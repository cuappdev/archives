The conversation is long and ranges through many aspects of being an artist in today\u2019s comic book industry. We\u2019ll talk about the origins and breaking in stories, as well as the highs and lows of the industry. We talk about some of the challenges a comic book artist faces, and how writer and artist collaborate.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of information to be gained, learning from people who\u2019ve been there, and are still working at climbing their ladder, whatever that ladder may be. If you have any interest in making comics, either as an artist, writer, or whatever, this is an invaluable conversation.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ifanboyPOW/~4/RSCbVUx2HCc\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "01:39:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/f6/b3/ff/f6b3ff02-8bbc-fce8-fd30-0e92d5bc8e80/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/f6/b3/ff/f6b3ff02-8bbc-fce8-fd30-0e92d5bc8e80/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ifanboyPOW/~5/_r5NhejzIn8/iFanboy_podcast210a.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["comics", "comic books", "graphic novels", "kevin mellon", "blair butler", "heart", "mma", "image comics", "declan shalvey", "marvel comics", "dc comics", "vertigo", "northlanders", "josh flanagan", "graphicly", "dixon's notch", "ifanboy"]}, {"seriesId": 90983408, "seriesTitle": "iFanboy.com Comic Book Podcast", "pubDate": 1321206253, "title": "iFanboy.com Pick of the Week #310 - Uncanny X-Force #17", "author": "ifanboy.com", "summary": "November  13, 2011 \u2013 Do you think John Byrne is pure and clean?
