There are so many different markets, sub-markets, product types and deal structures to choose from.\u00a0 Beyond that, there are variations in economic conditions, seller motivations, tax laws, interest rates and on and on and on.\u00a0 The types of returns which can be attained in a real estate investment range from bankruptcy (on the VERY negative side) to infinite returns (profit on nothing invested). We like the latter better, don't you?Recognizing that real estate investing is \u201cnon-traditional\u201d when compared to the conventional approach of \"work hard, pay taxes, live below your means and buy stocks, bond and mutual funds for the long haul\" - we talk about the ranges of returns which are reasonable to expect when investing in certain kinds of real estate.\u00a0 We also talk about how certain deal structures can really improve your ROI.Another topic of discussion is the risks of investing versus those of NOT investing.\u00a0 There is an adage which says that the more risk you take, the more return you should demand.\u00a0 We agree with that one. Of course, it presupposes that you understand the risks and can factor them into your decisions.There is another adage which says that higher returns mean more risk.\u00a0 NOT NECESSARILY!\u00a0 There are actually deal structures which REDUCE risk while INCREASING return.\u00a0 So of course, we talk about those things because they are among our favorite benefits of real estate investing!After this broadcast, we slipped off our leotards (sorry, bad visual) and headed for the showers (worse visual!), pleased with our performance.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re waiting for the judges (that\u2019s you) to put our scores.\u00a0 We only ask that not take into consideration what we look like in our leotards.\u00a0 And, that you remember to take us to the gym because, as you probably already know after the leotard visual, we REALLY need the workout!Want more?\u00a0 Sign up for The Real Estate Guys\u2122 free newsletter at http://realestateguysradio.com/newsletter-sig", "duration": "52:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/aa/5a/62/aa5a62b0-25ca-3228-d671-f64975dd341f/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/aa/5a/62/aa5a62b0-25ca-3228-d671-f64975dd341f/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/clean/realestateguysradio/Determining_ROI_-_Balancing_Risk_and_Reward.mp3?dest-id=14021", "type": "episode", "tags": ["real", "training", "money", "rich", "investing", "wealth", "finance", "dad", "estate", "retirement", "personal", "coaching"]}, {"seriesId": 194167775, "seriesTitle": "The Real Estate Guys Radio Show - Real Estate Investing Education for Effective Action", "pubDate": 1275847200, "title": "Happy Housing Headlines - Real or Not Real?", "author": "info@realestateguysradio.com (The Real Estate Guys)", "summary": "Lots of good real estate news lately!\u00a0 Does that mean real estate is back?\u00a0 Inquiring minds want to know!\u00a0 So we decide to dig deeper into the headlines to see what we can find out.
