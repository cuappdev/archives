Which is a pretty ordinary way to meet somebody unless you live in Hollywood, where people don't seem terribly likely to strike up a conversation for no reason. I mentioned that I do a podcast and that he might be a good guest. He seemed interested, but then I mentioned the interview idea to my good friend Justin Maruco (who you might remember from the Jake Seeley podcast) and he told me that not only would he make sure that it happened but that he had a grip of good questions in mind. Jacob ended up bringing his close friend and amazing skateboarder, Oscar Meza with him and we picked their brains, gleaning some much needed insight into both of their careers as well as the skateboard world in general.

To others, it is an inescapable Los Angeles brand with a penchant for pop culture logo bites. I became friends with the guys behind the brand 6 months or so ago and knew that if I could get them on the show that it would make for an explosive interview. I was not wrong.

I've known that I wanted to eventually start a second podcast where I could interview all of the interesting people I know outside of BMX. So today I'm happy to present the first episode of No Jumper in which I interview Ryan Denehey. You may not know who Ryan is (unless you remember late 2000's action sports website \"BNQT\") but he's an unbelievably successful young entrepreneur who has started and sold a couple of different businesses to some high profile firms, namely Gannett and Groupon. Hopefully some of you reading this will take some inspiration and use it to start something.\n\nIf you enjoyed this interview, follow No Jumper on Soundcloud, iTunes and Twitter to keep up on future episodes.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/nojumper-1\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/nojumperdotcom\n\n00:30 Ryan tells us his story of starting out making videos in the bike world\n06:00 We talk about dealing with rejection and failure as an entrepreneur and how to fight through it\n10:15 \"If you're not completely embarrassed by your first attempt at whatever it is you're trying to do, you're not trying hard enough\"\n15:03 We talk about working for free and when you should be willing to take on an unpaid internship \n19:25 Are you a person with a lack of regard for tradition and is that a key trait for entrepreneurs?\n27:30 Let's talk about BNQT, what the original idea and how did it almost fail?\n38:00 How BNQT became The Come Up's first ad network back in the day\n40:20 Why did you end up selling BNQT to USA Today?\n46:25 \"Oftentimes when people have their first big success, they stop doing what made them successful in the first place\"\n50:22 Let's talk about your most recent start up, Swarm\n53:30 \"Very few people actually want to give up trivial things to go after much bigger dreams\"\n55:25 How Nas became an investor in Swarm\n59:25 How did you feel when you realized Groupon were making an offer to buy you?\n1:04:40 We talk about what our days are like and how we manage to be productive\n1:10:50 Do you still feel like you have companies you're going to start up in the future?\n1:12:50 We talk about Ryan's blog and his new book he's working on\n\nCheck out Ryan's blog here: http://www.deneheyxxl.com\n\nand follow him on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/denehyxxl", "duration": "01:17:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/79/0e/79/790e7902-8795-644d-bc4d-d6e9eff6f173/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/79/0e/79/790e7902-8795-644d-bc4d-d6e9eff6f173/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/208371981-nojumper-the-ryan-denehey-interview.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}]}
