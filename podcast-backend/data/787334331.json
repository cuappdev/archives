But ...</p> <p>Have you seen how smug and self-satisfied these inventors are after they give their\u00a0<em>pitch</em>. They are even shocked when the investors give negative feedback.</p> <p>The crude, rude and brutal feedback is what we all enjoy seeing, it's the reason the show succeeds, and for psychological reasons I don't have time to explain, we love the feeling we get when we hear Mr Wonderful say,\u00a0<em>\"This is the suckiest suck that ever sucked!\"</em></p> <p>It's so important to understand, this is a TV show that entertains by having rich investors verbally destroy ideas like Man Candles, Pet Paint or Wired Waffles (all real products.)</p> <p>On a side note I just filed a lawsuit with a tenant of mine that hasn\u2019t paid his rent in two months---3 days later I got a letter in the mail from Judge Judy inviting me on the show\u2014im probably gonna do it because if I win ---I will the show will pay me instead of me trying to collect from my deadbeat tenant.</p> <p>Anyhow---lets get back to how actual buyers in our case people that want/need to list their homes.</p> <p><strong>In the real world, where we all actually live ... our listing prospects <em>do not rip you apart</em>.</strong></p> <p>They\u00a0<em>do not</em>\u00a0say funny and shocking things like ...</p> <p>- Don't call me, I'll call you.<br /> - I'm not trying to make friends, I'm trying to get my home sold for the most money..</p> <p><strong>I actually wish my prospects would say those things that way I would know exactly where I stand.</strong></p> <p>Unfortunately, when they lose interest, when they know for certain they will not buy my products or services, when they want to get out of the meeting, these are the things they will do:</p> <ol> <li>Smile, laugh and give encouragement</li> <li>Ask easy softball questions</li> <li>Being overly interested in the tiniest product details</li> <li>Giving you positive feedback and helpful advice during the presentation</li> </ol> <p>Wait a second-----Aren't these things people do when they are interested?</p> <p>Doesn't engagement, questions and positive feedback show\u00a0<em>buying intent?</em></p> <p>Not in Enterprise Sales. Not in Venture Capital. Not in Private Equity. Not in the Fortune 1000 and most of the time not in the living\u00a0 room of that million dollar listing</p> <p>If you're out asking to list someones biggest asset, \u00a0these typically are NOT good signs. In a weird twist, it's exactly the opposite: these are all signs that you have lost your audience.</p> <p><strong>What should be happening?</strong><br /> 1. Instead of laughing and quipping jokes they should be leaning forward and looking concentrated (focused on all the new & interesting things you are introducing.)</p> <ol start=\"2\"> <li>Instead of asking questions on irrelevant facts or sidebar topics, they should be taking notes on the presentation -----this happens to me in every presentation.</li> <li>Instead of giving you advice they should be<em>asking</em>for your advice.</li> <li>And if they really aren't understanding your key ideas, they should be giving you direct and brutal feedback that the meeting is off-track.</li> </ol> <p>Getting direct, somewhat rude and even brutal feedback can be great, because you know where you are in the sale. Of course it's not a positive sign, but now you can adjust quickly.</p> <p>So, Is there anything you can do if your audience is just feigning interest?</p> <p><strong>What to Do:</strong></p> <ol> <li>When they are smiling, joking, laughing: I will laugh along for a bit and then get extremely serious. Say \u201cit\u2019s all fun and games until you blow 50K and 6 months before you realize your marketing isn\u2019t working\u201d</li> <li>Don\u2019t give long-drawn-out answers to basic softball questions. Answer simple, no-brainer questions with ever shorter statements. Shrug those off. \u201cThat's always a good topic, but we have limited time here so let\u2019s focus on the big stuff\u2026\u201d</li> <li>Don\u2019t let them give you advice. Cut that conversation thread off immediately. You're the expert, you know this product better than anyone, and you're here to make a sale or close a deal. Today, you're not looking for a mentor, you're looking for a buyer.

He continuously faced the frustration and pain of not being able to pay his bills while he watched others succeed. This combined with the fact that his marketing was costing him far more than he was making was enough to make him consider quitting in the early days.</p> <p>Craig admits that he made the same mistake that 99% of all beginners make. He simply looked around at what everyone else was doing and did the exact same thing. Since all his ads looked exactly the same it was impossible to even get the attention, let alone business of potential clients in the cutthroat real estate market. Its a blueprint for financial disaster and unfortunately this is all too common, and why most marketing is such a huge waste of money.</p> <p>Here are 4 bullet points to consider when building an attraction business</p> <p>\u00a01 - The One Reason The only reason to advertise is to have prospects call you. Anything else is a waste and should not be attempted. Let's be clear: no one really cares about you or your image.</p> <p>2 - Replace Image Ads With USP Ads The second breakthrough is to instantly replace all image ads with highly effective Direct Response style ads where the only objective is to get the potential customer to contact us. We create the desire to contact us by implementing a Unique Selling Proposition within the ads. This quickly sets us apart from every other provider in the market.</p> <p>3 - Offer The Prospects A \"Lead Magnet\" They Actually Want What a revelation! At least in was in the Real Estate Business. Part of creating a compelling USP is to give the prospects exactly what they are looking for. In Real Estate for example most prospects are not looking for an agent, they are looking for a nice home. So instead of running ads that highlight services, you simply ran ads that highlight the emotional benefit that prospects were looking for. In the case: \"Lovely homes, quiet street, great neighborhood.\"</p> <p>4 - Advertise What The Prospects Want You may start to notice a pattern here; It's called \"WIIFM.\" Or What's In It For Me? Many small business owners make the mistake of advertising what they sell: the product or service. The secret to getting predictable high-response rates from your ads is to connect with the prospects emotional \"hot-buttons.\" What does your prospect desire and dream about?

If you are looking to grow your business with a limited budget; there is no better place to look than Linkedin. I recently sat down with Josh Turner, a best-selling author of \u201cconnect\u201d teaches people how to hack Linkedin.</p>\n<p>This episode is more of training than just a straight interview. To give you some context--- businesses can broadly be classified as a prospecting or marketing based business. Let me illustrate; Stockbrokers are prospecting based and your local dentist is marketing based. Stockbrokers are the kings of cold calling making 100 to 300 calls a day looking for leads while your local corner dentist simply hangs out his shingle. Whether your business is marketing based or prospecting based you still have the same end goal: Make a sale. The difference is how you get there. Marketing businesses ATTRACT buyers while, prospecting businesses CHASE buyers.</p>\n<p>By using proven Linkedin strategies you can build your list, grow an audience and build credibility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For listing leads the best thing we have seen in the market is radio.\u00a0 Go to <a href=\"http://www.realestateradioexperts.com\">www.realestateradioexperts.com</a> and check out some of our videos.\u00a0 If you think your ready to level up --fill out the getting started sheet and we can chat.</p>", "duration": "53:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/5e/8b/89/5e8b892f-34f4-ef1b-3cc5-76f0f2dd094e/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/5e/8b/89/5e8b892f-34f4-ef1b-3cc5-76f0f2dd094e/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/superagentslive/211GenerateListingLeadsOnLinkedin.mp3?dest-id=155112", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 787334331, "seriesTitle": "Selling!!
