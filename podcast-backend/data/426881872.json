Last year I got to have him as a guest on Tom Rhodes Radio when he released 'Return To Zooathalon.'</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">We recorded the conversation over Skype and I found him to be just as witty and charming as his writings that can be found at <a href=\"http://sananda.org/\"><span style=\"color: #4787ff;\">Sananda.org</span></a> so it was my mission this year to meet him face to face and record another episode.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">We recorded this in his state of the art recording studio where he records all of his music and plays every instrument on those recordings.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It felt like going to Willie Wonka's chocolate factory and getting a personal audience with Willie Wonka himself. His kind eyes and easy humor instantly evaporated my hero worship and made me feel as if I had been friends with the man for years. It is impressive when you meet people who are solid examples of how to conduct business professionally. Not only was everything set up for us to record when I got there but a photographer was there to capture our togetherness but also a film crew recorded a multi camera shoot of it as well that can be viewed at <a href=\"http://youtube.com/SanandaMaitreya\"><span style=\"color: #4787ff;\">youtube.com/SanandaMaitreya</span></a> .\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This conversation was just the tip of the iceberg on the glorious day Ashna and I had with Sananda Maitreya and his glorious family. After this recorded he invited us over to his house for lunch where his wife cooked us a wonderful meal and we got to meet his two sons Elvis and Mingus. If seeing those two perfect joyful children doesn't make Ashna's ovaries start to knock then nothing will. Sananda invited me into his library complete with grand piano where we continued to talk endlessly about everything.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Seeing the titles of his books indicates what a lofty intelligent thinker this man is. Goethe, Balzac, Celine and other philosophers of heights I have yet to comprehend. By the time our evening together ended I felt like I was his blood brother and that I was saying goodbye to a relative. They say that you should never meet your heroes but in this case Sananda is the exception to that rule.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It was worth every Euro cent that it cost to get there and have this personal experience with a man that I have admired and appreciated for many years.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Sananda Maitreya!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Intro song: Cutting Room (Hot Pants) \u2013 Oceanliners</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; padding-left: 30px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';\">Song 1: </span>It's Yours</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; padding-left: 30px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';\">Song 2: </span>If I Fell</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; padding-left: 30px;\"><em>End song: <span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\">Siamo Qui\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Recorded in Milan, Italy \u2013 October 31, 2014</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Official website www.Sananda.org\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; padding-left: 30px;\"><em>There will be a video interview be available at www.youtube.com/SanandaMaitreya\u00a0 + the release of THE RISE OF THE ZUGEBRIAN TIME LORDS chapter 5 at www.Sananda.org/newmusic</em></p>", "duration": "01:12:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Sananda_Maitreya_LAST_EDIT.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1416845487, "title": "Kevin Meaney", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Kevin Meaney is one of my favorites because I will never forget watching him on television with my Dad and he made us both laugh out loud together.

I liked him when we met so I have been cheering him on through the ensuing years when I saw him on countless British panel chat shows.

The Amazing Johnathan has a heart ailment and his doctors have told him that if his medicine doesn't work he only has one year to live.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Imagine what you would do if you were told you only had one year to live.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">After years of touring relentlessly he wants to stay at home, maybe buy a new big screen TV, maybe do heroin, maybe a demolition derby in his back yard?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I drove into his swank neighborhood, gated community with plush lawns and green trees in Las Vegas. Rich people can make it green anywhere. His house is a large sparkling palace with classic cars parked all over the front yard and back.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The 17 year old boy in me can't help but smile to see sitting in his drive way a 1967 midnight blue convertible GTO. His tasteful home has been modified to his specifications and every painting in his house has a trick or joke function hidden that can spring forth at his command. His opulent home is exactly the way you would dream Amazing Johnathan's house would be or a mad scientist with a wicked sense of humor. I'm impressed to see the life that he made for himself and I'm proud of him for being one of the few comedians who was smart with his money.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He earned it! Going from comedy club headliner to doing countless television appearances he opened up The Amazing Johnathan Theater in Las Vegas and his ominous presence could be felt advertised everywhere in the city during his decades run. I would credit Amazing Johnathan with being right at that turning point in Las Vegas history where it went from being a sad joke to the cool upgraded spot it is today. George Carlin was a fan of his and once left him a long complimentary message on his answering machine. He listens to it when he gets depressed he tells me. He attributes everything he has to drugs. He tells me the best and worst times he had on drugs. He is open with me and honest about his lunatic partying days. He tells me that dying is a lazy way to get compliments.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I met the Amazing Johnathan doing comedy festival and television tapings and we have been friends from sharing those experiences. Our mad men party periods never met and I only knew him in a professional way that I respected. His comedy for lack of a better description I would call rock & roll comedy magician but whatever you would call it the man always hit the stage like a hurricane with jokes coming at you from everywhere. For me personally the reason I love the Amazing Johnathan is because when I was a young comedian watching every stand up comedy show on television while dreaming of getting there myself that is when I saw him for the first time. Destroying the audience on television and me at home.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He was unlike all the other stiff, cookie cutter style comedians, he had his own style and his magic tricks involved fake blood and his eye popping out. Crazy shit! I loved him for his wildness and I respected him before I ever even met him.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Hamlet holds the skull of a comedian and he laments the fact that such a magic human who had made him laugh so hard is no longer of this earth. I ain't Hamlet and I ain't waiting until the man is dead to say how much I appreciate him. This tribute episode is not meant to be sad, it is meant to be alive and celebratory. For this reason I end the episode with a song I love instead of some sad sappy shit. The man left his mark on American entertainment and world wide comedy. I'm grateful that I know him and that he invited me over to his house to have this conversation with him.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Amazing Johnathan!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i>Intro song: Cutting Room (Hot Pants) \u2013 Oceanliners</i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i>End song: The Shouting Matches \u2013 Gallup, NM</i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i></i><i>Recorded at Johnathan\u2019s house in Las Vegas, September 2014</i></p>\n<div><i><br /></i></div>", "duration": "01:29:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Amazing_Johnathan.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1413565464, "title": "Eddie Pepitone", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Eddie Pepitone is the darling of the underground comedy scene of Los Angeles.

He is the angry heckler in the crowd in the crowd who makes perfect sense. He comes from an emotional place as a comedian, he attacks the stage with how he feels.

In this conversation Eddie and I talk about how you stay aware of what is happening in the world while remaining sane.

Acting roles continue to role in because he is such a unique funny character who brings his soul and experience to every project he takes part in. A veteran of two Edinburgh Fringe festivals, who I caught up with in Los Angeles just a few weeks after this year's festival. The show he performed this year was entitled 'Rest In Peace America' in which he celebrates the downfall of America and gives him a vent to steam about life in America today.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He loves the modern comfort's of today's technology but thinks it is an exercise in futility with us amusing ourselves to death.

I had so many deep conversations with him over the last 2 weeks of the festival and I liked his show much I thought it an imperative that he be a guest on my show.\u00a0 After our Edinburgh run we both went to London, me to do my show at the Soho theater and Mark to do his at the St. James theater.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">My wife Ashna and I went to see his show again in London and then we invited Mark over to have a few bottles of wine and record this conversation in our rented flat.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">His show at the St. James theater was brilliant with the verve and excitement of live performance that Mark brought to his character and since it was in the evening with alcoholic beverages flowing each of the excellently written lines of dialogue hit their targets making the room explode with laughter. Mark told me he loved the message of Quentin Crisp because it wasn't about being gay it was about being yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In this conversation we talk about the harshness of criticism, the meaning of life and the most interesting people who ever lived. \"Writing 87,000 reviews would never feel as good as giving one performance.\" In today's narcissistic society no one knows who they are and what to believe in. Quentin Crisp's life told by Mark Farrelly is one to gain inspiration from and peppered with Quentin's sharp quotes on life we are reminded of why Quentin Crisp is worth remembering.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\"We live in a pretty dreary world were most people don't even have the decency to be themselves.\" In this episode you will learn why it is our excessive freedom is what makes us miserable and why having personal style will cure you of your excessive freedom.

Back then you could see that he was destined to do great things as a comedian and it is enjoyable to me, someone who is cheering him on, to see the development he has had and where he is as a performer today.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This being his 4th Edinburgh Fringe festival he has more experience than me in some areas. I love him as a friend, a comedian and as someone I always easily have great conversations with. In this conversation we talk about the power of the pink dollar, how in Edinburgh people value stories above all else, the unnerving feeling of performing when children are in the audience, his hand made bow ties, his fondness for Argentinians and lamas.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He is the Priscilla Queen of the desert of stand up comedy. He was born to be in show business and his side comments to himself are gems of performers inside jokes that anyone would laugh at feeling a part of the club. His Australian accent, personal style and self referencing humor subliminally encourages everyone to embrace their uniqueness and fabulousness just by sheer example of his being. He has many brilliant years ahead of him as a performer and I am one of his fans and friend that will be cheering him on all the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Rhys Nicholson!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i>Intro song: Cutting Room (Hot Pants) \u2013 Oceanliners</i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i>Stand-up clip from YouTube: Rhys Nicholson - ABC2 Comedy Up Late 2014 (E7)</i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i>End song: Jim White\u2013 Hey!

I have worked with her many times through the years and I respect her not only because she has always been kind to me but because she is funny and has a certain authoritative way of carrying herself onstage.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I've always said that when a comedian steps onstage everyone else in the room should lose rank and title and that comedian should become the sheriff of the room while they have the microphone in their hand. That is one thing about Jo's style that has always impressed me, while she is onstage she is the sheriff of the room.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In recent years more women and ethnically diverse personalities have taken to comedy stages but going way back to when I first met here up until the present Jo has been someone, a female someone who has been slugging it out in a male dominated profession and busting heads in the comedy world. This business is an unforgiving one where only the strong survive and just the fact that she has remained at the top of the UK comedy performing world for so long is testament enough of her quality and a badge of honor not many people can claim to have achieved.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">She is a respected veteran with many television appearances and Edinburgh Fringe festivals under her belt.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In this conversation we cover many topics from her personal history to the British Empire's opium wars with China but perhaps the most valuable thing you will learn from her in this episode is the proper way to make English tea.

I could go for years without seeing Margaret but when we do it is like we never lost a minute together. I have been communicating with her for the past few years about trying to record an episode of this podcast with her but our schedules have not allowed us to make that happen. A few weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I asked Margaret if she would be in town and she said that she was going to go San Francisco for Comedy Day in Golden Gate park because this year it was dedicated to Robin Williams.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Because of Margaret I bought a last minute plane ticket to fly up for it.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Comedy Day is a yearly free comedy concert in the park every year that the city of San Francisco puts on. I had not been to one since the late 1990s and neither had Margaret. It was so much fun to see so many old friends from the San Francisco comedy scene of the 1990s. Deservedly so Margaret is an adored icon and watching her being appreciated makes my heart happy. She is the perfect San Francisco comedian, raised in the city by book store owning parents, an intelligent, funny Asian woman who represents and defends the gay and lesbian community. Margaret has been busting heads in the comedy world for many years and not many comedians ever attain the universal love and appeal that she has.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This conversation was recorded the day after Comedy Day in Margaret's Union Square hotel room. We had enjoyed comedy Day immensely laughing our heads off together, my favorite moment was having Margaret sit right up front under the stage and scream her head off laughing at me. I also learned that she was very close to Joan Rivers and that she is still very tore up over her recent death.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Margaret and I also were both given our our sitcoms around the same time and they both only lasted for one season. My reaction to my sitcom ending was to plunge myself into drugs and alcohol but Margaret wrote a brilliant one person show called 'I'm the one that I want'. Seeing that show in New York City gave me great inspiration at that time when I needed it. Margaret's career has been so successful because she continuously works her ass off. In this conversation we talk about our sitcom experiences and the mountain of pressure you have on you when you are the star of your own network television show.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Margaret Cho has championed countless civil rights causes and has supreme knowledge on many different topics, especially stand up comedy. In this conversation Margaret tells me about Joan Rivers' funeral and the best laugh she had with Joan. We also talk about Korea and the Korean pop culture domination of the planet. I've been to Korea twice in the past 2 years and I'm excited for Margaret to go there just because it will produce another brilliant special for her. We talk about our immigrant mother's and Margaret tells me about her quest to learn the Korean language. She teaches me about the highlights of Korean cinema. The trilogy of movies 'Old Boy', 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">She we had this talk I watched 'Old Boy' and I highly recommend this mind-blowing movie. Since the day I met her, Margaret has turned me on to cool things. She tells me about the Rue De Temple, the best place to shop in Paris. She gives me the best world wide travel tips she has learned and I tell her the importance of a successful comedian having nice luggage.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode happened because Margaret suggested that I come up to San Francisco at the last minute. After the joy of having this conversation we went to the panhandle and got stoned before she took me to a guitar store on Haight street. After the guitar store we ate fat gorgeous San Francisco burritos and then Margaret called me an Uber that took me to the airport. It was a perfect 24 hours in San Francisco and this episode is the result of this.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">She is the Joan of Arc Samurai warrior of comedy and it is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Margaret Cho!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i>Intro song: Cutting Room (Hot Pants) \u2013 Oceanliners</i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i>End song: Teenage Fanclub & Jad Fair - Crush on You</i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><i></i><i>San Francisco, September 2014</i></p>", "duration": "01:14:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Margaret_Cho.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1410972060, "title": "Aisha Tyler", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">This episode was recorded in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">Aisha Tyler is an iconic woman who has conquered the stages of stand up comedy, the world of network television and the New York Times bestsellers list of book authors.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">I met Aisha Tyler in the 1990s in the golden age San Francisco comedy.

She has produced countless shows for the festival for over 30 years and it the operator of the Gilded Balloon, one of the cornerstone venues of the entire Fringe.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It was important for me to do my Edinburgh debut with Karen at the Gilded Balloon because of a disaster I had experienced at the old Gilded Balloon (which has since burned to the ground) at the perennial late night show Late n\u2019 Live many years ago when I was visiting the festival in August 2000.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">That disaster and the notorious viciousness of Late n\u2019 Live hecklers are discussed in the episode. Not only did I shatter that memory for myself I created the best possible new one from getting to perform my hour show every night at 9:15pm at the Gilded Balloon and be under the loving umbrella of Karen Koren.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">At the Loft bar of the Gilded Balloon where this conversation was recorded is the private bar for the performers of this venue who I bonded with, saw the shows of and hung out with until the wee hours of the morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Karen has created such a welcoming atmosphere at this excellently run venue. Not Only does she bring in the best quality performers but the people who ran her venue I had met at Comedy festival in Australia, New Zealand, England, Ireland, Canada and France. Even her staff are of the highest quality in live festival comedy entertainment.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I enjoyed talking with Karen Koren every night, not just because she has the most dreamy hypnotic accent but also because of her gorgeous laugh. She helped to launch the careers of Alan Cumming, Eddie Izzard, Russell Brand, Tim Mincheon and Tom Rhodes.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I can\u2019t say enough good things about this woman, she\u2019s classy, she\u2019s funny and she is wealth of comedy knowledge and history concerning British comedy and the Edinburgh Fringe festival.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">She doesn\u2019t bullshit anyone, she doesn\u2019t beat around the bush and she has a strong opinion about the lack of substance from most American stand up she has seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Looking back on my memory of doing the festival this year I think of Karen and the lively and funny conversations we had together most every night. At times it felt like I had a mother figure looking out for me and I grew in her warm loving embrace. The people who book other world wide festivals when they spoke with Karen she insisted they should book me or be missing out on one of the best comedians in the world. She was constantly telling people to go see my show and raving about how funny I am. It would plaster the hugest smile across my face her every endorsement. Because of the incredible experience I just had in Edinburgh August 2014 and all of the friends I made there I am inspired to write my ass off to come up with a new hour of material.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I won\u2019t go back too early with some watery shit, only hard hitting head cruncher jokes and stories because I would never want to disappoint Karen Koren by being any less than funnier than anyone else. I\u2019m proud the hear in this conversation that her favorite part of my show was the real life stories where I wore my heart on my sleeve. She is the kind of person that if she likes you, you think \u201cWell if Karen Koren thinks I\u2019m great I must be pretty damn good.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">At this moment when I post this episode it one of the most important weeks in the history of Scotland because they get to vote whether or not they want to be an independent country or to stay joint with England. Either way, in England they like to yell \u201cLong live the Queen! God save the Queen!\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I just want it to be known that wherever I go in the world I will yell \u201cLong live Karen Koren!

He is reputed to be an honest fair man in a business where sticking it to a comedian by undercutting his cash is often one of the occupational hazards. Comedians speak of him with respect and his employees show their loyalty by working for him for years. I was happy to meet Tommy and make friends with him this past month while I was doing the Fringe Festival.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Before going into the comedy world by opening his room in the 1990s he was a full time organizer with the British Labor party. After the Labor party decided to go in another direction ideologically he left politics and with his redundancy payment he put a down payment on The Stand comedy club.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This moment in human history is very exciting because next week Scotland has the vote to decide if they want to be an independent country away from the United Kingdom.

I love her style, her energy, her pacing and her material. Often when you are seeing multiple shows in a day at the Fringe festival you will look at your watch during a performance and I'm happy to report I did not look at my watch once while Zoe was performing her show Mustard Cutter. I simply got lost in my enjoyment of her show.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Her and I have in common that she also has a Dutch wife and her insights on being married to a Dutch person made me howl with laughter. Her facial expressions as well as her way of expressing how she feels about the life that she is living is of the essence of what comedy is about.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I will now bestow the greatest compliment I could give any performer by saying that Zoe Lyons contains the original energy of joy.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Like all comedians, I'm sure she has experienced a bumpy road but her attitude towards life and performing comedy is what attracted me to her soul as I sat among the audience watching her perform and why I wanted to highlight her on my podcast.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">She lives in the artistic hub of Brighton and is a respected veteran of the UK comedy scene, she is one of the people I enjoyed hanging out with the most at the festival after parties and it must be said that I think she has the most glorious gap between her two front teeth.

Her Edinburgh show of 2014 was one of my favorite shows that I saw this year and her stand up comedy is consistently solid powerful laughs every time I see her perform.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #dddcd2; color: #414141; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 18px;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Hannah Gadsby!</p>\n<address style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #dddcd2; color: #414141; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 18px;\"><i style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\">Intro song: Cutting Room (Hot Pants) \u2013 Oceanliners</i></address><address style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #dddcd2; color: #414141; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 18px;\"><i style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\">Audio Cameo: Jasper Rijkeboer from Delft, The Netherlands</i></address><address style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #dddcd2; color: #414141; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 18px;\"><i style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\">Stand-up clip from YouTube 1:\u00a0Melbourne Comedy Festival All Stars supershow 2014 Hannah gadsby</i></address><address style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #dddcd2; color: #414141; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 18px;\"><i style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\">Stand-up clip from YouTube 2: Hannah Gadsby \u2013 Melbourne Comedy Festival 2012</i></address><address style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #dddcd2; color: #414141; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 18px;\"><i style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\">End song:\u00a0Slip of The Tongue \u2013 Mary Gautier\u00a0</i></address><address style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #dddcd2; color: #414141; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 18px;\"><i style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\">Recorded at Hannah\u2019s Edinburgh Festival apartment , Edinburgh August 2014</i></address>", "duration": "01:21:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Hannah_Gadsby.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1408558441, "title": "Lucie Pohl", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\"><strong style=\"color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;\">Lucie Pohl</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\"><b style=\"color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</b><b style=\"color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;\">\u00a0\u00a0</b><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Tom Rhodes Radio\u00a0</b>Review<b style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\u00a0</b>for\u00a0<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Lucie Pohl</strong></span><span style=\"color: #424242;\">\u00a0in\u00a0</span><b style=\"color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;\">\u2018Hi, Hitler!\u2019</b></p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">Tom Rhodes Radio give the show 'Hi, Hitler' by Lucie Pohl a 5 star review!

Lucie Pohl can! She even drew Hitler innumerable times as a kid and wanted to go as Hitler for carnival but that kind of action is illegal in Germany where she was born. Her show is the story of her life and it is greatly influenced by the New York style of one person shows that I hold sacred like Eric Bogosian's Sex Drugs & Rock & Roll and John Leguizamo's Freak. Expertly performed Lucie Pohl keeps you captivated as her story pops from one scene of her life to another.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">As a child loving David Hasselhoff in her native Germany, her successful father moving her family to New York City, having artistic parents with dramatic lives living in Greenwich Village, her moving back to Germany to pursue her dream of acting, getting her knees skinned up from a bad romantic choice to finding love on a beach in Greece on the island of Rhodes. With magnanimous charm she plays all of the characters in her life and the journey she has experienced up to this point.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">Her show is so enjoyable you can't help but think why isn't this woman a superstar actor by now but we should be grateful because superstar actors never give us brilliant one person performances like this rooted in the very fabric that makes theater great and greatly inspiring.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">Lucie Pohl's show is also on at the Gilded Ballon like mine and I met her very early in the run hanging out in the performer's Loft Bar.

It was at Josie's that I first saw Scott Capurro perform. He stood out among all the other comedians that night because he made my sides hurt with laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It was only a few years later Scott would be the first openly gay comedian to bust through the barriers of the regular club scene there. He was like the gay Jackie Robinson busting down the door for all the other gay comedians who would eventually be able to work the regular rooms.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Scott's comedy has always been dark, twisted and controversial just the way I like it. I once had an interviewer ask me of those years in the 1990s when I lived in San Francisco \"Did you know you were a part of history when it was happening?\" The answer is \"No.\" I just was enjoying my friends killing audiences and getting inspired by them to lift my game higher by always bringing my best.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">For many years Scott has lived in London and is a veteran taking part in his 17th Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He has stirred up controversy and created many firestorms from crafting his thoughts into jokes at this festival.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">We talk about his years of doing Edinburgh Fringe, his life in London and the tragic passing this week of Robin Williams, who Scott costarred with in the movie Mrs. Doubtfire.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Just recently has Scott reappeared in my life and I have to say that I have missed him. He is never lazy in creating his material for the stage and never one to back down from bringing out thoughts that upset more conservative tastes in the audience.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">To me he is more than just a gay comedy icon, he is a friend who I respect greatly and a performer I love to watch crushing the bugs of prudishness.

There are literally thousands of shows happening here on all manner of topics but the one thing that all of them share is that they each belong to the family of storytellers. I have been racing around the city as much as possible taking in as many different shows as I can and one of the shows I have loved most and that knocked me out is 'Circumcise me' written and performed by Yisrael Campbell.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is the story of his life and how he went from growing up Catholic in suburban Philadelphia to being an orthodox Jew living in Jerusalem. As is pure in every hero's story it was a bumpy ride to reaching the top of his spiritual journey. Yisrael is a reformed alcoholic, philosophical sage and stand up comedian with clear eyes discerning the continual crisis Israel faces and how best to deal with tragedy when it strikes your life.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I first encountered the bright light of his personality after my first show of the festival run that he attended. I enjoyed his show 'Circumcise me' so much that I went to it twice. I laughed, I cried and stood on my feet clapping wildly when it finished. His story is epic how he became the person that he is today and I would much rather watch a film about his life instead of another dull super hero sequel.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Until then we have his show and this conversation about his life's journey.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">At the Edinburgh Fringe Festival review's are very important so let it be known that Tom Rhodes Radio gives 'Circumcise Me' 5 stars! 5 Bravos! and 5 Hallelujahs!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">(5 stars are the best you can get on an Edinburgh review) If you are in or anywhere near Edinburgh during his run I highly recommend you put this show on the top of your list of must see shows.

She just needs a few more years of experience and developing material. Her love of comedy is pure and she is from the most unlikely breeding ground for comedians of Hanoi, Vietnam.

I love my Dad and the topic of Vietnam was very dear to our family.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1994 I was one of the first Americans to go to Vietnam after the travel ban was lifted and I filmed an hour special for Comedy Central there called 'Viva Vietnam!\" Since filming there I have always wanted to return and since it had been 20 years since I had been there I set up a show there on my next tour of Asia. Filming 'Viva Vietnam!\" we went all over the country and Hanoi was my favorite place so for this visit I spent a whole relaxed week there.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dan Dockery who owns the House Of Son Tinh is a beautiful lunatic from England who drove me all over the city at night on his motorcycle in the rain. Of all the great things I did that week nothing was more fun than the show I did at the House Of Son Tinh and MinhHa Pham opened the show for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She is young, attractive and likable so I knew she would do well on the stage but I was honesty blown away at how smart and funny her jokes were. She graduated from the university of Minnesota and started doing stand up comedy at Gotham comedy club in New York City 2 years ago. Now she is back living in her hometown of Hanoi forging this new art form and expanding her horizons while more stage time in cities around Asia. If she is this funny after only doing it for 2 years then I easily predict that she will be as massive as she would chose to be. It is a mighty claim but nonetheless you will be pleased to know such a person as MinhHa Pham exists. I am grateful to her for giving me the reason to return to a place that I loved and was deeply meaningful to me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This conversation was recorded at the Hanoi Social Club just a few hours before our show that night. As much as I love my new expensive killer microphone I think it may have been too good because of all the chaos of noise happening outside of our open air window. The streets sounds of Hanoi, car horns, scooter horns, communist propaganda loud speaker announcements, there were moments while we were recording that the city burst out with a plethora of crazy noises. That is the charm of Hanoi and you can hear it in full effect on this recording. It was blazing hot, the windows had no glass and Coca Cola on ice never tasted better.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is my pleasure to take you all the way to Hanoi in this episode and introduce you to the one and only MinhHa Pham!</p>", "duration": "01:07:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Minha_Pham.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1403830888, "title": "Jason John Whitehead", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">This episode was recorded in Los Angeles.</span></p>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I first met Jason John Whitehead about ten years ago at The Comedy Store in Sydney.

He has been referred to as the Persian Elvis. He has appeared in countless film and television roles but my favorite incarnation of him is as a stand up comedian.</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I am a fan of his comedy because it contains the original energy of joy. His brand of comedy is not the slumped shoulders, down on your luck kind. His is a man in love with life and clearly enjoying himself onstage and that is what it is all about. In comedy, just like in real life it's all about having fun and enjoying yourself.</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I also admire Maz's work ethic. When I am in Los Angeles I always run into him around town doing sets and working on new material. This conversation was recorded in his home where I met his beautiful wife and amazing children. In every form of media these days the negative gets high lighted and too much time is spent glorifying bitter turds. The fact that he is the complete opposite of an unhappy human is why I love him so much.</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the bright ball of sunshine that is Maz Jobrani!\u00a0</div>", "duration": "01:28:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Maz_Jobrani_Final.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1397774436, "title": "Joseph Wilson", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in London.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I first met Joseph Wilson when I performed at the Comedy Cafe in London in 2013.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">We hit if off instantly and unbeknownst to me he became a avid listener of my podcast. I found out he was listening to my podcast 6 months later when he was on vacation in Peru and sent me a video he filmed at the top of Machu Pichu where he recreated and slightly mocked the opening of my podcast where I list all the fabulous places in the world I am going to take the listener. I thought the video was funny and I was very flattered he filmed it in my honor.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This year when I got to London I got to hang out with Joseph a lot and get to know him better and today consider him a good friend.

My guest today is Don Ward, the owner of the Comedy Store.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Since its opening in 1979 it has single handedly changed the British comedy scene from tired old pub comedians doing Mother in law jokes to the champions league of powerful original comedy that it is today. It is now an established institution of British comedy because every British comedy legend of the past 30 years has performed there. Don Ward is the visionary who made this work and who has witnessed the development and rise of these now household names, French & Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous), Eddie Izzard, Ben Elton, Jimmy Carr, Harry Hill and on and on.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The first time I ever did a set at the Comedy Store was in 1994. Then again in 1998 which led to me playing there regularly in 1999. In 2000 the Comedy Store started managing me for Europe while I lived in Amsterdam. You could say I had life by the balls back then and I was most certainly spoiled by being under the loving umbrella of the Comedy Store. Don Ward always treated me like a king and I always enjoyed speaking with him about comedy. I love and respect the man dearly. I love him like a relative in fact. Then I fucked up....</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I've been working on writing a book the past few years and I will go into more details there because in the story of my life Don Ward and the Comedy Store is an important chapter. The truth of the matter was that I was partying too much in London after shows and I frightened myself enough to decided to take a break on the place for a while when I moved back to the US in 2004.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I should have communicated with Don better about what was going on in my life. I owed him that. I owed him the respect her deserves so I wish I had been more honest with him. Needless to say feelings got hurt and it took me many years to mop up the mess that I had made.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I missed London and all my friends there so I just started going back a few years ago. One of my main reasons to go back was to set things right with Don Ward and apologize to him for me being such a schmuck. Last year when I was in London I went into Don's office and had the heart to heart talk with him. I told him since my Dad and my sister died I now see that the most important thing in life is the relationships you have with people. I told him how important he is to me, how I appreciated him treating me like a king and that I was ashamed and sorry over how I had disappeared on him. He could have rightfully told me to fuck off. Thankfully he welcomed me back to the Comedy Store and told me how that is all water under the bridge now.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode is very important to me because it was recorded between shows on Saturday February 22, 2014, the first weekend I have performed there in ten years. This episode is the end of a circle that took me ten years to get around to the other side of because of my mistake.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Never turn your back on the people who give you love and respect.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Don Ward is a living legend in the world of comedy because he has seen it all and presented the greatest comedians the world has every known. One day the British government will put a historical marker in front of the Comedy Store but until then we have the wealth of knowledge living in the museum of Don's mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode is very important to me because it is with someone I love and respect and that was crucial to my development as a world wide performer.

She was a fun and easy interviewer and I liked that she could roll with my answers injecting her wit into the conversation effortlessly. \u00a0She is the editor and primary journalist for art and culture happenings in Paris. I thought she would be an interesting guest because she knows everything that is happening for art and entertainment in Paris and also because she is usually the one answering the questions. I have stayed in touch with her in the past year and a half and I have enjoyed seeing the clips she has posted of her interviews with artists, musicians and movie stars that have graced her studio. Her journalistic path that led to her current reign at France 24 is an interesting tale and once a year she gets to hit the red carpet to interview all of the film industry people in attendance at the Cannes film festival.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I owe a great deal of respect and gratitude to Eve because of a huge blunder on my part that happened during this recording. She told me about how last year at Cannes she interviewed Woody Allen about his latest film 'Blue Jasmine' and when they got back to the editing studio they realized that her sound man had forgot to hit the record button. I thought to myself \"What a boob! Who could screw something up that was that important.\" Then after an hour of conversation my computer went black because it had run out of energy and the entire recording was lost. My computer said it had 18% left but it went black nonetheless and I was rightfully embarrassed and deflated.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The ever gracious Eve told me not to worry and come back later that night at 8pm to record it again. This is recording number 2 that we did later that night. It cost me 40 Euros each way from my hotel to her home 4 times, 160 Euros total. This is probably the most expensive episode I have ever created but it was worth every Euro cent because I think Eve is that interesting, fun and knowledgable.\u00a0 It is my secret desire to make some type of entertainment talk show with her to be broadcast from Paris to the rest of the English speaking world. Aside from being a magnanimous charismatic human being, she is the kind of generous soul who would give a boob like me a second chance to record with her after screwing up monumentally.

I didn't understand a word of the show but I was impressed to see an American speaking French and getting laughs. He is originally from New York with Argentinian parents. There are many reasons for me to love Sebastian Marx because he and I have so many things in common. Being American with a parental Argentinian connection, love of comedy, love of French culture, not afraid to live in Europe, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The upstairs room at the So Gymnase theatre is where I did my shows with Sebastian. It's an intimate cozy room with old couches and a low ceiling which is perfect for comedy. He regularly puts on his New York Comedy Nights show there. The audiences I experienced where multiethnic, multinational and of higher intellect. Also there were lots of French comedians hanging out and making the scene.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Comedy is a brotherhood in many ways because not many people know what it is like to face the fire, to get shit on your face if need be, with the quit respect of fighter pilots. Hanging out with comedians is one of my favorite things in life.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I like what Sebastian Marx is doing in Paris. There is a young hot eager scene there and if you are traveling to Paris and want to do some shows he is the man to know. It's a small room, not a big money maker but worth it in measure of fun and getting your performance orgasm. Sebastian is not only super lovable on stage he is the same sweet guy off the stage too. I had fun running around Paris with him in the communal electric cars of Paris. All over the city there are batches of small electric cars that can be picked up and dropped off using an iPhone app to set it all up. It's cheaper and easier than taking a taxi and being a French citizen he uses that electric car like a master. Enjoying Paris is always best when you experience it with a resident who knows how to get around.\u00a0Sebastian set up my Paris shows, promoted them and hosted them.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">On my show February 4, 2014 which happened to be my 30th anniversary he baked me a cake and has 30 candles on it that he brought out to me at the end of my show. The entire audience sang to me and it was a golden memory of an evening. I think he is funny, smart and lovable and it is my pleasure to present to you the one and only Sebastian Marx.</p>", "duration": "01:14:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Tom_Rhodes_Presents_Sebastian_Marx.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1393541760, "title": "Sand van Roy", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Paris.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I first met Sand Van Roy after my show in Paris in June 2012. Speaking with her I was tickled to find out that she was a huge comedy fan and that he all time favorite comedian is Mitch Hedberg. She was thrilled to hear that I was Mitch Hedberg's friend. She was trying a joke that she had written out on me and I told her that I liked it.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In this conversation recorded earlier this month in Paris I discover that it was that moment that inspired Sand to begin being a comedian one week after I met her. Because of Mitch Hedberg's influence on her she has a style of comedy that is exclusively one liners. What I consider to be the hardest form of comedy that requires a sharp mind and expert precision.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Sand is from Holland and now lives in Paris earning her living as a model. She is the first ever super model comedian that I am aware of. To focus on her good looks instead of her comedy is to sell her short in appreciating her outer shell instead of her brain power to invent sharply funny thoughts and observations. In this episode she tells me about the current comedy scene in Paris that happens in English and French.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded on February 4, 2014, my 30th anniversary of being a comedian. We recorded this just a few hours before my anniversary show which Sand opened up for me on. Aside from talking about comedy she gives me all the insight and juicy trash that goes on in the modeling world. I think she is smart, funny and destined for greatness in the world of comedy.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Sand Van Roy.</p>", "duration": "01:19:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Tom_Rhodes_Radio_Presents_Sand_van_Roy.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1392822420, "title": "Peter Klashorst", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Amsterdam.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I first met Peter Klashorst ten years ago when he appeared as a guest on my Amsterdam late night talk show. At the time I was told that he was famous for painting naked black women. Having a deep appreciation for dark skinned women I liked the man instantly. His journey as an artist has been epic with a world wide reach.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He lived in Senegal where he was arrested for running a brothel. He said he was only hiring women as models but the authorities wanted to hassle him. From there he moved to Kenya and his feelings about Africa and African people are dear to his heart and he still maintains an art studio there as well as in Amsterdam.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I got to hang out with Peter several times in Amsterdam and he is one of the few humans alive who earns his living solely from painting works of art. Every fiber of his being exudes the thoughts and actions of an artist and it was a joy to see him painting in his studio when I did. As a younger man I always loved Rembrandt and Van Gogh but this is a true living great artist and it is possible that Peter Klashorst is currently the greatest living Dutch artist.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He is now living in Cambodia working on one of the most heart felt acts of his career. For several years he has been painting the portraits of the victims of Pol Pot's genocide against his own people from the photos that were taken of them just before they were executed. Like most great artists Peter doesn't commit himself to anything unless his heart is fully in it and it seems that Cambodia has captured his heart and he will continue to do great work there. He is very open about fucking prostitutes and trouble he has received from living his life passionately as an artist.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This conversation was recorded 4 years ago late at night when Peter and I were drinking multiple beers. This is actually one of the first interviews I did for Tom Rhodes Radio. We talked and recorded for 4 hours and this episode was taken from the first 2 hours before the beverages really kicked in.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I respect Peter Klashorst as a man, as an artist, as a true friend and it would be hard to find anyone who is living their dream of being a true artist with a real powerful vision than him. As he says in this conversation \"I want to show how beautiful God created this earth and all of it's inhabitants.\" I believe that the life and art of his will live on forever because it is timeless. It was made from his pure vision of love and beauty. Aside from his superior art and world encompassing philosophy I think he is very funny.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Mr. Peter Klashorst.</p>", "duration": "01:50:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Tom_Rhodes_Presents_Peter_Klashorst.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1392300473, "title": "Zihni \u00d6zdil", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This episode was recorded in Rotterdam.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It always tickles me to meet intelligent people who attend my shows and are fans of mine.

I was a very young and inexperienced comedian and I loved and respected her from our initial meeting. She was a strong female headliner in a profession that was mostly male dominated.

I felt like a proud relative seeing Lizz kicking ass in the television world just as hard as she had as a headliner in the stand up comedy world.

Right before we started recording she let me smoke at her window which broke and remained half open with the cold air streaming in.

He wasn't playing in comedy clubs then he had a regular Wednesday night stint at a bar in Lower Manhattan. A musician friend of mine took me to see him and the musician friend told me \"This guy does more than comedy. He does raw naked truth\". I was ready to not like it but what happened over the next two hours as I sat watching him in this dark bar was uniquely powerful. It took him about 20 minutes to warm up but once he did there were slabs of brilliance. He spoke so freely and candidly about being a heroin addict and male prostitute I was transfixed. The sheer raw power of his honestly as he portrayed different stories of his personal history made me a fan of his work and the comedy thunderbolts he was throwing down.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I didn't meet Rick until about 7 or 8 years ago at a party of comedians in Los Angeles. I must have ignored everyone for most of the night because my main memory of that party is of talking with Rick all night about comedy in the back yard. Sometimes you need to be patient with Rick, just like that first time I saw him in New York, because once he gets warms up it is truly masterful.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This conversation was recorded at Rick's Hollywood bungalow. In this chat a beautiful point is made in that comedy wasn't invented for the young and beautiful. It was invented for the damaged people, the ones with great stories to tell. Few people have lived the life that Rick Shapiro has and I admire him because he weaves his stories throughout his brilliant observations on modern living.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He's not afraid to get angry and yell at the injustice's of the world.

I think that sincerity is the bravest choice a comedian could make and Rick is a perfect example of this style.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I respect this man and believe him to be an American comedy legend who will be remembered and studied.

I love and respect this man so much it is effortless for me to comply with his wishes. Earlier this year I discovered his brand new album entitled 'Return to Zooathalon' and it has been in my heavy rotation in the music that I have been using to pump me up and fuel me up to keep motoring down the highway.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">For me as a music lover there is no better feeling than when you fall in love with an artist's music to discover that they have an entire body of work that you were unaware of. That is what happened with me after I feel in love with 'Return to Zooathalon', I discovered the period of recordings Mr. Maitreya calls Post Millennium \u00a0Rock. There are so many smash hits in these recordings! As I got further into his music I went deeper into exploring his website <span style=\"color: #4787ff;\"><a href=\"http://sanandamaitreya.com/\">sanandamaitreya.com</a>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\">&</span></span> <a href=\"http://sananda.org/\"><span style=\"color: #4787ff;\">sananda.org</span></a> where I discovered his archive or writings. His writings reminded me of my own comedy notebooks that I have been keeping for years and made me fall deeper in love with the man behind the music.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Mr. Maitreya lives in Milan, Italy with his wife who he loves and inspires him and they have just had their second child. I keep referring to him as Mr. Maitreya because many years ago I was lucky enough to be the opening act for James Brown and Ray Charles. Backstage everyone addressed them as Mr. Brown or Mr. Charles. Even Ray Charles' son Ray Charles Jr. called him Mr. Charles! I believe this is the same respect that Mr. Maitreya commands. In this conversation when Mr. Maitreya refers to an artist that he respects and admires I like that calls them master. I was privileged to have this long conversation with him via Skype and it is filled with wisdom, humor, philosophy and supreme advice from the life of a legendary recording artist.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">For the first 5 minutes of our chat I felt like a nervous fan, for the half hour past that I felt like I had been friends with him my whole life, then beyond that I felt like a disciple of a new religion I wished that he would start. There ain't nothing about this man that I don't like! I'm proud to present to you here the one and only divine presence of music and light that is Master Sananda Maitreya!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The songs that I have generously been given permission to use in this episode can be found and available for purchase at the following links:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">'Kangaroo' from\u00a0<i>Return To Zooathalon</i>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zooathalon.com/\"><span style=\"color: #1255cc;\">www.Zooathalon.com</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">'Ornella Or Nothing' from\u00a0<i>Return To Zooathalon\u00a0\u00a0</i><a href=\"http://www.zooathalon.com/\"><span style=\"color: #1255cc;\">www.Zooathalon.com</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">'With A Girl Like You' from\u00a0<i>Nigor Mortis</i>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nigormortis.com/\"><span style=\"color: #1255cc;\">www.NigorMortis.com</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">'Hurricane Me & You' from <i>Return to Zooathalon</i> <a href=\"http://www.zooathalon.com/\"><span style=\"color: #4787ff;\">www.Zooathalon.com</span></a>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "01:30:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2f/41/0d/2f410d07-3179-6d2d-fdf0-76032a9e62fe/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trr/Tom_Rhodes_Radio_Presents_Sananda_Maitreya.mp3?dest-id=63268", "type": "episode", "tags": ["tom", "rhodes", "maitreya", "sananda"]}, {"seriesId": 426881872, "seriesTitle": "Tom Rhodes Radio Smart Camp", "pubDate": 1380851280, "title": "Dara Faizi", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">This episode is a heartbreaker.

He had confidence as a story teller and a command of the stage you don't normally see in a comedian who is just starting out.

For years before I started doing my podcast I had been filming comedians for the comedy travel TV show idea that I have about highlighting comedians around the world. Dara Faiza was one of the comedians I wanted to highlight from Holland. Originally I was only going to use a few clips from this conversation for the TV show I wanted to make but since that show is still not in the works and Dara has passed on I see no reason to keep this chat to myself.</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\"></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">Since we recorded this conversation his career path had been smart, going in the Dutch tradition of cabaret where you craft hour theater performances instead of a night club act.

He lives in Brighton, the artist hipster capitol of England and if you don't know him already you will be glad for the introduction.
