Over the years I've interviewed him many more times and I always love talking with him, probably because I'm such a huge fan of his work from <em>The State</em> to <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em> to <em>Stella</em> and now Neftlix's <em>Wet Hot American Summer First Day of Camp</em> (not to mention <em>The Baxter</em> and <em>Mr. Funny Pants</em> and all the projects I'm forgetting). It was fascinating to find out how he regards his own success and how the Netflix series, he says, \"changed the narrative.\" Also he recently made a film called <em>Hello My Name is Doris</em> starring Sally Field and Max Greenfield and it was heartbreaking and beautiful. We also talked hypnotherapy (I was inspired to make an appointment after our conversation), kids, NY work ethics vs. LA work ethics (and the cultural differences in general), cats, tennis and sportiness. Plus we took your questions over twitter and did a round of Just Me Or Everyone. (BTW, still trying this thing where I write the episode summaries in EXTREME FIRST PERSON. Is it still working?

Ok bye.)</p>", "duration": "01:14:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/aa/b7/2e/aab72edd-6b4c-d835-24bc-e201a3596736/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/aa/b7/2e/aab72edd-6b4c-d835-24bc-e201a3596736/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/ariynbf/AR_102615_Michael_Showalter.mp3?dest-id=86968", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 379453196, "seriesTitle": "Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend", "pubDate": 1445486906, "title": "Dirty Diet Coke, Bonus Fruits and Mormon Funeral Potatoes", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I included Dirty Diet Coke in this episode title because ever since Jenna talked about it on the show, I can't stop thinking about it.
