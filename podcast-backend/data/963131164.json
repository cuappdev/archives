Mark grew to serve as HubSpot's SVP of Worldwide Sales and Services until 2013, during which he increased revenue over 6,000% and expanded the team from 1 to 450 employees. These results placed HubSpot #33 on the 2011 INC 500 Fastest Growing Companies list. Mark was ranked #19 in Forbes' Top 30 Social Sellers in the World.

There were two interesting wrinkles. First, each new chapter was free for the first 24 hours. If you missed the free window, it cost $1.50 to download. Second, each chapter was accompanied by a few different transmedia elements: there free samples from brand sponsors like Harry\u2019s and deals on sites like HotelTonight, downloadable DJ playlists, business cards for each character, and finance tutorials to explain some of the concepts in the book.Fast forward to today and based on the popularity of The Underwriting, Michelle signed on to published five books as part of a six-figure book deal.
