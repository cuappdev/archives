He and I used to tour with Gabriel Iglesias (Fluffy) for a while too. He has his son \"Pops\" (Armando Cosio Jr.) working for him in the office and eventually hired my friend Rodrigo Torres to work for him as an exterminator while Rodrigo is touring with me on the side AND going to law school. \n\nThey have a long history with me, a lot of stories and a lot of jokes. We'll probably have Mando back again soon since we have so much history together, but sit back and listen to this first one.\n\nPlease rate or review the podcast and if you like it subscribe on iTunes or Stitcher.
