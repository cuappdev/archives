(leaning towards no)</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Vocabulary:</strong> what level of archaism is appropriate?\n\n<strong>Syntactic structure:</strong> How complicated are the sentences?\n<ul>\n<li>Modern vs. archaic sentence structures \u2013 Someone wrote a letter to Tolkien telling that he was being too archaic, to which he said \u201creal old (medieval) people talk like this\u201d and gave a Theoden monologue sample in \u201cmodern voice\u201d which didn\u2019t sound \u201cright.\u201d</li>\n<li>Sentence structure is complicated, but tone is still conversational.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Return of the King</h3>\n\u201cField of Cormallen\u201d\n<ul>\n<li>Different from the beginning of Fellowship of the Ring \u2013 more archaic but not difficult. Syntax: unapologetically using poetic and archaic structure. More stately, less conversational. The effect is different.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Silmarillion</h3>\n\u201cof Maeglin\u201d chapter\n\n<strong>Vocabulary:</strong> a bit elevated/\u201cKing James\u201d-ish to modern readers. \u201cthe craft of finding ores of metals in the mountains\u201d vs \u201cHe learned about mining\u201d \u2013 stresses the connection to the mountains, and the relationship between the craftsmen and the metal.\n<h3>Book of Lost Tales</h3>\n(Lost audio) Vair\u00eb: in prose \u2013 one of the most archaic that Tolkien ever used. Extended expression instead of simple words. (The elaboration has a function, but what is it?)\n\nBy comparison, Game of Thrones: \u201cBritish\u201d accents but modern language/politics. It\u2019s a modern story with the trappings of fantasy.\n\n<strong>Trish:</strong> We need a synthesized accent (the Valar would have a dialect, the Hobbits have more of a rustic/English country accent, the different Elves having their own accents based on region)\n<h3><b>Discussion</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cArt should not be a slave to a perceived audience.\u201d \u2013 We should NOT dumb this down \u00e0 la Hollywood. (comment from attendee) We have precedents of this with other shows on Netflix/HBO. (House of Cards\u2019s Kevin Spacey uses \u2018old school\u2019 language)</li>\n<li>We still see Shakespeare adaptations with the original language.</li>\n<li>\u201cArchaic language is less a problem than the run-on sentences.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cWe should follow Tolkien\u2019s language as much as possible. His style is what makes his works so great.\u201d Tolkien is a more finely crafted linguistic performance, and changing the wording would lose much of the meaning.</li>\n<li><em>Silmarillion</em> is a *summary* of the history. We would need more dialogue to make it more accessible to the audience. The prose style of the Silmarillion isn\u2019t appropriate for a screen adaptation. We would need a more \u201cnovel like\u201d story.</li>\n<li>Majority of an episode would be dialogue, so we need to think about how the characters will talk.</li>\n<li>Tolkien gives more directives for how Samwise talks than other characters (capturing his accent in the writing).</li>\n<li>How many levels of distinction do we need? Do we try to draw a distinction between how the Elves talk vs. the Valar?</li>\n<li>Narrator\u2019s register should be different from the character\u2019s register/syntax.</li>\n<li>The narrator might be a good place to do the more complex Tolkien writing (long sentences, archaic vocabulary), while the dialogue might be better suited for shorter lines. But if our narrators are characters, then they need to sound true to that character.</li>\n<li>Originally against the idea of voice overs, but as we get into making individual episodes, we may need to have narrative voiceover to bridge the gaps in time, as the first season would cover a LOT of years and we need a way to convey the passage of time.</li>\n<li>Talked about the narrator having his own story \u2013 timing the narrator\u2019s story/voiceover with events happening</li>\n<li>Skipping the gaps in years to compress time fundamentally changes the story (Gandalf left Bilbo\u2019s party to search for answers about the One Ring for 17 years, not just a few days), so not in favor of shortening the timeline, but would need to skip \u201clong periods of bliss\u201d. (Time lapse!!)</li>\n<li><strong>Dialects:</strong> Elves don\u2019t use contractions whereas Men would\u2026do the Wood Elves have a different dialect from Elves of other regions? Dwarves would likely have a different accent. (No Hobbits in the Silmarillion, so don\u2019t need to worry about them)</li>\n<li>Beren doesn\u2019t speak the way he\u2019s depicted in the Silmarillion \u2013 it\u2019s the Elves telling his story and describing what he\u2019s saying. The Silmarillion doesn\u2019t have a lot of registers because it\u2019s told from the Elvish point of view. The Edain should have a dialect closer to the Elves, vs. the Easterlings.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages</strong> \u2013 at the very least, we should at least \u201cmake a nod\u201d towards the different languages. (Significant differences between Quenya and Sindarin, so the dialect should reflect this.)\n<ul>\n<li>Dwarves with Yoda sentence structure! (not specifically, but rather that level of syntactic difference)</li>\n<li>Valar/Noldor might speak Quenya almost exclusively amongst themselves (since Quenya becomes like Latin \u2013 a dead language)</li>\n<li>If they\u2019re speaking English to each other, we can imagine that they\u2019re actually speaking their own language, but if we inject words here and there, it may make it seem more obvious that they\u2019re speaking English. \u201cHunt for Red October\u201d starts them in Russian and then switches to English, but that transition may be too jarring.</li>\n<li>In the Third\u00a0Age, there is a common tongue that everyone understands, (which we could believe is English) but that\u2019s not the case in the First Age.</li>\n<li>When we have the two Elf peoples coming together, we need to sort that out. (We\u2019ll likely need subtitles)</li>\n<li><strong>Solution:</strong> (not the best, but for the moment) different accents, and when the Noldor start speaking Sindarin, they need to change their tone.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If we get too hung up on this, it may end up being more confusing. We don\u2019t want to lose the story for the sake of details</li>\n<li>We also have visual components to help distinguish between groups.</li>\n<li>Detailed stories that overlap in time: Tuor and Turin crossing paths. Contemporaneous stories vs. skipping around the timeline a lot, which could make things confusing. (Think <em>Two Towers</em> film, how Jackson is telling the three\u00a0simultaneous stories.) We could build drama by going back and forth, and might be good to break up the Bliss of Valinor.</li>\n<li>The narrator at the beginning or end, not in the middle to be a \u201ctour guide\u201d for the viewer.</li>\n<li>This is more of an awareness episode, as opposed to coming to final decisions (maybe we can\u2019t make some decisions till we get started).</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Narrators:</strong> if we use narrators \u201cthe cool way,\u201d we may be stuck with the contiguous stories. Would be good to synthesize a few stories together.\n<h2><b>Summary and Decisions made</b></h2>\n<strong>Syntax</strong> \u2013 a kind of \u201creverse Silmarillion\u201d \u2013 the narrators will have more modern syntax, dialogue from the first age more archaic.\n\n<strong>Chronology</strong> \u2013 interleaving stories\n<h2><b>Closing</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Questions for Season 0, Episode 4</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Laying out plot structure of entire show (big picture season arcs for Seasons 1-3) to have a sense of where we\u2019re headed.</li>\n<li>Where should we end each season? Multiple story lines?</li>\n<li>Next class: July 17</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Trish:</strong>\u00a0We should consider a \u201cwrap up episode\u201d where we go over all our decisions and combine special guests, before we start Season 1. Especially if there are outstanding decisions. (In light of \u201ctabling\u201d the Register question and other issues for the moment.)\n<h3><b>Recommended Reading</b></h3>\nRefresh memory up to Flight of the Noldor to Middle Earth to the Dagor Bragollach", "duration": "1:45:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf286.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Tolkien", "Olsen", "Mythgard", "LOTRO"]}, {"seriesId": 320513707, "seriesTitle": "The Tolkien Professor", "pubDate": 1437764796, "title": "SilmFilm Episode 0-04: Plot Mapping", "author": "Corey Olsen, Trish Lambert", "summary": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf287.mp3\">Episode 0-4 Audio\u00a0</a></p>\n\n<h2>Introduction/Review</h2>\nToday, we are dividing up the Silmarillion storyline into actual seasons for the show.

Glorfindel telling a young Estel telling the story of the Fall of Gondolin would be an exception. Gandalf telling a story would be \u201cgood fan service.\u201d</li>\n<li>\"The Ainulindal\u00eb\" doesn\u2019t need an eyewitness as narrator. (But Bombadil as a narrator would have to be entirely written in poetry!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are our narrators' stories?</h3>\n<strong>Aragorn:</strong> overarching life story (Hero\u2019s journey)\n<ul>\n<li>Adolescent Aragorn in Rivendell, with Gilraen, instruction from Elrond, gaining wisdom.</li>\n<li>Discovering his heritage, being engaged to Arwen</li>\n<li>Becoming king</li>\n<li>Final scene would be deathbed with Arwen.\n<ul>\n<li>Life in Gondor when he\u2019s older and instructing his son \u2013 the story of Lord of the Rings.</li>\n<li>Merry and Pippin (as elders) could participate in the framestory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Rise and Fall of Numenor</strong> \u2013 Aragorn would be a good candidate for this story. We can also see how Aragorn becomes the man we see in LOTR. Rangers sitting around a campfire, Aragorn telling cautionary tales to his men\n\nAragorn/Celeborn/Samwise as dominant framestories.\n\nAragorn is the culmination of the stories of Valar, Elves and Men, and will be likely the longest narrator\u2026the stories are very relevant to him.\n\n<strong>Spinoff:</strong> \u201cThe Adventures of Young Aragorn\u201d\n\n<strong>Sam \u2013</strong>\u00a0Smaller story arc:\n<ul>\n<li>Young Sam hearing stories from Mr. Bilbo, sowing the seeds of Sam\u2019s love for all things Elvish.</li>\n<li>Sam\u2019s time in the shire as Mayor \u2013 talk about the Shire in the 4<sup>th</sup> age (begin at Frodo\u2019s leaving for the Greyhavens and end when he gets on his own boat)</li>\n<li>Living at home with Frodo for a few years, forestry work, his wedding\u2026(could be covered at the end with elderly Sam telling his children of the Scouring of the Shire/Battle of Bywater.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat\u2019s Sam\u2019s first story going to be?\n\nHe might represent the \u201cestablishment of the new order\u201d \u2013 Bilbo has made adventures fashionable again\u2026connections to the outside world and its impact on the culture of the Shire. (Goes from a pleasant cultural isolation/\u201dbackwater\u201d to being in contact/familiar with the outside world)\n\nCeleborn in Rivendell after Elrond leaves. (Galadriel never shows up.) The fading of the Elves should be his main theme. We can show Celeborn resisting the fading. He may be the spokesperson of the Elves who don\u2019t want to go, trying to retain the past. (Both good and bad) Eventually he decides to leave, and when he does, He and Sam could sail off together (with Legolas and Gimli)\n\n<strong>Comic Moment:</strong> Spinoff sitcom of the 4 them (the ship gets off course! Like <em>Gilligan\u2019s Island</em>)\n\nAragorn and the hobbits may stop by to see Celeborn while traveling.\n\nCeleborn always being in the same setting, while Aragorn and Sam are traveling about and doing different things, can reflect the longevity of the Elves.\n\nGiven this, Season 1 goes to Aragorn(?) Working title for the season: \u201cThe Shaping of Arda\u201d\n\nA separate narrator for \"The Ainulindal\u00eb\" might work, as that\u2019s such a different story from the rest. That inconsistency might be okay.\n\nIntertwine the 3 narrators? Place and time subtitles to help with chronology\n\nOr different elves could be telling a young Estel parts of the Ainulindale, and Estel could learn something from that story.\n\nNoldor arriving in Beleriand might be a good point to bring in Celeborn (after kinslaying)\n\nSam\u2019s first story: could start with the Bliss of Valinor and the Awakening of the Elves (journey to valinor)\n<h3><strong>Season 2:</strong></h3>\nBegins with Orom\u00eb finding the Elves and inviting them to Valinor. The Bliss, and then the Unchaining of Melkor, and how he started the poisoning of the Elves or the forging of the Silmarils. Or the death of Finw\u00eb (darkening of Valinor).\n\n<b>Arc:</b> Bliss of Valinor, rise of dissention, and the Darkening (Melkor taking the Silmarils)\n\nWorking title for the season: \u201cThe Noontide of Valinor\u201d\n<h3>Season 3</h3>\nOpens with Oath of F\u00ebanor (his death as the opening of Season 4) and the Unrest, the Kinslaying, Doom of Mandos the Burning of the Ships, the setting up of kingdoms, Crossing of Helcarax\u00eb (and end with Rising of the Moon) Galadriel may make an appearance here\n\nWorking title for the season: \u201cThe Unrest of the Noldor\u201d\n<h3>Season 4: Beleriand Stuff</h3>\nF\u00ebanor\u2019s death will cause the stories of peoples to diverge. Healing of the breach)\n\nSons of F\u00ebanor need more fleshing out\n\nWill need an asynchronous Season 0 Episode to discuss later seasons\n\n\u201cSeason 1\u201d section of the <a href=\"http://mythgard.org/forum/index.php?categories/the-silmfilm-project.5/\">forum</a> is open, be thinking about Casting (for two episodes down the line).\n<h3>First Age</h3>\n12-season arc between the beginning to the War of Wrath!!!!\n<h3>Second age</h3>\nHow many seasons do we spend in N\u00famenor?

Tolkien have offered continues to be of interest to Corey and his podcast listeners.\n\nIn a recent Tolkien Chat, Corey took on another sort of adaptation: the new Middle-earth Lore Series. A brainchild of Joel \u201cAndang\u201d Shepherd, the director of the Players Alliance (a Mythgard Institute partner) and the force behind the weekly LOTRO Players News podcast, the series looks at the history of Middle-earth from an unusual angle. Using locations such as The Shire, Bree-land and Rivendell as anchors, the episodes relates the history of each place and the people who inhabited it. And those places and people are all inside LOTRO.\n\nThe first episode of the series, \u201cThe Shire,\u201d was recently released, and to celebrate the launch. Corey talked to Andang about how he came up with the series idea, who its target audience is, and what the experience shooting within LOTRO is like.

Only after his arrival does the spirit of corruption begin to permeate</li>\n<li>Discovery of the infection of Melkor in the world</li>\n<li>Overthrow of the Lamps (Lost Tales version is comical\u2026there\u2019s probably a good reason why Tolkien changed that) We may want to consider that the Valar isn\u2019t sure Melkor is an enemy.</li>\n<li>Melkor comes among the Valar</li>\n<li>Rebellion of Osse against Ulmo (great conflict in the sea), Uinen saves the day (an opportunity to show that repentance is possible and showcase the power of the Maiar)\n<ul>\n<li>Maiar including Saruman, Gandalf and Radagast\n<ul>\n<li>Gandalf/Olorin inspired visions unseen</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tom Bombadil could be in his house.

He is associated with Balrogs. Had he been in a peaceful relationship with the Valar, he would be in the domain of fire.\n\n<strong>Medieval cosmology:</strong> concentric spheres. Sphere of fire is nearest to the heavens and farthest from Earth. Earth-Water-Air-Fire reflects the pecking order (Melkor was the most powerful and highest on the hierarchy)\n\n<strong>Melkor\u2019s miserly evil:</strong> Instead of \u201chating\u201d light but he becomes more spiteful about sharing it b/c he thinks everyone else is unworthy of it. You can\u2019t tell the difference between an extreme miser and a pauper\u2026the miser hates spending money so much that they look poor. Temperatures are a fire thing, and therefore ice is a fire thing.\n\nTrish suggests a 2-hour first episode.\n\nCharacter development/Manwe\u2019s commitment to mercy. For Melkor, pride (\u201cI know how to do it better, I should be in charge\u201d) becoming an evil thing, as opposed to a 2-dimensional bad guy from the beginning. At what point is \u201cthe point of no return?\u201d Sauron had a partial (but genuine) redemption after the First Age.\n\nCritique against Tolkien is that his world is simple black and white as far as good and evil. Tolkien recognized this weakness with regard to orcs, but this is not the case with other characters, and we should consider this when portraying Melkor.\n\n<strong>Precursor stories:</strong> Melkor and Varda for Melian and Thingol, ____ for Beren and Luthien\n\nTurning point of Season One = Destruction of Lamps b/c that\u2019s the first conflict between Melkor and Valar (he is no longer pretending to be a friend. He has now decided he wants to conquer them). He will likely blame Varda for poisoning the other Valar against him and building his antipathy for Manwe. He loves Light, so he destroys it spitefully. He overthrows the Lamps because Light is <b>His</b>. He hoards the Silmarils for the same reason \u2013 he is a miser.\n\nGo back to the void and Melkor seeking the Flame Imperishable.\n\nA \u201cWhat if\u201d of Melkor hadn\u2019t fallen (and Varda)? Elements of a love triangle, but the real challenge is looking at cosmic and moral implications. (We don\u2019t need this to be emotional/cheesy)\n\n(In regard to lighting these episodes, The Sun and the Moon are not going to rise until Season 3, so we will use starlight predominantly, until the Lamps, or the Trees in Season 2).\n\nJoy of slaying/being in battle is a corruption of a positive trait (Tulkas is a positive embodiment)\n\n<b>Summary and Decisions made:</b>\n\nNext episode will be more plot overview (instead of casting). Casting will be handled episode by episode, as it helps to design the characters first.\n<h2>Closing</h2>\n<h3>Questions for Season 1, Episode 2:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Next class:</strong>\u00a0Friday, August 28, 10am - 12pm ET</li>\n<li>Cast of Characters for Frame Story (Young Aragorn in Rivendell) \u2013 there will be more narrative frame in the first episode more than in any other episode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommended Reading:</h3>\nAppendix A and Appendix B", "duration": "1:54:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf289.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Tolkien", "Olsen", "Mythgard", "LOTRO"]}, {"seriesId": 320513707, "seriesTitle": "The Tolkien Professor", "pubDate": 1441209072, "title": "SilmFilm Episode 1-02: Narrative Overview", "author": "Corey Olsen", "summary": "<h2>Introduction/Review</h2>\nExcited to finish the overview of Season One and incorporate some of the things mentioned on the discussion board.

The reason this matters is for the question of the origin of orcs\u2026Melkor cannot be chained up prior to the Elves\u2019 awakening.\n<ul>\n<li>Final scene: Awakening of the Elves (but what does that look like? Bubbles in sand?) Even the Valar don\u2019t see the Elves awaken, they happen upon them, so the camera can do the same thing.</li>\n<li>Formation of the Orcs \u2013 never fully solved, so open to not giving an answer and having orcs appear (there are problems with kidnapping and turning them into orcs) Do we really want an \u201cElf torture montage?\u201d</li>\n<li>We should depict the chaining of Melkor before the finding of Elves to make it neater for the seasons, and Episode 2 Season 2 would be Orome finding the Elves. (Still open to change)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dave was in agreement with pretty much everything discussed last week (\u201cno major objections or complaints.\u201d)\n<ul>\n<li>Episode 1 of the series: business as usual for Valar\u2026not immediately overt that Melkor is the enemy. An uninformed observer might get a hint at the very end of the first episode, and then receive the explanation in the next episode.</li>\n<li>Showing the way that people go bad is b/c their nature/impulses which are initially good. It\u2019s more tragic to watch that fall. Lucifer\u2019s story parallels. When we look at each villain (Sauron, Feanor, etc.) we want to have a sense of tragedy\u2026we want to feel the fall, and see how great the character could have become if they went \u201con the light path\u201d and contrast it with how it turned out taking the \u201cdark path.\u201d</li>\n<li>Emphasis on Melkor being a miser (of light and goodness).</li>\n<li>A lesson for Estel: Sometimes you have to do bad things b/c someone else is doing worse things, and they need to be stopped.</li>\n<li>Getting to the point of going to war \u2013 should be a horrific idea (The War that Began All Wars).</li>\n<li>Warrior culture: should be viewed as a decline from where we began. One can still be heroic, and it\u2019s not necessarily evil, but looking at where we began, it is the result of a fall.</li>\n<li>The Valar are not preserved from Melkor\u2019s corruption. The Valar make mistakes and Tolkien is explicit about that, but we don\u2019t want to depict them as wholly compromised.\n<ul>\n<li>Especially of Manwe and Varda, who are still spoken of in holy/consecrated terms</li>\n<li>Aule\u2019s mistake with the Dwarves was an actual moral failing.

We want the story told within the frame that interacts with the larger story.\n\nWe need to save Aragorn\u2019s time, as we have 20 years of episodes\u2026so we would start with a young Aragorn, prior to meeting Arwen perhaps.\n<h3><b>Discussion</b></h3>\nYears of Note:\n<ul>\n<li>2890 Bilbo born</li>\n<li>2907 Gilraen born</li>\n<li>2931 Aragorn born.\n<ul>\n<li>Taken to Rivendell when he is 2 years old.</li>\n<li>Will have no memory of life outside of Rivendell. (Gilraen is 24)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2941 The Hobbit takes place when Aragorn is 10-11 years old. Aragorn may have seen them.</li>\n<li>2951 Meeting with Arwen \u2013 he is 20, he is told his true name in history, goes out into the wild.</li>\n<li>2953 Last meeting of the White Council, Gandalf begins to work independently (or against) Saruman</li>\n<li>2956 5 years of travel before Aragorn meets Gandalf. Gandalf needed an ally</li>\n<li>23-year period of travel, meets Arwen in Lorien</li>\n</ul>\nAragorn and Arwen meeting should happen in context with the Beren and Luthien story (Season 4 or 5) so \u201cnot in any hurry to get Aragorn through puberty.\u201d\n\nBilbo and the Dwarves should overlap a little.\n\nMeeting and conversation between 11 year old Aragorn and Bilbo returning from his quest to Erebor could be the end of Season 1. It would be neat to have their relationship start back then. Why does Bilbo talk to Aragorn so casually? B/c he knew Aragorn as a kid.\n\nBilbo is returning home \u2013 he\u2019s had a traumatic experience, and is he able to \u201cgo back home again\u201d after having witnessed war? Though he\u2019s much older than Aragorn, he is still ignorant of the world of the Elves, and in a sense. Juxtapose his horrific experience to young Aragorn, who hasn\u2019t experienced the horror but knows the stories?\n<ul>\n<li>Beginning: Young Estel looking at a mural and Elrond deciding to begin his education</li>\n<li>End: Bilbo looking at the same mural, and young Estel finds him there and starts telling him the story about it.</li>\n</ul>\nRe: Legolas \u2013 Orlando Bloom should walk in and say \u201cThis kid is 11. I\u2019ll come back in a while.\u201d\n\nCameo of Dwarves, not as main characters in the frame. Stick with Estel, Elrond, and Gilraen, with Bilbo at the end. We don\u2019t want the framestory to get too complicated\n\nElrond would likely tell the Valar stories\n\nAndreth\u2019s story (<em>Morgoth\u2019s Ring</em>) is more of a platonic dialogue (so it wouldn\u2019t translate well to TV), but would like to give some of Andreth\u2019s characterization to Gilraen. Andreth is the only human to get into the face of an Elf and say \u201cYou have no idea what it is to be human,\u201d mortality, etc. (And the reverse happens to her as well, and she learns that she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be an Elf)\n<ul>\n<li>Gilraen being in Rivendell is a bit of a sacrifice on her part, as she doesn\u2019t quite fit in.\n<ul>\n<li>There could be tension between Elrond and Gilraen in regard to Estel\u2019s education, so Gilraen may narrate some of the Feanor material in her desire to give Estel the human side of the story\u2026a sort of balancing force. \u201cDo not raise my son as an Elf \u2013 he is a Man.\u201d</li>\n<li>Gilraen could tell the Beren and Luthien story and be like \u201ctrust me, this never works out\u2026\u201d when he begins coming of age and starts noticing Elf ladies.\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cThe consequences of raising Aragorn too much like an Elf is that you\u2019ve lost your daughter to him.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWe should have a list of moments that we want to see in the framestory, as they will only be a few minutes per episode. Estel could represent the audience, and could ask the questions that we would be asking. (And what are those questions?) Maybe a non-Elrond Elf like Glorfindel or Lindir. Aragorn would likely go out with different Elves for short journeys as an adolescent.\n\nWhen he goes out into the wild, that\u2019s when he becomes the Chieftan of the Rangers.\n\nMany of the settings for this first season will involve Elrond talking to Estel, and Gilraen likely in the room.\n\nCameo with Thorin and Dwarves might be earlier in the season.\n\nLots of potential for Aragorn, and lots of time to show different things.\n\nElrond views Aragorn as a foster son\u2026but maybe he looks at him as his nephew (he is a descendent of his brother Elros). Hard to believe that there is no affection between them and it\u2019s never addressed. (Juxtapose against Beren/Thingol?)\n\nWe might see how Elrond feels about Elros\u2019 choice: Gilraen \u2013 \u201cYour brother chose mortality, you can\u2019t make my son into what you wish your brother had become.\u201d\n<h3><b>Summary and Decisions</b></h3>\nStart with a wide shot of Rivendell, and zoom in to a young mother and young boy, perhaps she may be disciplining him and calling him Estel, and only when Gilraen and Elrond talk do we learn his real name.\n\nCasting: Gilraen would look younger as a Dunedain, so a 20-something woman would do well\u2026imagine a young woman being feisty and standing up to Elrond.\n\nWhen Elrond sees Aragorn looking at the mural and asking questions, he decides it\u2019s time to start telling the stories.\n\nThe tension between Gilraen and Elrond could run parallel to Mandos\u2019 bit about how strife is already in the land.\n\nDeath of Arathorn and flight to Rivendell (originally suggested as an opening for the first episode\u2026But we would need to have time pass.) This may be best kept for a flashback, as young Aragorn would eventually ask what happened to his father. (This could be used when the Valar go to war.)\n\nRadagast may be a great narrator further down. (original idea was Radagast telling the tale of the Music)\n<h2><b>Close </b></h2>\n<h3><b>Questions for Season 1, Episode 3 (Sept. 11, 2015)</b></h3>\nEpisode 1: Ainulindale\n<ul>\n<li>How to introduce the frame and how much?</li>\n<li>Depicting Music of Ainur?</li>\n<li>How do we connect it to the later stories?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Recommended Reading</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ainulindal\u00eb</li>\n<li>Vala Quenta</li>\n<li>Chapter 1-2 Quenta Silmarillion</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "1:59:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf290.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Tolkien", "Olsen", "Mythgard", "LOTRO"]}, {"seriesId": 320513707, "seriesTitle": "The Tolkien Professor", "pubDate": 1443785354, "title": "SilmFilm Episode 1-03: The Ainulindal\u00eb (Pilot Episode)", "author": "Corey Olsen", "summary": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf291.mp3\">Audio Episode</a></p>\n\n<h2>Introduction/Review</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No more delaying: it's time to discuss the Music of the Ainur.

Season 1 qill cover 1000\u2019s of years, so how do we depict this time?\n<ul>\n<li>Framestory of <b>Elrond teaching Estel stuff</b> helps deal with this. (Flashback to Arathorn\u2019s death and meeting Bilbo and the Dwarves can happen) Episode 3 or 4 may be a good time for Estel to ask \u201cSo how long had they been living in Almaren before Melkor came?\u201d and Elrond can teach about how time wasn\u2019t measured the same way prior to the Awakening of the Children of Iluvatar, and can allude passing of eons.</li>\n<li>Season 1 will be more frameheavy b/c of this. The story will be developing, but won\u2019t be happening in real human time scale, so we can say these things happened before time was tracked.</li>\n<li>Character drama with the Valar will be slow to start, but the framestory will have more personal stakes. Estel, Gilraen and Elrond can bring in a level of emotional investment into the story.\n<ul>\n<li>Valar won\u2019t even have human forms for a while, but we want the viewers to become attached to them, but it won\u2019t happen right away.</li>\n<li>Cast Mandos as someone incredibly attractive so that the audience wants him to say and do more, but never does.</li>\n<li>A child asking questions can be part of the story (and help the audience understand what\u2019s going on with the Valar)</li>\n<li>Gilraen channeling Andreth is good, as Andreth\u2019s story wouldn\u2019t translate well for an episode. The tension between Elves and Men should be depicted, and would be more interesting to see the tension in a relationship that isn\u2019t prejudiced from the onset (as we usually see) but tension between people who\u2019ve now co-existed/co-habited for a period of time and likely have developed friendship/kinship/fellowship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Looking Back to Last Session</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>One primary overarching question: <b>What\u2019s the story here?

Aul\u00eb and Yavanna are easier to visualize.\n<ul>\n<li>Much of what the Valar were doing are not going to be visually depictable, and may be better handled in the frame:\n<ul>\n<li>Elrond teaching Estel: how each one has invested their spirit/ideas into the Music</li>\n<li>how it relates to the creation of the world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How do we make it look? Looking at the end of the Ainulindal\u00eb, it talks about how the symmetry of the world has now been wrecked/tumultuous due to Melkor\u2019s marring.\n<ul>\n<li>Do we depict Arda unmarred? Do we even know what it looks like? (more conceptual than descriptive)\n<ul>\n<li>We may not ever come up with something attractive/beautiful enough. The mountains we see now are the \u201cpost Melkor\u201d mountains.</li>\n<li>Mountains might be perfectly conical. Trees might be perfectly straight. The things that make mountains craggy and interesting are absent, so it may not even be attractive (and it would like Melkor rescued us)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Is it better to depict an abstract Arda unmarred in a \u201cmythic\u201d way, like they take it on belief and this concept is very old?\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cUnmArda\u201d may not have \u201cexisted\u201d and may be more aspirational rather than historical</li>\n<li>Our tastes are defined by the world we live in, so we are bound to fail in conveying this visually.</li>\n<li>It needs to be depicted in the harmony of the characters\n<ul>\n<li>Can be depicted in the frame\u2026Gilraen can express some \u201cAndreth-style\u201d skepticism: \u201cHow do you know this? Why is this \u2018perfect world\u2019 important when we live in this awful one?\u201d</li>\n<li>Elrond: \u201cWe have evil and suffering, but it wasn\u2019t always this way. The greatest evil began as benign as a young Estel.\u201d</li>\n<li>Role call: Each Valar introduced as their elemental versions and how they played their part in the creation of the world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Story arc for Episode 2</h3>\nMoving from chaos to harmony. When the Valar arrive in Arda, they don\u2019t know each other. They don\u2019t know how to work together, or understand each other, they only understand the part of Eru\u2019s mind from whence they came. They don\u2019t get Melkor, they\u2019re different from him, but they\u2019re different from each other. But they learn to harmonize.\n<ul>\n<li>Ulmo and Manw\u00eb were able to make rain and snowflakes thanks to the extremes in temperature from the discord of Melkor</li>\n<li>Marriages \u2013 those who are in sympathy with each other and how they fit together/amplify each other (Manw\u00eb and Varda, Aul\u00eb and Yavanna)</li>\n<li>Pieces of Eru\u2019s mind can work independently and together</li>\n<li>Valar are not infallible\u2026some foreshadowing of personality traits that lead to future issues\n<ul>\n<li>Oss\u00eb (violence of the coasts) and Uinen</li>\n<li>Mandos: walking around pronouncing doom while Tulkas is laughing all the time</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb and Yavanna can have a lot of relationship drama with the creation of Dwarves</li>\n<li>Ulmo the rebel (he could look like the baddie for the first 1/3 of season 1)</li>\n<li>Nienna is about compassion and wisdom (following Mandos around and making the judged feel better).\n<ul>\n<li>She shouldn\u2019t be in group scenes. She consoles 1-on-1. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t attend parties.\u201d</li>\n<li>She argues for Melkor\u2019s release (She shows compassion for Melkor as well)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nValar don\u2019t know what the Children look like, so the Valar should look alien to us.\n\nEstablishment of Almaren will be the conclusion of Episode 2. Physical fights between Valar and their domains as they learn to establish peace and work together.\n\nIn the \u201cmaybe not this episode\u201d category:\n<ul>\n<li>Sauron cameo: establish relationship between Aul\u00eb and Sauron</li>\n<li>Ungoliant cameo in \u2013 Elemental Season 1 Valar/Maia female form\u2026she is the Maia (we might make her a Vala, as she\u2019s still an Ainu) of darkness\n<ul>\n<li>Remember that Melkor\u2019s thing is fire/light/heat and uses darkness b/c he\u2019s denying others light.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Q&amp;A with Estel: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Valar and Maiar?\u201d\n<ul>\n<li>Elrond: \u201cNot much. They are all Ainur.\u201d</li>\n<li>(But for us, the Valar are main characters and the Maiar are supporting characters)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nEnd of Season 2 (The Darkening): Melkor remembers Ungoliant and seeks her out to form the alliance and speaks to her (in her female form) and then morphs into the spider when they begin to take action.\n<ul>\n<li>Ungoliant is never mainstream. She is on her own while the other Valar are forming their alliances. She keeps to herself.\n<ul>\n<li>Wait till Episode 4-5? Orome could return from riding and be wondering what\u2019s up with the \u201ccreepy darkness lady?\u201d (played by Angelica Houston as Morticia Addams)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nienna and Ulmo are also \u201cloners\u201d as well</li>\n<li>We can present enough personality/drama/tension to make the audience wonder which one will go bad, out of maybe 5 of the Valar?</li>\n<li>In the Silmarillion, we are looking \u201cup\u201d at the Valar b/c we are reading about them from the position of the Elves. Book of Lost Tales OTOH are looking at the Valar from the \u201cValar-level,\u201d and they can look \u201cgoofy\u201d and dysfunctional</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Summary and Decisions</b></h3>\nNot really a decision, but something that happened in this discussion is that Gilraen and Elrond\u2019s tension runs parallel with the Valar\u2019s tensions (and we had aspired to have either parallel storylines between frame and main stories)\n<h2>Closing</h2>\n<h3>Questions for Season 1, Session 5:</h3>\n10/9: Clarify ideas for future episodes vs. what should be in Episode 2.\n<ul>\n<li>We can continue introducing new Maiar</li>\n<li><strong>Episode 3:</strong> Bringing in Melkor to Almaren. (Flashbacks to the void\u2026Melkor trying to form an alliance with Varda)\n<ul>\n<li>How do we show what happens in pre-Arda (Flashbacks from the Void\u2026frame within a frame???)</li>\n<li>What does the Void look like \u2013 how do we distinguish what happens in the Void vs. Arda.</li>\n<li>How do we show the relationship between Melkor and the Valar? (They\u2019ve been through the music and the discord) How \u201cclueless\u201d are the Valar?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommended Reading:</h3>\nAinulindal\u00eb, Vala Quenta, Chapter 1-2 Quenta Silmarillion", "duration": "1:50:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf292.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Tolkien", "Olsen", "Mythgard", "LOTRO"]}, {"seriesId": 320513707, "seriesTitle": "The Tolkien Professor", "pubDate": 1445288834, "title": "SilmFilm Episode 1-5: He Who Shall Not Be Named Morgoth", "author": "Corey Olsen", "summary": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf293.mp3\">Audio Episode</a></p>\n\n<h2><b>Introduction/Review</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There\u2019s opportunity for creativity, visuals, etc. as we don\u2019t have much character arc in the book, so we have the chance to do something different here. Tolkien gives us glimpses but there\u2019s nothing specific\n<ul>\n<li>Seeking the Flame Imperishable (FI), but no narrative of what he was like before his fall, but more about what his fall consisted of.</li>\n<li>We see his desire for light and the FI, which are good things. How did everything go so wrong?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Two\u00a0Questions:</h3>\n<strong>1) What\u2019s going to be our central focus? Central themes?</strong>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If there\u2019s a single recurrent theme, it would be <i><b>estel</b></i> (not the guy, but the concept of Hope)</li>\n<li>Theme of Season 1 is the Fall from the Golden Age (as well as the fall of Melkor)</li>\n<li>We end Season 1 with \u201cThe War To Begin All Wars\u201d\u2026The Valar don\u2019t WANT to go to war, and they don\u2019t want to concede the idea that Arda has been marred that much\u2026conceding this is itself a fall/defeat\n<ul>\n<li>One of the things the Valar might be talking about is \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Iluvatar intervening to save Arda?\u201d</li>\n<li>Iluvatar\u2019s intervention is awakening the Elves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Season 2 is the Valar\u2019s screw-up (bringing the Elves to Valinor)</li>\n<li>Estel\u2019s reveal to the audience (as Aragorn) may be at the end of Episode 1, but the final episode of Season 1 may reveal (to the audience) the true meaning of the name Estel\u2026Gilraen and Elrond could be watching Estel and Bilbo interacting, and while watching, discuss amongst themselves and the meaning of the name is revealed.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<strong>2) Melkor\u2019s name</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Vala Quenta: \u201cOf the Enemies\u201d \u2013 he has forfeited the name Melkor (He who Arises in Might), and the Noldor do not utter that name; they have renamed him Morgoth (the enemy of the people)</li>\n<li>Will he be a \u201che who must not be named\u201d thing? That may be giving Melkor too much respect (too much reverence)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cHe whom we do not name\u201d (Voldemort in HP: creates an air of mystery and fear, so HP and Dumbledore defy him by using his name)</li>\n<li>Gondor: more an attitude of disdain \u201cwe don\u2019t respect you enough to name you\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Elrond: would be more open, especially in a pedagogical environment. He would call him Melkor at the beginning, to set up how he becomes Morgoth</li>\n<li>The music is a spoiler for all of history \u2013 we already know Melkor is discordant\u2026so would his fall be a surprise?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We know he\u2019s the bad guy\u2026so let\u2019s see what happened.</li>\n<li>He doesn\u2019t become Morgoth until F\u00ebanor names him, so it makes sense to wait to use that name till it actually happens.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We maybe want to be able to \u201croot for\u201d the bad guy, even though we know he\u2019s destined to fall.</li>\n<li>We can watch him fall, and fall again, and fall again, and how he eventually becomes a completely different identity</li>\n<li>Burning of his hand by the Silmarils would be the changing moment when he becomes a tyrant.</li>\n<li>Utumno should be paradisiacal\u2026more of a retreat</li>\n<li>We can take Tolkien\u2019s lead with regard to name usage. Elrond can caution Estel about casually using Melkor\u2019s name</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Looking Back to Last Session</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Episode 2 of season 1: thinking about how to depict the Valar, marriages, Maiar (Ungoliant)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the first of 4 episodes where Melkor and the Valar interact in Almaren</li>\n<li>Next episode is when he meets the other Valar, the following episode is The Creation Of The Lamps, and the one after is The Destruction Of Lamps)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The next half of the season is more \u201cepisodic\u201d \u2013 self-contained stories in each episode, so it would be good to keep the cast small right now (for these 4 episodes), and save the introductions of the additional characters and side stories for the second half of the season.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Mythgard Announcements</b></h2>\n<a href=\"http://signumuniversity.org/fund/\">Mythgard and Signum University fundraising campaign</a> runs through the month of October\n<ul>\n<li>Jim Butcher (author of the <em>The Dresden Files</em>) interview.\n<ul>\n<li>Talking about his books, as well as the Peter Jackson adaptations and the SilmFilm project.</li>\n<li>October 13 8pm ET</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Our\u00a0Matt Gutting has been retelling the entire Hobbit story in Haiku form on Twitter</li>\n<li>Patrick Rothfuss\u2019s <em>The Name of the Wind</em> is being made into a video game, movie and TV series\u2026this is a good thing to look at in terms of adapting <em>The Silmarillion</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Book Context of this Season</b></h2>\nAinulindal\u00eb/Vala Quenta/Ch. 1-2 Quenta Silmarillion\n<h2><b>Today\u2019s Topic</b></h2>\nHow much of Melkor in Arda are we fixing to do in this episode?\n<ul>\n<li>His arrival in Arda and establishment in Utumno should be it for this episode, focusing on his time in the Void</li>\n<li>Ways he interacts with the other Valar would happen in this episode.</li>\n<li>\u201cThere\u2019s should be only so much scaffolding on screen\u201d (The Valar are creating Arda, no need for too many on-screen construction projects at the same time)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Discussion</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only time to show what Melkor was up to\u2026rejection by Varda and search for FI are the seeds for his fall\n<ul>\n<li>Creates visual challenge (how do we depict the Void?)</li>\n<li>60/40 (Trish) 90/10 (Corey)% would be pre-Music\u2026his attraction to Varda is another expression for his search for the FI (and how would we depict the FI, and how does one convey that desire?)\n<ul>\n<li>They can dialogue about the FI, his words in the conversation can reflect his desire</li>\n<li>Aule \u2013 \u201cmy desire to make things is just me expressing myself\u2026how you (Eru) made me\u2026\u201d</li>\n<li>Melkor to Varda: \u201cDon\u2019t you want to create things?\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Melkor is a loner even on Arda, so some time should spent with him apart from the Valar.\n<ul>\n<li>He is \u201ctinkering\u201d with the edges of creation</li>\n<li>He discovers his degree of power (and adds to his opinion of himself) though Corey feels he already knows his power</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Unfallen Balrogs\u2026they lose their wings when they fall into evil, may look like traditional depictions of archangels\u2026gorgeous, but they\u2019re spirits of flame (which explains why Melkor would want to draw them to him)\n<ul>\n<li>they keep the SHADOW of their wings</li>\n<li><u><b>HW project for those who know Tolkien\u2019s languages:</b></u> Gothmog will not work as a name for the unfallen captain of the Balrogs. His name can change too (we need another name) Bright, shining, radiant angelic figure</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider Sauron\u2019s name change as well \u2013 he has several names (Thu in the Legendarium, Annatar, Mairon)</li>\n<li>Melkor isn\u2019t necessarily about gaining followers, but there are lesser spirits that follow the Valar which are similar to them</li>\n<li>Huge risk - that Melkor may come across as the \u201ctypical\u201d jilted lover turning to evil\u2026being thwarted in his desire for light and power (and his reaction) that leads him down the path to evil\n<ul>\n<li>We can avoid the typical Hollywood \u201creductive\u201d romance if we take that attraction as a metaphor for his desire for light. Don\u2019t leave it as just a \u201cboy-girl love story\u201d but look at how his desire for light is going too far</li>\n<li>Have a Thingol-Melian (Beren-Luthien) moment with Varda in the Void as a parallel.\n<ul>\n<li>A progression of a sort\u2026Varda says no, Melian says yes, but remains who she is, and then Luthien says yes and changes who she is</li>\n<li>Varda is able to see that Melkor has a possessive love/desire, though Melkor thinks his desire is selfless</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fire and light could work together, but light ends up with air, and they supplement each other. Fire and light are more sibling-ish</li>\n<li>Melkor\u2019s fire consumes and casts shadows (and can be blinding), whereas Varda\u2019s light illuminates (and reflects)</li>\n<li>Fire needs air, too (Melkor/Manwe) \u2013 we should get a view of what could have been\u2026how things should have been\n<ul>\n<li>Extremes of heat and cold that Melkor brings about can bring Manw\u00eb and Ulmo (with the different forms of precipitation) closer together</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Visual cues covered by color tropes. (Varda\u2019s light being more silvery white, Melkor\u2019s fire being more orange-red)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How do we get to the Void visually? Do we have Estel and Elrond starting in the Rivendell frame (he can be confused about the Music thing \u2013 he can ask questions like \u201cif Melkor was evil, why did Iluvatar create him?\u201d Elrond: \u201cNothing is evil in the beginning\u201d)\n<ul>\n<li>No \u201cPrincess Bride\u201d type interruptions, but the Estel frame would be convenient. Very little time spent in Rivendell this episode\u2026the episode could start with Estel\u2019s question, and we don\u2019t necessarily need to come back to the frame at the end of the episode</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nOr\n<ul>\n<li>Do we have the story of Melkor and Varda told from Varda\u2019s point of view (perhaps a conversation between Manwe and Varda)\n<ul>\n<li>Wouldn\u2019t it be better to show Melkor doing something, as opposed to having other characters talk about what he\u2019s doing?</li>\n<li>Internal frame problem: what \u201cexcuse\u201d would we have to have this conversation? (\u201cDid you want to hear about my ex?\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s this other guy who\u2019s into me that\u2019s trouble\u2026\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Valar get that Melkor is trouble, but they don\u2019t know to what extent. They\u2019re going to know that it\u2019s the same guy from the \u201cdiscordant music\u201d but they don\u2019t understand the extent of his selfishness/desire.</li>\n<li>We have Elrond\u2019s lessons and Estel\u2019s questions and this can help us get into the story. Parallels would be nice, but may be too distracting (and may end up being reductive)</li>\n<li>Melkor (or anyone) wouldn't have a corporeal body in the Void.\n<ul>\n<li>Viewing from Melkor\u2019s eyes? Gets rid of Melkor\u2019s corporeal body, but doesn\u2019t eliminate Varda\u2019s</li>\n<li>Viewers enjoy chemistry between actors and the way they deliver lines. It would be harder to depict this without actors on screen.</li>\n<li>Scenes of 2 different shades of light would be too abstract/boring. They still need to look like people</li>\n<li>Aule should look like a Dwarf\u2026their image is derived by his (inaccurate) idea of the Children of Iluvatar)</li>\n<li>We would need Valar that can be depicted by actors with makeup\u2026so maybe they wouldn\u2019t have to look so different in the Void.\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe the actors could be translucent/ghostly so the actor could be identified but we get the idea that they\u2019re more \u201cspirit\u201d and less \u201cbody\u201d</li>\n<li>Why would being banished to the Void be a torture for Melkor in the future? \u2013 maybe b/c nothing is tangible</li>\n<li>There is a dwelling of Iluvatar (a place) and Melkor goes out to the Void\n<ul>\n<li>Varda and Melkor might be in the dwelling of Iluvatar when she rejects him</li>\n<li>Maybe the Void isn\u2019t black\u2026maybe it\u2019s more misty and grey and foggy\n<ul>\n<li>We don\u2019t want a cheesy Mt.

It is not the bodies of the protagonists, because The Valar don\u2019t have bodies.\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cBut are they going to survive? Are they going to make it out of this one?\u201d is the sort of question we usually see, but they don\u2019t apply to Valar.</li>\n<li>What\u2019s at stake for them is \u201cHow does Arda turn out and does it follow with what Iluvatar wants?\u201d\n<ul>\n<li>Even tho they are immortal, things can go badly and they can still screw up.</li>\n<li>\u201cWill the world turn out well or not?\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same immediacy/ability to build a cliffhanger.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Are they going to succeed or fail? Putting them in physical danger somehow doesn\u2019t work as well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are differences in relationship of the body and mind in the Valar, vs the relationship of the body and mind of the Elves, and how that is still different from the relationship of body and mind of Men.\n<ul>\n<li>We need to make it clear to our viewers the difference between them, and that it retroactively works.</li>\n<li>Maybe let\u2019s not mention the imperviousness of the Valar to the viewer????????</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Metaphorical danger: When Nessa is captured by Ungoliant, it\u2019s not going to be about torture, as it\u2019s not really the issue with the Valar.</li>\n<li>They can\u2019t be stabbed with a knife and hurt, but they can be corrupted in spirit\u2026how suffering wounds people.</li>\n<li>Even Melian has to go for a prolonged timeout after the death of Thingol, and retreats to Lorien. She needs time to recover and grieve, and she needs to heal.\n<ul>\n<li>Suffering (the way the Valar suffer when the Trees are lost) \u2013 can Nessa be tormented and hurt?</li>\n<li>Corruption \u2013 will Nessa become \u201ctwisted\u201d, so that she ends up falling?</li>\n<li>There can be a physical correlation to illustrate what\u2019s being done metaphorically</li>\n<li>When they rescue her, it\u2019s about helping her through out of her spiritual crisis, but this comes across as \u201chokey\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Valar having bodies exposes them to different temptations than they would have without them.\n<ul>\n<li>The more time you spend in your body, the more attached to it you become and will want to protect it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Valar are bound to Arda. (We\u2019re going to depict them changing their bodies when the Elves come) They can walk about without their bodies if they want, but they are committed to Arda, so they keep in their bodies more than they aren\u2019t, as they need to interact physically with Arda. But their bodies change.</li>\n<li>Re: Melkor\u2019s and Sauron\u2019s weakening of their power with the increased investment in matter: they are desiring to dominate Arda, so they distribute their power in the effort to dominate/relate to things other than themselves.</li>\n<li>They do need their bodies to interact with the world.</li>\n<li>We have sequence of events when compared to the book without acknowledging it: specifically, the order of the plants and animals correlates with the lighting of the lamps.\n<ul>\n<li>There can be light without their being a sun in the sky and without the lamps. Almaren must have had some sort of light (and not be completely pitch black).</li>\n<li>We have starlight, and we can have some animals, and perhaps fungi/white forest plants that aren\u2019t dependent on light</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why make lamps in the first place? The Valar have been shaping the world for quite some time, so it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to do all this in the dark, there had to have been light to work by.</li>\n<li>The sky itself is like gloomyish dusk\u2026a low-level light, you can see perfectly well even though it\u2019s dim. Stunted plants can grow, but not necessarily trees or flowers.</li>\n<li>The desire to build lamps can be flawed from the beginning. The collecting of the light into the lamps creates this blissful paradise, but they\u2019re hoarding the light into a smaller space, creating darkness in other corners of the world. (And this could be Melkor\u2019s idea) Middle Earth won\u2019t benefit as much as Almaren (a well-intentioned misstep)</li>\n<li>References to \u201cliquid light\u201d (Ungoliant drinking it, pools) in the Book of Lost Tales.</li>\n<li>The cool thing about this project is that we have to think about details on a level beyond what Tolkien has done so far. The shaping of the land takes some time in the Ainulindal\u00eb, but when we start the Quenta, there isn\u2019t much said about creation. Fleshing the world out to this extent wasn\u2019t part of his project, but it\u2019s part of THIS project.</li>\n<li>Every decision has consequences, and they don\u2019t always anticipate what will happen. Great goodness can come about, but also great \u201cevil\u201d and often both together. Now there is darkness for which Ungoliant can hide. This is a pattern among the Valar</li>\n<li>Then when they dim the lamps, they can see the stars for the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Mythgard Announcements</b></h2>\nThanks for participating in the fundraising campaign, we raised $37k for Signum.

Manw\u00eb doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d evil, but we don\u2019t want to undermine him or make him look stupid\u2026(Maybe a little na\u00efve) but he wouldn\u2019t be against it.\n<ol>\n<li>Melkor might think this is actually a good idea and be coming from a \u201csincere\u201d place\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>His conflict with them is that he thinks he should be the king, not necessarily that he\u2019s outright evil. The discord was his striving to bring more glory to his part of the Music.</li>\n<li>Melkor\u2019s actually in a happy place when he comes up with the idea of the lamps \u2013 everyone sees how awesome he is, and he knows it.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>This is the \u201cfirst seed\u201d of Melkor hoarding light.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>He expects authority and worship from the others. He sees the lamps as his property</li>\n<li>He sees Almaren and the other Valar as his property as well. Or at least something he has dominion over and to which he is entitled.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Melkor is the \u201chappy good light\u201d guy, while Ungoliant is taking light and transforming it into darkness (a more obvious \u201cbaddie\u201d)\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>The lighting of the lamps can coincide with the rescue of Nessa, or</li>\n<li>The lamps can be used to help find Nessa</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ulmo should counsel against it, and Varda should be uncomfortable with it. Varda is uncomfortable b/c she has experience with Melkor being a creepy dude. Ulmo is the one who usually goes against the rest of the Valar as he\u2019s usually suspicious.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>They were only given ONE part of the mind of Iluvatar, so their understanding is limited. They don\u2019t have the wisdom of evil b/c they don\u2019t understand that part of Iluvatar\u2019s mind. It\u2019s ok for them to be a bit clueless.</li>\n<li>Varda had experience in Episode 2 with Melkor that leads her to think that Melkor\u2019s motivations are less than good.</li>\n<li>Ulmo would just be suspicious of the idea\u2026what about the rest of Arda? He\u2019s the one that stays in Middle Earth and hangs out with the Children, away from Valinor\n<ol>\n<li>With the creation of the lamps, there is now a hierarchical structure: some places will have more light (and blessing) than others.</li>\n<li>This is unjust.

She doesn\u2019t have to be a stereotypical wuss. (Swifter than the deer)</li>\n<li>In Tolkien\u2019s world, females may be few, but they aren\u2019t weak. But feminine strength isn\u2019t about brawn. Beating someone up isn\u2019t the only way to demonstrate strength, but in modern tales, the only way a woman is strong is to be more manly than men (which plays to our traditional stereotypes about strength). <u>This can be an opportunity to depict strength in a non-stereotypic way.</u></li>\n<li>The problem with the \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d is that she is now merely an object for the hero and the villain to fight over.\n<ol>\n<li>Where is Nessa\u2019s Equality with Tulkas in all this?\n<ol>\n<li>She doesn\u2019t need to be as strong or kick as much butt, but have other strengths that are equal to his</li>\n<li>Their strengths should be complementary.

What is the scenario for how the lamps are destroyed, and how does that come about? 2 models from Tolkien:\n\n<strong>First</strong>\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s the Festival when Melkor comes in and destroys the lamps. An open act of war by an openly evil villain. (published Silmarillion). They don\u2019t know that he\u2019s there all the time, but when they do, they recognize (eventually) that he\u2019s evil.\n\n<strong>Second</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Melkor is contributing with the rest of the Valar. He constructs the pillars for the lamps out of ice, setting them up for failure. He dupes them\u2026so when the lamps are destroyed, he is laughing at duping them (book of lost tales) The Valar look more foolish in the Book of Lost Tales that they do in the Silmarillion.\n<ul>\n<li>Do we want to revisit Estel, Elrond and Gilraen? How many episodes can we go without seeing them? (Estel: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Nessa just evaporate herself?\u201d but don\u2019t want to get too \u201cPrincess Bride-y\u201d)\n<ul>\n<li>How does the current story connect with the frame? If there\u2019s no good connection/relevance to Estel\u2019s story, then we shouldn\u2019t \u201cshoe horn\u201d the frame.</li>\n<li>Brief visit with the frame at the end of episode 5 or beginning of the episode 6 to help create a sense of time. Elrond can begin by saying \u201cAfter much time passed\u2026\u201d but this could be cheesy.</li>\n<li>Tension between Gilraen and Elrond was paralleling the tension in the story, so this might be a good time to briung the tension back in at this time, as the tensions are building between the Valar and Melkor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who does the actual destruction? Melkor or the proto-Balrogs?\n<ul>\n<li>We could have a nod to the ice pillar idea (even if we don\u2019t actually use ice), as Melkor and Sauron could be working together on making the pillars.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What is the fallout from this? Options:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Most of the Valar think that Melkor is still one of them and don\u2019t connect him with the destruction</li>\n<li>They might be uneasy\u2026where there was some uneasiness before, there might be more now, but no open \u201crebellion\u201d</li>\n<li>It can be associated with Melkor if proto-Balrogs are the ones who destroy them, but Melkor can still have some sort of plausible deniability</li>\n<li>They can all assume that Melkor did it and they openly accuse him</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Total ignorance seems unlikely (option 1)\u2026Maybe Melkor might disappear when/after the destruction of the lamps, and perhaps the other Valar might think that that something bad happen to him. They might suspect Ungoliant did it, b/c we know she\u2019s evil.\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Melkor destroys the lamps in a fit of pique, and so he storms off.</li>\n<li>Some may think \u201cwe need to watch out for him\u201d b/c he wants to rule everything, but Nienna might be like \u201che might be suffering and needs compassion.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The moment of the destruction of the lamps might be the turning point for the Balrogs (they get their wings physically burned off).\n<ul>\n<li>The Balrogs might actually be sensitive about the \u201cwing thing.\u201d</li>\n<li>Perhaps the Balrogs take the \u201cevil\u201d form to perform the destruction, but they can\u2019t change back.</li>\n<li>Their physical marring can be their immediate consequence, rather than an external punishment befalling them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Melkor doesn\u2019t become Morgoth for a while yet, but he\u2019s still changing, and this is a turning point for him and his relationship with the Valar. He may try to fake his \u201cgoodness\u201d but he\u2019s no longer \u201chonestly good.\u201d He still doesn\u2019t think of himself as evil, he\u2019s rather the injured party. (\u201cThe others don\u2019t know what\u2019s *good.*)\n<ul>\n<li>The Balrogs would fall of their own will, and this would be a changing point for them. They can be a symbol/visual cue for Melkor. They would be making the choice to fall.</li>\n<li>Melkor may be ranting about how the other Valar don\u2019t respect him and how the lamps belong to him and not the others, and how they aren\u2019t worthy of them, and Gothmog would call a meeting with the Balrogs and says \u201cour Master has been slighted, so we should do something about it.\u201d Arien may rebel at this moment from participating, and we watch her leave for Almaren to tell the others what the Balrogs did.</li>\n<li>What we saw happen in the music (the discord starting with Melkor) would be reflected here. Melkor may feel a little regret (not quite repentant, but sorry to hear this happened)</li>\n<li>There could be ambiguity here\u2026the Balrogs could have been trying to hoard the light for themselves. Uncertainty about their form (is this shadow and flame their true form, or something that they\u2019re imprisoned in?)</li>\n<li>Gothmog at the end would tell Melkor what they did, and he may smile and say \u201cexcellent,\u201d opening up the possibility that Melkor ultimately wanted them to do this in the first place, illustrating that he\u2019s corrupting other beings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What are the consequences of this event? Melkor\u2019s attitude is \u201cIf I can\u2019t have them, then nobody can have them.\u201d Feeling disrespected.</li>\n<li>The building of the lamps is the crowning glory of creation. The Valar can look at the world with the lamps lit and enjoy what they see and be like \u201cWell, this is it! We\u2019ve done it.\u201d And Melkor would be like \u201cNow my rule begins.\u201d</li>\n<li>Episode 6 is the turning point of this season\u2026up until this point, most things were trending upwards and looking pretty positive.\n<ul>\n<li>Melkor and the other Valar not seeing eye to eye on who\u2019s in charge. (conflict with Melkor and Manw\u00eb, and not being comfortable with Melkor\u2019s dreams, and thus Melkor starts feeling slighted. Maybe Varda says something that upsets Melkor and he grows more spiteful.)</li>\n<li>The viewers (as well as the Valar) could be surprised that the lamps have been sabotaged\n<ul>\n<li>Q: Are we diminishing the lamps by building them initially flawed? If there is a discordant note at the end of Episode 5, then there never is the *perfection*\n<ul>\n<li>Remember from last time that the flaw/folly with the lamps is that even though it\u2019s immediately brighter where they are, there is now more darkness. (the light is no longer evenly distributed)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Also, Arda is already marred from Melkor\u2019s discord. We can still have the \u201cparadise lost\u201d moment, though it\u2019s not a perfect paradise.</li>\n<li>The concentration of light in the lamps now has a destructive effect, so that when the lamps are destroyed, the molten, liquid light is destructive and molten, and a burning destruction is released. (Melkorian destruction)</li>\n<li>Where in the Silmarillion do we see something purely good being destroyed? The trees.</li>\n<li>The trees and the lamps are connected. Season 2 is the Darkening of Valinor, so we will be anticipating that in this episode.</li>\n<li>The lamps can be beautifully crafted\u2026a beautifully executed bad idea</li>\n<li>We\u2019ll be anticipating Ungoliant sucking the light out of the Trees.\n<ul>\n<li>We could have some audio only pitch darkness at crucial moments to convey the shock of the total darkness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Summary and Decisions</b></h2>\nDidn\u2019t really have a decision discussion.\n<h3><b>Closing</b></h3>\n<b>Questions for Season 1, Session 9</b>\n\n12/4: There is at least one question we have to ask each episode\n<ul>\n<li>What is the story arc for the next episode? / How much of the story are we going to get through in the episode?</li>\n<li>What other longer term bits do we want to introduce/plant seeds for future episodes?</li>\n</ul>\nFor next episode:\n<ul>\n<li>How should the relationship between Melkor and the Valar progress?

He hasn\u2019t openly declared himself as an enemy of the Valar, but is actively working in opposition, but they don\u2019t realize it.</li>\n<li>What do the Valar think?\n<ul>\n<li>Some may suspect Melkor more than others.</li>\n<li>There could be confusion amongst the Valar (like this may be tied to Oss\u00eb), though Oss\u00eb\u2019s rebellion is an effect, rather than a cause\n<ul>\n<li>His rebellion will have more power if he\u2019s not immediately tied to this.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t want to make Oss\u00eb a red herring. He should be the centerpiece of his rebellion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If there\u2019s doubt, who else would be a possible culprit? Is Melkor the only one?\n<ul>\n<li>We could say the Balrogs went rogue, but that would require some explanation.</li>\n<li>There is little mystery about what happened. More importantly, Why? and What does it mean?</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t have \u201cevil\u201d yet. The only one who\u2019s presented as a villain at this point is Ungoliant.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nessa maybe shouldn\u2019t even be captured \u2013 she would just start hanging out with Ungoliant b/c the idea of evil hasn\u2019t crossed anyone\u2019s mind. She would see how they\u2019re similar but not see the bad.\n<ul>\n<li>How na\u00efve do we make the Valar? They remember the discord of the music, but they might not have knowledge of what that means.\n<ul>\n<li>Melkor could be come off as \u201cI don\u2019t know why the Balrogs did that, I\u2019m not in control of them\u201d</li>\n<li>They only know the part of Iluvatar\u2019s mind from which they came, so they won\u2019t understand what the discord is about</li>\n<li>If no one witnesses what happened, Arien can be like \u201cThe rest of the Balrogs are going to do this!\u201d and the Valar wouldn\u2019t understand why. Then it happens, and Melkor (who has been keeping himself distant) could claim that Arien was the one that went bad. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame about Arien. My beautiful Balrogs were damaged by Arien\u2019s rebellion.\u201d</li>\n<li>Does the audience know? Does the audience feel that Melkor can be redeemed?\n<ul>\n<li>He may feel like a relatable villain to modern viewers. We\u2019re not trying to undermine his evil, but the point is to do justice to the complexity of Tolkien\u2019s moral landscape.</li>\n<li>Tolkien invites us to sympathise with the bad guys (walking down the path with good intentions).</li>\n<li>If we have people cheering for Melkor against the Valar, we have failed.</li>\n<li>The Valar <u><b>mourn</b></u> for the marring of F\u00ebanor, and we can try to evoke the same thing for Melkor.</li>\n<li>He errs of the side of self-righteousness, rather than doing evil things b/c they\u2019re \u201cfun\u201d</li>\n<li>We also don\u2019t want Elrond confusing Estel with the story telling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mairon/Sauron could be \u201cdrinking in\u201d all of this and getting how Melkor feels.\n<ul>\n<li>We don\u2019t want him to be too prominent too quickly.</li>\n<li>We know that Melkor will eventually promote Mairon to first lieutenant\u2026he may be more of an easter egg for right now.\n<ul>\n<li>Astute viewers will recognize him immediately, but others end up learning 8 seasons later that he\u2019s actually Sauron.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sauron was less evil only b/c he served another (Melkor) for a long time (submission)\n<ul>\n<li>Defector from Aul\u00eb to Melkor</li>\n<li>Mairon could defect when Aul\u00eb repents, being upset that he submits.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t meet Sauron till Beren and Luthien.

What are their domains?\u201d may be interrupting the other storytelling that we\u2019ve been doing up to this point</li>\n<li>How much time can we realistically spend on the establishment of Valinor without losing the audience\u2019s attention?\n<ul>\n<li>Estel could be nodding off while Elrond is talking, making a joke about that getting kind of tedious \uf04a</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\u201cA closer look at a representative sample\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If we spend time with Lorien, Nienna and Mandos, we can introduce Olorin, Est\u00eb and others who serve/work with them.\n<ul>\n<li>Now that Almaren has burned, Nienna has something to cry about (!!!)</li>\n<li>Yavanna and V\u00e1na can help make the gardens (save for the next episode with the Trees) and Nienna will be involved with that as well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What other characters do we need to introduce?\n<ul>\n<li>The most common ones were Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast (with Yavanna and Aul\u00eb)</li>\n<li>Orom\u00eb \u2013 though he is the one who discovers the Elves, so he\u2019ll have his episode. But we don\u2019t want him to be a total stranger either.</li>\n<li>Huan (and who is he? He is the Hound of Valinor\u2026is he a Maia who chose the form of a dog?) We can make up our minds but not need to explain it in dialogue.\n<ul>\n<li>Our depiction of Huan could spark internet debates about whether or not he\u2019s a SuperDog or a Maia. Will there be Deer of Valinor? Horses of Valinor? Does he have a pack? He may ne a member (though not a leader) of Orom\u00eb\u2019s pack</li>\n<li>Is Shadowfax of this line? Yes (we don\u2019t need to be explicit about it)</li>\n<li>The Noldor should bring some horses with them from Valinor</li>\n<li>We can just show that Orom\u00eb with his pack to establish the idea for the time being. The Noldor in Season 2 can be riding with Orom\u00eb\n<ul>\n<li>When Huan turns against Celegorm, the viewers should be emotional/upset b/c of how far Celegorm has fallen. Huan can grieve\u2026being Celegorm\u2019s conscience/ \u201cJiminy Cricket\u201d</li>\n<li>Celegorm steps forward to speak the oath, and we can see Huan\u2019s reaction.</li>\n<li>The moment Huan leaves, he has concluded that Celegorm is no longer redeemable</li>\n<li>Getting to know Huan throughout all this will definitely make his death that much more tragic</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Melkor\u2019s trajectory: we need to have some kind of map (how do we get from here to the war at the end of the season?)\n<ul>\n<li>There should be tension\u2026some of the Valar should suspect Melkor\u2026but not all of them. Other Valar may suspect others</li>\n<li>The theme is discord.</li>\n<li>There\u2019s conflict, tension, chaos. The Valar (especially Manw\u00eb) think this can be reconciled and reestablish order and peace. (manifestation of discord in the Music)\n<ul>\n<li>In some cases, this will work. Aul\u00eb is about to go off track, but comes back</li>\n<li>Oss\u00eb rebels, but comes back</li>\n<li>Manw\u00eb still thinks Melkor is just another one of those things that can be fixed. The thing that happens is the recognition is they actually have to fight Melkor\n<ul>\n<li>Manw\u00eb will feel like this is giving into discord, and the idea of establishing peace through violence</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Musically, the discord should be in the soundtrack.</li>\n<li>When does he go to Utumno? Melkor will see he has followers and offer them an alternative to going to Valinor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>End Episode 6 with Arien rushing in to where the other Valar are to warn them about the attack on the lamps</li>\n<li>Begin with the Destruction of Almaren from the Valar\u2019s point of view and talk about\n<ul>\n<li>What just happened?</li>\n<li>What do we need to do here?</li>\n<li>Arien is pointing the finger at Melkor and vice versa</li>\n<li>Ulmo was already speaking against Melkor before, so he could be blamed as well (and we had already set up Ulmo as an opponent for Melkor anyway)</li>\n<li>Tulkas likely suspects Melkor, and probably wants to challenge him to a fight on the spot</li>\n<li>Manw\u00eb ultimately says \u201clet\u2019s build a place together, as we\u2019ve been too separate. We need to establish peace\u201d (which is ironic, as they establish their own domains)</li>\n<li>To go to Valinor is to leave Middle-earth. This introduces a split. Melkor would be against this and would want to establish a stronger kingdom as in Middle-earth. We can build New Almaren (Utumno)\n<ul>\n<li>Melkor is right for the wrong reasons. He\u2019s trying to establish his own kingdom but he\u2019s not wrong in saying that leaving is escapism.</li>\n<li>Melkor is forcing a choice between himself and Manw\u00eb (and he becomes more bitter as most choose to follow Manw\u00eb)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Setting up for the Valar\u2019s next mistake of bringing the Elves</li>\n<li>Tulkas is becoming increasingly restless (\u201cAre we just going to leave Middle-earth to Melkor?\u201d) while Ulmo is like \u201cRemember that ALL of Middle-earth is our charge, not just Almaren\u201d\n<ul>\n<li>We need to be careful that we don\u2019t make Melkor \u201csuperwise.\u201d We can craft his speech to show that dominion is what he\u2019s after.</li>\n<li>The Valar do the wrong thing for the right reasons whilst Melkor does the right thing for the wrong reasons</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Valinor needs to be visually constructed, as well as Utumno</li>\n<li>Where do Orcs come from? Season 2. The Elves should have no more than 30 sec this season.</li>\n<li>Valinorian subplot? Perhaps the subplot can begin in Episode 7 and finish in Episode 8\n<ul>\n<li>For next episode, Trees would involve Nienna and Yavanna, so we could have a subplot going on at the same time</li>\n<li>Establish L\u00f3rien and Mandos\u2026show what these domains are like as an illustrative example.\n<ul>\n<li>Irmo is about peace, healing and recuperation, so he \u201chasn\u2019t had anything to do\u201d until now. For the first time, there are wounds, so L\u00f3rien (and Valinor) are a place of peace and harmony.</li>\n<li>Namo is justice and fate.</li>\n<li>Nienna is pity and mourning.</li>\n<li>These 3 didn\u2019t have a role per se until Almaren falls.</li>\n<li>Vair\u00eb (Namo\u2019s wife) never speaks. She only speaks through her weavings. She\u2019s the one who has the visions of the future and weaves them into the tapestries, which hang in Mandos\u2019 halls. Namo studies them with her and decrees his dooms based on Vair\u00eb\u2019s prophetic visions.\n<ul>\n<li>Her insight into the future aren\u2019t storyboards of history\u2026they see the big picture and translate the Music</li>\n<li>They wouldn\u2019t contain \u201cspoilers\u201d \u2013 they would be symbolic and require interpretation (rather than representational)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We can divide episode 8 between the Trees and the F\u00ebanturi.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We can also spend some time with the framestory, as we got away from it the last few episodes.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t have the same momentum of storyline that we did the last few, so we have passage of time happening, and separating that with the frame would fit.</li>\n<li>Establish parallel here\u2026Gilraen and her tension with Elrond.\n<ul>\n<li>Thorin\u2019s company should arrive with the telling of Aul\u00eb and the creation of the Dwarves</li>\n<li>The Valar retreating to Valinor parallels with Rivendell as a safe haven. Gilraen can be like \u201cAnd what have you done against the enemy while my husband died in battle against them?\u201d And Elrond would be like \u201cI\u2019m doing a lot more than you can even understand\u201d</li>\n<li>Galadriel\u2019s line \u201cFor it is not only by the strings of Elvish bows that this land is defended\u201d can basically be spoken by Elrond.</li>\n<li>It may well be a parallel, but it isn\u2019t the same situation.</li>\n<li>\u201cWhat have the Valar done for us humans? They just hide in their blessed realm. They may have cared for the elves, but they haven\u2019t done anything for us.\u201d\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cJust because you can\u2019t see what they\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d</li>\n<li>Gilraen is right, but she doesn\u2019t see the big picture either. She feels that Elrond is disconnected from the world.</li>\n<li>They\u2019re both right and they\u2019re both wrong, and they can come to a greater wisdom by having this discussion (Like Andreth and Finrod\u2019s debate)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Summary and Decisions</b></h2>\nDidn\u2019t really have a decision discussion, but key things highlighted\n<h2><b>Closing</b></h2>\n<b>Questions for Season 1, Session 10:</b>\n\n12/18: There is at least one question we have to ask each episode\n<ul>\n<li>What is the story arc for the next episode? / How much of the story are we going to get through in the episode?</li>\n<li>What other longer term bits do we want to introduce/plant seeds for future episodes?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For next episode:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Growth of the Trees.

We want to come up with a logical sequence of events.\n<ul>\n<li>Varda and the stars should be episode 12 (the establishment of the great constellations should happen with the awakening of the Elves) so Oss\u00eb's rebellion (in which Melkor is involved), Aul\u00eb and the Dwarves, and Yavanna and the Ents, and the defection of Sauron to Melkor happen prior.</li>\n<li>How are we progressing along to the War to Begin All Wars?\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the Valar distrust Melkor, others don't.</li>\n<li>We could make it look like Oss\u00eb is gone for good at the end of the episode.</li>\n<li>Sauron could defect at the same time.</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb disobeys but repents, \"the bad boys episode\" (we should never miss an opportunity for a cliffhanger)\n<ul>\n<li>It could look like everything is going to hell bc of the trouble Melkor has caused.</li>\n<li>If the stories overlap, it can really look like a crisis for the Valar and everything is falling apart.\n<ul>\n<li>At that point, Melkor isn't the only issue. There are other problems with Oss\u00eb, Aul\u00eb, and Sauron.</li>\n<li>Manw\u00eb and Varda seek harmony and order, and he may want to keep trying to reach out to Melkor to bring things back in line, and it finally comes to an \"alien,\" tragic, loss type conclusion that they need to go to war by the end of the season.</li>\n<li>These other rebellions begin to look like an epidemic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb may begin making the Dwarves in fear that the Children may not come.\n<ul>\n<li>In the book it says that Aul\u00eb made them to oppose Melkor.</li>\n<li>They're designed to be \"weapons\" against the chaos.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We can show parallels with the rebellions, and the nuances between them as foils for each other and foils for Melkor to show different stages/aspects of the path of discord.</li>\n<li>It's difficult to depict unfallen, angelic beings. What does it mean to be totally free of sinful inclination and yet have free will to choose.\n<ul>\n<li>Aul\u00eb is a wonderful example of showing it's not just a black and white deal. He has good intentions and could go in a bad direction but repents. It's not just about being flawed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We need to have at least one scene in Utumno and want to show the visual contrast between Utumno and Valimar. Utumno should be genuinely beautiful, but not understated, and yet not gaudy/tacky.\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe Aul\u00eb can visit Melkor in Utumno\n<ul>\n<li>Aul\u00eb's rebellion should be bc he opposes Melkor, not bc he is seduced by Melkor's words.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Or maybe it's Manw\u00eb that goes to Melkor's throne to try to work things out. He is really trying to keep things together and very reluctant to go to war.\n<ul>\n<li>He doesn't need to look like a doofus...he's thinking of the collateral damage of the world as a result of the war.</li>\n<li>As Manw\u00eb is the King, it's typical for him to look regal, but in comparison to Melkor, his rainments would look simpler. He would look out of place in Utumno. Manw\u00eb is more humble.</li>\n<li>Who does Manw\u00eb see besides Melkor? The Balrogs are too ugly now, and would be suspicious to Manw\u00eb.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some of the Balrogs were missed when Utumno was destroyed. He may have contempt for the other fallen creatures (\"I'm not like them\"). But maybe other Maiar went with Melkor, as all the Valar went to Valinor.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the Balrogs are in the \"basement\" - After Melkor and Sauron fall, they can't take on beautiful forms any longer, and so it should be with the Balrogs.</li>\n<li>Utumno is beautiful but empty. Melkor meets Manw\u00eb at the door, and gives him a tour, and only his voice echoes back.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There's no actual ban against going to Middle-earth.\n<ul>\n<li>Yavanna and Orom\u00eb will continue going there without having to \"sneak off\" but the idea of going to Valinor is for protection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Trees...\n<ul>\n<li>What we see are the fruits of these choices.\n<ul>\n<li>What happens in Valinor is the beauty of the trees, and peace and harmony, light and hope is sheltered here in Valinor.</li>\n<li>The Valar don't feel any competition with Melkor, but Melkor feels competition with them, and wants the Valar to feel ashamed of their place.</li>\n<li>Pride and envy, which become anger, bring forth the monsters in Middle-earth. The beasts can just appear. We don't need show them being created.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Tulkas, Orom\u00eb and Huan can be hunting in Middle-earth, and they fight and kill the monsters.\n<ul>\n<li>This would be the first time we have \"bulk\" corpses. Carnivores already exist, but this would be the first time there would be a field of corpses (deer, for instance). The fight with Ungoliant didn't shed any blood.</li>\n<li>We can have them talking about what they're seeing, and show the differences between their characters.</li>\n<li>We can look more at the horror of the slaughter and what it means, rather than focusing on CGI violence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>F\u00ebanturi: we want to highlight Nienna's role in the planting of the Trees.\n<ul>\n<li>Yavanna's song is still what creates them, but Nienna's tears water them. (She does not weep for herself, and those who learn from her learn pity.)</li>\n<li>Nienna's is still mourning the marring of Arda, and she goes to Yavanna, and from that mourning are tears of hope.</li>\n<li>Nienna is not just sad. We have to be selective in the actress that plays her bc it's a complex range of emotion.</li>\n<li>The tears of hope can tie back into the frame and it ties into Estel, who's listening to the story.</li>\n<li>And in this moment, the rest of the Valar \"get\" Nienna.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We can begin this episode with the beauty of Valimar and the rest of the Valar celebrating, whilst Nienna weeps. Tulkas maybe like \"um...dude?\"\n<ul>\n<li>Just as Gilraen talks of giving hope to the Dunedain, Nienna can talk of giving hope to Valimar.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The rest of the Valar can be celebrating Yavanna's accomplishment, but Lorien and Mandos would be the ones appreciating Nienna's contribution (as well as the audience)\n<ul>\n<li>The division of who's celebrating Yavanna vs appreciating Nienna can point to the disunity to come (leading to the rebellions of Aul\u00eb, Oss\u00eb, and Sauron)</li>\n<li>Namo, Irmo, Est\u00eb and Vair\u00eb might already be in Valinor (building Mandos and Lorien, respectively) when the rest of the Valar go there but we don't want them to NOT be in Almaren, which would be good at the end of Episode 7.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Final shot of episode 8 \u2013 the 2 trees are glowing, and then pan to Melkor looking down from Utumno, looking at the 2 trees, and the reflection of the 2 trees are in his eyes (foreshadowing the moment that he and Ungoliant look at the trees before attacking them) and the trees</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nQuestions for next time: January 8\n<ul>\n<li>How should we handle the elements of the next episode?</li>\n<li>What are we doing?\n<ul>\n<li>Do we want to do Aul\u00eb first (with the Dwarves)?</li>\n<li>Or do we do Sauron and Oss\u00eb in parallel?</li>\n<li>Or do we integrate all 3?</li>\n<li>Yavanna has to happen after Aul\u00eb.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>And how does this all relate to Melkor, and where is he in all these?</li>\n<li>The war episode is the last of the season (the war to begin all wars)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nReading for next episode:\n\nCh. 1 Quenta!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTh\u00e9oden was described as being like Orom\u00eb, so maybe we want to have a scene where Orom\u00eb might remind the viewer of Th\u00e9oden in some way (appearance or some sort of parallel...a sort of LOTR Easter Egg).", "duration": "1:44:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/77/7b/e1777be6-7c43-baa2-c782-e8f6791c4b47/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.podcast/TolkienProf/TolkienProf299.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Tolkien", "Olsen", "Mythgard", "LOTRO"]}, {"seriesId": 320513707, "seriesTitle": "The Tolkien Professor", "pubDate": 1452625099, "title": "SilmFilm Episode 1-11: Episode 9: the Fall of the House of Ainur (sort of), Part the First", "author": "Corey Olsen", "summary": "<h2>Introduction/Review</h2>\nApologies for delays in posting - website is under redesign with more features, etc. but we have added more Signum personnel to help with the \"backstage\" end of production.\n\nMythmoot will now be every other year, but 3-4 days instead of a day and a half.\n\nComments from last time:\n\n1) Going back to The Lamps: \"the lamps being a 'bad idea' is a bad idea\"\n<ul>\n<li>This is supposed to be the Spring of Arda, and making the Valar selfish at this point cheapens the idea, and makes their \"fall\" with going to Valinor makes it redundant.</li>\n<li>If we did it right, it would be a foreshadowing.\n<ul>\n<li>The lamps would show the beginning of the impulse to do the wrong thing for the right reasons</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What was the status of light prior to the lamps?\n<ul>\n<li>If the light was already there, did making the lamps suck it up and create dark corners?</li>\n<li>Did they make the lamps for the benefit of a select few?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Having the lamps (they're still in Middle-earth) creates a \"warm bright center with dark edges\"\n<ul>\n<li>With Valinor, they go to the edge and wall off the light, leaving the rest of the world dark</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The text says the lamps are in the extreme edges, and can work in a mythic concept, but in a visual medium (and physics-wise) doesn't work, thus the idea of moving the lamps to the middle of the world</li>\n<li>Tolkien's solar system (flat earth with a tunnel) was first Elvish myth, but later on, changed it as the Valar and Elves would recognize the astronomical plausibility, so then he decided it was a myth of Men.\n<ul>\n<li>Tolkien's later years were less spent storytelling and more time fact correcting</li>\n<li>The flat earth discussion will be tabled for when we get to the rise of the Sun and Moon (season 3, 2018)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n2) Visit of Manw\u00eb to Melkor.

We want to come up with a logical sequence of events.\n<ul>\n<li>We have 3 rebellions to deal with.</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb should be saved for the end (anticipating the Children/Yavanna's response)</li>\n<li>Things are bad enough with 2 of the Maiar rebelling, but now one of the Valar, too? This looks like a real crisis.</li>\n<li>Creation of the Ents as a response to Aule's creation\n<ul>\n<li>Mairon could tempt Aul\u00eb into doing what he does, with the viewers knowing that he has already fallen (or, at least, on his way).</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb's rebellion can transition into Yavanna and the Ents, rather than being an afterthought (if it happened before or concurrent with the others).</li>\n<li>Sauron's fall isn't going to be like Anakin Skywalker's relatively instant transition...it would be the beginning of a slow fall. It should be gradual.\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps falls in secret (serving as a double agent, staying with Aul\u00eb in Valinor).</li>\n<li>His fall affects the world the most, so drawing it out would be more effective.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Aule's fall would be the most serious transgression so it'll be the most dramatic to have last.</li>\n<li>Oss\u00eb would look most like a petulant teenager. His rebellion will be the loudest.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We need to plan out their fall plot lines individually, and then fit them together for the episodes. We'd likely have a \"rebellion arc\" of episodes 9-10 and likely 11. We can work on sequence of events next time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Dwarves should be troublesome because of Aul\u00eb's actions. We as readers have become attached to certain Dwarves, but if you come from the Silmarillion, you see that they were always a troublesome lot.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Melkor's rebellion is caused by his pride leading to resentment, shifting towards malice. We don't want him to a cackling baddie just yet.\n<ul>\n<li>Anakin's fall was more \"embrace evil because evil is powerful,\" rather than doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nSauron/Mairon's rebellion\n<ul>\n<li>The one redeeming thing about Mairon is that he remained true to his master.\n<ul>\n<li>The same sorts of things that attracted Melkor would attract Sauron.</li>\n<li>Some kind of dissatisfaction based on restrictions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Part of why he goes bad is because of misplaced loyalty (he's mad that Aul\u00eb supports Manw\u00eb and not Melkor)</li>\n<li>He likes Utumno better than Valinor.\n<ul>\n<li>He might admire Melkor's courage for standing against the rest</li>\n<li>He could see Manw\u00eb's humility as a sign of weakness</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Melkor is into dominating the wills of others, but with Sauron that's less the case. There is a element of humility in serving Melkor, though it would not be selfless.\n<ul>\n<li>If he acts as a double agent in Valinor, it's because he thinks it's the right thing to do.</li>\n<li>Mairon's personal motivation would be about improving his own power.</li>\n<li>His fall would stem from his sympathy for Melkor, rather than being seduced by him.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Manw\u00eb might take Aul\u00eb (and his posse, which would include Mairon and Curumo) with him when he goes to see Melkor, but it wouldn't be like a \"this is an official state visit/embassy to discuss negotiations\" but rather Manw\u00eb might like others to go visit.\n<ul>\n<li>There could be a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about how to handle it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Melkor would want visitors to show off Utumno.</li>\n<li>While Manw\u00eb and Aul\u00eb would expect an informal casual visit, Melkor would be formal and imposing.\n<ul>\n<li>The rest of the posse might take affront (especially Mairon) to Melkor's arrogance, and then when Manw\u00eb doesn't react, Mairon might initially be upset and be against Melkor.</li>\n<li>But seeing Manw\u00eb's humility, he thinks Manw\u00eb is being weak and is disgusted by it, would start to rethink.</li>\n<li>Curumo can be the foil to this, and we see the distance between the two grow.\n<ul>\n<li>Curumo/Saruman would have a proud, arrogant support of the establishment (Manw\u00eb) but Olorin/Gandalf (allied with Manw\u00eb) would be the only one to see accurately.</li>\n<li>Initial conversation between Sauron and Saruman in the Palantir would be really rich...Curumo may have the ultimate grudge against Mairon.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Manw\u00eb isn't offended by Melkor's making him look like a supplicant, but rather confused. \"um...can't we just talk?\"</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb as a grumpy, not so attractive, similar to Vulcan/Haphestus (maybe not an actual plumber's crack, but he's the least fancy dressed.)\n<ul>\n<li>Not rags so much, but his focus is on making things, not personal adornment</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Follow this with a solo visit with Mairon and Melkor.\n<ul>\n<li>Not a seduction/enlistment, but more a meeting of the minds and how they have things in common.</li>\n<li>The visit could be short, and give a tour of Utumno</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Maybe it's not until the battle comes that Mairon makes his choice.\n<ul>\n<li>He might not even see himself as a double agent...he just keeps him apprised.</li>\n<li>Gothmog probably wouldn't like Mairon. The Balrogs might be rude to him.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We could reveal what's going on in Mairon's mind by his dialogue with Curumo and Olorin.\n<ul>\n<li>Mairon might express admiration, which may anger Curumo</li>\n<li>Most won't know who Mairon is - it's an obscure thing, so we can reveal Mairon as Sauron when the lines are drawn with great dramatic effect.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nOss\u00eb's rebellion - key elements\n<ul>\n<li>Oss\u00eb is offered power (the entire realm of Ulmo) if he serves Melkor.</li>\n<li>He is brought back by Uinen, his wife.</li>\n<li>Ulmo is the hard line anti Melkor spokesman</li>\n<li>If Melkor considers anyone his enemy, it's Ulmo, so plotting against him makes perfect sense.</li>\n<li>Ulmo is the extremist, so it offers a natural gap in the way Oss\u00eb looks at things vs Ulmo.</li>\n<li>Melkor to Oss\u00eb: \"hey, this is a good way to improve your lot\" - there is a hierarchy and Oss\u00eb is subordinate to Ulmo</li>\n<li>Oss\u00eb loves violence.

(Hero worship)\n<ul>\n<li>Sauron may begin to see Melkor's side as he goes along.</li>\n<li>We could see Sauron distance himself as Melkor as Melkor's power diminishes, and Sauron may \"betray\" Melkor bc Melkor has now betrayed the cause (and has become a cruel, ugly tyrant/cackling villain) and Sauron would despise that.</li>\n<li>Melkor's obsessed with just Beleriand that Sauron may be the one to send out agents to men...perhaps under the guise of recruiting for Melkor, but ends up being for his own ends.</li>\n<li>The apprentice tries to do better than the master by \"killing them with kindness\" and being beautiful and friendly But the way they devolve should look similar.</li>\n</ul>\n5) Mairon would visit a few times (solo)...not hidden, but not \"sanctioned\" to the point that he has to report to Manw\u00eb afterwards.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday's episode\n<ul>\n<li>1) We don't want to make the Valar look like they don't care about Middle-earth.</li>\n<li>2) Do we have Sauron involved in Oss\u00eb's rebellion? Or in parallel? How do we get it started? Do we have Melkor go to Oss\u00eb in the ocean?\n<ol>\n<li>It's hard to not make Melkor not to look like a football coach or a used car salesman.</li>\n<li>Maybe more like a talent scout CEO...he may tell Oss\u00eb that Ulmo is rebelling against Manw\u00eb's trying to establish peace.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>3) Oss\u00eb may stop respecting the boundaries of where his dominion ends and disrespects the hierarchy. Even after repentance, he tests those boundaries. \"He rejoices in the storm.\"\n<ol>\n<li>He may encroach upon Aul\u00eb's territory, which would cause Aul\u00eb to be involved, and Uinen bringing him back...but in a way that doesn't make her look simple or Oss\u00eb look dumb.</li>\n<li>Remember that Uinen has \"boundary issues\" after the Kinslaying...her grief causing the storm to destroy ships at Alqualond\u00eb. (this was a simple transgression however, not a complete fall, and perhaps unintentional) She is more similar to him, rather than direct opposite.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>4) Uinen's message - \"unrestrained chaos is not more fun - it pushes everyone away and is more lonely. We can enjoy our natures within boundaries, and see how our part fits into the bigger picture. The boundaries allow for collaboration and interaction with others)</li>\n<li>5) Uinen and Oss\u00eb might have a fight - Oss\u00eb might be being chaotic and raging, and she comes in and interrupts him, showing that she's like him, she's his equal, and \"if you go away, who will I break stuff with?\" Uinen can be destructive, but she's more dependable (no Numenorean shipwrecks...they hold her in high regard)</li>\n<li>6) Uinen would put Oss\u00eb in a chokehold (perhaps with her hair)</li>\n<li>7) Ulmo v. Melkor would look like a grudge match to Manw\u00eb...Ulmo is just bad mouthing Melkor bc he tampered with Oss\u00eb</li>\n<li>8) Is Oss\u00eb's love of violence a corruption left behind after Melkor, or was it always in him? Is violence intrinsically evil?</li>\n<li>9) We have Tulkas and Orom\u00eb who are good yet violent, and had Melkor not rebelled, these 2 would still be violent. Tulkas would have sparring matches even if there was no war. Orom\u00eb would still be hunting.</li>\n<li>10) Does Melkor instigate Oss\u00eb? Or does Oss\u00eb go to Melkor whilst upset with Ulmo?</li>\n<li>11) Melkor may be looking at the sea, thinking about how Ulmo is a \"neckpain\" and how he has no influence over the sea, and Oss\u00eb is troubling as well, but knows that Oss\u00eb is unhappy with Ulmo, so dissension maybe? We could involve the frame explaining Melkor's rationale</li>\n<li>12) Maybe Mairon and Melkor talk about it. Oss\u00eb might breaking something, and Mairon would be sent to fix it and grumbling about why it always has to be him? Maybe Mairon would be looking at the sea at the same time, wishing Oss\u00eb was under control, and Melkor would be sympathetic to Mairon.</li>\n<li>13) Melkor would then go to Oss\u00eb (dialogue please...writer's homework)</li>\n<li>14) How does Melkor approach Oss\u00eb? Maybe this SHOULD be a temptation, not for ambition but for breaking inhibitions. Melkor hopes that Oss\u00eb overthrows Ulmo in some way or Oss\u00eb gets squashed...and Uinen disrupts his plan. He doesn't get either of his desired outcomes</li>\n<li>15) Oss\u00eb is riding a tsunami, and Melkor puts himself in the way and just blasts him with a volcano, an unrestrained violence. Melkor basically says \"you and I enjoy destruction. Why limit yourself and sell yourself short?\" (encourage him to surpass his boundaries via demonstration)</li>\n<li>16) It's ok for Melkor to look suspicious now - we're 10 episodes in now.</li>\n<li>17) House of Ulmo...Aul\u00eb complaining to Ulmo...</li>\n<li>18) Love story...showing earlier interactions with Oss\u00eb and Uinen when they were in harmony...would make their reconciliation more powerful. The rebellion would be when he was no longer in sync with her.</li>\n<li>19) #6 \"do you want to lose what we have?\" \"I thought you would come with me.\" \"no, I don't want unrestrained chaos.\"</li>\n<li>20) Valinor scenes (need to see the reactions of the other Valar) and Manw\u00eb being uncomfortable having to choose between Melkor and Ulmo</li>\n<li>21) We had Aul\u00eb visiting with Melkor, so we can have Aul\u00eb going to Ulmo, and then Uinen comes in to fight/subdue. This gives us a launch pad for Aul\u00eb's decision. Ulmo would talk about how Melkor is bad news and Aul\u00eb could be convinced to create the Dwarves with that conversation in mind.</li>\n<li>22) At the \"to be continued\" point, we would have build up to the rebellion and the actual fall. We'd have the conversations in Utumno, the 3 way dialogues, Valinor (Manw\u00eb and varda talking about his fears that chaos is increasing, then cutting to Melkor and Oss\u00eb being destructive</li>\n<li>23) Episode 10 - Aul\u00eb comes to Ulmo, Uinen says \"I got this\" is Mairon happy with this? Mairon goes to Melkor to report Oss\u00eb being worse than before. Then Melkor goes into his strategy (the 2 positive outcomes) (it's Mairon's first act of spying and Melkor's teaching him strategy) (thinking in a Machiavellian way)would be a natural step. Cutting from Uinen/Oss\u00eb reconciliation scene to Melkor on the cliff side</li>\n<li>24) \"If you have a Balrog, you don't need a cat\"</li>\n<li>25) Could return to Valinor, Utumno, or Rivendell</li>\n</ul>\n3 episodes left...Aul\u00eb and Dwarves/Yavanna and Ents/Manw\u00eb and Eagles/Varda and Stars/Orom\u00eb and the Elves\n\n*Kudos to Marie Prosser for Oss\u00eb/Uinen material*\n\nComplete Outline (Summary/Decisions made)\n\nEpisode 9\n<ul>\n<li>Manw\u00eb brings Aul\u00eb (Mairon, Curumo and Olorin) with him when he goes to see Melkor, but not an \"official state visit/embassy to discuss negotiations\" thing.</li>\n<li>While Manw\u00eb and Aul\u00eb expect an informal casual visit, Melkor is formal and imposing.\n<ul>\n<li>The posse might take affront (especially Mairon) to Melkor's arrogance, and then when Manw\u00eb doesn't react, Mairon might initially be upset and be against Melkor.</li>\n<li>But seeing Manw\u00eb's humility, he thinks Manw\u00eb is being weak and is disgusted by it, would start to rethink.</li>\n<li>Curumo can be the foil to this, and we see the distance between the two grow.\n<ul>\n<li>Curumo/Saruman would have a proud, arrogant support of the establishment (Manw\u00eb) but Olorin/Gandalf (allied with Manw\u00eb) would be the only one to see accurately.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Manw\u00eb isn't offended by Melkor's making him look like a supplicant, but rather confused. \"um...can't we just talk?\"</li>\n<li>Manw\u00eb/Melkor have their talk</li>\n<li>We reveal what's going on in Mairon's mind by his dialogue with Curumo and Olorin.\n<ul>\n<li>Mairon might express admiration, which may anger Curumo</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Follow this with a solo meeting with Mairon and Melkor cliff side\n<ul>\n<li>Melkor looks at the sea, thinking about how Ulmo is a \"neckpain\" and how he has no influence, and Oss\u00eb is troubling as well, but knows that Oss\u00eb is unhappy with Ulmo...</li>\n<li>Mairon is there fixing something Oss\u00eb broke, so he and Melkor talk about it.

Maybe reflective of the impatience they have as a group</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb is the only one who can fall in this way...it's not like Nienna can cry the Children into existence, or Tulkas can't punch them into existence</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb thinks he's doing something right, but at the same time, he knows it's not entirely \"right\" bc he does this in secret. He might even think that Iluvatar's plan was to have Aul\u00eb make them (to rationalize this)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Show the parallel here with Melkor: the similarities between Melkor's fall and Aul\u00eb's almost-fall. He might even sound like Melkor at times\n<ol>\n<li>Aul\u00eb going off into a dark place to create parallels Melkor going off into the Void to search for the Flame Imperishable</li>\n<li>Plant the seeds of this impatience by having a scene with him talking to the other Valar. The impatience for The Coming of The Children is shared.\n<ul>\n<li>Who else should be included in this conversation?\n<ol>\n<li>Tulkas, Orom\u00eb, Lorien, Melian (She could be against it and then after Thingol's death she could be like \"I knew this was a bad idea\" or she could be for it and then regret it later) Mandos could be there but silent</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb goes to the Gardens of Lorien, as that's what Valar do when they're of turmoil of mind, where he meets Lorien, Melian, Orom\u00eb, Nessa (instead of Tulkas, or Nessa is the excuse for Tulkas being there as its not exactly his \"natural\" setting)</li>\n<li>Melian could have a moment of foresight (The Coming of the Children is bound to her fate) and being uncomfortable with Aul\u00eb's conclusion that The Valar are supposed to create the Children</li>\n<li>Nessa would say \"You should go talk to Yavanna about this\" and he'll say \"yeah,\" but then goes off on his own and creates</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n2) What his actions are (do we focus on him making the dwarves, or do we emphasize his father figure/teacher quality - he's teaching the dwarves the language when Iluvatar finds him)\n<ol>\n<li>It'll be a Moria-like environment (dark and shadowy)</li>\n<li>They will be carved out of stone (will he discuss what material from which to make them?) or is he mumbling to himself?\n<ol>\n<li>Perhaps he makes Durin first, and then talks to Durin while he makes the others</li>\n<li>This emphasizes his desire to be a teacher. Durin could be his assistant as he makes the rest</li>\n<li>Durin can be like a robot. He'll do something when commanded but is frozen until spoken to.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>He made them \"hard to endure\" to stand against Melkor, and that's why they're proportioned the way they are.</li>\n<li>When Melkor sees that Aul\u00eb makes the Dwarves, Melkor copies him and makes Orcs</li>\n<li>Aul\u00eb might be hypothetical \"we're not understanding the music properly\" and then we see him putting on the finishing touches, or maybe he brings out The Dwarves to show the other Valar?</li>\n</ol>\n3) Interaction with Iluvatar (how do we handle that),\n<ol>\n<li>Yavanna or Manw\u00eb could serve as Iluvatar's proxy. Either of them could rebuke Aul\u00eb</li>\n<li>The voice of Iluvatar comes from the flames of Aul\u00eb's furnace...referencing the Flame Imperishable.
