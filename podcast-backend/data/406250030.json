The tension can suddenly evaporate, leaving things hanging. I think it's because I find myself genuinely frightened only by horror that manages to simulate the true feel of real life--its dead ends, unexplained mysteries, cliffhangers with no payoff. This is the world at its most stark, inexplicable, impenetrable. When horror gets too neat and follows a bulletproof story arc, I find myself spotting the ways the author artificially tied things up so as to satisfy everyone in the audience, and the story tends not to linger for me beyond that initial telling. But if I'm actively denied knowledge, or a traditional ending, or a release of tension, I find the horror sticks with me. To wander a world where anything can happen to you randomly, without warning, without explanation--that's what creeps me out. Lack of closure is my boogeyman. Well, lack of closure and cleaning my shower.</p>", "duration": "36:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/knifepointhorror/legend.mp3?dest-id=48154", "type": "episode", "tags": ["horror", "stories", "ghosts", "spirits", "terror", "hauntings", "campfire", "knifepoint"]}, {"seriesId": 406250030, "seriesTitle": "Knifepoint Horror", "pubDate": 1417738349, "title": "lake", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Some places are so remote that just to explore them is an invitation to the phantoms that know we're alone.</p>\n<p><em><em>When I was younger, I loved adapting stories I\u2019d read into radio plays or short films or long monologues, but the results just grew old in a drawer, because there was always the spectre that these projects were based on someone else\u2019s original work and there would certainly be much ceasing and desisting and legal threats.

Many people have been thoroughly creeped out by the show's avatar--what IS that thing looking at us? Well, we finally have an answer, provided by 11-year-old Ethien Duckett. His story below is entitled \"Ratbat.\" Talk about economy of storytelling!</em> </p>\n<p>One cold rainy night I saw a rat I picked it up with no idea what to do with it. As I came home a bat flew into a net beside my door. I grabbed it and took them both inside. Thinking what to do with them was hard, then I thought about the sewer. I quickly threw them in the toilet. Then a beam of light came out of my toilet. I then realized something was going to happen just then a portal from another dimension threw a potion down the toilet and transformed them both into a ratbat. You wouldn\u2019t like to meet a ratbat. They are hideous, monstrous things that shouldn\u2019t exist.<br /><br />They look like a slice of moldy bread with teeth, the strange thing is that they have no wings to fly with. Sadly they have no feet so they can\u2019t run, but they can teleport. If a rat bat gets on you stop, drop and roll, or else your hair will get turned into a mop with a stick on top. Ratbat likes to laugh at people with mops on their head. Ratbat laughs \u201cRahhhaa\u201d each and every time he sees a mop-head. I was trying to catch that ratbat in the net, then he teleported on the mayor\u2019s hair and turned it into a mop. The mayor was freaking out and pulled out a ray gun, blasting everything except ratbat. Everyone\u2019s mop hair was on fire it was total mayhem. Just then ratbat made a black-hole and everyone was put in a parallel jail dimension.\u00a0 While some tried to shout I decided to use my mop stick to make a ladder and climb out. Ratbat was sleeping safe and sound. I took a stick of my ladder and whacked it with my stick. Oh no it was a decoy the real one was behind me, I pulled out a laser gun and attached it to my stick right as he teleported I shot the portal and trapped him inside the portal forever.<br /><br />The EnD--->???</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "01:32:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/knifepointhorror/A_QUICK_TRILOGY_OF_TERROR_June_20_2013.mp3?dest-id=48154", "type": "episode", "tags": ["horror", "stories", "short", "suspense", "terror"]}, {"seriesId": 406250030, "seriesTitle": "Knifepoint Horror", "pubDate": 1330049244, "title": "sisters", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The secluded castle, once rumored to harbor evil, had been redeemed by the influence of piety and innocence until something came through the forest to return it to true darkness.</span></p>", "duration": "53:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/knifepointhorror/sisters.mp3?dest-id=48154", "type": "episode", "tags": ["horror", "stories", "story", "tale", "short", "suspense", "scary", "tales", "ghost", "ghosts", "terror", "narnia", "soren"]}, {"seriesId": 406250030, "seriesTitle": "Knifepoint Horror", "pubDate": 1326762784, "title": "undead", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A brief history of a brilliant creator slowly becomes a tale of shadows, footsteps, and terror when an awful irony reaches out to him with cold, lifeless hands.</p>", "duration": "39:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/knifepointhorror/undead_4.mp3?dest-id=48154", "type": "episode", "tags": ["horror", "stories", "story", "short", "suspense", "fear", "ghost", "ghosts", "zombies", "terror", "narnia", "eerie", "soren"]}, {"seriesId": 406250030, "seriesTitle": "Knifepoint Horror", "pubDate": 1323011978, "title": "outcast", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Whether high school student Garrett Markish was truly evil or under the influence of forces he could not overcome did not matter to those who fell\u00a0before his\u00a0seething wrath.</p>", "duration": "01:06:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/knifepointhorror/outcast.mp3?dest-id=48154", "type": "episode", "tags": ["radio", "horror", "stories", "story", "short", "suspense", "scary", "tales", "ghost", "ghosts", "terror", "narnia", "eerie", "soren", "knifepoint"]}, {"seriesId": 406250030, "seriesTitle": "Knifepoint Horror", "pubDate": 1319939177, "title": "sounds", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Two fugitives desperate to escape both the police and the elements become aware of a far greater horror lying between them and safety.</p>", "duration": "38:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7b/93/6f/7b936f2e-26f2-768b-d0f7-8357075a96f3/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/knifepointhorror/sounds.mp3?dest-id=48154", "type": "episode", "tags": ["horror", "stories", "story", "short", "suspense", "scary", "fear", "ghost", "ghosts", "terror", "narnia", "soren", "knifepoint"]}, {"seriesId": 406250030, "seriesTitle": "Knifepoint Horror", "pubDate": 1316746616, "title": "visitation", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Another new story of Knifepoint Horror.
