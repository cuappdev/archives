In October 2007, eager to make extra money, they noticed that local hotels were booked up because of a conference. So they pumped up some inflatable mattresses and listed their place online as an &#8220;air bed and breakfast.&#8221; It was quirky and it worked. That little act of creativity became Airbnb, the (profitable) site that allows anyone to list their extra space for rent.\nThis interview is full of examples of that kind of hustle, like how they created and sold cereal called &#8220;Obama O&#8217;s.&#8221;\u00a0That idea brought in a much-needed $30,000, but more importantly, it impressed investor Paul Graham of Y Combinator, who backed them. They jumped on that opportunity too, seizing every chance they could find to get Graham&#8217;s advice. His mentorship helped their company become profitable.\nAlong the way, they got impressive media hits by crafting interesting stories, improved their design by sleeping in their users&#8217; homes and kept changing their product based on feedback. In this interview, they teach you how they did it.\n<p><a href=\"https://mixergy.com/interviews/airbnb-chesky-gebbia/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://mixergy.com/interviews/airbnb-chesky-gebbia/?get-twitter-card=true&amp;\" /></a></p><p>Brian Chesky &amp; Joe Gebbia are two of the co-founders of <a href=\"http://Airbnb.com\">Airbnb</a>.
