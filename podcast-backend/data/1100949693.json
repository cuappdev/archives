Unlike acute stress, chronic stress is constant and low-grade, wearing and tearing on the nervous and immune systems over time. You may not even realize you\u2019re being affected, but studies show that chronic stress makes it harder for us to be creative, think outside the box, and be mentally flexible. \n\nIn this flash wisdom episode, host Maria Molfino explains how this form of stress cripples our energy and willpower, inviting the inner critic to come out and play. Practice some compassionate self-inquiry to reveal the impact chronic stress has over your life and learn basic steps you can take to keep it in check.\n\nShow Notes:  \n-Download Maria\u2019s free Creative Confidence Playbook at mariamolfino.com/free-playbook\n-Music by Lucia Lilikoi at lucia.bandcamp.com", "duration": "278", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/22/78/73/227873b6-a4f7-8483-3c5b-e6ff208b027f/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/22/78/73/227873b6-a4f7-8483-3c5b-e6ff208b027f/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/9149279/8_chronic_stress_2.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["women", "inspiration", "confidence", "leadership", "wisdom"]}, {"seriesId": 1100949693, "seriesTitle": "Heroine: Women\u2019s Creative Leadership, Confidence, Wisdom", "pubDate": 1470312056, "title": "Eileen Fisher: Reclaiming the Voice", "author": "Heroine", "summary": "A big piece of the heroine\u2019s journey is reclaiming what\u2019s been lost.
