He\u2019ll share the url so you can check it out for yourself\n \tHow he uses a pre-recorded message to warm up cold leads and also offer an easy way for property owners to get more information about Eric\u2019s business without having to speak to a live person.\n \tThe letter he sends to surrounding property owners once he\u2019s purchased a property within the same neighborhood and how this one method alone has resulted in multiple additional acquisitions for Eric and his group.\n \tHow Eric was able to turn a disgruntled property owner who was sick and tired of receiving his direct mail into a friendship that has brought him multiple investment opportunities, capital for deals, not to mention a mentor who had 50+ years of experience in the industry and who has become an invaluable resource to Eric and his team.\n \tWhy Eric loves the Detroit market and the reasons he says that you should add it to your list of \u201ccities to consider investing in\u201d.\n \tThe important role a mentor played in Eric\u2019s overall success and why he feels that a good mentor is critical to your success in this business.\n \tThe one Dr. Seuss book that Eric suggests will change your life and is one of the best business books he\u2019s ever read.\n \tAnd much more\n\nOur Guest\n\n \tEric Stark\n\nRecommended Resource\n\n \tSchedule a free 30 minute \"no obligation\" 30 minute call directly with me by clicking this link \u00a0https://www.timetrade.com/book/KV2D2\n \tLooking to invest in Mobile Home Parks?

If you\u2019ve been a loyal listener to our show for the past few years then you\u2019ve probably heard me previously talk about this niche of raw land investing. Our company even went as far as testing this particular niche to see if it might prove to be a potential new revenue stream for our existing investment business.\n\nI think the most existing part about this niche is the fact that someone could essentially get started and buy their first deal for as low as a few hundred bucks. I personally feel that this niche offers a great opportunity for the beginning investor who has limited money and resources to get started in a \u201cnot so competitive\u201d niche and start making some passive income streams which they can bank roll and hopefully later parlay into bigger deals.

A CMBS loan, also known as a commercial mortgage-backed security, is a type of fixed-income security that is collateralized by commercial real estate loans. Typically these loans are for commercial properties such as office buildings, hotels, malls, apartment buildings, factories, etc., but not\u00a0single-family homes. CMBS make up about 2% of the total U.S. fixed income market.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn essence, CMBS are created when a bank takes a group of loans on its books, bundles them together, and sells them in securitized form as a series of bonds. Each series will typically be organized in \"tranches\" from the senior - or highest-rated, lowest-risk issue - to the highest-risk, lowest-rated issue. The senior issue is first in line to receive principal and interest payments, while the most junior issues will be the first to take a loss if a borrower defaults. Investors choose which issue they invest in based on their desired yield and capacity for risk.\n\nToday we're going to speak about how Ann's company can help investors navigate the tricky and often times complex CMBS loan process as well as discuss some of the opportunities that might exist from maturing CMBS loans that were created back during the 2005-2008 real estate run-up and how her company can help you capitalize on some of these \"soon-to-be\" distressed opportunities.\nHere's What You'll Learn\n\n \tWhat a CMBS loan is\n \tWhat role 1st service solutions \u00a0plays in the CMBS market and the services they provide to real estate investors\n \tHow Ann was able to grow her company during one of the worst real estate markets in history which was 2008\n \tThe opportunity that exists with the $100+ billion of maturing CMBS loans and how you can go about uncovering those that might be distressed\n \tWhat defeasance means when it comes to CMBS loans\n \tThe benefits of a CMBS loan and how they typically offer much more attractive terms than conventional commercial loans which can include longer amortization, lower rates, non-recourse vs. recourse bank loans, and 10 year balloons instead of 5 or 7 that you have with commercial loans.\n \tThe number one marketing strategy which she feels is responsible for the great success her company has experienced and how you can apply this same strategy to your real estate business.\n \tHow to get a free 1 hour phone consultation with Ann.\n \tAnd much more\n\nOur Guest\n\n \tAnn Hambly - Company Website\n\nRecommended Resource\n\n \tDownload my free success guide,\u00a0 \u201c7 habits of highly successful multi-family investors\u201d by going to www.KevinBupp.com/guide\n \tSchedule a free 30 minute \"no obligation\" 30 minute call directly with me by clicking this link \u00a0https://www.timetrade.com/book/KV2D2\n \tLooking to invest in Mobile Home Parks?

You see, being that we are all human and our lives are forever changing, circumstances have a tendency to change from day to day which means that although a seller might have declined your offer on Tuesday doesn't mean that their circumstances might change on Friday which will make them a more motivated seller. Throughout my 15+ years as an investor this theory has held true time and time again which has allowed me to buy multiple properties from owners who originally declined my original offer. Most investors take the approach of \"once and done\" and will completely lose interest in a deal if their original offer gets declined which is the complete wrong approach to take.\n\nSo here's what I want you to take away from this week's tip. Whether you're dealing with a broker or directly with a property owner it's your duty as a savvy investor to stay in constant contact with them after your initial offer was declined and this can be through either email or phone and it's up to you to choose the one that best suits that particular relationship. And with technology setting reminders for this type of activity are super simple by using many of the free CRM software systems available on the market, your smartphone, or even the old school method of writing it down in a planner. I don't care how you track it as long as you actually do it.\n\nI can promise that if you'll significantly increase your number of accepted offers if you use this one simple technique, plus it will win you a ton of brownie points with brokers if it's a listed property. So as soon as you finish listening to this podcast I want you to create your follow up plan or system on how you plan to stay in touch with brokers or sellers who have declined your initial offer.\nRecommended Resources\n\n \tDownload my free success guide,\u00a0 \u201c7 habits of highly successful multi-family investors\u201d by going to www.KevinBupp.com/guide\n \tSchedule your free 30 minute \"no obligation\" call directly with Kevin by clicking this link https://www.timetrade.com/book/KV2D2\n \tLooking to invest in Mobile Home Parks?

This initial exposure to the world of real estate investing was all Mike needed to know confirm that he had found his calling as a real estate investor\n\nFast forward a few years and Mike quickly jumped with both feet into the business by starting a full service property management company, fixing and flipping properties, running a local real estate investment club, as well as building his own multifamily real estate portfolio.

This is an extremely important exercise and is one that I suggest every investor, both new and seasoned, do in order to create a roadmap for their investing career. This is an exercise which I learned from Jeremy Cyrier who was a past guest on our show and is a very successful real estate broker, trainer, and investor. I went through this exercise when I was first introduced to Jeremy and it's had a significant impact on my overall focus as a real estate investor.\n\nFor example, my WHY is the following: Spending as much time as possible with my family is priceless because none of us are guaranteed tomorrow and commercial real estate investing provides the vehicle that can generate enough passive income for my family and I to live the lifestyle that we choose and spend the maximum amount of time together traveling the world and experiencing all life has to offer. I will make this a reality by focusing solely on acquiring a significant portfolio of mobile home parks and apartment buildings which can produce a yearly passive net income stream of at least 500k. Based on my calculations this should take approximately 1000-1500 rentable units to achieve my investment goals.\n\nSo there you have it, in a nutshell that is my WHY and this is what I work towards every day. You can develop your own why by answering these following 5 questions and then forming them into one continuous statement. I suggest that once you have your WHY statement completed that you review and tweak on a regular basis and have it in plain sight for all to see. I also suggest that you share it with your family and friends and anyone else who you feel might help hold you accountable to this mission.\n\n5 questions:\n\n \tBriefly describe what it is you want to do: For example: I want to own 4 apartment buildings in Southwest Florida totaling 500+ doors which produce in excess of 250k in passive income each year.\n \tNow describe how you will do it. For example: I will do this by building a relationship with every apartment broker in SW Florida and by sending direct mail to all buildings that meet my general criteria\n \tDescribe why you want to do it. I believe that owning\u00a0 500+ doors in SW Florida will afford my wife and I\u00a0 the luxury to quit our full-time jobs and travel the world with our 2 kids. Owning 500+ doors will also provide a much more secure retirement plan for our family and will allow us to send our kids to the colleges of their choice.\n \tWhy do you want this for yourself? Example: Because my family is my world and I want to opportunity to spend every available minute with them and owning 500+ doors will provide me with that time.\n \tWhat are some other reasons you want this? Example: Because I believe that you should enjoy what you do and both my wife and I are unhappy in our current careers . Real estate can be our escape and can offer the enjoyable career path that we both seek.\n\nNow after you've come up with your answers to these 5 questions now what you'll need to do is start with the #5 answer\u00a0and work backwards and merge them together to form a statement or sentence. So merge #5, #4, #3, #2, #1 together and you'll end up with your why.\n\nPlease don't dismiss these type of exercises as they allow you to think through what you envision your future should be like. You can have anything you want in this life if you work hard enough for it and plan accordingly and this offers a way for you to plan for your real estate investing success. I promise that if you take the 20-30 minutes to complete this that you'll be glad you did and will have a much clearer focus. And if you need some guidance on coming up with your WHY statement just reach out to me and we can walk through it together.

The topic of discussion for today's show is regarding the wave of CMBS loan maturities that are taking place right now and will continue over the coming years and how we as investors can find opportunity in these distressed commercial assets.\n\nTo provide you a clearer picture of why this represents an exciting opportunity, these CMBS loans are typically 10 year terms which means most of these loans coming due were originated during the peak real estate markets of 2005-2008 before the financial crash of 2008 and majority of them were very high leverage loans (as high as\u00a0 90% LTV) and a large quantity were interest only terms which means they're are upside down in value and would require a large amount of cash from the borrower in order to get out from underneath it.\n\nSal also is giving a free copy of his book \"making the yield\" to the first 20 listeners who go to the website and register www.MakingTheYield.com\u00a0\nHere's What You'll Learn\n\n \tWhy CMBS loan maturities represent a great opportunity in the coming years for investors\n \tWhat Sal and his team are doing to prepare for capitalizing on these distressed deals\n \tHow to track down these distressed notes by going direct to the lenders\n \tWhy he feels that CMBS loans between $2 million & $30 represent the best opportunities for the small to mid-size non-institutional investors\n \tThe reason he is focusing on secondary and tertiary markets\n \tWhy it's not as simple as just restructuring these loans similar to what would happen with a portfolio loan\n \tWhy he feels the sweet spot for banks that are holding these types of distressed assets are the ones that have between $2 & $5 billion in assets and why that's the niche you need to focus on.\n \tThe person we need to speak with at the bank in order to gain access to these distressed deals.\n \tWhy he feels that there are many markets that are already overheated which will ultimately represent a correction sometime in the coming years and why we need to be cautious as investors\n \tAnd much more\n\nOur Guest\n\n \tSalvatore Buscemi - Company Website\n\nRecommended Resource\n\n \tDownload my free success guide,\u00a0 \u201c7 habits of highly successful multi-family investors\u201d by going to www.KevinBupp.com/guide\n \tSchedule a free 30 minute \"no obligation\" 30 minute call directly with me by clicking this link \u00a0https://www.timetrade.com/book/KV2D2\n \tLooking to invest in Mobile Home Parks?

David started thinking about real estate at the very young age of 14, an age when most of us were more interested in riding our bikes or playing a game of catch. His young interest in real estate stemmed from a fear of his dad running out of work and not being able to provide for his family and David knew that creating a perpetual income stream through real estate could ease that fear, but his father thought otherwise. His father thought tenants were nothing more than headaches and he wanted no part of it\n\nFast forward a number of years and David went on to build a multi-million dollar contracting firm, has built or renovated more than 250 homes, built 100 condo units, built more than 5 million sq ft of commercial and office space and has built quite the impressive rental portfolio. To date David has 68 rental units in his portfolio with a goal to get to 300 units by 2018.\nHere's What You'll Learn\n\n \tWhat intrigued David about real estate at the age of 14\n \tWhy he decided to make the switch from being a contractor to a long term investor\n \tWhat attracted him to Charlotte, NC and why he thinks it's the next large growth city\n \tHow he found one of his best deals through a brokers personal website\n \tWhen hard money makes sense and when it doesn't\n \tHow he was able to obtain owner financing on a recent 21 unit building in Charlotte\n \tWhy he uses a multiple offers strategy when buying apartment buildings\n \tThe risks of buying the underlying LLC that owns the asset instead of buying the real property itself.\n \tWhy he loves condemned buildings\n \tWhy he lives by the motto \"don't be cheap\" and how he attributes that to his success as an investor\n \tAnd much more\n\nOur Guest\n\n \tDavid Fontana - Company Website\n\nRecommended Resource\n\n \tDownload my free success guide,\u00a0 \u201c7 habits of highly successful multi-family investors\u201d by going to www.KevinBupp.com/guide\n \tSchedule a free 30 minute \"no obligation\" 30 minute call directly with me by clicking this link \u00a0https://www.timetrade.com/book/KV2D2\n \tLooking to invest in Mobile Home Parks?

Unfortunately, we can't just go and purchase a list of names and mailing addresses from a list broker for these individuals who have self directed IRA's as that would be too easy and everyone would be doing it already. What we can do though is use this little secret method that I'm going to teach you in today's show to find those who have self directed IRA's and who are already actively buying or lending on real estate using their IRA which means they already know the benefits and are essentially semi-warm leads or prospects. What does all of this mean for you? Well, \u00a0this means \u00a0you'll be able to directly target millions of dollars of self directed IRA funds which can act as an excellent source of capital for your RE deals.\n\nSo, in today's show, \u00a0I'll \u00a0break down this process for you into 4 simple steps.

Being someone that has personally used vacation rentals for multiple vacations I have to agree with him, especially if you're buying in highly desirable tourist markets.\nHere's What You'll Learn\n\n \tHow he got his start in the vacation rental business\n \tThe important role that 3 mentors played in his life and how he found them\n \tWhat unique attributes excited him about investing in the emerging tourist destination of Panama City, Panama\n \tWhy he feels that the vacation rental market is still in its infancy and will continue to grow at a fast rate\n \tHow he was able to find and befriend strategic partnerships in this new county which enabled him to complete his first acquisition\n \tHow he was able to position his properties as \"best in class\" in a very short period of time\n \tHow he uses technology to create consistent bookings thus creating very high demand for his properties\n \tWhy the big brand hotel operators aren't too happy about the vacation rental niche impeding on their market share\n \tAnd much more...\n\nOur Guest\n\n \tMatt Landau - Company Website\n\nRecommended Resource\n\n \tDownload my free success guide,\u00a0 \u201c7 habits of highly successful multi-family investors\u201d by going to www.KevinBupp.com/guide\n \tSchedule a free \"no obligation\" call directly with Kevin by clicking this link \u00a0https://www.timetrade.com/book/KV2D2\n \tLooking to invest in Mobile Home Parks?

I mean, who would want to know how much demand there will be for a rental unit and how much you'll be able to get for it before ever buying it. Forget proforma's that the turnkey operators try to sell you on and why would you ever rely solely on the realtors opinion on what you'll be able to rent the unit for. Let the facts speak for themselves.\n\nNow some of you might feel that this technique is a little misleading or unethical and you're completely entitled to your opinion. My goal when buying a mobile home park is to ensure we're buying in an area that has sufficient demand for the type of property I'm offering. Take the guess work out of the equation and let the market tell you whether or not the property you're considering buying is in high demand and will rent fast.\n\n#1: Write a description for the property and be specific as possible without mentioning the address or neighborhood it's located in, since after all you don't own it yet. Be sure to include all the relevant facts: schools, beds/baths, sq. ft., age, upgrades, monthly rent $, etc\n\n#2: Search google images and try and locate a similar looking exterior image (don't use an image of the exact property you're looking to buy) as well as a few interior images. Again, don't go and use the exact images of the property you're looking to buy. Using similar images which you grab from the web will do the job and won't get you in hot water.\n\n# 3: Create a free google voice phone number which is where you'll be forwarding the calls to. Setup a voicemail message with a basic greeting so that the callers think they're calling an individual. If you're running more than 1 test ad at a time (maybe you have more than 1 property or are testing different markets) then you can use an app called burner which will allow you to create multiple temporary numbers with VM's for each for up to 30 days. We use this when we are looking at multiple parks and need to run numerous test ads to determine demand\n\n#4: Post the CL ad and be sure to include the phone number to your google voice or burner app.\n\n#5: Sit back and see how many calls come in. I personally like to see at least 5-6 calls per day for a specific property, but you'll need to figure out what the right demand for you is. If you're in a small market then maybe that number is 2-3 calls per day.\n\nRecommended Resources\n\n \tDownload my free success guide,\u00a0 \u201c7 habits of highly successful multi-family investors\u201d by going to www.KevinBupp.com/guide\n \tSchedule a free \"no obligation\" call directly with Kevin by clicking this link https://www.timetrade.com/book/KV2D2\n \tLooking to invest in Mobile Home Parks?

Then rent-o-meter is free and easy to use and will give you the quick and dirty data needed to see what properties are renting for in your market.\n\n#4: www.Craigslist.org - We use craigslist for a multitude of things including; checking the local rental market competition - how many properties similar to mine are there available, how long have they been listed, are they offering move-in incentives.\u00a0 Another thing we do is we run test ads to determine the demand within a given market for the type of property we're about to bring to market i.e., mobile home, apartment, SFR, etc. Some of you might find this misleading and unethical, but when looking to acquire\u00a0 a property within a new market I want to make sure there is plenty of demand before we commit to buy.

The question is, how do you find out whether the property you\u2019re considering is located in a high demand area and whether the area will continue to be in high demand in the future because the last thing you want to do is buy a property in a declining market where incomes are deteriorating, unemployment is rising, and people are moving out.\n\n#1 - Demographics: Commercial property investing is really all about space investing.\u00a0 What that means is that you are buying, selling, or leasing space that you think the general population not only want, but need.\u00a0 Take a look at the number of households, people, and businesses residing within 3-5 miles of your property.\u00a0 The more the better. A simple free tool I use to do a quick and dirty analysis for this is www.BestPlaces.net and www.City-Data.com\n\n#2 - Income: To market, sell, and lease your space, you need paying customers.\u00a0 That means the more paying customers you have within 3-5 miles of your property that earn enough money to pay for your property, the better.\u00a0 For example, when I\u2019m evaluating a market for Mobile Home Parks, I will look for median household incomes of $28,000 or better.\u00a0 That\u2019s because residential tenants will spend about 1/3 of their income on housing.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking for tenants that can afford at least $7,000-9,000/year. (583-750 mo)\n\n#3 - Infrastructure: Airports, highways, railways, ports, area amenities are all critical indicators for high demand areas.\u00a0 People want to live, work, and sleep where access is easy and amenities are available.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking at an apartment community 1 hour from any Walmart location, you might want to reconsider how \u201cin demand\u201d that are might really be. In fact, when I'm looking at a mobile home park within a new market I always look to see if there's a walmart and how close by it is. If there is no walmart in town then I usually pass immediately.\nOur Guest\n\n \tYours Truly\n\nReview and Subscribe", "duration": "5:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/07/96/65/07966590-5c00-d769-40e1-31a03201be7d/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/07/96/65/07966590-5c00-d769-40e1-31a03201be7d/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/realestateinvestingforcashflow/final_edit_complete_show_5.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 791316884, "seriesTitle": "Real Estate Investing For Cash Flow Hosted by Kevin Bupp. The #1 Commercial Real Estate Investing Teaching You How To Create We", "pubDate": 1423514121, "title": "Ep #57: Increasing your NOI and creating better tenants by enforcing late fees", "author": "", "summary": "In this weeks show we\u2019re going to cover a topic that has seem to become a popular over the past few weeks throughout the numerous conversations I've personally had with real estate investors who own multi-unit and single family rental properties\n\nThis week\u2019s show is a quick one in comparison to our normal Monday session and I\u2019m going to get straight to the point as this is a topic that we don\u2019t need to tip toe around.
