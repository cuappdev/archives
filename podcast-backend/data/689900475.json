They use a special shorthand to convey ideas or explain plot in the most efficient way possible. There's one problem though: they do it in the same couple dozen ways and recycle them over and over. And they need to stop. Or at least invent some new ones.Is someone's life crumbling away after a break-up? Just give them a beard and litter their apartment with Chinese food cartons. Want to show someone has a house or apartment, but no possessions? How about some well-placed Chinese food cartons? Is someone pulling an all-nighter with their work? More Chinese food cartons!If you're a person who even casually watches movies, you'll know so many of these the instant we bring them up and you'll never unsee them in any film going forward. To break down 25 of the biggest offenders, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Carmen Angelica, Soren Bowie and Daniel O'Brien. They talk about how people brush their teeth in movies, how men try to steal kisses and why you can never trust a fictional male nurse.Remember to buy tickets to our next live taping of The Cracked Podcast on this Saturday, March 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

The point we're trying to make is that what seems fringe or crazy now may have a billion devoted followers a thousand years from now. Mormonism was about as fringe as you could get a hundred years ago, less than a million followers, but now the there are around 16 million members and counting. Is there any religion that's out there now that's in the same place Mormonism was 100 years ago?To get a better understanding of some of these lesser-known religions and if they'll stand the test of time, Jack O'Brien's guest this week is Reza Aslan, who has a PhD in the study of religion and whose new show 'Believer' on CNN throws him head-first into the beliefs and practices of obscure religions. Among Scientology and Santa Muerte, they talk about the implausible origins of biblical literalism, the rare disorder that has tourists in Jerusalem thinking they're the messiah and a few big things that'll change your notions of Christianity and Islam.Remember to buy tickets to our next live taping of The Cracked Podcast on Saturday, March 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

Most of us can and did, in fact. Great job, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences! Way to keep your fingers on the pulse of American filmmaking by giving gold out to the 1930s-style silent film. Trailblazing. The Oscars have proven year after year that they're not the best barometer for judging the best or even the most popular films from a given year. Often they're really only judging movies on the criteria of being appealing to a group of old, white men with film industry jobs. Look at three of the last five best picture winners and their subject matter: 'Birdman'\u2013 an aging actor known for playing superheroes strives for artistic legitimacy; 'Argo'\u2013 Hollywood producers save hostages in Iran; 'The Artist'\u2013 Remember silent films? And let's pencil 'La La Land' into that list\u2013 an struggling actress and a struggling musician fall in love, become successful. Hollywood obviously has a problem being objective about movies wherein the subject matter is itself.So this week we're being objective for Hollywood. Jack O'Brien welcomes Cracked's David Bell, Adam Ganser and Brett Rader to discuss 2016's Best Picture nominees and award movies in some made-up categories that we'd like to see incorporated into the Oscar broadcast. Later they took a look back at the 2012 Oscars in which 'The Artist' won best picture and redistribute the awards with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.

Who doesn't? And when you do, you probably imagine in your head (because you love envisioning your eldest relatives gettin' down) a very bland, puritanical form of sex where they do it through a sheet once every other year and only to conceive, right? Well, sorry to make you throw up in your mouth a little bit, but your ideas of chastened ancestors living repressed lives are as wrong as the next images we're about to put in your mind: ancient humans were nasty little horndogs. In fact, the basically standard modern ideas of monogamy and fidelity are extremely recent developments in human history. They've only been around for about 10,000 years -- a blink of the evolutionary eye.So what was the ancient hunter-gatherer love like actually like? And what can we learn about our own sex lives from looking at how the cavemen got down? A lot, actually. So we asked an expert. By studying prehistoric human cultures and the sex lives of our two closest genetic relatives, chimps and bonobos, Dr. Christopher Ryan has some pretty eye-opening stuff to share about human sexuality. So Jack O'Brien welcomes Dr. Ryan on this bonus episode of The Cracked Podcast to talk with Teresa Lee and Michael Swaim about swinging tribes-people, primitive vibrators and ape balls in a conversation that is bound to make you rethink everything you know about love and sexuality.Footnotes:Book: Christopher Ryan & Cacilda Jetha: Sex At Dawn:  https://goo.gl/NkZVye Podcast: Christopher Ryan: Tangentially Speaking:  https://goo.gl/uWl7mK Scholarly Article: Michael Gurven & Hilliard Kaplan: Longevity Among Hunter-Gatherers:  https://goo.gl/9LXdBo Article: Jared Diamond: The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race:  https://goo.gl/4k9zM Article: Cracked: 5 Gender Stereotypes That Used To Be The Exact Opposite:  https://goo.gl/zgnNG Article: Cracked: 6 Horrifying Facts That Get Left Out Of History:  https://goo.gl/ItWwcK Article: Cracked: 7 X-Rated Traditions That Prove History Was Horny As F*$&:  https://goo.gl/9XxknD Article: Cracked: The 6 Most Cynical Exploitations of Romantic Love in History:  https://goo.gl/Hik16 Article: Cracked: 6 Factors That Secretly Influence Who You Have Sex With:  https://goo.gl/oIAFD Article: Cracked: 5 Insignificant Things That Determine Who You Have Sex With:  https://goo.gl/0i8cQ", "duration": "01:29:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/307615629-crackedpod-why-modern-people-might-have-the-worst-sex-lives-ever.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 689900475, "seriesTitle": "The Cracked Podcast", "pubDate": 1486973332, "title": "Jafar Is Disney Moses: Secretly Heroic Villains", "author": "", "summary": "Did you ever notice how every movie villain is just really ugly beyond belief?

'The Incredibles' is a perfect example. The villain is an ugly-little redhead kid who just wants for everybody to be a superhero, but the Incredibles are like NNNNNNOPE and throw him into a jet engine because only they should get to be superheroes.Yeah, of course Syndrome kills like 30 other superheroes and sets a giant death robot loose on a major metropolis, but just go with us for this thought experiment.

Disinformation, strong man tactics and a corrupt and dictatorial turn have spilled into American life in a way that would've seemed like fiction only a few decades ago.

It separates the gods who create from us lay-people who like to eat cheese and can barely decide what to watch on Netflix. Take Spock's \"Live Long and Prosper\" hand signal. Yeah, it seems a little trivial, it's not 'Starry Night' or 'Hey Jude' or anything, but it's an icon that's lasted in the popular culture for 50 years and stands only second to \"May the Force be with you\" as the most recognizable totem of the sci-fi genre. Only a genius could've come up with that, right? Not really. Gene Roddenberry and company wanted the Vulcan salute to be the peace sign until Lenoard Nimoy took a stand for what was right and was like, \"hey, this is dumb. I know this is coming from the dude wearing pointy ears right now, but can I just try this other thing so I don't look like the stupidest person on television?\"And thank god Nimoy did that, because otherwise everyone would've thought 'Star Trek' was cheesy crap, or at least cheesier than it already was considered. So sometimes genius isn't in the intention as much as it is being able to realize a mistake, correct it and pray to god your new solution isn't as dull as the idea that preceded it. And pop culture is so littered with examples like these, there's a lone Native American man shedding a single tear over it. That much litter.So Jack O'Brien is joined on the podcast this week by Cracked's Teresa Lee and Alex Schmidt to talk about the behind the scenes mistakes and last-minute casting changes that made some movies and video games better. They also talk about some ghastly original versions of famous scripts that thankfully never saw the light of day.

It's all the same mad libs game, and the outcome is always the same.Colin Firth/Hugh Grant/Matthew McConaughey runs to the airport/apartment building/twee bakery to declare his undying love for the maid/undercover journalist/baker he just met last week. The music swells, they kiss, the girl's less attractive best friend sighs, \"oh I wish architect/surgeon/astronaut Chet Wellington could fall in love with me,\" and the credits roll. But what if, instead of the swelling music, it was a single piano note being played backwards, or an old-timey phonograph blowing out a single child singing, \"Ring Around the Rosie?\" 'Love Actually' would turn into an actual horror movie. The little boy chasing the little girl through the airport would take on a new interpretation. 'Shining 2: This Time It's British Christmas.\"RomComs are weird like that. They take a thing most people experience (falling in love) and turn it into a warped version of reality that only abides by backwards rules: where chasing someone down is considered romantic and getting the person to like you is the hardest part, not that whole spending the next 5 decades together thing. No, that part is easy (cries self to sleep).So this week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editor Soren Bowie and comedian and writer Jamie Loftus from 'The Bechdel Cast' to talk about how RomComs get almost everything wrong and when you change just one detail, they become creepy stalker thrillers.Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

Although what is a Minion but yellow Ewok?But in all seriousness, the world has taken a turn for the conservative as it did in the early 80s. Free love and long hair were gone and replaced by shoulder pads, cocaine and rich white kids who thought the stock market was dope. So is there anything redeemable about this situation other than the prospect of getting some cool movies and punk music?Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien are joined by comedian, podcast host and 'Saved by the Bell' historian April Richardson for a conversation about how 80s pop-culture perfectly represented those regressive times and how some of the patterns we saw then are starting to appear now in our modern pop-culture.

There are too many damn movies and TV shows to keep up with. When we're not in the middle of a season of Game of Thrones, Westworld, Silicon Valley, Stranger Things, or House of Cards, there are always 40 other shows just waiting to get started. If only you were ready to make the commitment. Your girlfriend wants you to propose but you can't even commit to Six Feet Under, let alone the next 60 years of your life.This glut of TV shows we're experiencing completely fails to lack the steady stream of quality movies coming out not only in the US but all around the world. And the surplus of movies doesn't even address how behind you are on music. Open up Spotify or look at the next festival lineup and you can barely recognize a third of the bands there. And we're not being old fogies complaining about music these days-- most of these bands are good-- we just can't keep up with them. 21 Pilots, 21 Savage, 21 Scarecrows. Only one of those band names is completely made up.So to give a little order to this exponentially insane world, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about some of their favorite they discovered in 2016. They commiserate about the superabundance of content and Soren gives some completely unsolicited home improvement advice.Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

One thing we haven't quite touched on yet is how real life actual people will be affected by the changes he promised to make during his campaign.\u00a0One thing Trump already promised to do is repeal an Obama executive order called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\u00a0 DACA allows children who were brought here illegally (keyword: children) to gain somewhat-legal status; protection from deportation, a social security card, in exchange for staying out of trouble and being an active part of the workforce. These are law-abiding, tax-paying young adults whose home country for all intents and purposes is America. A lot of them don't even know the know the language spoken in their country of origin. The shittiest thing is these people might be the first to be deported because they had the unmitigated gall to actively try to live in the United States legally.Robert Evans and Tom Reimann grab the reigns of the podcast this week and have conversations with a potential victim of the removal of DACA, a transgender woman whose medications may no longer be covered, and an army vet whose parents are immigrants to talk about the scary world they've been suddenly thrust into. Later a British journalist joins to talk about the parallels to Brexit and\u00a0why we might soon see fascist vs. anti-fascist fighting in the streets, and how it could look.If your life has been concretely or irrevocably changed by the new administration, we want to hear your story.

If the news later reports of a man who stabbed his mother, you'll find a Freudian explanation for the crime that speaks of Oedipal repressed sexuality and the phallic nature of stabbings. Bad news: turns out everything you learned about psychology from the shiny little box in the center of your living room isn't totally accurate. Not only do movies and TV shows take giant liberties with how psychology works, the psych field itself has a hard time getting out of its own way: studies can be biased for multiple reasons, the replication crisis impedes the verification of discoveries and news outlets only report on the grabbiest psych headlines and and skew the truth.So on this week's podcast, we're putting a bunch of psych myths in a straight jacket, tossing them in a padded room and throwing away the key. Cracked's Jack O'Brien, Daniel O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Peter McGraw, an expert in behavioral science and a marketing and psychology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. They dispel pop-psych stories like the Milgram experiment, power posing and the Mozart effect.Also make sure to buy tickets to our next LIVE podcast taping on Saturday, December 10th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, California.

Like, sending up a crew of men less qualified than Donald Trump (too soon?) to blow up an asteroid? That's probably not in NASA's Plans A through \"we ran out of letters\" of how to stop a meteor on a collision course with Earth.\u00a0Even in more fantastical movies like the Star Wars or Star Trek films, you just get very inadequate image in your head of how space works. Take asteroid belts, for example. It's a belt! Made of asteroids! Asteroids as far as the eye can see! You can't safely pilot your ship through them because there are just so many damn asteroids! I've had it with these motherf**king asteroids on this motherf**king belt!\u00a0We're sorry to say that's now how the asteroid belt works at all. The average distance between bodies in the asteroid belt is 600,000 miles, which is more than double the distance between the Earth and the Moon. So traveling through the asteroid belt is less dodging asteroids like Han Solo and more, \"we passed through the asteroid belt?\" To dispel some more myths about how space works, Jack O'Brien and Alex Schmidt are joined by Dr. Farah Alibay, a real life scientist at JPL who gets to play with styrofoam models of planets all day and is currently working on a mission that's trying to scoop a 2o-ton boulder off an asteroid, which is as cool as it sounds.\u00a0Footnotes:\u00a0Farah Alibay Bio :  https://goo.gl/iM4NI7  Podcast: How NASA Was Born Out of Magic Loving, Orgy Having Nerds :  https://goo.gl/sbSjcR  \u00a0Video: To Scale - The Solar System :  https://goo.gl/yxUggj GIF: Jupiter's Surface in Motion :  https://goo.gl/BEUaJz  Video: Pigeons in Space :  https://goo.gl/H3Anrr  Video: Spiders in Space :  https://goo.gl/VrQQkJ  \u00a0Video: Russian Meteor Reaction :  https://goo.gl/R6WKTA  Image Gallery: Cupola Module on the ISS :  https://goo.gl/IJUO5U  Article: The Drake Equation :  https://goo.gl/rYZVzF  Article: Myths Everyone Believes About Space (Thanks To Movies) :  https://goo.gl/H0WiLF  Article: Things About Space You're Picturing Almost Exactly Wrong :  https://goo.gl/qDDpgn  Article: Reasons Space Travel Will Always Suck :  https://goo.gl/VfNZ  Article: Reasons Life in Space Sucks (That Sci-Fi Doesn't Show You) :  https://goo.gl/jNuONd  Article: The Most Mind-Blowing Things Ever Discovered in Space :  https://goo.gl/XztW9  Article: Real Planets Way Weirder Than Anything in Science Fiction :  https://goo.gl/Rb6Yy6  Article: Mind-Blowing Things Found in Our Own Solar System :  https://goo.gl/Azquk  This episode is brought to you by Squarespace and MVMT Watches.", "duration": "01:17:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/294022978-crackedpod-dispelling-every-space-myth-you-learned-in-7th-grade-science.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 689900475, "seriesTitle": "The Cracked Podcast", "pubDate": 1479110703, "title": "7 Things To Do In A Time Machine (Other Than Killing Hitler)", "author": "", "summary": "Scenario: you've got a time machine and you only like two things in this life: eatin' breakfast and killin' Nazis, and you've already eaten breakfast. Your obvious next step is to travel to April 20th,1889 and throw baby hitler down a well and then blow up the well, \u00a0right? Or is there something better you could do with your time?The whole 'would you kill baby Hitler' thought experiment has been a surprisingly prevalent pop-culture moral question at dinner parties and bad games of Cards Against Humanity. Even Jeb Bush weighed in with his thoughts back in a simpler time when he thought he could be president. His answer, by the way, was, \"hell yeah!\" ( https://goo.gl/IzBaxA ).This got us thinking, what would be some other moments in history to travel back to and change one thing? One answer might be incredibly simple: November 8th, 2016. Who wouldn't go back in time to stop the events of last Tuesday? Only time will tell if that day becomes one of the giant crossroads in the slow forward march of history.So today Jack O'Brien and Alex Schmidt are posing that question to our five comedian guests: Steven Wilbur, Riley Silverman, Caitlin Gill, Blake Wexler and Eric Lampaert.

His experiences in Iraq mean he knows a thing or two about modern political unrest and civil war, which makes that quote even more terrifying.As you might've heard, there's an election tomorrow (if you're reading this day it's coming out), and no matter what the outcome, a portion of the country is going to feel like they've had it stolen from them. Matt Bevins, the Governor of Kentucky, has already promised that, \"blood will be shed\" if Hillary wins and there's no doubt real people are taking promises like these to heart.So how likely is it that America falls into a second civil war? What would that look like? That's what we're asking Cracked's Robert Evans and Teresa Lee on this episode of The Cracked Podcast. They'll explain to us that violent unrest on American soil is a lot more possible than you think and that it wouldn't be North vs. South or Red vs. Blue, but a war fought on thousands of different sides.Also, make sure to catch the next LIVE taping of The Cracked Podcast, this Saturday, November 12th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, CA.

But what about his other 12 novels and the dozens of short stories and other works you're not familiar with?The Cracked Podcast is going to mix it up this week with an introduction to our new Vonnegut book club, a brand new podcast with Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim, the Kurt Vonneguys. Once a month, Alex and Michael will work through the Vonnegut library, dissecting the recurring themes and characters, highlighting some amazing Kurt-isms and providing a general overview of Kurt's work as the connective tissue to modern sci-fi.In this week's episode, Alex and Michael cover Vonnegut's overlooked first novel, 'Player Piano,' a satirical '1984'-esque warning about the horrors of automation. When you're through, you can check out episode two of Kurt Vonneguys here ( https://goo.gl/dtD9Qz ), where they look at Vonnegut's masterwork, 'The Sirens of Titan.'

We're doing a Trump podcast! Please hide your women and children.We've actually kind of skirted around Trump a lot in the last year. We talked about the class divide in America, how it's not necessarily driven by money and how the Donald personifies the hopes and desires of the \"lower class\". We even talked about narcissism as America's mental disorder, symbolized again by king narcissist himself, Donald J. Trump.So this week, Crooked Jack O'Brien is joined by Lyin' Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) in hopefully our final Trumpcast. They take one last look at Mr. Tinyfingers by looking at the 40% or so of people who are voting for him in a couple weeks no matter what. It's easy to pass them off as toothless rednecks, racist uncles and cartoonish extras from Daily Show segments, but they are real people who didn't come to support Trump out of nowhere. This cultural shift has been hiding in plain sight and the only problem was the left hadn't even bothered to look. By really dissecting the reasons for this social chasm, we'll prove that even the craziest of Trump supporters should actually be listened to, no matter how orange and absurd their political mouthpiece is.Footnotes:Cracked: How Half of America Lost Its F**king Mind:  https://goo.gl/KBJs5W Cracked Podcast: The 11 Nations of America:  https://goo.gl/dTJnm4 Cracked Podcast: Why Class in America Isn't Just About Income:  https://goo.gl/4juPht 2012 County-by-County Election Map:  https://goo.gl/EKH1xb Map of County-by-County Economic Growth:  https://goo.gl/u3vqyo This episode is brought to you by Harry\u2019s and Adam and Eve.", "duration": "01:49:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/289670538-crackedpod-trump-country.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 689900475, "seriesTitle": "The Cracked Podcast", "pubDate": 1476865969, "title": "Dark Secrets from the Teacher's Lounge", "author": "", "summary": "Did you ever have the sneaking suspicion that when your history teacher rolled out the old A/V cart for movie time that he was completely hungover?

A coked-up Harry Potter in his invisibility cloak? We have no idea. Scary.There was also the story of Major Henry Rathbone, the unfortunate fellow who took the invitation of Abraham Lincoln to see a play at Ford's Theater. Rathbone was so wracked by guilt over Lincoln's death that he straight-up turned into Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and slaughtered his whole family.

They'll discuss the thousands of missing people in our national parks and why the government may be covering it up, the French impostor who killed his entire family, the scary clowns that are tormenting America right now, the French Jack the Ripper and the famous serial killer H.H.

It's because studying humans is freaking impossible, and that's never going to change. When you're studying people, there's an endless amount of incalculable variables that make reaching a conclusion a futile undertaking. And even if you control for as many factors as you can think of, you still might not be able to account for your subjects' genetics or the very likely chance that they're just lying to you. \"Oh, my diet?

Gateway to the inside of your miiiiiiiind! Enemy of the maaaaan, maaaaan! Also, a thing that's been around for so long in human history, we don't even have an accurate date for when our ancestors started doing them. They've just been, for all we know, a common way to explore, escape and seek spiritual oneness for hundreds of thousands of years.Some great stuff has been conceived of while on psychedelics: while on LSD, Francis Crick conceived of the double-helix shape of DNA, Steve Jobs cites LSD as one of the major influences of his life's work, and some biblical scholars think the Bible may have been written with the aid of some magic mushrooms. So why does the government hate the stuff? Especially as more research is coming out that says that psilocybin (the active ingredient in mushrooms) does wonders for the terminally ill and MDMA may be the key to curing PTSD.On this week's podcast Jack O'Brien enlists the help of comic Shane Mauss and Cracked editor Robert Evans to find out. First Jack and Shane examine some of the medicinal effects of psychedelics, from mushrooms to DMT to MDMA, and talk about how America's war on drugs is prohibiting important research into these areas. Later, Robert Evans calls in to discuss how some ancient cultures got high and how an individual's reaction to drugs may not be chemical, but cultural.Also, make sure to come see our THREE live shows this October!First, at 9pm on Thursday, October 6th at the UCB Sunset Inner Sanctum, Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien take a behind-the-scenes look at America's most under-appreciated profession: teachers.

But in the fake Hollywood adaptation, \"Rome Wasn't Built in a Day,\" it's probably built over the course of a short montage set to peppy music, where it feels like it's built in 20 minutes.That's one of the subtle lies movies and TV imprint on our minds- that monumental things can be achieved in relatively short periods of time or with relatively little effort. Doc Brown hits his head and comes up with the idea for a time machine, and the hardest part is sourcing plutonium from a crew of gullible Libyan terrorists. This myth of invention affects how we look at history too. In our minds, Thomas Edison is a guy who just pulled the idea for the light bulb out of thin air (or from about 3 inches above his head, right after he thought of it), but he's just the guy who happened to invent the best one.These recurring myths are what we're talking about today. Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Alex Schmidt to talk about this invention myth, why we mistakenly think the President controls the economy, how we assume that there are real-life criminals like movie criminals and why a bomb with a timer on it is the stupidest idea in the world.Also, make sure to come see our THREE live shows this October!First, at 9pm on Thursday, October 6th at the UCB Sunset Inner Sanctum, Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien take a behind-the-scenes look at America's most underappreciated profession: teachers.

This month alone we've got 3 true story movies that shouldn't have much suspense to them: 'Sully' (the plane lands); 'Deepwater Horizon' (oil gets everywhere); and 'Snowden' (dude's in Russia).We've got a little hint for you, Hollywood: how about releasing a movie that isn't about something that happened, like, six seconds ago? History is full of amazing true stories and you're giving us a movie about the most unceremonious, bloodless and explosion-less crash in the history of aviation? Pshhh.This week we've got seven true stories for you that we promise would make better movies than 'Snowden': from the mad warring paleontologists who would rather burn down a museum than see each other gain a modicum of success, to the 10th century Slavic saint who murdered just everybody. Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim co-host live from the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles with Cracked guests Carmen Angelica, Tom Reimann and Alex Schmidt, and guest comedians Lindsay Adams, Sunah Bilsted, Eli Olsberg and Steven Wilber.Jack is also joined by Cracked writer and researcher Evan Caris to talk about a major world event that is always underserved in film: World War I.Footnotes:Salon Interview with Atilla Ambrus, The Whiskey Robber: http://goo.gl/FLsxwZBallad of the Whiskey Robber: https://goo.gl/vxlFswCracked: 6 People With WTF Secret Lives Absolutely Nobody Saw Coming: https://goo.gl/XBXQ7cBiography of Julie d'Aubigny: http://goo.gl/c6fyrw'60 Minutes' Clip with Jack Barsky: https://goo.gl/mZxy4LBiography of 'The Bone Wars': https://goo.gl/8mpfQUBiography of Olga of Kiev: https://goo.gl/XxM08MBiography of Sarah Jacob, The Fasting Girl: https://goo.gl/wlG4rqTom Reimann on Twitter: https://goo.gl/wgHhK2Carmen Angelica on Twitter: https://goo.gl/B7W9JRSteven Wilber on Twitter: https://goo.gl/4UNvFfLindsay Adams on Twitter: https://goo.gl/1L02UEAlex Schmidt on Twitter: https://goo.gl/y5P6YoEli Olsberg on Twitter: https://goo.gl/3eVRelSunah Bilsted on Twitter: https://goo.gl/3VgjE6This episode is sponsored by Casper Mattresses and Blue Apron.", "duration": "01:46:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/283549981-crackedpod-screw-sully-7-true-stories-that-would-make-better-movies.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 689900475, "seriesTitle": "The Cracked Podcast", "pubDate": 1473664002, "title": "Weird Hearing Super Powers You Didn't Know Your Mind Has", "author": "", "summary": "It's underestimated how important your sense of hearing is, how much it affects your daily life in ways you don't fully appreciate. Take the inconceivable geometry you do in your head all the time, thanks to your ears. Say you're standing with your back facing a street and you hear a car approaching from the right--how do you know that? Your brain is instantly calculating the miniscule differences in volume and the slight difference in time it takes for the sound of the car to reach both ears. Yes, thank you Captain Obvious, but it's still an amazing feat that you're performing all the time, every day, with everything you hear.You probably don't even know how much you hear every day, how unaccustomed to silence you actually are. Silence actually sounds weird, your brain knows something is wrong when it's absolutely quiet. Conversely, really loud places like cities take up so much of your subconscious mental capacities that they also create a sense of unnerving. That's why the sound of nature is so relaxing to us.On this week's podcast Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by actor/comedian Johnny Pemberton, whose podcast 'Twisting the Wind' is an incredible aural experiment, a constantly surprising manipulation of sound that pushes the boundaries of what's expected in a podcast. They talk about the power of noise pollution, incredible Tuvan throat singing rap music, how John Williams stole everything from Russian composers and sonic devices that mess with our heads like speech jammers and The Mosquito.Footnotes:Johnny Pemberton's Website:  http://goo.gl/bZ9Tv9 Twisting the Wind with Johnny Pemberton:  http://goo.gl/SzgA4H TED Talk on Noise Pollution:  https://goo.gl/YFtlrX Tuvan Throat Singing:  https://goo.gl/o7yX7h Tuvan Throat Singing Rap:  https://goo.gl/fV8RuQ The Best of Shostakovich:  https://goo.gl/kZp2aA Timmy Thomas - Why Can't We Live Together:  https://goo.gl/QlPFzP Pantera - Mouth for War:  https://goo.gl/MBE8pQ Trailer for Glenn Gould Documentary \"Genius Within\":  https://goo.gl/5OoTlN The Daily Beast: Slow TV:  http://goo.gl/0p8o6x In-Browser Speech Jammer:  https://goo.gl/Te4jr2 Reading Dr. Seuss with Speech Jammer:  https://goo.gl/TmFR68 Infrasound:  https://goo.gl/ZWe5ao The Mosquito:  https://goo.gl/YnYV8h Come see us at the Now Hear This podcast festival:  nowhearthisfest.com This episode is sponsored by Squarespace and Wealthfront Veritone.", "duration": "01:13:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/bf/e2/29/bfe229a7-6143-57f3-e75f-9dc5ad825431/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/282491813-crackedpod-weird-hearing-super-powers.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}]}
