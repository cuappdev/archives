Thousands of farmers, cooks and producers travel from 140 countries and five different continents to congregate in the northern Italian city of Turin. \n\nHundreds of thousands of people simply interested in food also travel from Italy and beyond to join in the spectacle; to watch events, join discussions and (importantly) experience the most diverse range of food and drink imaginable. \n\nThe biannual event is organised by the international Slow Food movement to raise awareness about issues around food and drink and to celebrate the diversity of food cultures around the world. It is also a unique opportunity to hear inspirational stories of how people produce and cook food. \n\nDan Saladino was there to collect as many stories as he could from around the world. Over two editions of The Food Programme he tells highlights from Terra Madre.\nIn this first programme the focus is on Africa and features the story of three people who in their home countries are trying to make a positive change through food.\n\nThe first comes from a village thousands of metres up within the highlands of south-eastern Ethiopia, Rira. There, honey producers use bamboo to create bee hives. They smoke the bark of a tree to \"perfume\" the hive and attract the bees. These long bamboo tubes are coated in leaves, sealed with animal manure and then placed 25m high up in trees among the rainforest canopy. \n\nIn recent years the honey they collect has been sold to the producers of a honey wine in Ethiopia which is both traditional and popular. However the prices paid for this hard to get honey have been low. \n\nTerra Madre is an opportunity for producers around the world to meet and exchange ideas and over the years the Rira villagers have met honey producers from Macedonia, Brazil, Japan and Indonesia. From this \"knowledge exchange\" the Rira were able to set up a co-operative, improve the quality of the honey and sell it in Ethiopia's biggest towns and cities. This has meant more people are now able to make a real living from honey production and remain in the village (and important opportunity when the country is seeing large numbers leave rural areas and move to the cities). \n\nThe second story comes from Uganda and is told by Edward Mukiibi who oversees Slow Food projects in the country. One of the most important involves the world's (and the UK's) most popular fruit, the banana. In Uganda 50 different varieties are used on a daily basis. Some are used to brew beers or distil drinks that feature in ceremonies. \n\nThe banana we know well in the UK is the Cavendish, the variety that has dominated the global trade for more than half a century. The fungal, Panama disease, has had an impact on Cavendish plantations around the world leading to reduced production in Australia and Asia. In Africa, more Cavendish plantations are being established. Edward explains in the programme why he's now on a mission to save Uganda's traditional banana varieties and protect the country's biodiversity. \n\nThe final story from Sierra Leone and is that of the experience of a child soldier who was involved in the violent civil war that tore the country apart in the 1990's. Ibrahim was abducted by the RUF rebel force at the age of nine. As he explains to Dan, he was involved in atrocities and had to fight against the government's forces in armed combat. For seven years he lived and fought with this rebel army. When he finally managed to escape he was rejected by his community. It became clear his return wouldn't would easy and forgiveness hard to win. \n\nIn the programme Ibrahim describes how food and farming was the key to his eventual redemption.\n\nPresented and produced by Dan Saladino. \n\nPhoto: Carla Capalbo.", "duration": "1654", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p04cbg8g.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1476057600, "title": "The Apple: How British a Fruit?", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "As apple fairs and celebrations are held all around the country, Sheila Dillon travels to an orchard in Devon for a conversation with drinks writer Pete Brown, who has just written a book about his two-year journey into all things apple: 'The Apple Orchard'.\n\nSheila and Pete are joined at Otter Farm by its owner - food grower and writer Mark Diacono.

He's spent 40 years on a mission to celebrate and protect brewing traditions - writing about brewing and beers including over 20 editions of the Good Beer Guide. Arguably what he was writing about then is what many hold important today - in both food and drink. His passion and excitement about innovation and new flavours hasn't waned. He took Sheila to one of his favourite local pubs to try some new local ales before sharing more about his life and career. \n\nHis writing saw him forge a path to parts of the world where few were travelling - including hunting out beers and brewers in Czechoslovakia before the fall of the Iron Curtain, his eyes were opened to Belgian beers and tastings through France, and across to the USA, all of which he shared with his readers. \n\nRoger has also worked for the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) since the 70s helping bring real ale back from the brink of extinction as a threatened minority drink to a thriving British craft industry. His work has also seen him fighting to help save pubs - to put it simply, 'no pub, no ale'. But his opinions haven't been without controversy and while he celebrates the rise of the microbrewers, CAMRA is now asking its members on whether it should remodel itself and embrace all beers and beer drinkers. \n\nPresented by Sheila Dillon.\nProduced in Bristol by Anne-Marie Bullock.", "duration": "1695", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p044cbpg.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1470614400, "title": "The Surprising Strawberry", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "2016's strawberry solstice fell as the UK's strawberry pickers embarked on a bigger crop than ever before.

She was keen to hear the experience of other runners and athletes and how they eat to run.\n\nDan hears from Kevin Currell, Head of Performance Nutrition at the English Institute of Sport, to find out about the dietary advice given to Britain's elite athletes. Adharanand Finn, author of 'Running with the Kenyans', shares his insights into running, racing and eating in Iten, the town where many of the world's most successful distance runners live and train. Kenyan runners eat a lot of ugali, a carbohydrate rich porridge made of maize flour and water.\n\nElsewhere however, others are arguing that a low-carb, high-fat diet will help runners reach peak performance. Author of Born to Run and Natural Born Heroes, Christopher McDougall, profiles diets based on this principle, that fuelled long runs by resistance fighters during the Second World War and early Iron Man events in the 1980's. It's a controversial approach and many believe it's just the latest food fad to be picked up by people in the running world.\n\nThe programme also features Scott Jurek who eats a carbohydrate rich, vegan diet.

Dan Saladino asks how those from Syria - the world's biggest producer of both internally displaced people and refugees - manage to eat and feed their families and the cost and long-term effects of both the conflict and displacement.\n\nSyria has an ancient food culture and was once a bread basket for the Middle East but conflict has damaged agriculture and food supplies to many areas. The World Food Programme explain how they manage to transport food through territory occupied by so-called 'Islamic State' and also how they feed the thousands in refugee camps in bordering countries like Jordan.\n\nDan hears from one refugee who paid traffickers to get him to Europe after he was threatened by IS and the Assad regime.

He was a Sicilian and communist who believed the best way of taking on Cosa Nostra was by seizing its assets, including its farm land.\nDecades later that law is the way in which thousands of acres of citrus groves, wheat fields and vineyards have been placed in the hands of farming co-operatives. Libera Terra is the main organisation helping to turn this seized land into a food and wine business, create jobs and give young Sicilians a way of improving the island's future.\n\nAs John Dickie, Professor of Italian Studies at University College London, and author of Cosa Nostra: A History of the Sicilian Mafia, food and agricultural provided the conditions necessary for the mafia's birth in 19th century Sicily. \n\nBy the 1860's the lemon groves around Palermo were among the most profitable agricultural land in Europe, that combined with the weak political and legal framework in place after the unification of Italy, provided the conditions for what became the world's most successful criminal organisation.\n\nIn the 1940's, when efforts were made to instigate land reform and give more access to farmland to Sicily's peasants, the mafia would often intervene and exert its control over this valuable resource. Dozens of peasant leaders and trade unionists were killed in the years following the second world war simply because they tried to implement these new laws.\n\nIt's this backdrop that gives the Libera Terra project added significance, but it's more than just a noble cause. As Italian wine expert and writer for www.jancisRobinson.com Walter Speller explains, some of the confiscated land is in territory that has the perfect conditions for excellent wines.

She left America in the early 1960's and has now lived in Sicily for 50 years.\n\nSicily has one of the oldest, continuous, food cultures in western Europe. Invasions, conquests and Mediterranean trade led to influences being exerted by the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Spanish and French. That combined with an abundance of sun and fertile soil has given it one of the most important and delicious food stories to tell.\n\nWith a Sicilian father, and extended family, Dan spent a lot of his childhood staying with his grandmother, watching home cooks in action, visiting markets and eating in espresso fuelled bars. For many years traditional Sicilian foods like caponata, cannoli, arancini and pasta con le sarde, were enjoyed but not fully understood. Sicily remained a mysterious place with an equally mysterious array of foods.\n\nIn the last in the series in which presenters meet their food heroes Dan meets Mary Taylor Simeti at her home and farm on the outskirts of Palermo. Her series of books on Sicily and its food provided the first detailed insights into this ancient cuisine in the English language.\n\nShe started to write in the early 1980's, \"On Persephone's Island\" is a personal account of life on a family farm and of life lived near Palermo. It was a violent time in the city's history, a period now known as the \"second mafia war\". The book weaves in snapshots of that side of Sicily, but also captures the changing seasons on the farm, olive and grape harvests, religious festivals that feature food rituals and first-hand accounts of traditional lives lived on the land and producing ingredients.\n\nIt was followed by \"Pomp and Sustenance: 25 Centuries of Sicilian Food\", a book that explores the island's cuisine from the classical world right up to her own experiences of food among family and friends. A third book, \"Bitter Almonds\" told the story of Maria Grammatico, who grew up as an orphan in a convent, trained to make intricate biscuits, cakes and sculpted almond paste. The book explains how from a Dickensian childhood she'd produce the most skilfully made and delicious foods.\n\nMary Taylor Simeti's work not only helped Dan make sense of all the food, cooking and festivals he saw around him, but also helped chefs including Giorgio Locatelli have a better understanding of Italian food. \n\nMary explains how she left a life in Manhattan that seemed destined for an academic career to life on a Sicilian farm documenting one of the world's most colourful food stories.

Meanwhile we hear about the new tech which is enabling wine enthusiasts to gen up on wines and form their own opinions and ask is branding is putting style over substance. \n\nSheila Dillon asks if the slow moving world of wine is seeing its own revolution and if these new ideas can open the world of wine to more enthusiasts. \n\nPresented by Sheila Dillon, Produced in Bristol by Anne-Marie Bullock.", "duration": "1684", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02wl3hz.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1436140800, "title": "Feeding the Commons - Part II: Lunch to Lights Out", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "Following the food operation at the centre of British politics.

A global project called the Ark of Taste is now attempting to catalogue traditional ingredients in more than 100 countries. \n\nIt was started in the 1990s when a group of Italian Slow Food campaigners realised the flavour of a traditional street food snack had changed. The reason was that chefs could no longer source a local variety of pepper. It's led to thousands of people all over the world submitting their local traditional varieties of fruits and vegetables, rare breeds of livestock, cheeses and other products into the Ark. \n\nAs the leader of the project Serana Milano explains it's not just a list. Once an ingredient is placed in the catalogue work begins to find ways of saving it. An early example was a traditional cheese that was being made by one elderly producer. The Ark project led to a group of young producers learning how to make the cheese and so the recipe and technique has been kept alive.\n\nSlow Food is now working with the European Commission, United Nations and Google to record the stories from the Ark of Taste and support projects to keep food diversity thriving around the world.\n\nAs Dan explains earlier examples of this work can be found across the UK going back more than a century. Writers including Florence White (Good Things In England), Dorothy Hartley (Food in England) and F.

Sheila Dillon asks if the humble egg is breaking free of a tarnished reputation and proving itself to be a versatile protein provider worth celebrating. \n\nShe hears reports from US where yolk-dodgers have demanded white-only 'heart healthy omelettes' and similar concoctions while in Silicon Valley a 'solution' to the egg has been created in a plant protein based alternative which they claim can mimic many of the egg's functions. \n\nBut back in the UK she finds a more celebratory atmosphere - a major retailer has begun supplying guaranteed double yolkers, Neil Rankin, founder of 'Bad Egg' Restaurant has kept his supplier in steady business while Genevieve Taylor found her hens laid so many she had to create new recipes to use them all. \nHas the egg been given too much of a bad rap and is now breaking free and what does the future hold? \n\nPresented by Sheila Dillon and Produced in Bristol by Anne-Marie Bullock.", "duration": "1683", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02qf6zs.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1427673600, "title": "Sweet Britain", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "The nutritional debate over sugar doesn't seem to be putting off a new generation of sweet makers in this country.

In the 1970's it captured headlines for a \"burn for hate\" policy that appeared to have taken hold; abandoned (and sometimes occupied) buildings were set on fire and raised to the ground. Entire blocks were destroyed giving the borough, in some eyes, the look of a war zone.\n\nIn recent years the changes that have unfolded in the Bronx have been significant. In part the progress made, making the area more desirable to live in, and home to a more united community, can be put down to food. New York City has had a network of public gardens where food can be grown dating back to the 1880's but in recent years, this resource has taken on new meaning, and in the Bronx it's changed lives.\n\nSheila Dillon meets Karen Washington a woman who's using food and farming to transform her part of the Bronx through \"the Garden of Happiness\", a three-quarter acre abandoned lot that she turned into an \"urban farm\" back in 1988. It's gone from strength to strength and this garden, in which Mexicans, African-American, Asian and Caribbean neighbours come together to grow food, has changed a part of the south Bronx for good.\n\nIn the programme Karen Washington explains why the garden has not only become a valuable source of fresh food but has also helped solve many of the social issues in the neighbourhood. \n\nSheila also speaks to Marcel Van-Ooyen, head of Grow NYC, a part of the Mayor's office in New York, to hear how the city's gardens have also become part of an anti-obesity strategy. \n\nProducer: Dan Saladino.", "duration": "1674", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02q2yp0.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1416787200, "title": "Get Ahead Treats for Christmas", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "Sheila Dillon invites Diana Henry to provide a guide to an Eastern Christmas.

As our consumption of chicken increases and UK poultry production intensifies, Dan Saladino looks at the modern poultry industry.\n\nTwo recent events have brought the production of chicken into sharp focus. The first is an investigation by the Guardian's Special Correspondent Felicity Lawrence into allegations of hygiene failings at major production plants.\n\nIt was a serious claim as poultry production is already under scrutiny because of the presence of campylobacter in most chicken, a bacteria that can cause food poisoning.\n\nThe report triggered a call by the Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, for checks on two factories. The company involved strongly denied any problems had taken place, subsequent checks by the Food Standards Agency found no breaches and the plants were given the all clear. However the episode brought poultry production under national scrutiny.\n\nDan is given full access to the production line of one of the plants involved. Based in Scunthorpe it's the largest poultry slaughter house in the UK and is owned by the largest supermarket chicken supplier 2 Sisters. They explain how our chicken is produced and what kind of measures are in place to reduce levels of campylobacter.\n\nThe second story that brought poultry to renewed national attention was a recent decision by the Food Standards Agency on its plans to publish data revealing which supermarkets had the highest levels of campylobacter in their supply chains. In March it was announced that the agency was pushing ahead with \"steely determination\" to publish the names and levels of the bacteria. In July that decision was reversed and that data might not be available for another year.

Establishing a vineyard also requires a big capital investment; one adage used to be that if you wanted to make a moderate amount of money the way to do it would be to have a large amount of money and then plant a vineyard. This may be part of the reason why the wine produced in England and Wales accounts for less than 1% of that consumed here. \n\nDespite all of this, the acreage of vineyards in England has doubled in the last 7 years and there are some producers aiming to produce an unheard of million bottles a year.

Tim introduces us to some specific examples of how that tradition is thriving today. Giorgio Locatelli and food historian Mary Taylor Simeti explain how an array of recipes for sublime biscuits and pastries made by Sicilian nuns have survived for centuries, due in no small way to a woman called Maria Grammatico who went to live in a convent where Nuns would live out their final days. She would collect their recipes and she went on to become one of the most famous makers of Sicilian pastries. Giorgio Locatelli lovingly recreates some of those sumptuous treats in his Locanda restaurant today. We visit the New Skete Nuns in New York who have featured in the New York Times and Vanity Fair with their famous cheesecakes. Tim talks to food historian Annie Gray who reminds him of the overall impact of the monastic orders on food production but who also cautions us not to get too carried away with the idea of continuity. We hear from the writer, Madeline Scherb, who went on her own pilgrimage around the world to cook and pray with some monks and nuns; recalling the chanting of the Hail Mary on a caramel production line. She explains how St Benedict himself was not able to persuade his own monks to abstain completely from alcohol, and so the tradition of producing liquors of all sorts is one of the longest surviving strands of monastic production. In the UK, that includes the famous Ampleforth abbey ciders and beers. And there's Buckfast tonic wine from Devon; a drink that has attracted controversy in some areas.

Raw milk producers are subject to stringent and regular laboratory tests and their products have to carry a warning on the label that the milk may contain properties that are harmful. But there is a growing demand for raw milk in the UK and means of supply are testing the current rules ; The FSA recently threatened prosecution over the presence of a vending machine selling raw milk in Selfridges. Advocates argue that raw milk has many positive health benefits that are lost with pasteurisation. The debate for some is about the right of the individual to choose what risks they take. Balancing that demand with the need to protect public health is the challenge the Food Standards Agency faces. In America, the libertarian argument is even more polarised. With the prices paid for pasteurised milk being on a seemingly downward trajectory in the UK, and with internet shopping making a mockery of distribution rules, Sheila will get the views of all the interested parties.

Sheila finds out how they've done this, and asks what other schools can learn from their approach.\n\nSheila also asks the Plan's co-author Henry Dimbleby and Jeanette Orrey, who inspired Jamie Oliver's original school food campaign, what actual differences we may see on the ground as a result of this new attempt to change the way that schoolchildren eat.\n\nPresenter: Sheila Dillon\nProducer: Rich Ward.", "duration": "1682", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02q30qr.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1379808000, "title": "A Quiet Food Revolution: The Story of Myrtle and Darina Allen", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "Myrtle and Darina Allen, revolutionised food in Ireland with their cooking.

People lose both their appetite and their sense of taste. But food and cooking can also play a positive and healing role in helping individuals come to term with their loss. Sheila Dillon explores the healing power of food and how it can help to remember and recapture memories of those who have died.\n\nSheila visited the Hospice of St Francis in Berkhamsted which runs cookery courses for those who've been bereaved. Some of those taking part had lost the will to cook - especially the prospect of making meals for one rather than two. Others found they'd lost the partner or parent who'd made all the meals and found themselves not only grieving but without the knowledge and skills to cook for themselves.

Professor Erik Millstone, an expert on the UK's food safety system, believes this could result in an increase in risk from food borne illness. \n\nAlready rates of Campylobacter, a bacterial form of food poisoning, are on the rise and so any future safety regime will have that as one of its main priorities. \n\nSheila Dillon interviews Tim Smith, Chief Executive of the Food Standards Agency, about the cuts, the FSA's review and if economic pressures could lead to an increase in risk to our health.\n\nProducer: Dan Saladino.", "duration": "1690", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02q34db.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1329609600, "title": "Food Clubs", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "Sheila Dillon looks at how people are clubbing together to buy budget and luxury food.\n\nProducer: Maggie Ayre.", "duration": "1653", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02q34ds.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1329004800, "title": "Comfort Food", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "In these uncomfortable times, Sheila Dillon asks what role does food play in giving comfort? \n\nProducer: Sara Parker.", "duration": "1687", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/90/6c/29/906c291c-70fa-9a3c-a5c8-39e945a8f5eb/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02q34f3.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 342927791, "seriesTitle": "Food Programme", "pubDate": 1328400000, "title": "Adventures in Vegetarian Cuisine", "author": "BBC Radio 4", "summary": "Meat-free cooking is in the spotlight.

But more recently people have been reaching out for more interesting and complex flavours to replace the neutral taste of vodka. Gin was perfect.\n\nFrom as far back as the 12th century apothecaries had used juniper and its coniferous flavours in spirits to heal and revive. By the 17th century the Dutch had given us Geneva or Holland Gin, a rough, whisky like spirit with juniper at its base. As distilling techniques developed in the 19th century it became the refined gin we know today with juniper flavours being delicately mixed with botanicals like coriander, cinnamon, ginger and Orris.\n\nIt's the challenge of blending and experimenting with these flavours that has attracted a new generation of gin distillers.

In the late 19th century nearly 20 thousand tonnes of sardine was caught, salted, packed and sent to northern Italy where it was highly prized.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century the fish had fallen out of favour. Supplies of the fish were still abundant but consumers had started to switch to more aspirational fish like cod and salmon. Sardines being landed fell below 10 tonnes. Fisherman gave up the profession, boats were destroyed and processing plants closed.\n\nNow with concerns over global stocks, one solution is for more of us to switch to \"poorer\" more abundant fish species like the sardine and pilchard. \n\nChef Sanjay Kumar, born in Calcutta and now based in Cornwall, wants to help make that happen. He moved to the county five years ago, fell in love with Cornish food and its fishing traditions.\n\nIn May Sanjay travelled to a bi-annual event held in Italy called Slow Fish. It brings together fishermen, chefs, policy experts and fish scientists, all keen to promote small scale, traditional and sustainable forms of fishing. His mission was to use the event to find new ideas to help revive Cornish fishing tradition.\n\nAs well as cooking a traditional Italian sardine dish, meeting fellow campaigning chefs, Sanjay also gets to interview the European Union's Fisheries Commissioner, Maria Damanaki.
