I have since landed a job and have been working for about 4 months now. Prior to graduating college, I was much less educated on money matters and hardly mindful about my personal finances. Upon graduating, I realized that I knew next to nothing about budgeting, saving, investing, and growing wealth. Additionally, many technical terms and aspects of finance confused me. Since I was going to be getting a \u201creal job\u201d soon and making more money than I ever have before, I decided to self-educate and rid myself of financial ignorance. I began reading books, blogs, watching YouTube videos, and listening to podcasts. I now find myself in a much better position to make sound monetary decisions.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Here is my current situation:</em><br /> <em>I live at home with my parents rent free.</em><br /> <em>I am extremely fortunate to have no debt from college.</em><br /> <em>I have no debt.</em><br /> <em>I work a full time job and save virtually all of that money. I work a part time job and use that money as my \u201cspending money.\u201d</em><br /> <br /> <em>Essentially, I am blessed to have a blank slate coming out of college.</em><br /> <br /> <em>The downside of my equation is that my full time job does not pay particularly well ~$31,000 a year and I live in an area with a high cost of living (northern VA).</em><br /> <br /> <em>Do you have any advice for someone like me who is just getting started in the real world and wants to begin a path to financial independence?</em><br /> <br /> <em>I do realize that a huge step would be to find a better paying job \u2013 I am working on that. However what would you suggest that I do in the meantime to add additional income and begin my journey to FI?</em><br /> <br /> <em>My goal is not to make this all about making more money, but rather to position myself in such a way that I can live life the way that I want. ALSO I want to be in a position where I can easily provide advice and assistance to those who are less well off than I am.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Thank you in advance for any advice that you can provide!</em></p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Joshua</p> <ul> <li>Please support Radical Personal Finance on Patreon! <a href=\"http://www.radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\">www.radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a></li> </ul>", "duration": "32:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0431-FI_Plan_for_a_22-Year-Old_College_Grad.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1488210521, "title": "430-Should A Retiring Naval Officer Invest in Real Estate or Do Something Else?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today, I answer this question from a listener:</p> <p><em>Joshua- Fan of the show and a Naval Officer.

I've had no problem with it.\u00a0<a href=\"http://rpf.link/2dO4v0Y\">http://rpf.link/2dO4v0Y</a></li> <li>I also own the <a href=\"http://rpf.link/2dP9SJF\">RAVPower 13000 mAH External Battery Power Pack</a>. It works perfectly fine and is smaller and lighter than the Kmashi above. (This is the one that I prefer to carry in my pocket while traveling. The Kmashi above is too big to be comfortable in my pocket.) It should get you about 4 charges. But, at $27 on Amazon, it doesn't give you as much bang for the buck.\u00a0<a href=\"http://rpf.link/2dP9SJF\">http://rpf.link/2dP9SJF</a>\u00a0</li> </ul> </li> <li>Steven Harris has more information on keeping your cell phone charged at his excellent site: <a href=\"http://www.cellphone1234.com\">www.cellphone1234.com</a>\u00a0I chose to buy different batteries than he recommended because they were cheaper (but still highly rated) when I was shopping.</li> <li>The Berkey water filter system that we own and use is this one:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.directive21.com/products/royal-berkey-system/\">http://www.directive21.com/products/royal-berkey-system/</a>\u00a0(This is where we bought it from--Directive 21 did a fine job with service.)

at 30", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I received the note below from a listener of my show and today I answer it!</p> <p>Enjoy,</p> <p>Joshua</p> <p>-----<br /> <br /> Hi Mr. Sheats!<br /> <br /> I'm a home educated 13-year-old fan of your podcast.\u00a0 I love how in-depth, interesting, and out-of-the-box it is.\u00a0 I used to listen to the Dave Ramsey Show a lot, but that got really bland, so my dad suggested your show.\u00a0 I love it!<br /> I've been listening pretty much daily since January of this year, and you've inspired me to become financially independent before age 30.\u00a0 Right now, I'm saving 70% of my income from working at my parents' dental office and trying to develop skills that will get me closer to that goal (such as math, coding, and finance, all things I love learning about and think have the best potential to help me become financially independent).<br /> <br /> Do you have any advice for a thirteen-year-old listener like me?<br /> <br /> As for a specific question, I was wondering whether you would recommend I continue doing high school at home or attending our local public school.<br /> <br /> I'm really interested in taking CLEP classes since those could help me finish college faster.<br /> <br /> As far as I can tell, the pros of public school are:</p> <ul> <li>I'm pretty extroverted, so being able to hang out with friends every day sounds fun (although I'm sure high school isn't just hanging out!).<br /> The high school in our district is ranked 10/10, so it's supposed to be a good school academically.</li> <li>It might be a good way to get a feel for going to a \"normal\" school and make getting used to staying at the teacher's pace, and other skills I might need for college easier.</li> <li>The transcript is automatic, but in home education, you have to detail everything yourself and make sure it fits with requirements.</li> </ul> <p><br /> Cons:</p> <ul> <li>I love being home educated!</li> <li>I'm an independent learner, and I can learn faster just reading something and taking a test than sitting in class for an hour.</li> <li>I'd probably have less time in a public school as opposed to home education.\u00a0 Other than hanging out with friends, writing my fantasy novel, and playing music, I want to spend my free time as a homeschooler learning skills, experimenting with starting a business, and studying CLEP.</li> <li>I'd have to stick with the class, but with home education, everything's based on your pace, so you can go faster.</li> <li>I love how we can take vacations or days off sporadically, but in public school, with such long summer breaks, etc, you can't miss a day comfortably.</li> <li>I'd have to wake up early (;</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for all your time!</p> <ul> <li>Support RPF on

Focus on how you say it instead of what to say.\nEngage people, not thinking about what you\u2019re going to say, but\nabout how they\u2019re feeling and responding to what you say. Have a\nscript and know your script. Focus on internalizing the words until\nyou forget about the words and dig into the delivery.</li>\n<li>Know where to lead people.

If you are a person worth referring to, you won\u2019t need\nany tricks or gimmicks. Good technique is important for good\nsalespeople. Do both good work and great technique.

My Own Experiences from the Trenches!", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today,\u00a0I respond in detail to this question from a listener:</p>\n<p><em>Hi Joshua,</em></p>\n<p><em>I have been really into personal finance for about 5 years now and am\u00a0considering becoming a financial advisor, specifically with a large company like you used to work for.</em></p>\n<p><em>I am currently a 31 year old physician making around $150,000. I have spent a long time preparing for my career, but I am always drawn to becoming a financial advisor. </em></p>\n<p><em>The medical field is becoming increasingly draining with charting, liability, decreasing reimbursement, increased regulations etc. </em></p>\n<p><em>The problem is in my career I can only make so much money. I can see some more patients everyday, but eventually you can only work so much and with that will just take more time. </em></p>\n<p><em>I already work from 8am-8pm everyday not even including my commute. More patients would just add more time to that. Quite frankly, with the liability and difficult patients I see all the time, I don't think I am paid enough of a premium to take on the risks I take. </em></p>\n<p><em>I know everyone says they aren't paid enough, but I can literally be sued for anything, especially the surgeries I do. In addition, the aggravation of arguing with some patients on deductibles they owe, co pays etc. I don't know if you know what its like to argue with someone about a $32 bill after giving them necessary medical services because they have \"insurance\" and feel they are entitled to everything medically related for free, but it is draining.</em></p>\n<p><em>I would love to hear your thoughts on becoming a financial advisor\u00a0with a company like you were with. </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>What were the pros and cons? </em></li>\n<li><em>What kind of income can I expect and within how long? I have spoken to a few agents, but I know you will give me the \"real\" story. </em></li>\n<li><em>What was a day like for you? </em></li>\n<li><em>When did you really start taking off with your career there? </em></li>\n<li><em>Do a lot of people not make it? Why not? </em></li>\n<li><em>How do you actually make money as an advisor? Consulting fees? Ongoing commissions? Upfront fees for selling something? </em></li>\n<li><em>Do you develop a niche or do everything? Estate planning, group benefits, just individual consultation, etc.?</em></li>\n<li><em>I always imagine being in a nice, clean office, creating a plan for people's finances. Is there a bad side to the business in terms of lifestyle? </em></li>\n<li><em>Is it really difficult finding clients? I know there are hundreds of thousands of advisors so there is a lot of competition.</em></li>\n<li><em>Does the location\u00a0where you practiced as a financial advisor make a big difference in income/quality of life and if there is a big gap in income between places like West Palm Beach, FL vs Dallas, TX vs Northern Virginia near DC, etc. </em></li>\n<li><em>Also, is it easy to transition from one location to another once you get started or is that a huge set back?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>I am a religious listener to your show.

I think you could potentially provide some good advice that I'd love to hear answered in an upcoming podcast if possible...</em><br /><br /><em>\"Since discovering your podcast I've completely changed my thoughts on savings and consumption. I've always lived pretty frugally (I thought) but it turns out I was making poor decisions all along. I bought a house last year thinking that was a fool proof way to hang on to my money. I only just ran the numbers this month since I've discovered your podcasts on homeownership, and I've discovered I would have been much better off renting. I've also cut my cell phone bill in half (still $70/month though) and cut back on my weekend golf habit which I was spending about $200/month on. In place of that I've decided to train for a triathlon which is free since I already have a decent road bike. So thank you for all those tips on saving! I'm continuing to find ways to save.</em><br /><br /><em>\"My situation that I'd like your advice on is my current job. I'm an engineer making just south of $200,000/year. I'm working at a nuclear power plant in the middle of no where in Georgia. The closest town is Augusta\u00a0which is still a 50+ minute commute each way (I'm single, 30 years old, and living in a trailer in the woods near the plant wouldn't going to help that situation). I'm working 50 hours/week plus the commute and 30 minute unpaid lunch break. My entire week is consumed by work and travel to work. This is a paperwork heavy desk job which brings me zero fulfillment. I would love to quit and chase short term seasonal outage work but my dividend/investment income isn't nearly enough to live off and I can't justify turning down this kind of steady income stream. I'm miserable but well paid. I'm afraid that if I quit, my experience level isn't enough to land me the highly sought after seasonal work I'd be trying to get. I believe you were likely in a similar pay scale when you quit your job and since your situation was similar to mine is I'd like your advice as to how to get more enjoyment out of life and work.</em><br /><br /><em>\"Love the podcast!\"</em></p>\n<p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get a $100 bonus when you open an account at TradeKing: <a href=\"http://www.tradeking.com/radical\" target=\"_blank\">www.tradeking.com/radical</a></li>\n<li>Support Radical Personal Finance on Patreon! <a href=\"http://www.radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\" target=\"_blank\">www.radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a>\u00a0</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "54:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0302-200k_and_Miserable.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1456440915, "title": "301-Careers, Entrepreneurship, and Raising Entrepreneurial Kids: Interview with Dan Miller from 48 Days to the Work You Love", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I'm up here in Nashville, TN at the moment and had the opportunity to connect with Dan Miller from <em>48 Days to the Work You Love</em>.</p>\n<p>Dan is a legend in the career advice business.

This book is a broad, useful introduction to the topic.</p>\n<p>All else being equal, people would rather spend time with, work with, buy from, and help those that they like. The skill of being likeable and helping people to like you is thus a very useful life skill and can be an important component of your success toolbox.</p>\n<p>Boothman establishes two beautiful aspects to being likeable:</p>\n<p>1. It\u2019s a learned skill. This means that no matter who you are and where you\u2019re starting from, you can improve and develop your skills so that others like you more and more quickly.</p>\n<p>2. It\u2019s an honest and ethical practice. Even though the title has the typical \u201cself-help schmarminess,\u201d there is nothing tricky or conniving about the tools and tactics in the book. You would want everyone in your life to understand the concepts of this book and to practice them continually in their relationship with you. Ultimately, likeability largely boils down to active listening and we all crave friends who are careful, active listeners.</p>\n<p>This book is not deep. Boothman doesn\u2019t dig into science research or discuss a lot of history. Rather, it\u2019s useful and practical. You can immediately learn and apply the content. I appreciate that!</p>\n<p>I listened to the audiobook version and I enjoyed listening to it in the author\u2019s own voice. He does an excellent job conveying the emotion and tone of his work.</p>\n<p>However, I purchased the written version so that I would be able to access the outline and notes for reference and so that I could do some of the exercises contained within it.</p>\n<p>The book was published in 2000, so there are plenty of used copies available for $0.01.

And can a person do it on their own without relying on a firm to do it for them?</li>\n<li>Thought you should know something I recently found out. California child labor laws no longer apply once you have graduated from high school. \u00a0In addition, California has a method to graduate by exam (similar to a GED, but GEDs are only available to those 18 or older). \u00a0The high school proficiency exam (which is easy) can be taken by anyone who is 16 or older or who has completed 10th grade or will have completed 10th grade by the end of the academic year in which they take the test.\u00a0My son, who is 15 1/2 and in 10th grade, took the exam and passed it. Nothing prevents him from continuing on in high school, but he's no longer subject to child labor laws.\u00a0He's seriously considering switching to community college in September, doing that for 2 years, and then transferring to a University of California campus to finish off his college. \u00a0That'd get him a solid college degree by the time he's 19. During that entire time, he'd be eligible to work whatever hours he wants.\u00a0Another option we're considering is self-study (with my help; I used to be a Computer Science professor), taking a bunch of AP exams, and then entering UC at age 18 with at least one year (and possibly more) of credits.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Joshua,\u00a0Can you weigh in on your thought about being an accredited investor\u00a0and the legal limitations around it? \u00a0As I understand it, I do not\u00a0qualify as an accredited investor. \u00a0And certain investments cannot be\u00a0invested in by those who are not accredited. \u00a0however, apparently the\u00a0rules were supposed to have changed to allow people to make\u00a0investments of these kinds without the government saying that I have\u00a0to make X amount or have X amounts of savings. \u00a0but, as I learned by\u00a0listening to the podcast Startup (episode 7) by alex blumberg, these\u00a0rules have changed with the JOBS ACT, but the FCC has been sitting on\u00a0the ruling and is way overdue for implementing it so that someone like\u00a0me can invest in these previously off limits investments without being\u00a0told that we can't. \u00a0That episode of startup really explained a lot to\u00a0me, because I had wanted to invest a large amount with alex after\u00a0listening to the very first episode of startup (i assumed he would be\u00a0very successful because I've loved his stuff for years and he's\u00a0leveraging some seriously big friends for his new venture), but I\u00a0couldn't invest in something I really thought was going to be a huge\u00a0success (or at least provide me with good cashflow) because of these\u00a0rules. \u00a0I'm also about curious why these rules exist. \u00a0Were they\u00a0implimented to protect people from being scammed out of their \u00a0money?</li>\n<li>Joshua,\u00a0As a young engineer, who is single, making a salary of over $80,000 in Texas (no state income tax): Should I max out my 401k if my goal is to become very wealthy, before age 40? Or, should I invest some in my 401k and invest the rest in REITs/other, more risky assets. Of course, along the way, I will be very frugal, and live way below my means.

This morning I just signed up via Patreon to support your show. It's a small amount, but one important thing I've learnt on my PF journey is learning to pay for value rather than simply focusing on cost.\u00a0I have a question which relates to the investment part of building wealth. How should I invest an idle USD$20,000 that's sitting around in my savings account for maximum returns? I feel I'm sufficiently exposed to the stock market at this stage and diversified enough within and outside the publicly traded securities realm. I don't want to pour money into publicly traded stocks as due to mean reversion, future returns tend to be lower when markets are at highs. Please feel free to suggest the most radical ideas you have - that's why I love the show! Some background on myself:\u00a0I'm 28 years old living in Singapore.\u00a0My marginal tax rate is 7% but we are forced to contribute 20% to our own tax-free housing/medical/retirement accounts.\u00a0Annual take home salary (post taxes and retirement etc contributions) is about USD$50,000.\u00a0Invested USD$60,000 in semi diversified stocks, ETFs and REITs.\u00a0USD$20,000 in alternative non-publicly traded investments.\u00a0Have 6 months emergency fund.\u00a0Have a 30 year level term insurance for USD $400,000.\u00a0Time horizon: >20 years.\u00a0I consider myself an aggressive investor willing to take large risk on small sums of money for the potential return, if the mathematics are in my favor (eg NO lotteries, YES to EM stocks).\u00a0I know it's hard to provide investment suggestions without knowing the nuances of each individual situation. Right off the bat I know I should be focusing on: increasing my salary/earning potential and starting a side business.\u00a0Should I be getting more insurance coverage?\u00a0Should I be maxing out retirement accounts when my marginal tax rate is only 7%?\u00a0Is there anything else I'm missing? As a goal oriented person (and my goal is to reach FI fast!), I can't stand the fact that my money is idling in my savings account earning a negative real rate of return.\u00a0Keep doing great work!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support Radical Personal Finance on Patreon!\u00a0<a href=\"http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\" target=\"_blank\">http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "01:09:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0201-Friday_QA.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1432206000, "title": "200-My Podcasting Equipment, Workflow, and Lessons Learned From 200 Episodes", "author": "", "summary": "<p>From time to time, I receive questions from listeners about the equipment that I use to produce my show.

I originally started listening because I have an interest in one day becoming a personal finance consultant, but that's a long way off, for now I just need help with a crazy student loan issue! I am currently paying almost $600 a month for a $102k student loan at 7%, couple of key things, credit is shot due to bk filed last year, the loan is with the nelnet through dept of Ed, the question is should I pay down the loan, or find an investment that will pay me $600 to offset payment? Right now the $600 is preventing me from moving forward on anything financial, I'm expecting a lump some of money in February, like $60k, I would love to invest it where I can earn $600 or more a month to offset the payment! Any ideas?</li>\n<li><strong>28:56</strong>\u00a0Joshua,\u00a0I recently stumbled upon your podcast and just started listening to it from the very beginning. Your approach to each podcast has been a from a very practical point of view which I really appreciate and hence enjoy listening to it! Please keep up the great work!\u00a0At the time of writing this, I just finished with the episode \"rfp-0009 - Why is your house a terrible investment.\" I myself am in the stage of having signed a contract on a home and waiting for closing date. All through the show James and yourself have made many, many valid points. I myself have already tracked down my cost (also factoring in an average monthly maintenance expense) to owning a home in an excel spreadsheet and even-though most often than not, one usually tends to buy a home which is slightly bigger in area that the what one was renting (same with me), the numbers for buying a home vs renting still look better (to me) in the long run. I live in the slightly expensive Northern VA area.\u00a0I have been renting for the last 7.5 years (in various capacities from being a full-time student to full-time employee to full-time employee + part-time student) and can definitely say that annual rent increase adds up over each year. In order to keep the rents at a reasonable rates you will have to move every 2 or 3 years. This would add moving expenses, cleaning expenses, security deposits and a peace-less mind to your rent calculations. But this has not been factored into the James' calculations. Yes, when you own a home your property taxes may also go up as the home appreciates, but this won't be as much as how much the rent would increase year-in year-out. Also your home may or may not appreciate every year for this to happen.\u00a0Would like to know what your comments are to this.</li>\n<li><strong>36:09</strong> Joshua,\u00a0I have a 1 year old son and am married. \u00a0My wife is in school earning her PhD. \u00a0Can my wife and I create two separate 529 plans to double our tax benefits (one in my son's name and one for my wife)? \u00a0Indiana's benefit is 20% tax credit ($1000 max credit). \u00a0If not should we create a 529 anyway? \u00a0We have the money to pay for her $30,000 education already saved to be spread over the next 3 years. \u00a0Thoughts?</li>\n<li><strong>40:06</strong> Joshua,\u00a0My parents just recently started working with a fee-only financial adviser after their recent retirement. She has been doing a nice job with them so far helping them come up with their financial goals, seeing if they are able to achieve them with their current assets, and choosing the most appropriate Social Security choice for their needs and goals. I have been attending the meetings with them.\u00a0Either in the next meeting or the meeting after, the question of converting their traditional IRA to a Roth IRA will come up. Other than their paid-off house, most of their portfolio is in traditional IRAs. She is of the belief that it doesn't make sense to convert any of the traditional IRA to Roth because they don't have the taxable funds to pay the necessary taxes. I'm of the opinion that since the income they currently receive from their IRAs is well under the $74,900 limit (filing jointly) keeping them in the 25% bracket, that they should convert some of it and pay the 25% tax rate before they have to start taking much larger RMDs in the future at higher tax rates. Of course that also ignores future potential tax hikes. They understand the benefits of having some flexibility for the future as well as the benefits of passing a Roth to me and my sister on their deaths (another one of their goals).\u00a0The question I have is: What are the appropriate questions to ask the financial advisor as to how to look into whether converting makes sense outside of the generalities that you shouldn't because you don't have taxable funds?

But I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing other strategies.</li>\n<li>I've been working at a major package delivery company for almost 26 years. I was just inducted into the circle of honor. Which means that I have gone accident free for over 25 years. Mind you I drive in New York City. I am highly trained, and pretty good at what I do. Since listening to you, and some other podcasts. I was thinking of starting my own podcast. Driving is something almost everyone does and there really aren't any podcasts on safe driving. Trust me most people don't know what they're doing. The problem I have is exactly what you went through after episode 181. I don't want to argue with people over everything that I say. I don't understand why people can't take the good, and credible information out of a conversation, and leave the bad behind. I don't agree with everything you said, but that doesn't mean I didn't pause, \u00a0and think about what you were saying. Kudos to you. I'll be retiring in four years, maybe by then I won't care what anybody thinks. Since I have your attention I have a question. I have a 15 year old son. Who works for his mothers company from home. He he takes home takes home $225 every two weeks. In which she saves about 75% of that. I opened up a brokerage account for him to separate the money from savings, and checking. I spread the money out into four different ETFs. I'm trying to teach him to invest and diversify. The problem I have is he maybe using some of this money, or all of it for college. I'm afraid the stock portion could be a problem, since I know you shouldn't have money in the market you're going to need within 3 to 5 years. Would like to know your thoughts on this situation.</li>\n<li>During episode 181 you mentioned that you don\u2019t have your money in the markets for moral reasons. Where do you put your money and have it grow in line with inflation or better yet beat it?</li>\n<li>I very much enjoy your show. \u00a0I took in the marathon of show #181. \u00a0Thank you for using such controversial material to make your point. There is not enough genuine debate and too much simplified propaganda from all sides in this country. One point that stood out to me from this particular show is your personal approach to investment for your own family. \u00a0My question is, if your position on investing in large \u201cEvil\u201d public companies is so strong that you would not personally invest in them, how do you justify working in the financial industry, advising individuals on their investments in those same publicly traded companies? \u00a0I\u2019m assuming that you are or will be engaged in that financial advisory role. Could you also please touch on the investment categories that you are or will consider for your family's financial plan (generally speaking of course).

Thank you very much for the effort you put in and the thought provoking product you create! It is worth the voluntary money!I've got a very open ended question: You often talk about journaling and writing to help develop thoughts, ideas, and plans. How does one get started doing this? What should your listeners focus on when getting into the habit of journaling? How often do you write in your journal? Without any framework or place to start, I find myself wanting to move on to other activities. I know it's not a direct financial topic but I believe there is a huge amount of value to the idea of putting your thoughts down on paper and developing them and it is something I'd like to start as soon as possible. It'd be great to hear your thoughts and maybe some tactics you employ to get the most out of your journaling time. Keep up the great work, -Chris</li> <li><strong>19:52</strong> Joshua, One of the biggest goals I have in my life is to become financially independent. Which is why I came across your Podcast in the first place but I am having a hard time figuring out where exactly to go from here. I just started keeping track of every penny I make and spend so that I can start to budget and plan accordingly (I know I should have done this years ago but I gotta start somewhere!) I am 26 years old and have very little experience saving. I am a compulsive spender but I know I can change my habits with the right motivation and I know that I am still young enough to make a very significant change in my life. I have tried to find something \"from the beginning\" in your podcast but I havn't yet found one that fits my needs. The questions that I have are things that may seem really basic to anyone who has been financially planning for a while. What do I do with my first savings? Say its only $100 dollars, do I keep it in cash at my house? Do I open a savings account and keep it there? How much should I have saved before I start looking at other options, retirement accounts, etc. Sincerely, Garion.</li> <li><strong>29:45</strong>\u00a0Joshua, With regard to \u201cYour Money or Your Life\u201d (I have been reading the book for the past few days.), is the strategy for investment/FI that the author\u2019s put forth in Chapter Nine still valid today, in your opinion. (I apologize if you have covered this already; I am still trying to get caught up with all of your podcasts.) Please keep up the awesome work. -Daniel</li> <li><strong>36:35</strong>\u00a0Joshua, First off I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan of the show and your format. It's so refreshing to actually listen to an in-depth discussion of personal finance rather than all the surface level junk online:\"The one easy tip for financial freedom.\" So I hope you never question your long format in the landscape of quick tips and 3 easy steps posts. I've been growing more interested in personal finance/investing. I'm curious if you've ever encountered or heard of families that invest together. Whether it be siblings or siblings and parents investing together. This is something I've been pondering lately. It seems this would be a smart way for families to invest and take advantage of strength in numbers. Perhaps it's not discussed because it's taboo to talk about money at that level of detail. I really have 0 experience in this area so it'd be interesting to hear what some of the benefits/challenges would be of this kind of thing or if you've personally heard of families doing this. Keep up the good work, and know that your work has had an impact on me.Regards, -Ryan</li> </ul> <p><strong>Resources</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Jukes-Edwards, A Study in Education and Heredity</li> <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jukes_family\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jukes_family</a></li> <li>Support Radical Personal Finance:\u00a0<a href=\"http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\" target=\"_blank\">http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a></li> </ul>", "duration": "01:00:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0185-QA.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1430156150, "title": "184-Financial Freedom Afloat: Lessons We Can Learn From the Long-Term Sailing Community", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I enjoy looking for financial planning tips from odd corners of the world.

However, striving to create a large enough portfolio of dividend paying stocks seems like a option in which I could pay tuition with the money strictly generated from my investments.\u00a0Assuming (still a moderately big assumption on my end) that I can create the principal to generate ~$25,000 in dividends at a 4% yield, does this seem like a viable option? -Brian</li>\n<li><strong>44:04\u00a0</strong>Joshua, I am 42 years old and currently have life insurance from my employer. I'm trying to buy life insurance from one of the providers but have the following questions:\u00a0Should I continue the life insurance at work even after I get from outside? Will the 2 ever be mutually exclusive?\u00a0Should I search for an agent? If so, are there any websites that can help me find one?\u00a0Are websites like Accuquote reliable?\u00a0How else should I compare the products of various providers? -Vikram</li>\n<li><strong>1:01:52</strong>\u00a0Joshua, I wanted to ask you to consider a podcast show around radical ways to lower the cost of owning a home. \u00a0Not the typical advice out there, \u00a0but more along the lines of buying a property that meets your families needs but that could provide rental income to offset your mortgage too.\u00a0Cash flow around homes is a large percent of take home for most families - just seems like an area that most people are not considering and could be a significant win.\u00a0-Todd</li>\n<li><strong>1:20:16</strong>\u00a0Joshua,\u00a0While listening to Podcast #36 you mentioned changing a 401K plan to be able to defer more than the $17.5K.

Every law and every decision has a moral and ethical component to it.</p>\n<p>In modern conversation, we're unaccustomed to talking about philosophy and ethics. We steer away from\u00a0discussing\u00a0politics and religion because we're uncomfortable with how we can have a positive relationship with another person even when we disagree.</p>\n<p>Or, we\u00a0might\u00a0feel unequipped to battle in the world of philosophical\u00a0or religious ideas.</p>\n<p>The problem is that our lives are continuously influenced by others who are battling in the world of politics, religion, and philosophy. And, we're subject to the same moral/ethical code as everyone else is regardless if we want to admit it or not!</p>\n<p>Worse still, we don't have the choice of non-participation. Every dollar of tax we pay, every item we buy, every hour we work affects the larger system in some way. By our actions we are supporting or tearing down various systems and causes.</p>\n<p>We are either moving the systems that surround us in a certain direction or we are being moved by them.</p>\n<p>The final horrific reality is that most of us are untrained in the fine art of sniffing out propaganda and influence. So, we are subject to it. Most of us would be content to simply sit by and live our lives quietly; it's not possible. Because you are in important pawn in others' plans for you.<br /><br />Today's show is a unique experiment for me in a teaching style. Essentially, I'm trying to accomplish a few objectives in an interesting and challenging way.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want you to understand the impact that your worldview has on all of your decisions.</li>\n<li>I want to demonstrate how one specific worldview (in this case formal secular humanism) impacts the broader culture with its stated objectives.</li>\n<li>I want to demonstrate how all of the broader agendas within a governmental system tie back to worldview. Politics are driven by worldview.</li>\n<li>I want to demonstrate how propoganda and media are used to promote an idea in the general culture and how incredibly effective that can be.</li>\n<li>I want you to see an example of a propaganda effort that has achieved massive cultural change over your lifetime so that you can learn the skills to sniff out other agendas--specifically other agendas that are closely related to finance.</li>\n<li>I want you to see and understand\u00a0that it's completely impossible to disconnect the social aspects of life and their associated moral questions from the daily, practical & financial aspects of life. You've got to be a consistent human being with a clear and consistent framework.</li>\n<li>I want you to see and understand how theories change and adjust over time and how society changes throughout history.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the show. It's an unusual discussion but it's an important one.</p>\n<p>I will be building on the content of this show in future episodes as we sort our way through the swamps of financial movements, theories, and conspiracies in the future.</p>\n<p>Let the critical thinking skills commence!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<p>p.s., I've tagged this show with the [EXPLICIT] label because of the content and some of the words used.

I am 33 years old, single and don't plan on starting a family. I have about $170K in investments/retirement and am on track to have an additional 80-90K saved for the condo in about six years. I want to make a 50% down payment on a $200K condo (so basically a 100K down payment). \u00a0 My dream is to have a super low monthly mortgage payment (around $500 - 600 per month). That would be very freeing for me! I want the flexibility in life + career that low monthly expenses would give me. Am I crazy to make such a big down payment? I know its almost half of my net worth, but it feels right for my lifestyle choices. \u00a0 I'm tired of being stuck in the super-high trendy-city apartment renting hamster wheel ;)\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>30:19\u00a0</strong>I have a 529 for my oldest son. I am planning on transferring that to my wife as she will be going back to school in August of 2016. She is a teacher, once she graduates with a specialist degree she will receive an automatic $5,000 annual pay raise. We estimate the program will cost $15,000 and can be completed in 18 months-24 months. The 529 plan is currently invested very aggressively (based on our oldest son's age of 6). I am planning on immediately changing the investment to the guaranteed option (1-1.25%). Am I missing any other investment options? We use Georgia's 529 plan which is TIAA-CREF based. It seems an easy choice to me. What else am I missing? Any other thoughts? The current value is $12,700 and we contribute $600 per year.

Should I buy new or should I buy used?</p>\n<p>In reality, the answer is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the needs and wants you're trying to satisfy?</li>\n<li>Which option meets those needs for the lowest total, lifetime cost?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose the option that fits best.</p>\n<p>But, of course, there are as many ways to answer those questions as there are people in the world.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the decision you make, here are some ideas for you to consider to lower the total cost and enhance your results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The thought process for choosing a used car vs. a new car is no different than the decision applied to any other item that you own. We should consider new vs. used for every item that we buy. Cars are a bit unique though because of their relatively high purchase price and also because we have such an easily accessed and abundant used car market.</li>\n<li>We have an incredible used car market in the USA because:\n<ul>\n<li>Tons of people regularly buy new cars while their old cars have lots of useful life left. If the supply weren't so plentiful, the recommendation to \"buy used\" would be more difficult to implement.</li>\n<li>Vehicles are built to a high quality with a long potential life span.</li>\n<li>Most vehicles are lightly used. Long highway miles on paved roads don't take a huge toll on a vehicle. If you were in a different situation, it would be different.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For most people, the highest cost of car ownership is depreciation.</li>\n<li>Depreciation is calculated like this: Initial Purchase Price - Residual Value When Sold = Depreciation (your actual cost)</li>\n<li>To make an intelligent buying decision, carefully consider your actual needs and wants and consider the options that will fit those needs and wants.</li>\n<li>Think carefully about your opportunity cost. If you can save $10,000 of total cost over the lifespan of ownership, what could you spend that money on? For example, would you rather have a cheaper car and a motorcycle or just a more expensive car? Would you rather have a cheaper car and an extra $500,000 in 40 years or just have a more expensive car? The decision is up to you.</li>\n<li>Consider all of the costs of ownership:\n<ul>\n<li>Depreciation expense</li>\n<li>Fuel/energy costs</li>\n<li>Downtime expenses (in case of repair)</li>\n<li>Financing costs</li>\n<li>Maintenance/repair costs</li>\n<li>Insurance costs</li>\n<li>Other expenses (parking spots, garage space, car wash expense, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are ways to mitigate each of these categories of expenses. The best situation is to find an optimized approach in each category.</li>\n<li>Since the biggest consideration between used and new is depreciation, here are some ideas to minimize depreciation:\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Buy a less costly vehicle.</span> (20% depreciation on a $40,000 vehicle is a loss of $8,000 in one year. 20% depreciation on a $20,000 vehicle is a loss of $4,000 in one year.)</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Get an up-front deal.</span> (Buy the same vehicle but buy it at a more opportune time for less. Be out of sync with the general marketplace.)</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Buy a vehicle that depreciates at a slower rate.</span> (Look for a unique segment where you can use a vehicle that maintains its value more than the general market.)</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Take better care of your specific vehicle so that it depreciates more slowly.</span>\u00a0</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Keep your vehicle for longer.</span> (No matter whether you buy used or new, just keep your vehicle for longer so that the impact of depreciation is lessened.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you want to give a shot at havine a one-car household isntead of a two-car household, consider supplementing for your transportation needs with Uber or Lyft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support the show!\u00a0<a href=\"http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\" target=\"_blank\">http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "01:11:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0167-Used_Cars_vs_New.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1426272802, "title": "166-Why I Host a Daily Podcast and Why You Should Model Me (But Not Necessarily Copy Me)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I'd like to share with you a look behind-the-scenes of the business of Radical Personal Finance. I want you to know why I host a daily (or at least almost-daily) podcast and why I've stuck with that, even with many people suggesting less frequency.</p>\n<p>To be clear: I don't think you should copy what I'm doing. But perhaps if you understand why I'm doing what I'm doing you may be able to apply it to your own endeavors.</p>\n<p>I'm creating\u00a0this show for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some listeners are concerned about my pace and my ability to sustain it.</li>\n<li>It will be helpful for you no matter what business you're in as you can understand my thinking process as I create a new business.</li>\n<li>It will be especially helpful for you if you're a podcaster. I think a lot of the advice that's being given in the podcast world is bad...people say \"do this\" without illustrating the principles behind it. I will share with you what I'm doing and also why I'm doing it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This show is going to sound very me-focused. It's intended to be helpful for you but I'm sharing all of my personal, selfish motivations to demonstrate my way of thinking.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>My reasons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fundamentally, I host my show daily because <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I believe the\u00a0format is best for my\u00a0audience</span>. That's it. I want to be a source of daily encouragement, inspiration, and education in your life.\u00a0I remember how important having a source of daily encouragement was to me in the past when I was working my way out of debt in college.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm scratching my own itch.</span> I'm creating the show I wish were there for me when I was 15 years old. I have nothing else to go on. I want one show that has unique content that makes me think. I don't want to wander around downloading from 11 different podcast feeds to scratch my itch. It's more convenient to have one but for that one to have varied content.</li>\n<li>I needed and still need to build the skills of a broadcaster. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">By doing a daily show instead of a weekly show, I have 400% more experience than I would have otherwise.</span> That experience compounds over time. I believe it's wise to learn and then really learn by doing. I have a tremendous competitive advantage because of how hard I work at it and I have learned and improved tremendously. I have the long-term view:\u00a0I'm focused on 2015 but I'm even more heavily focused on 2017. Or 2018 when the potential audience size increases massively. I need to be ready for that.</li>\n<li>I'm doing what I believe I'm best at. I don't feel that I'm the most creative writer. But I'm a good speaker. So, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm focusing on my strengths.</span> Producing lots of verbal content actually comes more easily to me than to many people.\n<ul>\n<li>I have years of pent-up frustration to express.</li>\n<li>I have years of financial ideas that have never been publicized.</li>\n<li>I'm a verbal learner so the best way for me to learn is to teach.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There is more competition in the podcast space than ever. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I want to push my competitors aside in terms of audience focus. </span>I want people to find my show, fall in love with it, and stop searching for new content. Their other feeds will run out of content. Mine won't.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm modeling the success of radio and TV.</span> Most well-known radio programs are 5 days per week. Why? Because of the normal flow and routine of our work week. Many people listen to things while they work and the 5-day work-week is common. People are used to the regular flow of content streaming in on their radio, their TV, etc. Now, there's a transition to on-demand. When you find something you like...you zero in and consume the archives.</li>\n<li>But, I pay careful attention to the differences between podcasting and radio. Radio is not cumulative. Radio is a \"dip your toe in the water\" kind of format. You'll notice that radio is always either current events or Q&amp;A. That's great for tuning in and tuning out. Podcasts are different. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm focusing on taking the good from radio and adjusting it for a podcast-listening audience.</span> Some listeners listen every day almost as soon as the show comes out. Many listeners go back and listen to the archives. I try very hard not to repeat topics. There is some overlap but I'm focused on consistently fresh, new ideas.</li>\n<li>Format is not the answer to a problem. Content is. You should fit your format to your content and goal. There are many popular weekly programs. But I don't really enjoy many of them because I'm not interested in the content. I simply believe that the format that I've chosen is the best way for me to help my listening audience.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I essentially have four different shows and I can't choose between them:</span><ol>\n<li>A short-format Q&amp;A show.</li>\n<li>An interview show.</li>\n<li>A technical financial planning show.</li>\n<li>A unique personal finance show.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Different types of shows appeal to different audience members.</span> My technical shows are the least popular. But some listeners only listen to them. By having a varied format I can appeal to a broader audience. My vision is to keep the content so varied that you're always interested in what tomorrow's show topic will be!</li>\n<li>I'm focusing on the strengths that I have: I didn't have an audience when I started. I didn't have a platform. I didn't have experience as a broadcaster. I didn't have any other content to promote. So, I can whine about it or I can focus on what I do have. What I do have is a tremendously broad interest in various topics and a tremendous depth in financial planning topics. So, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm focused on highlighting my strengths</span> and playing to them rather than worrying about my weaknesses.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm focused on my core fans and completely focused on serving them with massive value.</span> You always have to look at who is giving you comments and feedback. I read online feedback often about my show: Joshua's show has too many episodes. I factor it in. But just because someone in an online forum doesn't like the format...they're not paying me any money. Just expressing their opinion doesn't mean I should change because of\u00a0it. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I pay attention to the names of the people that send me money. I listen carefully to them.</span> And many of them listen to every show and many of them like the daily format. In fact, many of them only send me money because of how consistently I deliver content.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm focusing on bringing in new audiences.</span> Diverse topics are good for daily listening--that's the most important thing. But they're also good for helping new listeners find me. People search google. People search itunes. Shows get linked. The more content I create on specific topics, the more findable and useful I am. Interviews are also helpful. Every time I do an interview, I have the potential to reach a new audience and attract some additional listeners. I get bored by a lot of interview-only shows. But, I think some interviews are valuable to my audience. If I did a once-a week show, I wouldn't have any interviews. Two per week feels like a good fit to\u00a0me.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm focusing on financial productivity of the show.</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Patreon probably shouldn't work based on the percentage of many audiences who support various creators. If you run the numbers of some of the largest Patreon campaigns, the \"conversion ratio\" is tiny. It averages about .03% of a listening audience who is actually supporting a creator. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The percentage of the audience who is sending money to me volunatarily for my show is about 5%. I'm convinced that's because of the much closer bond I have with a daily show.</span></li>\n<li>Advertising that is based on a Cost Per Thousand (CPM) model is also based on the number of shows I produce. If I use John Lee Dumas's numbers of $43 per thousand listners per show and I calculate based on 3,000 listeners, my income potential is dramatically different based on the frequency of my show. Four\u00a0shows per month, 3,000 listeners, $43 per thousand listeners and two advertisers per show comes out to to $1,032 of monthly income. 4 x 3 x $43 x 2 = <strong>$1,032/mo.</strong> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">But, 20 shows per month is very different: 20 x 3 x $43 x 2 = <strong>$5,160/mo.</strong> That's compelling.</span></li>\n<li>Affiliate commissions: if I'm here every day reminding you about something that I'm selling, there's a much bigger reach than if I'm talking to you once per week.</li>\n<li>If I'm selling my own products, it's exactly the same.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I'm creating the job I want to have</span> and testing it on my own time before I go and try to find it. If the podcast fails, I might go and try to compete in the financial talk radio space. I think that\u00a0would be fun to do. But that format would probably be daily. I wanted to see what it would be like to follow that schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not committed forever to this format. I'm still\u00a0experimenting. But for now, the benefits are so great in comparison to the drawbacks that I'm continuing forward.</p>\n<p>The competitive landscape is changing. I may change in the future.</p>\n<p>But for now, my barometer for success is the heartfelt emails I receive from committed listeners who really value my content. I'm having a connection and an impact on the community. I believe what I'm doing is working and I won't change it until I find something I believe will serve more effectively.</p>\n<p>At this stage, I'm creating a body of content and building an audience. I might shift my focus\u00a0in the future. But not yet. I understand where I am in the phase of my business and this is one piece of my plan.</p>\n<p>Take these things and apply them to your business and life endeavors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are you trying to do?</li>\n<li>What skills do you have?</li>\n<li>What is your unique selling proposition?</li>\n<li>How can you stand out from the competition?</li>\n<li>Who are your customers?</li>\n<li>How can you serve them?</li>\n<li>How can you learn from others and study them but not necessarily copy them? Model, don't copy.</li>\n<li>How can you focus on your strengths rather than your weaknesses?</li>\n<li>How can you choose yourself and choose your career?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Focus on what you can do, not on what I can do. There are many, many other things that I would love to do more than I'm doing now. I don't have the capacity yet to do them. But I can focus on what I can do. And that's working.</p>\n<p>My format is not my pledge or my brand. My content is. If I don't have something worth saying and if I'm not prepared to deliver a show, I'm not going to waste your time.</p>\n<p>My commitment is to the audience. To bring you an idea worth hearing that is well prepared and well presented and that is useful to you. That's my brand. Not doing a show every day.</p>\n<p>I also don't care if a show is 3 hours long or 3 minutes long. It should be exactly as long as it needs to be to convey the point and to be effective. Sometimes that's short. Sometimes it's long. Sometimes it's being split into two or three parts.</p>\n<p>But format does not equal content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support the show on Patreon:\u00a0<a href=\"http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\" target=\"_blank\">http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "01:37:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0166-Why_I_Podcast_Daily.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1426108380, "title": "Out & About: Part 2 of Joshua's Interview on \"Family Adventure Podcast\" with Erik Hemingway: \"Build a Budget for Travel\"", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This week I'm focused single-mindedly on the new version of the Radical Personal Finance website.

If you'd like me to answer your questions, please email them to me or call them in on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Question #1:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Joshua,</em></p>\n<p><em>My father, who is 60 years of age, has become a victim of numerous scams over the last year or two. Generally, they involve him receiving calls that he won some prize and needs to wire some money (usually in $500 increments) to the West Indies, Jamaica, etc. His decision making with his finances is not good, to say the least. He continues to fall for these scams despite being told by numerous family and friends, law enforcement, and bank reps that it is a scam and he is never going to receive any \"prize.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>His financial situation is as follows... he receives Social Security (Disability) for around $1,400 per month. His expenses are only about $700 per month. He owns a very modest house that is paid off. Also, he has a bank IRA worth about $50,000 (earning a whopping 1.3% fixed) which is a rollover from a 401k he had when he was employed.</em></p>\n<p><em>In my efforts to help him with his finances I got him to give me Power of Attorney and I was added as a signer on his checking account. I am able to monitor his checking account through online banking. However, I live too far away to proactively keep dad from wiring in money for these scams. All I can do is call Dad after I see he has made a large cash withdrawal from his checking account and ask what it was for. I can tell by his evasive answers that it is usually for another scam.</em></p>\n<p><em>My question is, how can I prevent Dad from wiping out his IRA and spending all his future social security earnings on the dream of the big foreign lottery prize? Does the Power of Attorney allow me to move the IRA to another financial institution (perhaps an online broker, or something out of state). As it stands, Dad can go down to the local bank an withdraw from the IRA with ease. The account could be wiped out before I had the chance to try to talk some sense into him. Also, is there some way for me to become a custodian of the Social Security payment where I could ensure Dad's needs were met, and had the rest of the funds could go into a savings account in his name? I would welcome any other suggestions you have on this matter.</em></p>\n<p><em>Your response would be appreciated very much!</em></p>\n<p><em>Take care,</em></p>\n<p><em>Jason</em></p>\n<p><em>--</em></p>\n<p><strong>Question #2: @21:11</strong></p>\n<p><em>Joshua,</em></p>\n<p><em>How much can one roll into a roth IRA from a traditional IRA?</em></p>\n<p><em>Is it true that interest earned in the traditional IRA is treated as principles once rolled into the roth and can be withdrawn without the penalty after 5 years?</em></p>\n<p><em>I really like the variety of your show. keep it up.</em></p>\n<p><em>Best wishes,</em></p>\n<p><em>Brad from Utah</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>Question #3: @27:11</strong></p>\n<p><em>Joshua,</em></p>\n<p><em>A friend (22 y.o. male new grad. just starting his first engineering job) asked me if I had any good resources on investing.</em></p>\n<p><em>Prior to his question...I sent him your \"Become a millionaire working at Walmart\" episode as I felt that portrayed a lot of key concepts very well. \u00a0I want to recommend another episode that really embodies your take on investing which I think is very helpful....as my friend seems to think investing just means putting money in the stock market.</em></p>\n<p><em>What would you share with him?</em></p>\n<p><em>Dustin\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>Question #4: @38:17</strong></p>\n<p><em>Joshua,</em></p>\n<p><em>I think I have a unique and \"radical\" financial situation. I figured with your unique outlook on things and the interesting nature of your show this might an interesting question for you to consider.</em></p>\n<p><em>I want to be frozen after my legal death and reanimated later. I also want to preserve my wealth so that if/when I am brought back I will gain the benefit of at least many decades of compound interest.</em></p>\n<p><em>My question is:</em></p>\n<p><em>How should I fund my being frozen and how should I preserve my wealth in perpetuity after my death till my reanimation?</em></p>\n<p><em>Details:</em></p>\n<p><em>I currently have a 20 year term $150,000 life insurance policy. The cryonics organization is set the be the beneficiary. Upon my death they will take my body and fly it to their facility where it will be retained.</em></p>\n<p><em>The cryonics plan that I have signed up for costs $80,000. I have added the additional $70,000 for any chartered flights that might be needed to be flown or any legal battles that might need to be fought in order to get my body.</em></p>\n<p><em>I know that the 20 year term will expire and as I am presently 23, I (hopefully) will still be around. I was wondering what I should do long term?</em></p>\n<p><em>I was considering just using the\u00a0company's\u00a0standard trust model and just pumping money into it over the 20 year period.</em></p>\n<p><em>My insurance rep thinks I should move to a whole life policy.</em></p>\n<p><em>What are your thoughts?</em></p>\n<p><em>My second question is in regards to preserving my personal wealth upon death. As I will no longer be a legal person upon death, what is the best way preserve and grow my wealth over the years in such a way that I can claim it upon being reanimated? Ideally I would like to have a revival incentive in order to encourage people to revive me, something along the lines of 20% of the wealth accumulated.</em></p>\n<p><em>What do you think the best financial instrument would be? A trust? It's a bit tricky as I will not be a legal person after death.</em></p>\n<p><em>It's an odd question and I appreciate your help,</em></p>\n<p><em>Thanks,</em></p>\n<p><em>Caitlin</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Enjoy\u00a0the show!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support the show:\u00a0<a href=\"http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\">http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_against_perpetuities\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia: Rule Against Perpetuities</a></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "01:13:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0165-Friday_QA.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": ["parents", "roth", "aging", "ira", "rules", "conversion"]}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1425591764, "title": "164-An Introduction to Hackerspaces and Makerspaces: Interview with Jessica Fong, President of the South Side Hackerspace in Chicago", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Years ago I heard of the concept of a hackerspace/makerspace.

This is perhaps the real pickle.. which makes this ordeal much harder than it would normally be for other career changers.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p>\n<p>-Bill</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>AND at 51:24</strong></span></p>\n<p>Hey Joshua,</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for the show. It has really helped me and my fiance get our finances in order and start us thinking about how we could become financially independent. Even as a Canadian I've gotten a ton out of the show and have tried to hook as many people as I can.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if you might be able to touch on tips and tricks for someone who doesn't earn a consistent or regular income. I do video work and while it's consistent right now, I have spent most of my working career either working every day in a month or not working at all for weeks at a time. I was just curious if there might be any wisdom you can impart on those kinds of situations.</p>\n<p>Luckily my fiance has a very stable job and makes good money so it gives us the ability to plan at least a bit.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the show, I look forward to it whenever I walk the dog and on the way to work.</p>\n<p>-Brendon</p>\n<p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW ON PATREON\u00a0<a href=\"http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron\" target=\"_blank\">http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron</a></strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1433669331?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1433669331&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=radipersfina-20\" target=\"_blank\">48 Days to the Work You Love</a>\u00a0by Dan Miller.

In addition, you could have sales tax, payroll tax, deposits on hand, etc\u2026 that is money you have in your bank account but you'll have to pay to someone else at a later date.</li>\n<li>A simple excel spreadsheet or even something like Mint that tracks your income and expenses from your bank account won't be able to track this for you</li>\n<li>For example, if you're thinking about taking money out of the business or getting ready to make a large investment in a piece of equipment or something, you want to make sure that the money is available and that you don't need it to pay sales tax next month or something like that.</li>\n<li>Some things a balance sheet is helpful for:\n<ul>\n<li>Record Deposits Correctly\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t want to record income that isn\u2019t income.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Track Accounts Receivable / Payable\n<ul>\n<li>Want to keep track of who owes you money and who you owe money to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Inventory / Payroll Liabilities / Sales Tax\n<ul>\n<li>Inventory not an expense when purchased.</li>\n<li>Payroll liabilities are usually withheld from employee paychecks and need to be remitted to the government at a later date.</li>\n<li>Sales tax is collected when product is sold and needs to be remitted to the government at a later date.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Documentation / Retention\n<ul>\n<li>Write on Receipts / Invoices Immediately\n<ul>\n<li>Helps to document the business purpose of the expense and can capture some valuable information that's easily forgotten later.</li>\n<li>Why is this beneficial?\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly recall the purpose and payment method for each receipt that you have.</li>\n<li>Most questions from an auditor or bookkeeper / accountant can be answered by looking at the receipt.</li>\n<li>Helpful for locating a receipt from a specific transaction in your accounting software.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How do I do this?\n<ul>\n<li>Start to get in the habit of writing on all of your receipts and invoices. You don't need a dissertation for each receipt, just a brief description. An example of a meal receipt could be, \"Amanda / Todd / Michelle\u2026 discussed the marketing campaign for the XYZ product launch\".</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Create A Filing System\n<ul>\n<li>Scan All Receipts\n<ul>\n<li>Electronic system can cut down clutter and could potentially be easier to find something you're looking for.</li>\n<li>Can be backed up in the cloud or external hard drive in case something happens to the paper file.</li>\n<li>I see a lot of people wanting to do a bunch of folders to keep their receipts in. Either by year, month, vendor, or what have you.\n<ul>\n<li>I'm a fan of less folders because for each folder you have, that's one more folder I have to click into to see what's in there if I can't find something.</li>\n<li>I usually name the PDF by the date (year, month, day) and then the vendor and category.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some apps / software allow you to take a picture of your receipt and link it to the expense.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Getting It Done\n<ul>\n<li>Set Specific Time to do Books\n<ul>\n<li>Either weekly or monthly.

Here they are:</p>\n<p><strong>Question #1: @01:56</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Joshua,\u00a0</p>\n<p>My wife and I are well read in the areas of index fund investing, frugal living, early retirement, and financial independence (including your podcasts). \u00a0We have been on the path to early retirement for many years and we think we are there. \u00a0We both have high stress jobs and want to quit to raise a child and do whatever interests us whether it brings additional income or not. \u00a0We want to have a significant financial cushion, but also don\u2019t want to be so conservative that we work years longer than necessary. \u00a0We are worriers and are very conservative in our estimates.</p>\n<p>Although we are fairly confident in our calculations for early retirement timing, we hired a fee only financial planner for an outside opinion, and the experience was positive, but we believe the timing recommended was extremely conservative (4 years from now without a child; 5-6 years from now with a child). \u00a0We have a very good handle on our spending as we have been tracking it closely for several years.</p>\n<p>The financial planner did not seem to understand our frugal lifestyle and rather than reducing our current spending by the \u201ccost of working\u201d that we clearly communicated, he added $15,000 per year to our current spending, which significantly changes the projections for retirement. \u00a0The explanation given was to account for \u201cunexpected expenses\u201d, but that amounts to >$20,000 per year in excess of our retirement spending estimate below. \u00a0We would be very grateful for your opinion of our plan to retire NOW, given the following data, which we have abbreviated to the most important points.</p>\n<p>Ages: Him-45, Her-37</p>\n<p>Debts: None (own a house and 2 cars free and clear)</p>\n<p>Assets ($1,300,646)<br />$714,200 \u2013 His/Her TSP (Federal 401k)<br />$347,554 \u2013 Taxable Account (Vanguard Index Funds)<br />$216,165 \u2013 Cash/I-Bonds<br />$22,727 \u2013 His/Her Roth IRA<br />$31,000 \u2013 His Pension (starting at age 60)<br />$6,000 \u2013 Her Pension (starting at age 62)<br />(Minimum of $100,000 net after moving and downsizing our house \u2013 not included in assets total above)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Asset Allocation:<br />40% Total US Stock Market (Vanguard/TSP Index Funds)<br />12% Total International Stock Market (Vanguard/TSP Index Funds)<br />33% Bonds (TSP G Fund)<br />15% Cash (CDs)</p>\n<p>Spending:</p>\n<p>Current Spending: $45,000<br />Retirement spending estimate $37,000<br />*This is after removing the easily calculated \u201ccosts of working\u201d ($10,000 in property tax!; $3,000 in gas!) and adding estimated cost of health insurance ($5000?)<br />Note: We will be moving from a very high cost area (suburban Chicago) to a very low cost area (rural Florida)</p>\n<p><strong>Question #2 @26:20</strong></p>\n<p>Joshua,</p>\n<p>Came across your podcast and dig the advice/honesty.</p>\n<p>I've read numerous articles encouraging the use of fee-based financial advisors but haven't had a lot of luck finding the right person.. discouragement set in after numerous canned responses/what seemed like aggressive sales tactics.</p>\n<p>I made somewhat of a half ass attempt in my early 20s with regularly maxing out a roth/always contributing enough to various company 401k to get the contribution match.</p>\n<p>I've not paid a lot of attention and recently realized I'm holding roughly 50% of my total assets in a standard savings account yielding only 1%.</p>\n<p>Without pulling the actual figures that'd be ~90k in retirement accounts Roth/Traditional rollover and ~90k in straight up cash... terrible I know.</p>\n<p>My question is how do i fix/prevent it? I currently have one investment property with a mortgage that's less than what it's leasing for.</p>\n<p>I see a couple fix it options:</p>\n<p>Buy another house\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pay down existing mortgage</p>\n<p>Invest outside of a retirement account</p>\n<p>I believe adjusting my 401k contribution may be a start to preventing it but what about after I max it out?</p>\n<p>I don't mind paying for advice but what I really want is someone that's hands on/up to date.. helping me get the most out of my money.</p>\n<p><strong>Question #3: @46:37</strong></p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<p>My name is Joe and I\u2019m 24 years old. \u00a0I\u2019ve been listening to your show for a while now and really enjoy it, keep up the good work.</p>\n<p>My question has to do with whether or not a Roth 401k is the right move for me. \u00a0Currently my gross income is $58,616. \u00a0This year, I\u2019ve contributed 6% of my AGI into a regular 401k and my employer matches .80 cents on the dollar up to the first 5% of my pay. ($3,517+$2,344 = $5,861) \u00a0I also contribute to my Roth IRA and will max it out at $5,500.</p>\n<p>My employer just recently began offering a Roth 401k option and my question is whether or not it is the best move for me to make to begin contributing to the Roth vs the regular 401k? \u00a0I understand the tax benefits on the front end at my young age and do believe taxes will rise in the future and also that I will hopefully be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than I am now. \u00a0In my mind, the advantage of the Roth is the higher contribution limit (18k vs 5,500) but the advantage of the Roth IRA is I have it at Schwab and have lower fees and more investment options than inside my 401k. \u00a0I would like to keep my net take home pay the same and am having trouble running the math to figure out which would be the better option. \u00a0In addition, I have the option to do a Roth 401k conversion on the $12k that\u2019s in my Regular 401k. \u00a0Your advice would be much appreciated. \u00a0</p>\n<p>About me:</p>\n<p>Assets: $27k in Roth IRA, $12K in 401k, $3k in taxable investment acct, $6K in savings acct, $2k in checking acct</p>\n<p>Debts: $41,200 Federal Parent PLUS @ 7.65% and $16,500 @ 5.25%. I currently am on the standard repayment plan (10 yrs) and make an extra $100 payment each month on top of that. No credit card debt or any other type of loan, own a 2005 Camry that is paid off.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Enjoy the show!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>", "duration": "01:00:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0144-Friday_QandA.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": ["vs", "investing", "early", "retirement", "roth", "options", "traditional"]}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1422589081, "title": "143-Intro to Self-Directed IRAs: How to Invest In Real Estate, Tax Liens, Physical Gold and Silver, Structured Settlements, Horses, Livestock, Farmland, Timberland, and More In Your IRA", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I've been looking for an expert on self-directed IRAs to bring on the show and I was thrilled to meet Kirk Chisholm at FinCon last year.</p>\n<p>Kirk is an expert in both the self-directed IRA niche and the alternative investments world.

It is frequently used to describe different asset classes or investment types such as: hedge funds, structured products, managed futures, or even Timber REITs. If you describe traditional assets as stocks, bonds and mutual funds, then by contrast everything else is an alternative investment.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"We look at the term \u201calternative investments\u201d differently. We take a step beyond the current industry definition and use it to describe assets or investments such as physical real estate, tax liens, physical gold and silver, structured settlements, horses, livestock, farmland, timberland, and more. We would characterize alternative investments as an asset or investment which is: not publicly traded, has a low-correlate to most traditional investments, is too small for institutional investors, is illiquid, is not easily able to be securitized, or is not reliant on the publicly traded markets to be profitable.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"The characterization of what is a suitable asset for diversification purposes is a fluid concept. Some asset classes, which have traditionally provided a low or negative correlation to other assets, have become much more highly correlated since early 2000. Asset classes such as managed futures, timberland, farmland, and certain types of hedge funds in the past did provide a low correlation to the traditional markets, however, due to a higher level of institutional interest in these areas, as well as changing market conditions, they have become more highly correlated to traditional markets.

Sometimes, I get multiple emails in a day!</p>\n<p>Here are four examples that I mention on the show today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Joshua, I consider personal finance and financial planning a hobby and I dole out my amateur advice to friends, colleagues and family. A little bit of background -- I'm 25 years old and currently working as an auditor in big 4 in my third year and I've just been early promoted to Senior Associate. \u00a0The thing is I don't see myself auditing forever and I really want to get into financial planning. \u00a0My plan is to start taking the courses for the CFP in May/June 2015 after my busy season is over. \u00a0I feel secure in my job but I just don't love it. \u00a0Do you have any advice for a 20 something wanting to transition to a career in financial planning with zero experience?</li>\n<li>Hi Joshua, I\u2019m writing because I\u2019d love to get your insight in a career as a financial advisor. \u00a0A little background on myself, I\u2019m a 28 year old CPA who has worked as an auditor at a large CPA firm for the past 4 years. \u00a0I\u2019ve been thinking about making a career change, and given my interests I\u2019ve begun looking into possibly starting a career as a financial advisor. \u00a0I really enjoy the technical side of financial planning, including the tax side of planning, but am also enjoying learning about the investing side as well. In talking with a few other people, I have heard that being a financial advisor is basically a sales job where you are asked utilize your own contacts to push financial products on. \u00a0What I have heard is basically the only way to make money is to have rich friends or family to get established. \u00a0I really like the fact that I could be helping people, but the cold calling/pushing financial products on people does not sound appealing. \u00a0 Also, I don\u2019t believe I have the wealthy contacts needed to get established. I would love to get your insight on this matter, and to hear if the stories I hear about careers as a financial advisor are correct. \u00a0Additionally, I would love to hear any recommendations you would have for somebody looking to get into a career as a financial advisor.</li>\n<li>Hi Joshua, In 2013 I became completely obsessed with all things finance. I first picked up books about \"stock picking\" because I thought that was the way to go, but within a month or two I was recommended The Intelligent Investor, and I've been going with the \"boglehead\" strategy since then. I have been very lucky in getting a job straight out of college that pays quite well (software industry) and since I started in July 2013 I've saved 70-80% of my take-home income. I figure within 2015 I will become \"FI\" at age 25. I've been listening to your podcast daily since I discovered it last month, and needless to say it has quickly become my favorite podcast. Keep up the awesome work, I listen to every new episode! I am interested in becoming a fee-only financial planner. Every time I get the opportunity to talk with someone who is also interested in finance (believe me, this is super rare!) I get very excited. Nothing makes me happier, basically. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering right now. I am wondering, what is the shortest path that I could take to get to the place where I can \"hang out a shingle\" and start advising people for a small fee? I am not interested in charging for \"assets under management\"; I simply want to share knowledge with people so they can make their own investments and financial decisions. I want to do the opposite of most advisors basically! I'd be okay charging very little money for just a consultation, because I will be FI. You mentioned in one episode that you got a master's degree in financial planning, and I know you need the CFP certification. With just my bachelor's degree, could I get this CFP and start taking clients? Or would I need other certifications as well?</li>\n<li>Hi, Joshua, I have realized over time that I am a poor candidate for the traditional early retirement, and instead, would like to focus my next 15-17 years (roughly age 52-67) on doing something that I like--be it an administrator in a medical business that I believe in, being a health coach for middle age guys trying to get back into shape, or opening a gelato shop in my neighborhood. Actually, my dream job would probably be selling tickets in a booth at a ski resort! Maybe later... I have also thought about becoming a personal finance coach or advisor for docs. I see them make stupid mistakes all the time. I could probably do a series of podcasts on stupid things my partners have done.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's a great question and there are a bunch of ways to answer it. I decided for today to focus on the big picture answer which is primarily about having a good fit between your skills, your firm, your firm's abilities, and your prospective clients.</p>\n<p>I might do another show on the actual steps\u00a0needed to set up a firm if you want to do it independently.</p>\n<p>In this show I go through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historical practice models for financial planning</li>\n<li>Current practice models</li>\n<li>The importance of sales and sales skills</li>\n<li>Why you need to know what you bring to the table as a planner</li>\n<li>The importance of a great marketing plan</li>\n<li>The importance of a solid transition plan</li>\n<li>The importance of gaining clarity on what you want to do, who you want to work with, and how you want to work with them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Joshua</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "01:22:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/23/07/4f2307d2-dba7-afc6-3b2f-b0dc24d851a0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/radicalpersonalfinance/RPF0139-Advice_for_Getting_Into_Financial_Planning.mp3?dest-id=152630", "type": "episode", "tags": ["a", "as", "financial", "career", "planning", "cfp"]}, {"seriesId": 896153632, "seriesTitle": "Radical Personal Finance: Financial Independence, Early Retirement, Investing, Insurance, Financial Planning", "pubDate": 1421870556, "title": "138-Masterclass on 529 Plans a.k.a.

But, after finishing the first question and realizing how in-depth the show would be if I covered all six in one show, I decided to break it out into multiple shows.</p>\n<p>Today, I cover these two questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>8:41-I'm thinking about buying life insurance on my two kids' lives.

But I've never been able to find a company that will sell a stand alone term product on a minor's life. (Let me know if you know of one, please.)</li>\n<li>If you're buying a big policy (#1 above) and your child is over 18, it's easy. Buy an Annual Renewable Term policy for them.</li>\n<li>If you're buying a big policy (#1 above) and your child is under 18, it's harder. If you want to get closer to term coverage, consider a stripped-out universal life policy. If you have the cash flow, go with a traditional whole life insurance contract. Make sure it's a contract that your kid will be happy owning forever. Shop carefully.</li>\n<li>If you're buying a simple burial policy (#2), do it as a term rider on another policy. You can get these at work, bundled with a banking or property and casualty insurance product, or as a rider on your own term policy.</li>\n<li>If you're hedging now and later (#3), buy a small whole life policy with an Additional Purchase Benefit. That way as health, hobbies, and occupations change, your child will be able to buy more insurance if necessary.

These are all ideas and tactics that you can use in the last two weeks of 2014 to lower your income tax bill.</p>\n<p>I hope you don't defer your tax planning to the end of December. The end of the year is far too late to start talking about the really good stuff. Good tax planning should begin before January 1.</p>\n<p>But, these types of ideas can still be useful for you. It's possible that you've simply been too busy to do effective planning.</p>\n<p>It's also possible you had an unexpected windfall and you need to wipe out some tax liability.</p>\n<p>I'm here to help! :)</p>\n<p>Let's start with the easy ones and move to the harder ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last-minute retirement account contributions.\n<ul>\n<li>401(k)s and 403(b)s are tough becausec you have to have made your contributions as you go. Consider talking to HR about diverting a bonus check into the account if you can.</li>\n<li>IRAs are simple. You can contribute any time until you file your return. You can contribute up to $5,500 in 2014. Don't forget about the $1,000 catch up if you're older than 50.</li>\n<li>Almost everyone I've ever worked with is confused by the contribution limits. Read them for <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Amount-of-Roth-IRA-Contributions-That-You-Can-Make-for-2014\" target=\"_blank\">Roth IRAs</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/IRA-Deduction-Limits\" target=\"_blank\">Traditional IRAs</a>.</li>\n<li>Little tricks for IRAs:\u00a0You can make a separate payment for custodian fees, brokerage commissions, etc. in excess of the contribution limit. That will allow you to get the maximum value from the account.</li>\n<li>Consider establishing a an HR10/Keogh Plan or a SEP IRA.\n<ul>\n<li>Keogh plans were very popular for self-employed people prior to 2001. There was a tax law change in 2001 and now they're largely replaced by SEP IRAs.</li>\n<li>They have the same contribution limits but the SEP paperwork is much simpler.</li>\n<li>A Keogh plan has to be established by the end of the year but it can be funded prior to filing your return.</li>\n<li>A SEP IRA can be established after the end of the year and funded after the end of the year.\u00a0</li>\n<li>The maximum contribution is the lesser of 20 percent of earned income, less your deduction for half your self-employed payroll tax, before the deduction, or $52,000. (This winds up being 25% of net earned income after the deduction.)</li>\n<li>Remember that you can have one of these plans in addition to a 401(k) and an IRA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don't forget about the HSA. If you're covered by a HDHP, you can make your HSA contributions any time up till you file your return. Your contribution limits are $3,300 for an individual and $6,550 for a family. Remember also that there's a $1,000 catch-up contribution for 55+. This won't save you on your employment taxes but it will save you on your income taxes.</li>\n<li>One final little trick on IRAs. Look to see if you'll be eligible for a saver's credit. If you're at a low income level, this might help you...even if you can't afford to save for retirement. If you need to and you want to be aggressive, you can contribute to your Roth in December, take the savers credit on your return, and then take the distribution in January. (You'll owe tax on any gain but not on the contributions/basis.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consider deferring your income in other ways.\n<ul>\n<li>You can enter into a binding agreement until January to defer the grant of a bonus that you would otherwise receive in December. You need to enter into the agreement before the bonus is \"constructively received.\"</li>\n<li>The easy way to defer your income is if you are in business for yourself is to simply delay billing your clients until late December. You won't receive payment until the following year. Thus, no taxes in this year.</li>\n<li>Remember that this only works if you are a cash basis tax payer. If you are an accrual basis taxpayer in your business, you have to report the income when it is earned, not when it is received.</li>\n<li>If you have income from the sale of property, consider using an installment sale to defer income to a different tax year.</li>\n<li>Consider accelerating your expenses to lower your net income.</li>\n<li>In business, you can think through any end-of-year transactions you need to pay: accounts payable, conference fees, insurance premiums, marketing and advertising expenses, etc.</li>\n<li>Remember that you have to follow the 12-month rule.</li>\n<li>Consider buying equipment. In general, equipment will primarily be depreciated rather than expensed. But remember that you can make a Section 179 elect to expense <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr5771\" target=\"_blank\">up to $500,000</a>\u00a0and then take your depreciation after that.</li>\n<li>Consider bunching certain expenses such as medical expenses. If you've had a lot of medical expenses this year, consider going ahead and getting your dental expenses and eye expenses taken care of and pay forward the annual premium on your LTC insurance. That may result in enough deductions to take advantage of the medical expense deduction.</li>\n<li>Consider accelerating your tax payments: real estate taxes, personal property taxes, and state and local income taxes. Pay them now to take the deduction. (Be careful of AMT.)</li>\n<li>Consider making your charitable contributions and make sure to bunch them in years that you can fully use them.</li>\n<li>If you're making charitable contributions, be smart about how you do it, especially with regard to your taxes. Don't only think in terms of cash.\n<ul>\n<li>If you have appreciated property that you've held over 12 months, contribute it to the charity and take a deduction for the FMV. (Avoids the tax on the gain.)</li>\n<li>If you have loss property, sell it, take the tax loss and give the cash.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You can take deductions for items paid by check in the current year even if you mail the check on New Year's Eve, as long as there is no reason why the check can't be cashed in January.</li>\n<li>Credit card charges can be taken this year even if you don't pay the bill until next year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Think through the tax ramifications of your relationships.\n<ul>\n<li>If you're planning an end of the year or New Year's day wedding, calculate your taxes and see when you should actually schedule the marriage. Doesn't have to be the same day necessarily as the wedding itself.</li>\n<li>In general, marriage will only cut your taxes if one spouse works or earns almost all the income. Marriage will actually boost your taxes if both spouses work and earn good income.</li>\n<li>Dependents: Most people think purely about kids. There might be a planning scenario involving them.\u00a0For example, if you're having a planned C-section and the safe zone covers new years, have it on 12/31. Or, if you're adopting, try to get it finalized before the end of the year.</li>\n<li>But, the major benefit for some of you might be if you're caring for parents. There are a bunch of detailed rules. The one I want you to focus on is if you're providing more than half of a dependent's support. Doesn't mean income...it means support. Might be worth it to bunch some of your support here at the end of the year so that you can claim them as a dependent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Make sure you harvest your tax losses but also that you harvest some gains.

Although you could do this as a strictly mental exercise by just thinking about the answers and writing them down, I want to encourage you to go deeper than that. If you do, you'll get deeper answers that serve you better.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Start by putting on some relaxing music and sitting quietly in a comfortable environment where you won't be disturbed. Then, close our eyes and ask your subconscious mind to give you images of what your ideal life would look like if you could have it exactly the way you want it, in each of the following categories.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>1. First, focus on the financial area of your life. What is your annual income? What does your cash flow look like? How much money do you have in savings and investments? What is your total net worth?</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Next...what does your home look like? Where is it located? Does it have a view? What kind of yard and landscaping does it have? Is there a pool or a stable for horses? What color are the walls? What does the furniture look like? Are there paintings hanging in the rooms? What do they look like? Walk through your perfect house, filling in all of the details.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>At this point, don't worry about how you'll get that house. Don't sabotage yourself by saying, \"I can't live in Malibu because I don't make enough money.\" Once you give your mind\u2019s eye the picture, your mind will solve the \u201cnot enough money\u201d challenge. \u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Next visualize what kind of car you are driving and any other important possessions your finances have provided.</div>\n<div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>2. Next, visualize your ideal job or career.\u00a0 Where are you working?\u00a0 What are you doing? With whom are you working? What kind of clients or customers do you have? What is your compensation like?\u00a0 Is it your own business?</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>3. Then, focus on your free time, your recreation time.\u00a0 What are you doing with your family and friends in the free time you\u2019ve created for yourself?\u00a0 What hobbies are you pursuing?\u00a0 What kinds of vacations do you take?\u00a0 What do you do for fun?</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>4. Next, what is your ideal vision of your body and your physical health?\u00a0 Are you free of all disease?\u00a0 How long do you live to?\u00a0 Are you open, relaxed, in an ecstatic state of bliss all day long?\u00a0 Are you full of vitality?\u00a0 Are you flexible as well as strong?\u00a0 Do you exercise, eat good food, and drink lots of water?</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>5. Then move on to your ideal vision of your relationships with your friends and family.\u00a0 What is your relationship with your family like?\u00a0 Who are your friends? What is the quality of your relationships with your friends?\u00a0 What do those friendships feel like?\u00a0 Are they loving, supportive, empowering?\u00a0 What kinds of things do you do together?</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>6. What about the personal arena of your life?\u00a0 Do you see yourself going back to school, getting training, attending workshops, seeking therapy for a past hurt, or growing spiritually?\u00a0 Do you meditate or go on spiritual retreats with your church?\u00a0 Do you want to learn to play and instrument or write your autobiography?\u00a0 Do you want to run a marathon or take an art class?\u00a0 Do you want to travel to other countries?</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>7. Finally, focus on the community you live in, the community you\u2019ve chosen.\u00a0 What does it look like when it is operating perfectly?\u00a0 What kinds of community activities take place there?\u00a0 What about your charitable work?\u00a0 What do you do to help others and make a difference?\u00a0 How often do you participate in these activities?\u00a0 Who are you helping?</div>\n</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>You can write down your answers as you go, or you can do the whole exercise first and then open your eyes and write them down.
