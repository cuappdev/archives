This\u00a0can be a blessing and a curse because\u00a0some of us can organize ourselves and our time\u00a0while others of us need help. But no matter how organized we are (or not), we can always be better. And we can always be more productive with our time.\n\nHere to share his expertise on the subject is Mr. Productive himself Mike Vardy. Mike is the proud owner of Productivityist, the company as well as author of the book The Productivityist Workbook, Beyond Trying and The Now Year. He also just wrapped up co-hosting a podcast called Work Flowing.\n\nJoin us to hear what he has to say on productivity, comedy and how both of those topics relate to being a successful solopreneur on the 543rd\u00a0episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This Show\nWhen Mike first explored productivity he was working at Costco, for any of you not in the US Costco is a giant warehouse where you buy things in bulk at a discount. In his job there he was running two departments. And since that wasn't nearly enough for him, he got back into sketch and improv comedy when a friend suggested Mike join him. Mike had been in comedy earlier in his life and the bug bit him again that night.\n\nAt that point Mike was juggling two departments at Costco,\u00a0and when he wasn't working he was practicing or performing comedy of some variety. That's when he began to explore the concept of productivity, it soon emerged as yet a third ball he was juggling. When his daughter was born not long after, Mike realized he didn't want to be on the road. He wanted to be at home with his baby girl. Traveling for comedy had to go, and it was quickly replaced by productivity.\n\nUsing his performance skills honed in the comedy world, he began writing about and discussing something he called eventualism. Eventualism was the idea that if you do what Mike was sharing eventually you'll get around to finishing your task/project/goal. It was all tongue-in-cheek ala Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Show and it worked. He was able to interview people like David Allen and Seth Godin.\n\nIn fact it worked so well that David asked Mike to write for his site and Mike did. From there their relationship continued to grow and David eventually hired Mike to be a part of his team. Although he enjoyed what he was doing for them Mike realized he had become what he had been parodying with eventualism, and so he went back to his roots of productivity.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\n \tCan you schedule productivity?\n \tAre productivity and efficiency the same thing according to Mike?\n \tWhy Evernote is not enough.\n \tWhat is The Bullet in comedy and how does it relate to solopreneurship?\n \tHow systems actually help you do more, with less.\n \tAnd loads\u00a0more!\n\n\n\n\nMike shares that journey with us on today's show as well as some tips he has for making the most of your time and becoming the most productive you can be. One of the tips he has is to chunk your time. Set aside blocks of time to work on particular tasks and schedule this at least a few days in advance so when that time block arrives you've already made an agreement with yourself to do, and you can't get out of it.\n\nHe suggests creating themes for your days, if possible. Make Monday your administrative day where you handle all the administrative tasks that you need to do for your business. There's nothing else allowed to happen on that day, only admin-related tasks and projects. Doing so will keep you fresh and energized because it won't feel like you're doing the same thing day in and day out.\n\nRelated to creating themes and chunking your time is the question of whether or not you can actually schedule productivity for yourself. Mike's view is that if you approach your work with a task-based mindset versus a time-based mindset you'll be far more productive.\n\nSo scheduling a day for tasks like administrative work works better than schedu...", "duration": "1:06:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/543.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1488526815, "title": "542: FREEEE Coaching Friday", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to our weekly Q&amp;A edition of The Solopreneur Hour.

I started a CPR certification business. Other than teaching more - would like to grow my business by creating content as you have said many times before. Would like to create an easy to follow \"how to\" card. Need suggestions on software that is easy to use that doesn't take a ton of time to learn? Thanks much, Greg in Howe Texas (near Dallas)\n\nQ:Loved the recent episode with Andrew Jones - lots of application in our world about how he focused on one specific segment of the speaker market at a time.\u200b\u00a0 Am also glad to hear Dawn Marrs on the show - this needs to become an even more regular segment!\n\n\nFollowed your lead and got my first media credential for the upcoming Collision tech conference in New Orleans later this year! Never thought to ask before, so thanks for reminding us podcasters that we are part of the media, at least when we want to be!\n\n\u00a0You've been talking up the Olo Clip camera lately. I am excited about this because I've been using Instagram to share photos of New Orleans and grow my brand (@Beyondbourbonst on Instagram). Will it fit over an iPhone case or does the camera need to be naked? I tend to destroy stuff so the thought of the phone without protection scares me!\n\n\nQ: Hey, Michael... No question for you today. I just wanted to give back a little. I already did a review ages ago and that just isn't enough for how often you keep me company on the entrepreneurial journey so today, I shared your show with 35,000 other entrepreneurs and wannapreneurs in the Screw the Nine to Five Group. Hope it gets you some more listens. Thank you for all you do for us. I loved hearing your music conference story and loved how excited you were to share it with us even more.\n\nQ: Following up on your response to my SoloLab question - can you give some examples of where a brand and a website wouldn't match? What about a website and an IG handle, should they match or can they be different if they are closely integrated?\n\n\n\nSee you next week!", "duration": "41:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/527.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal -

But with the advent of LeadPages, that problem was solved. One of those happily satisfied online marketer solopreneurs\u00a0was one Tim Paige.\n\nToday he sits down with us for a live conversation from Podcast Movement 2014 and we chat about going from customer to co-leader...and how being a musician paved the way for his present day success.\n\nJoin us for episode 517\u00a0of The Solopreneur Hour to hear all of that and so much more.\nMore About This Show\nTim Paige is known in many circles of solopreneurs, entrepreneurs, online marketers, affiliate marketers and the like. Everyone in that world knows him as one of the kick-ass dudes bringing us LeadPages and their podcast, ConversionCast. And when you hear him talk about opt-in pages, conversions, and email tips & tricks, you'll instantly hear the passion in his voice. He loves his work because it helps people like you do what they love most.\n\nBut before he joined the team at LeadPages, Tim was a musician, an affiliate marketer and a voiceover artist. A man of many talents, he shares with us some of the lessons he's learned from all of those endeavors. In particular, we dive into what his days as a touring musician were like and what it was like for him to be on TRL on MTV and the Warped Tour.\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with TRL, MTV or Warped Tour, let's explain. TRL stood for Total Request Live and it was a show on MTV where the biggest bands and musical artists came to perform their music live in the MTV studio in New York City. So being on it was kind of a big deal! Tim says the experience of TRL prepared him for being a solopreneur in many respects; he learned the value in saying yes and going after something you want, whether you think you'll get it or not.\n\nHis TRL experience came on the heels of Van's Warped Tour. In fact, they appeared on TRL just four days after coming off their performance at Warped Tour! Warped Tour is an international outdoor music festival. Though it began by featuring punk rock bands,\u00a0today it showcases alternative rock and bands from other genres. Again, it was a pretty big deal when his band got to perform on\u00a0the tour!\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n \tHow Tim's band landed their spot on Van's Warped Tour.\n \tWhy you should be a \"yes\" person.\n \tHow Tim has taken the ConversionCast list to 95,000 subscribers.\n \tHis microphone tip for all podcasters.\n \tWhat happens when you give someone too many choices?\n \tAnd lots more!\n\nTim explains his visit to Warped Tour was the kind of experience that shaped his perception and his belief system. If he could get his band on that tour and then perform in front of hundreds of thousands of people, what else could he do? Anything, so long as he said yes and he went for it.\n\nHe's taken those lessons with him into all of his projects and endeavors since then. As we mentioned earlier, he does voiceovers for podcasters and was an affiliate marketer before joining the gang at LeadPages. He got to know Clay from LeadPages and he later told Tim he wanted him to run a podcast for their brand. Tim was thrilled; he and Clay mapped out a plan together and Tim got it off the ground. It started as a daily show but eventually Tim discovered a weekly show best suited their content and their audience. In fact, he kept his loyal listeners when he made the shift AND his opt-in rates went up significantly! His audience let him know they loved once-a-week episode style.\n\nOver time, Tim really honed in on what works and what doesn't work in both podcasting and conversion rates; I made sure he gave us a few golden nuggets on this show! One of the biggest takeaways for me was how he grew their list to 95,000 subscribers: their\u00a0detailed show notes for each episode\u00a0are only available to people who join their list.", "duration": "1:08:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/517.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1483144829, "title": "516: Free Coaching Friday, the \u201cI\u2019ve Got A Cold\u201d Edition", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hi all.\n\nI don't feel too well. \u00a0Which is a drag, because I had to cancel the show I was supposed to play drums in tonight.

I created a writing business and one year later one of my clients is also now gaining the same recognition, but this time I\u2019m a ghostwriter in the shadows letting somebody else take the glory.\n\nSo despite having successful podcast (Tech Blog Writer Podcast) and successful clients that I am helping, I need to create a sales funnel to introduce a a passive income steam too. Luckily I know a web funnel creation guy who is ready to go, but my problem is I do not know what to create.\n\nSo my question is, what kind of product do you think I should create? Having achieved great success in my field and then replicated it for others too, I am naturally leaning towards a personal branding, thought leadership kind of course. The only problem is I cannot publicize what I have achieved with others because I am locked down with NDA\u2019s.\n\nEssentially I\u2019m a longtime listener and first time emailer and I need a little nudge in the right direction.\nHuge thanks for your help and a great podcast that is the soundtrack to my lunchtime runs.\n\n\n\nJose\u00a0G\n\n\n\nHey Michael,\n\nWhat do you suggest would be a smooth way to introduce members of a free FB group to my products.\nThe FB group is a community for people with back pain and I get around 10-15 new members organically every day.\nI don't wanna be pushy and just tell them to buy my products.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nJose\n\nMark\u00a0B\n\n\nWhat is the best way to drive traffic to a new website that has been properly optimized with organic seo outside of AdWords?", "duration": "35:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/509a.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1481098245, "title": "508: This One Hack Will Change Your Solopreneur Life, with Gavin Zuchlinski of Acuity Scheduling", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "One of the first things I did when I started the Solopreneur hour was get an online scheduler, which completely changed how I did business and how I spent my day.

Your network plays a pivotal role in your net worth, your business and your life. One of the key pillars of solopreneurship is relationships and building networks. You can see it in any successful solopreneur\u2019s business. To show you exactly how this is done the right way, I brought Jayson Gaignard to the show today.\n\nIn episode 499Jayson Gaignard joins me to talk Timothy Ferris, masterminds, relationships and investing in networks.\n\nFor most of his adult life Jayson has been a solopreneur; he realized very early on he was unemployable. And like most solopreneurs, he has seen his share of highs and lows. He has generated $84,000 in just a few hours and brought Timothy Ferriss of The Four Hour Workweek to Canada for the first time; and Jayson has also been $250,000 in cash debt with no business and no set plan: just his solopreneurial mind, his network and his considerable willpower.\n\nWhether at the highs of highs or the lowest of lows on his journey, Jayson has understood, utilized and leveraged the value of his network. As he says in this show, \u201cI knew the bank could take my accounts, but they could never take my network.\u201d\n\nBrilliant eh?! But this wasn\u2019t the only brilliance Jayson shared on the show, he dropped some golden nuggets like:\n\n \tWhy action without vision is simply a recipe for disaster.\n \tThe 7 steps to forming and solidifying a relationship with ANYONE, even the \u201cgurus\u201d you admire and emulate.\n \tWhy the integrity of your word is worth more than anything else.\n \tThe importance of celebrating your wins and your progress, even when you think you haven\u2019t made it yet.\n \tAn unexpected yet simple way to connect and reach out with speakers after their events\n\nTogether we dive into real life lessons on how he created, built and leveraged relationships and networks for success, and how you can do the same thing in your business.\n\nFor even more on networks and net worth, connect with Jayson on Facebook and Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JaysonGaignard\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JaysonGaignard\nResources from this episode:\nhttp://mastermindtalks.com\n\nhttp://solohourbook.com\n\nYanik Silver's Underground Event\n\nCadre DC: A Networking Group\n\nThe Four Hour Chef\n\nYour Network is Your Net Worth: Unlock the Hidden Power of Connections for Wealth, Success, and Happiness in the Digital Age\n\nhttp://www.smartpassiveincome.com\n\nhttps://solopreneurhour.com/NMX", "duration": "1:24:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/499.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1479115007, "title": "498: John Spencer Ellis on Hacking Your Brain, Part 1", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today's guest is John Spencer Ellis, who I saw speak at Thrive Connect in early 2016, and he absolutely blew my mind.\n\nWe finally were able to connect for a show, but I realized that one show wouldn't be enough for this guy. \u00a0So, we'll bring him on again next week for part 2 of the conversation.\n\nWe dug into his background a bit, before we talked about SEO, keyword research (keywordshitter.com is real!), getting in the right mindset, hacking how you handle adversity, and a bunch more.\n\nWe'll dig more into JSE on the next episode as well!\n\nThis episode sponsored by Organifi, your superfood green drink. \u00a0Go to http://organifi.com and use the promo code \"solohour\" for 20% your order.\n\nhttp://johnspencerellis.com\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n#keywords - entrepreneur podcast, podcast for entrepreneurs, business podcast, coaching podcast", "duration": "1:14:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/498.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1478895939, "title": "497: Free Coaching Friday, Election Week!", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Happy Veterans Day everyone!\n\nFree coaching Friday is in effect! \u00a0Here's a list of today's questions:\n\nKevin Dahlberg \nDo you think that social media has made it possible for us to know too much about the flaws of people running for office?\n\nWould we have had similar problems with previous presidents if there had been a magnifying glass on everything they said and did?\n\nThanks for the great show.\n\nJill Miller \nI\u2019m sure you have several questions about the election, but my question is what do you think will change for entrepreneurs now that the administration has changed?

Not the details, but the overall approach? Should a trailer be first or just start uploading content and add a refined trailer later? Launch with several episodes at once or piecemeal?

(Best of)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Did you know that before Social Media Examiner was launched, Michael Stelzner was known as THE white paper guy?\u00a0What's a white paper you ask? In the 138th edition of The Solopreneur Hour, Michael joins us to explain what a white paper is and what it does, and he shares how that white paper industry expertise led to his interest in social media and the eventual launch and success of Social Media Examiner.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the necessity of building relationships, how to do it with people you admire and fledgling talent you come across, and how he runs a thriving enterprise with a dedicated staff, many of whom are volunteers.\n\nMore About This Show\nSince his early days, Michael Stelzner has been an entrepreneur. Growing up as a young boy in the Midwest, he and his brother would dig up nightcrawlers and sell them to fishermen the next morning. For those of you non-fishing folk, nightcrawlers are big worms fishermen used as bait.\nBeing just a kid, his nightcrawler interested wained so he picked up a paper route. When he grew tired of that, he got into video games and created a video game that was actually bought by a large gaming company. One week after they sent him the contract, they went bankrupt.\nNot one to be deterred by a setback, Michael persevered. Though he was the only solopreneur-spirit in his family, his father was always encouraging him to follow his passions. Michael wasn't clear on exactly what those passions were but he also knew he was artistic. He was one of the rare birds who was a good artist and a good writer, his \"secret sauce\" if you will.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n \tWhat's the biggest content tool in 2014?\n \tWhat is unconferencing and should you do it?\n \tWho was once his assistant and is now an online powerhouse in her own right?\n \tHow many millions of people visit Social Media Examiner now?\n \tWhat's the number one thing 68% of marketers plan to do in 2014?\n \tAnd lots more!\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually Michael did find a home for his writing and artistic talents: he became the director of artists at an agency in the 1990s.\nFrom there, he found his way into the world of white papers and positioned himself as an expert. If you're wondering what a white paper is, Michael explains it as a combination of an article and a brochure cross-designed to sell.\nTo solidify his expertise in the white paper industry, he published a book on the subject called Writing White Papers, created a big portal where people came to learn how to write and create white papers. He segued that into teaching marketers about white papers and training tens of thousands of out-of-work journalists how to write white papers and generate a living for themselves.\nAnd from those experiences he understood the value in teaching and\u00a0created deep relationships with the marketers and writers he came into contact with. From those close connections, Michael saw trends. He noticed they were all getting on Twitter,\u00a0so he started interviewing people for his newsletter, which were very big back then in the late 2008/early 2009. With those interviews, he introduced marketers to social media combined with white papers.\nHe saw another trend emerging: people were going crazy over anything related to social media so he started hosting online events around the topic. Those events were\u00a0the most popular and a light bulb went off in Michael's mind: social media was the next big thing and he was going to be a part of it.\nMichael had no idea how he was going to get into social media but he knew he was going down that path. The first thing he did? He built relationships. He got to know the people who were movers and shakers - the ones who were hosting events like BlogWorld and MarketingProfs.\nHis earlier connections paid off; one of his fans from his white paper days was Jason Falls and Jason was the man in charge of the speakers at BlogWorld that year. So when Michael heard Jason was going to be in San Diego where Michael lives,", "duration": "1:09:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/486.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1476477235, "title": "485: Mike Sherbakov Joins Us For Free Coaching Friday", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today's free coaching Friday has a special guest, my buddy Mike Sherbakov from The Greatness Foundation. \u00a0(http://thegreatnessfoundation.com) Mike is also an instagram expert, and has a great side hustle\u00a0business helping people optimize their Instagram feeds. \u00a0Today's questions, as always, are all over the map, but very interesting!\n\nSponsored by Organifi - Get 20% Off Your First order by using \"solohour\" at checkout at http://organifi.com\n\nSponsored by Hostgator - Get 30% off your entire order by using the promo code \"solo30\" at checkout, from http://hostgator.com", "duration": "1:02:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/485.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1476257025, "title": "484: Brett Campbell \u2013 Right Now.

Looking back 6 months from now, are you happy with what you have been working on could you say yes\n \t15:35 8 Years ago Brett moved from New Zealand where he grew up in a very low social, economic area with little opportunity around. Brett moved to Australia to embark on his entrepreneurial journey. At the time he left, one of Brett's dear friends got diagnosed with breast cancer.\u00a0While Brett was in Australia, Brett's friend was going through treatment, he was out of sight out of mind, didn't see her go through the treatment. Brett almost blocked the process she was going through out of his mind like it wasn't happening. The great thing was she coming out the other side of the treatment great. She was a school teacher, inspiring young children and then one day she got a headache, and it was worse than normal. She went to the doctors, and they did a brain scan, and they discovered she had a brain tumor. It was a total shock to the system. All Brett thought why her, why her a second time. She went through chemotherapy again.\u00a0Brett called up his her husband (One of Brett's best mates) and asked: \"How's she doing, I was thinking of taking a bit of a holiday, when should I come over?\" His best mate said, \"No rush mate, she's coming home on Monday, you could come over in the next few weeks.\"\u00a0Brett hopped off the phone and went to book his plane tickets and this wickedly overwhelming feeling of intuition just flooded his body. He didn't know what to make of it, but he just knew he shouldn't book the tickets. He rang his friend up again and told him he was coming over next week. He was lucky enough financially that he could just drop everything and come over. He arrived there on Tuesday, he rang his friend to find out ho she was and was told she was doing well and just got home.The house they lived in was really small. His friend still had to be in a hospital bed, so the hospital bed was set up in the living room. She didn't have a good nights sleep, so she was drifting in and out of sleep when Brett arrived. Brett sat beside her holding her hand; he saw she was not in any pain, and she whispered to him, thank you so for coming. Three hours later she passed away in front of them.\n \t22:31 When she passed away he went to beast mode, it wasn't until the plane ride home he burst into tears. He saw all his old friends in New Zealand and they comment on his life and his successes, What looked like successful on the outside didn't feel like success on the inside, he was upset with himself, he knew he wasn't living up to his full potential.\nWhy not me? Why not now?\n \t25:35 Good is the enemy of great. What is that thing that you would do for free for the rest of your life? Then you can look at how to monetize it to live the life that you want. Its about looking at the four key phases Brett mentioned and working on them incrementally to build upon the next.

See life as a series of projects or experiments. Some may last a couple of weeks. Some may last years and some may last decades then finish them when they organically come to an end\n \t9:28 Define yourself by the experience not by the entity.\n \t12:39 At College Jonathan was Entrepreneur/sound and lighting technician/DJ started his first company. Built it and sold it. Travel for three months around Australia went back to the US and got a job in outside sales. Hated it. Left and went to Law school. After burnout from practicing Law, Jonathan went back to his duel love of mind body and entrepreneurship. Began as a $12 personal trainer. Six months later opened his firsts facility. Grew the business and expanded twice. 2 years later sold it to an investor group. Took a year off to write and play. Signed a lease for a floor in New York City, the day before 9/11. Opened a Yoga center. Grew that with a beautiful community. The end of 2008 Jonathan was focused on other things so sold that company. Started to focus then on writing books and building communities in the online space. Three books in and a few ventures 2012 came and launched the Good Life Project. This is now his core professional focus since then.\n \t16:18 Being contrarian. Instead of niche down, building a broader audience for a more generalized experience, needs, desires and aspirations know that he could ask them what do they need and create solutions that were very specific within that larger community.\n18:25 Decisions. Being intentional about the way you craft the days, the weeks and the months in your life is something a lot of us just don't do. We allow other people stories from the moment we wake up control everything through the course of our day. We get to the end of the day and every minute had been filled but not by a whole lot of stuff that is important to us. We are not intentional about it. We were living by default. You should say no, when I open my eyes, I choose how this day will unfold, I choose what I'm about to say yes or no to. It is a game changer.\n \t20:50 When Jonathan realized he was not living a good life\n \t22:31 Defining a good life for Jonathan. See life in three buckets. Vitality, Contribution, and Connection\n \t24:33 Good is the enemy of great\n \t30:37 Money, happiness, life satisfaction\n \t35:13 Experience with REV.com and Jonathan's writing process\n \t41:27 Jonathan's primary form of creative expression is writing. He sold a different book to his publisher to the one that he is releasing now\n \t43:36 The easiest and most personal of all the books he has written\n \t46:03 The book is focused on the three-bucket model.\n \t46:41 Contribution Bucket: How are you bringing yourself to the world and contributing to the world that is deep and meaningful for you. What gives you a sense of purpose or passion?\n \t51:24 The Givers Glow\n \t55:53 Connection Bucket: If you don't feel a sense of belonging, we wither and in a pretty fierce and fast way. Belonging is a physiological and psychological need. What are our values and beliefs? Then look for people that share those values and beliefs. When you see the world in the similar sort of way, that's what brings people together.\n \t61:51 Vitality Bucket: Most obvious, Exercise and nutrition. Less obvious would be cultivating mindfulness.", "duration": "1:08:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/481.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Great Books", "Jonathan Fields", "Love & Relationships", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1475474173, "title": "480: Amazon FBA Private Label Masterclass with Brian Creager", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "This was a REALLY fun episode, because I didn't know this business model existed. \u00a0You can think of a product, find a manufacturer to make it for you, brand it, and sell it on Amazon without carrying a warehouse full of inventory and shipping it yourself. \u00a0This was a really interesting, informative show.\n\n \t6:08 May 2015, Brian was signing the paperwork to leave his corporate gig\n \t7:06 Brian had the dubious task of making concrete look good\n \t9:19 When you have an industry that is woefully behind you can innovate in the space like no other\n \t10:12 Meeting Chris Ducker and the catalyst to becoming a full-time entrepreneur\n \t11:12 23 Years incorporate - somebody wants what you know, and how private labeling came about\n \t12:59 What an air conditioning company private label and ultimately focusing on the branding\n \t14:29 Born and raised in Pennsylvania and moved to Atlanta in mid-2000's\n \t14:50 What the catalyst was to start selling private label goods and selling them on Amazon\n \t17:13 Locking down a product from an intellectual standpoint.

You don't want to cut corners on the packaging design, photography, presentation and copywriting.\n \t28:51 How Amazon works for someone who does private labeling. A traffic platform in addition to a sales platform and using FBA - Fulfilled By Amazon. Brian's products also qualify for Amazon Prime as his company is a 3P Seller (3rd Party)\n \t31:13 Images are the single biggest impact on a conversion rate for a listing\n \t31:44 Taking your products live on Amazon and steps for new sellers to get traction. Everything we do to generate sales is designed to impact either traffic or conversion.\n \t32:29 Conversion Rate: A really bad listing would convert under 20%, Unt Session Percentage (USP - An Amazon term), The number of units you sell has a factor to the number of sessions (A session is a unique visitor with a 24hr period). This is the Amazon measure of conversion rate, not page views. You want a conversion rate over 20%. Anything under means your listing is not optimized (maximize your images). Images, headline and reviews all factor into your conversion rates.\n \t33:47 Bullet points are important to conversion. This is where the power of copywriting and storytelling come in. People want to buy a story.\n \t34:09 The story around the Krieger + s\u00f6hne\u00ae brand\n \t34:32 How to get reviews when starting out, using follow-up emails to ask consumer feedback\n \t36:28 The first 48-72hours - Getting traffic, using PPC (Pay Per Click) optimizing for keywords\n \t38:23 It had taken six months before Brian knew he had a successful product, in that time Bryan was making income that would replace his income at his corporate job\n \t39:22 Entrepreneurial mindset - Business changes, what you have to do, the activities you have to undertake to be successful changes. Business changes. You need to adapt. What you need to a major faith in and not give up on is your business model. Whatever that maybe.\n \t41:33 Going retail at the right time\n \t43:05 Not knowing a thing about men's hair care products, how Brian went about finding a manufacturer.

For example #entrepreneur, which would have over\u00a011 million posts, then 10 to 15 hashtags that are closely related to that, lastly,\u00a0about 4 or 5 that are really niche to the subject\u00a0that only have around 2 to 3 thousand posts.\n\nThe reason for this is because, with the high volume hashtags your post will get lost very quickly, the same thing that happens with Tweets on Twitter. On the mid to lower end of the #hashtag post counts you are going to stay on that hashtags category a lot longer. This way you will get a lot more exposure.\n\u00a0\nLinks and Resources\n\n \tTheInstaGuy.co\n \tConferencetopia.com\n \tiwantsololab.com\n \tInstagram.com\n \tSmartpassiveincome.com Episode with Michael\n\nTypography Apps\n\n \tTyporama\n \tWord Swag\n \tPhotoshop\n \tCanva.com\n\nScheduling Apps\n\n \tLater\n \tGrum.co\n \tBuffer\n \tHootsuite\n\nPopular Posts App\n\n \tCommand on ios\n\nHashtags\n\n \tInstagrams Hashtag Cloud on the Desktop\n \tRitetag\n\nPlanning and Arranging your Posts\n\n \tUnum app\n \tInstagrids for Instagram\n\n\u00a0\nPrevious Episodes Mentioned\n\n \tNathan Chan Instagram Masterclass Episode\n\nThis Episode Was Brought To You By:", "duration": "1:01:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/478.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Masterclass", "Podcast", "Tony Huynh", "Hashtags", "Instagram", "Instaguy", "Ritetag", "Tactics"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1474868683, "title": "477: Thinking BIG in Business, and Relentlessly Considering Small Details, with Mike Johnston", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "I just spent a week in Folsom CA at the Mikeslessons.com drum camp. \u00a0I'd been waiting 3 years to take it, and finally got the chance. \u00a0On the last, day, Mike and I sat down to chat about the business side of Mike's business. \u00a0A couple of key takeaways: \u00a0I had no idea how fastidious Mike is. \u00a0Very regimented and relentless when it comes to pursuing a goal. \u00a0He also has a really \"no excuses\" attitude about business, and drumming. \u00a0For as great of a drummer as Mike is, I think he's a better entrepreneur. \u00a0This is another instant \"best of\" episode. \u00a0Enjoy!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMike and Mike Discuss:\n\n \t1:55\u00a0Doing the simple thing's so well that they look impressive\n \t5:09\u00a0Your a great drummer, but you are a better entrepreneur\n \t8:59\u00a0Great design, Content and Conversions, it's hard to do all three well\n \t10:32\u00a0Music genres come and go but education stays constant.

Listen from 18:13 to hear how he did and built up his portfolio.\n\nAfter watching the newspaper industry implode, Vincent and his wife had started a family, the newspaper Vincent worked for's budget was getting smaller and smaller for covering away games and at this point, they were at negative net worth.\n\nSo they decided to create a side business to help clear off their debts and to create freedom. After three years of putting all their business money (after tax) into clearing their debt, they were free. Free to do whatever they wished. It was three years of struggles of just surviving off of Vincents 9-5 pay, but now they could both quit their jobs and do whatever they wanted.\n\nBeing a professional sports photographer is more a life experience for Vincent rather than a career. Sports photography has never paid well for him, but the most value he has got from this is the relationships he has built and maintained.\nLinks and Resources\n\n \tElizabethVincentPhotography.com\u00a0\n \tVincent on Instagram\u00a0\n \tVincent on Facebook\u00a0\n \tWord Swag", "duration": "1:08:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/475.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Man", "Photography", "Podcast", "Vincent Pugliese"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1474262134, "title": "474: Rob Greenlee of Spreaker \u2013 Podcasting Before Podcasting Was a Thing", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today I'm honored to speak to Rob Greenlee, formerly of Microsoft/Xbox/Zune, PodcastOne, and currently with Spreaker, a full podcasting solution. \u00a0Rob has been podcasting in some form or another since before 2004's advent of the RSS feed as a podcast infrastructure.\n\nRob is a marketing guy at heart\u00a0and shares his insight on how to grow a show, why to do a show, and how much he loves the craft, just like yours truly.\n\nListen to Rob's live show\u00a0every Wednesday 3 pm pacific \u00a0spreakerliveshow.com\n\nnew media show \u00a0Sat. 9 AM pacific \u00a0newmediashow.com \u00a0audio/video\n\nMike and Rob Discuss:\n\n \t3:01 Tricaster - Simultaneously broadcasting to other platforms similar to OBS\n \t8:14 Rob in Seattle\n \t10:27 How Rob got into broadcasting\n \t17:13 Launching a podcast at the turn of the century vs now\n \t22:05 The moment Rob felt podcasting had legs\n \t25:32 Taking a traditional radio approach\n \t30:16 Next Trend in Podcasting\n \t37:26 Scaling the audience for the medium\n \t42:36 Getting into the head of your audience\n \t44:51 Tracking tools & Users Privacy\n \t50:38 New podcasters and how to grow a show in 2016\n \t57:00 How Spreaker is enhancing the Podcast world\n \t60:06 Keeping your intro short\n\n\nLinks and Resources\n\n \tRobGreenlee.com\n \tRob on Twitter\n \tSpreaker.com\n \tSpreakerLiveShow.com\n \tNewMediaShow.com\n \tOBS\n \tTricaster\n \tMAPCOM\n \tIphone 7 plus\n \tAmazon Echo\n \tGoogle Analytics\n \tFacebook Pixel\n \tHinesWardShow.com\n \tConferencetopia.com\n\nThis Episodes Sponsor:", "duration": "1:05:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/474.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Guests", "Man", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Rob Greenlee"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1474141583, "title": "BONUS EPISODE: Me doing a bunch of goofy accents on Free Coaching Friday Part II", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "This was a silly show...I answer a bunch of your questions with goofy accents. \u00a0(wait for them). \u00a0No offense intended. \u00a0Happy Saturday everyone!", "duration": "37:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/473.5.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1474051226, "title": "473: Entrepreneur / Solopreneur Q&A", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Free coaching Friday, y'all.

Tune in for this very fun, candid and interesting edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show and Hines Ward\nFor those of you who don't know who Hines Ward is he's a Super Bowl MVP, a two-time Super Bowl champion, an Ironman athlete and a Dancing With The Stars season winner. He's also the founder of Helping Hands Foundation, a charity we talk about on this show.\n\nI've followed his career after he was drafted by the Steelers and have always been impressed by his tenacity, his commitment and his attitude on and off the field.\n\nToday we chat about what it was like to grow up as a biracial kid in Atlanta in the 1970s, how his mom showed him the meaning of persistence and dedication, why he started his foundation and how he's transitioned from being a premiere athlete to life post-NFL.\n\nHines was born in Seoul, Korea and lived there until he was a toddler. His mom is Korean and his dad is African-American. Back then interracial relationships were not accepted in Korea and were barely tolerated in the U.S. His mom was kicked out of her country and her family shunned her when she married Hines' dad and gave birth to Hines.\n\nSo his dad brought them to the US and they settled in Atlanta. Their marriage didn't last and Hines' mom became his primary caretaker. She worked multiple jobs to make sure he had the best life possible. They were seldom home together, but she always made sure to have food prepared for his meals and let him know how much she loved him. Hines knew she was working so hard for him, and that's a lesson he has carried with him throughout his life.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Hear:\n\n \tHow he has proven haters wrong over and over again.\n\n \tHow did he land a spot on Dancing With The Stars?\n\n \tWhat's the worst part of playing in the NFL?\n\n \tThe connection between being a football player and being a solopreneur.\n\n \tHow he played without an ACL!\n\n \tAnd so much more.\n\n\nEven with his mother's love and support growing up biracial at that time in history was hard. Hines didn't fit in with either the black kids or the Korean kids, both sets of kids made fun of him. He struggled to find his identity, especially without his father around.\n\nBut that didn't stop him from dreaming big and going after those dreams. From early on Hines wanted to be a Super Bowl MVP; he would play football at recess and pretend to be whoever that year's MVP had been. He envisioned himself in that role, and worked tirelessly to be the best athlete he could be so one day he'd step into that role.\n\nHe also worked hard at school so he could go to college. Kids would make fun of him and call him an \"Uncle Tom\". Naysayers said a lot of things but Hines just ignored them and carried on being the best he could be.\n\nAnd it eventually paid off. He was drafted by the Steelers in the third round as a special teams guy. But by his fourth season he led the team in receptions - and he did so as the fourth man on the depth chart. That meant the team had 3 other guys ranked ahead of him in their receiving core. Hines proved he was a great asset to the team, and would continue to do so throughout his career.\n\nWhen he helped the team win a Super Bowl and was named MVP it was a dream come true for him. He was elated, and was not prepared for the whirlwind of attention it would bring from his home country of Korea.\n\nAs is his nature Hines found the positive in the situation.", "duration": "1:29:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/472.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1473644173, "title": "471: Scaling What Doesn\u2019t Scale, Building A Team Around You, and Finding Niche Biz Opportunities with Mark Asquith of Podcast Websites", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "In the lobby of the Holiday Inn Philadelphia Swedesborough, where I was just speaking about The Art of The Interview, I sit down with Mark Asquith of Podcast Websites. \u00a0We talk about being a designer, scaling your business, business ops, and how Podcast Websites came to be.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMike and Mark Discuss\n\n \t4:33 Jako Pistorius - Music influences\n \t6:43 MAPCON - Visiting grassroots conferences\n \t7:36 Motivation of people attending conferences vs those that don't\n \t13:50 Time freedom\n \t23:02 It's not about the time you invest its about how you spend the time you invest\n \t26:30 Undercover Dad\n \t31:55 After MOD becoming a designer\n \t34:15 Letting go\n \t36:06 Getting into Wordpress, cost vs value and scalability\n \t41:12 Knowing where to hit\n \t45:48 Podcast Websites\n \t50:19 The way we scaled is to not scale\n \t55:47 Age of the generalist\n \t60:18 USP\n\n\n\"Do what you can with what you can right now\" - Theodore Roosevelt\n\nMark Asquith is the founder and host of Excellence-Expected.

Once subscribed and have downloaded the Conferencetopia lead magnet they will automatically be put on the regular email series. After about five emails there would be an email that directs the subscriber down one of two paths.\n\nOne to Sololab, the other to \"The Art of The Interview\" course. Through later sequences, these paths will cross.\n\nA typical opt-in within the entrepreneurial space without a podcast and presence would mean you have to pay for advertising/traffic. This would give you a cost per lead (CPL), and it can get expensive.\n\n$3-$5 per lead in the entrepreneurial industry is probably decent acquisition, but if you were in real estate market, for example, CPL would be expensive because it is a competitive market. Around $50 to $100 per lead.\n\nSo a lead would be someone that would opt-in into a form to acquire their email address.\n\n\u00a0\nActive Reengagement\nWhen someone has not clicked or opened an email in \"X\" amount of days, Dawn puts them on an email sequence that says,\n\n\"Hey,\nThere is a bunch of cool stuff that I would love for you to see, I think it would be very helpful to you.\"\n\nIf they don't click or open those emails, then they are automatically culled from her email list.\n\nDawn's criteria for this email sequence is they have not opened/clicked or made a purchase.

In those episodes, we have covered too much about her background including her career in Hollywood as an actor, musician and comedian and how she has managed to sustain success. In this episode, we will give just a recap of his background. \n\nAnna is a talented actress, comedian and voiceover artist who knows what it takes to create a successful career in whatever she does. She has spent over a decade working on-camera and in voice over. She also produces the podcasts \"Yoda And Me\" and \"America's Angriest Trainer\" with Vinnie Tortorich. \n\nAnna knows that education is the key to success. She has dedicated her life to acquire much of it. She attended St. Andrews School for college prep from 1987 \u2013 1991. In 1991, she joined Emory University where she studied a Bachelor of Arts degree in History, French and Cultural Studies.\n\nUpon graduation from the university, Anna found herself truly unemployable. She wanted to work for herself. As a young lady, she used to believe that one day she would land on a certain project that would lead her to bigger and better opportunities. She knew that she was the one who determines the \"bigger and better opportunities.\" So she worked hard to achieve her goals of becoming a Hollywood star, blogger and internet marketer. \n\nIn 2002, she started her blog, annavocino.com, to recreate gluten free versions of comfort food favorites from her half Italian, half Southern-girl heritage. In 2012, she partnered with the inimitable Vinnie Tortorich to co-host and produce The Angriest Trainer Podcast, and her recipes these days are mostly free from sugars and grains. \u00a0She uses fresh ingredients whenever possible, and tries keep things simple.\nBeing the consummate solopreneur, you must be prepared to succeed in this world. Currently, Anna is working on numerous projects including a gluten-free cookbook. We discuss about her cookbook, what life has been like since she brought herself into the limelight, and how you can be inspired in order to stay healthy, fresh, and relevant.\n\nMike and Anna Discuss:\n\n \t[06:37] How Anna became a stand-up comedian.

So I want you to think about this for a second. Think about what you're working on right now in your solopreneur world that's not working. Are you trying to do Facebook ads? Are you trying to play something that can't play? Are you trying to write copy? Are you trying to grow your mailing list? Are you trying to podcast? Are you trying to interview people better? Are you trying to connect with people better?\n\nIf you've ever despaired that you \"aren't good enough\" at whatever you are doing, like you are terrible at those things or people won't accept you, then this show is for you.\n\nEvery Solopreneur Master Was Once a Solopreneur Disaster. Listen in for all of that and more on Episode 465 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nI then read a chapter from my upcoming book, \"Unemployable\u2122\" (Working title)\n\nLearn how to crush conferences and events with my FREE Conferencetopia course!\u00a0\nMore About Michael O\u2019Neal\nWhy should you listen to Michael O\u2019Neal and not any other individual out there? Well. This is everything you need to know about me. \n\nI was born in Ohio and spent 12 years there being raised in a Catholic family. As a kid, I participated in every sport known to man from skating and cycling to swimming and gymnastics. Just like other kids being raised in American suburbs, I got in a lot of trouble both at home and in school.\n\nAt 12, we moved to a new community in the outskirts of Philadelphia. We were fed up with ground zero for problems in this state something that forced my parents to look for a different location to relocate to. So in between 10th and 11th grade, we moved down to Spring Hill, a little redneck town in Florida. My parents seemed to like everything down there, but I hated every second that I spent there. I bolted back to Philly for my high school diploma. Here, I got a good opportunity to move around the East and South Coast States. I remember having stops in Long Beach Island NJ, Newark DE, and Palm Beach FL.\n\nAbout formal education, I\u2019ve dedicated my life to acquire much of it. I graduated from music school in Palm Beach FL. In 1994, I graduated from Temple University with an undergraduate degree in communication. I have also done several professional courses about internet marketing and web development.\n\nUpon graduation from the university, I became a web designer and worked in this field for 15 years. \u00a0In 1997, I moved to Boulder Colorado where I lived for almost 13 years until 2012 when I moved to San Diego. \u00a0After a few frustrations working for other people, I found myself to be truly unemployable. I realized it was the time I used to work for myself. So since 2005 till today I have been on the entrepreneurial track working for myself.\n\nMy journey to becoming a Solopreneur Master has not been as easy as you may think. I tried to do everything I would through 2008, but those things didn't have much success. In 2009, I knew that I no longer wanted to trade a dollar for an hour, so I went looking for something else. \u00a0That's when I found the hidden treasures in network marketing and internet marketing.\n\nIn August 2013, I started The Solopreneur Hour Podcast which aims to show the other unemployable people the correct path to business success on their terms. \n\nIn today's show, I have highlighted the exciting journey of Solopreneur Masters because I think it's easy to look at. \u00a0\n\nIn this episode, you'll hear:\n\n \t[03:37] My life as a drummer and the lessons that I learned from there\n \t[16:30] Whatever you want to do or achieve, the question here is, do you have the strength to do it without taking it personally?\n \t [18:30] You don\u2019t have to be an expert at everything all the time.

All of that and more on the 462nd\u00a0edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nAs of the airing of this episode Jack Canfield's Chicken Soup For The Soul series has been printed in 47 different languages and is on its way to selling a billion copies! After\u00a0CSFTS became a global phenomenon, he\u00a0asked himself if people wanted to be successful, what would be the one book they would read?\nFrom asking that question he set the foundation for The Success Principles. Today that book is celebrating its 10th anniversary and has been updated to include three new chapters reflecting our digital era. The book lays out 67 principles to follow to create success in your life, and it lays them out in order.\nThe book also includes real-life stories from people who read the first printing of the book, acted on the principles and created success. These are stories from all walks of life: homeless men and women to people who had just lost their jobs and had sold their\u00a0belongings to get by. People who were not successful in an area (or many areas) of their lives, but created success through implementing the contents of Jack's book.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n \tWhat's always been his biggest challenge?\n \tHow many books does he read per week?\n \tWhat's one of the weirdest experiences he's had while speaking?\n \tWhat is\u00a0the rule of 5?\n \tWhat does E + O = R mean?\n \tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJack shares these stories in greater detail on the show, and we also talk about why we have such a hard time getting out of our own way.\u00a0And he has an answer for us: because no one has ever taught us otherwise. We've all grown up with limiting beliefs that have been given to us by the world around us (from parents to clergy to school teachers), but no one has told us how to release those beliefs.\nBy nature we are creatures of habit so until we unlearn those limiting beliefs and create new habits, we'll continue to get in our own way. But there is a solution: simply create a new habit and cement it faster by pairing it with an existing habit.\nIf you are committed to doing your age in push-ups every morning, then pair the new push-up habit with brushing your teeth. Every time you brush your teeth, do your age in push-ups after. And you'll want to give yourself a solid 66 days to make that new habit a lasting one, Jack says the latest research out of London has found we need 66 days (not 30).\nAnother way to create success in your life is to take 100% responsibility. Jack says the happiest, most successful people he knows take full responsibility for everything in their lives.\nAnd by doing so when something goes wrong you can ask yourself what you did to contribute to the result you got. When you examine a result from that perspective you aren't defensive. When you're not defensive you can take steps to learn from the experience and apply it to the next situation, and grow in the process,\nWe talk about SO much more on this show, like why a no is a good thing and his legendary joke-telling, but one final piece to leave you with is the number one thing all successful readers of his book\u00a0have in common: they all want success and believe it's possible.

And my co-host for today is another first, he's our first five-time guest, Mr. John Lee Dumas of Entrepreneur on Fire and Podcasters' Paradise. \u00a0John and I are heading to Greg Hickman's wedding (Greg of Mobile Mixed) in Denver, Colorado and we decided to record in the air.\n\nOn this episode we'll talk about the importance of keeping your mind and your body sharp as a solopreneur, what John's four months in India gave him and our upcoming appearance on Creative Live. \u00a0Buckle up and join us for all of that and more!\nMore About This Show\nIf you haven't heard John on the show before you can catch his first visit here, and all three of his previous appearances are linked in the resources section below. And if for some reason you have no idea who John is, he's the mastermind behind Entrepreneur on Fire, a daily podcast where entrepreneurs spent 30 minutes with John answering questions and helping John's audience \"prepare to ignite\". (You'll have to listen to one of his shows if you don't get that reference).\nOne of the things that allows John to do a daily podcast is his commitment. He will out-hustle, out-market and out-work anyone else on the planet. His military background plays a role in this as does his upbringing; his parents expected him to become a lawyer like his dad or a doctor. And when he chose neither path, it was a significant turning point for him. It was after a semester of law school that he knew law was not for him; and that meant he had to face one of the hardest moments of his life: he had to tell his parents he wasn't going back. \u00a0And after he talked with them, he decided to go to India for four months and figure some things out.\n\nSo off he went and those next four months changed him. That trip changed his perspective on life and he came back a different man. He no longer carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, and it also recharged his spirit. He was more confident and yet still humble, he understood how insignificant he was in the grand scheme of things. That understanding enabled him to embrace failure and see it as a pathway to success, not a stopping point.\n\nOver the next few years he took a few more corporate-type jobs, crushing it at all of them but hating the work itself. Eventually he came up with the idea for Entrepreneur on Fire and even though no one said it could be done (including his coach Jaime Tardy and a few other notable podcasters), he did it.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n \tZone of genius: what is it?\n \tHe was in a Bollywood movie: true or false?\n \tWhat\u00a0percentage of John's podcast success comes from his format?\n \tWho instilled the reading bug in John and at what age did he\u00a0pick up the habit?\n \tHow many people are expected to tune in for our Creative Live show?\n \tAnd so much more!\n\nAnd for the next several years John poured everything he had into Entrepreneur on Fire and then Podcasters' Paradise. So much so that his health took a backseat for the most part, until he recently decided to change that. After getting some biometric testing done and changing his diet, he's revived his energy levels and he's ready to take on even more kick-ass projects, including an entire day-long segment on Creative Live.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, John received a call from Alex Blumberg asking him to be on his Creative Live presentation on podcasting. For those of you not familiar with Alex he is the man behind such NPR greats as This American Life and Planet Money. Alex is starting his own podcast called The Start-up Podcast and it's about how to start and run a successful podcast if you're completely new to the medium.\n\nIn order to start his show, Alex has resigned from NPR. Why leave such a prestigious position with all the fame and the following he's created? Because he has seen people like John make serious money\u00a0in podcasting.", "duration": "1:12:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/459.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1471016200, "title": "458: Puerto Rico Free Coaching Friday!", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Free coaching Friday, y'all.

Mark Costes is an entrepreneur turned dentist turned multi-millionaire and he\u2019s sharing his secrets on this edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nOne of the real keys to his business (besides the fact that he's pretty much \"The E-Myth Revisited\" in living color, is that he pays SO MUCH ATTENTION to small, minute details that make a HUGE difference for his clients.\nMore About This Show\nThe fact that Mark Costes is an entrepreneur isn\u2019t a big surprise. Just take a look at his family lineage and you\u2019d guess he\u2019d end up working for himself.\nHis dad\u2019s story is similar to many immigrants: he had a great career in his home country of the Phillippines as a professor, which he left to live in the United States. Coming over with not much more than a hundred dollars and a suitcase, Mark\u2019s dad rebuilt his life with a lot of hustle and willpower.\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, Mark\u2019s mother\u2019s side also boasts several successful entrepreneurs. His grandma was a loan shark who sent his mom out to collect payments! She, Mark\u2019s grandma, also had a prawn business (that\u2019s shrimp if you\u2019re from the States), a fleet of rental cars among other businesses.\nTo say entrepreneurism is in his blood might be an understatement; it\u2019s more like his blood IS entrepreneurism.\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that by the age of 23, Mark ran a lucrative food truck business and was also pursuing his MBA.\nBut while he was doing all of that, he was still dreaming of becoming a dentist. So much so that he applied to dentist school 20 times before he was accepted! Clearly Mark was not going to be deterred from his dream, no matter what.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n \tHow he builds rapport and a connection while seeing 40 patients a day.\n \tThe Yellow Sheet: what is it and how does it pertain to your business?\n \tHow his mindset is different from other dentists, and why it matters.\n \tThe day he became a millionaire - and why he sold 4 of his 6 practices the very next day.\n \tHow he lost almost 7 figures in the process - in one year.\n \tAnd so very much more!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter he completed his dentist school, he did something hardly any other dentists do: for the next year he worked as an associate in a friend\u2019s practice and spent his off-hours learning the ropes of the business. He learned the systems and learned how the office actually made money.\nBeing the solopreneur he is, he took that knowledge and applied it to his own practice; he didn\u2019t build just one, he built six! And one day his accountant told him to check his financial statements. When Mark did, he realized he had earned his first million dollars that year.\nThe only problem? He was working 80 hours a week and had a wife, a child and another child on the way. It was time for a shift.\nAnd shift he did. He began investing in different businesses, none of which took off. But he eventually created a curriculum to train dentistry assistants, he also trains other dentists on how to create passive income in their practices and has a mastermind group.\nMark is truly a shining example of turning a traditional service-based profession into a business with passive income streams. And in this episode, he talks us through the steps he has taken (and the missteps), to be where he is today.\nLeave a comment below for Mark and let him know you learned from him about your business.\n\n\n\nEpisode Resources\nMark's web site\nMark\u00a0on Facebook\nAmici Pet Hospital\nBlock Fitness\n\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?

To start that transition we often create a side gig.\n\nThe man who has made multiple six figures doing just that: taking side gigs and turning them into multiple streams of income is none other than our friend Dr. Mark Costes.\n\nDr. Mark joins us to talk about his latest venture, the Six-Figure Side Gig Podcast and how he helps others by leveraging his knowledge into products and additional income streams. We dive into all of that and more on episode 311 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Six-Figure Side Gig\n\nDr. Mark has made several appearances on The Solopreneur Hour (you can find them here) so if you haven't heard his back story have a listen! In a nutshell, Dr. Mark has gone from being a successful dentist with multiple practices to a dentalpreneur with multiple sources of income from helping countless others follow in his footsteps.\n\nToday he has multiple streams of income helping other dentists and other practitioners grow thriving practices, and by providing a franchise-type system for dental assistant schools that other dentists can buy and set up for their own additional side gig income stream.\n\nIt all began because he was running six successful practices, but was burnt out. He had very little time or energy to give his family, and he was losing his love of dentistry.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n \tWhen did he first commit to leveraging his knowledge?\n\n \tHow becoming an entrepreneur has helped him enjoy dentistry again.\n \tHow many income streams does he have?\n \tWhat's the #1 thing he's learned from his podcast?\n \tWhat was my most terrifying moment on stage?\n \tAnd much more.\n\nSo he spent a year developing a curriculum for a dental assistant school. He worked tirelessly over that year, and then opened his first school. Once the school was underway he handed over the curriculum to his staff and had them run it. He is there for the orientation night and for graduation night, but otherwise his team handles everything.\n\nThat one school grew to over a dozen, and when other dentists started asking him how he was doing it Dr. Mark got serious about marketing the school as a way for other dentists to make additional income. The idea took off and today he has 140 schools throughout the United States.\n\nBut being the entrepreneur in dentist's clothing that he is Dr. Mark didn't stop there. He took his passion for coaching, which initially was him consuming all the coaching he could get his hands on, and now offers his wisdom to others wanting to create a six-figure side gig. He does this with his twice-weekly podcast Six-Figure Side Gig and also with personal coaching.\n\nHe helps clients in multiple industries; he has a real estate agent who is building an empire with his real estate agent training school. And he's also working a doctor to create a CNA/medical assistant school system like Dr. Mark did for dental assistants.\n\nOn today's show we talk more about his most recent podcast Six-Figure Side Gig and what he's learned from the notable people he's interviewed, and why and how he started holding events for the dental crowd. Plus he gives us the formula he uses to translate his knowledge and experiences into products and programs. It's all here on episode 311 of The Solopreneur Hour - enoy!\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What program or product can you create using what Dr. Mark Costes shared today?

He is the founder of five up-and-coming companies including Clarity, Flowtown, Spheric Technologies, Mentor @ 500Startup, and GrowLabs & theC100.org. As an angel investor, he has provided capital to more than 33 startups, some in exchange for ownership equity while others for convertible debt.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDan\u2019s journey through life was not smooth. His life is full of ups and downs, twists and turns. At a special Mastermind Talks entrepreneurial event which was held in Toronto, Canada, Dan surprisingly revealed that he wouldn\u2019t have been successful if it weren't for a rough life.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was born and raised in Moncton; a city located in Westmorland County in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Dan opened up about coming from a poor family, raised by an alcoholic mother and a salesman father who rarely visited home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile aged 12 years, a juvenile court ordered him placed in foster care. He didn\u2019t last in one family for more than a month because of his constant distress. He was therefore moved from one temporary home to another. He returned to his family\u2019s home after a year, but he didn\u2019t found solace there. Life took a turn to the worst. Sadly, his parents divorced, he stopped going to school and found himself involved with hard drugs living a life full of crime.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt the aged of 16, he was sentenced to two years in jail for selling drugs to the daughter of the chief of police. He got it rough while in jail and promised himself that he would never get into the wrong side of the law again. He came out of prison a changed young man, but he later resumed his addict lifestyle. Nine months later, he was arrested for driving while high on PCP and driving over the limit. He was found guilty and taken to an adult correctional facility. He was placed in a rehab facility called Portage Atlantic near Sussex in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is Portage\u2019s structured treatment programs that saved Dan\u2019s life. They helped him get back on track in his journey towards a drug-free life. His anger towards everything was replaced by regret, repentant and a new sense of purpose. He was helped by the rehab\u2019s caring and friendly staff, all of whom were recovering addicts. After two years in the rehab, Dan finally returned home aged 19 beating the relapse statistics. He went back to school which also contributed to making a great difference for him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter school, he raised more than $2M that he used to start Flowtown and later Clarity.fm; two companies that he grew and successfully exited. Clarity\u2019s mission is to connect its members by telephone with business networks and expert mentors who provide advice in areas such as sales, marketing, and business development. He started this company using the experience he gained from operating Spheric Technologies and Flowtown.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClarity was launched in January 2012 in New Brunswick and opened in May 2012.

She has been helping many women to alter their diet rather than restricting food intake to reduce body weight.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSamantha is known as an emotional eating coach. She has already given solutions to many women who have been suffering silently from eating disorders, also advising many women who have body image issues on how to correct their bodies. With her, you can establish a proper diet without going hungry while, at the same time, maintaining a good shape.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHungry for Happiness has all its programs and objectives designed to helping women embrace proper diet and also body exercise. Samantha aims at helping 1 million women who have sustainably reduced their body weight and also improved their feeling for self.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSamantha was a dancer. The usual life of a dancer involves fasting moments and eating few types of foods while overlooking others. This is done in an attempt to maintain the shape of the body. Mostly, long term dancers develop poor eating habits and body dysmorphia.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn her part, Samantha was used to eating foods of her interest. As a result, her ballet teachers were on her complaining about her body and poor performance in dancing. Thus, she decided to try different methods to correct her body through changing diet and other activities. However, none of these methods worked successfully for her. She would not go to gym or any other exercise again as she had already given up on her body and how it looked. The same issue that she eventually began to solve was the same issue that she went through previously in her dancing life.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFollowing this was a definite feeling that developed in Samantha about her food habits and also her body image. After a while, she was able to relate healthy diet with proper diet as well as maximum body exercises. Consequently, her body responded to become what she always hoped for. Many women went to her to seek advice from her. She gained passion in advising and helping women to find their way out of an issue she once went through. Eventually, Hungry for Happiness was born.

He got involved with different things where he realized that all of these have one thing in common. That is, building repeat referral customers are easier than looking for new clients.\n\nDuring the recession in the early 90's, James landed a job in debt collection. Debt collection involves talking to people over the phone and requesting them to settle their bills. Compared to reverse sales, where they already have the products and services, and now, they are obliged to pay. That said, it's harder to get the money because of this, and he has to work double time and discover ways on how to deal with these people even under pressure. This gave him the idea that he should be trying to help these people as well.\n\nIn this kind of job, James learned that he has to partner with these people and make preparations in a way where he'd build trust to avoid the issue from getting worse, because if they fail to make payments, bad things will happen. So, it's critical to ensure that you're on the identical side with your customers and work with each other to be able to fix the problem. You would be a problem-solving machine in this industry.\n\nEventually, James realized that there're some issues with having that kind of job, especially for those who has to support a family; just like him. He didn't like the idea of earning from one person, the idea of selling only a single product. He was running out of enthusiasm, and his earnings felt capped because, despite the fact that he was proficient at this and the largest paid person in his team.\n\nBenchmarking became one of his favorite techniques, and this inspired him to step out of his comfort zone.\n\nHe started trying a little business before he moved to SFB. He tried everything from trading vanity license plates and marketing. When he started with his online gig, he was also the general manager of Mercedes-Benz during the day and an online marketer by night. His work involves commanding a large team of employees and it was a little difficult for him to focus on his \u201cInternet\u201d job. So, he had to spend several hours doing research and compiling every information that could help him. After discovering what worked, he began to succeed rapidly.\n\nAt the start of his online career, he was making around $300,000 annually in his day job, and with his online business, he noticed that his income kept on adding within a couple of years. It went up to $400,000 and $450,000. After fully quitting his day job, he generated more than $100,00 within a single month.\n\nHe started small that he only makes $49.25 on every sale of his product where he was affiliated.

But with the advent of LeadPages, that problem was solved. One of those happily satisfied online marketer solopreneurs\u00a0was one Tim Paige.\n\nToday he sits down with us for a live conversation from Podcast Movement 2014 and we chat about going from customer to co-leader...and how being a musician paved the way for his present day success.\n\nJoin us for episode 152 of The Solopreneur Hour to hear all of that and so much more.\nMore About This Show\nTim Paige is known in many circles of solopreneurs, entrepreneurs, online marketers, affiliate marketers and the like. Everyone in that world knows him as one of the kick-ass dudes bringing us LeadPages and their podcast, ConversionCast. And when you hear him talk about opt-in pages, conversions, and email tips & tricks, you'll instantly hear the passion in his voice. He loves his work because it helps people like you do what they love most.\n\nBut before he joined the team at LeadPages, Tim was a musician, an affiliate marketer and a voiceover artist. A man of many talents, he shares with us some of the lessons he's learned from all of those endeavors. In particular, we dive into what his days as a touring musician were like and what it was like for him to be on TRL on MTV and the Warped Tour.\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with TRL, MTV or Warped Tour, let's explain. TRL stood for Total Request Live and it was a show on MTV where the biggest bands and musical artists came to perform their music live in the MTV studio in New York City. So being on it was kind of a big deal! Tim says the experience of TRL prepared him for being a solopreneur in many respects; he learned the value in saying yes and going after something you want, whether you think you'll get it or not.\n\nHis TRL experience came on the heels of Van's Warped Tour. In fact, they appeared on TRL just four days after coming off their performance at Warped Tour! Warped Tour is an international outdoor music festival. Though it began by featuring punk rock bands,\u00a0today it showcases alternative rock and bands from other genres. Again, it was a pretty big deal when his band got to perform on\u00a0the tour!\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n \tHow Tim's band landed their spot on Van's Warped Tour.\n \tWhy you should be a \"yes\" person.\n \tHow Tim has taken the ConversionCast list to 95,000 subscribers.\n \tHis microphone tip for all podcasters.\n \tWhat happens when you give someone too many choices?\n \tAnd lots more!\n\nTim explains his visit to Warped Tour was the kind of experience that shaped his perception and his belief system. If he could get his band on that tour and then perform in front of hundreds of thousands of people, what else could he do? Anything, so long as he said yes and he went for it.\n\nHe's taken those lessons with him into all of his projects and endeavors since then. As we mentioned earlier, he does voiceovers for podcasters and was an affiliate marketer before joining the gang at LeadPages. He got to know Clay from LeadPages and he later told Tim he wanted him to run a podcast for their brand. Tim was thrilled; he and Clay mapped out a plan together and Tim got it off the ground. It started as a daily show but eventually Tim discovered a weekly show best suited their content and their audience. In fact, he kept his loyal listeners when he made the shift AND his opt-in rates went up significantly! His audience let him know they loved once-a-week episode style.\n\nOver time, Tim really honed in on what works and what doesn't work in both podcasting and conversion rates; I made sure he gave us a few golden nuggets on this show! One of the biggest takeaways for me was how he grew their list to 95,000 subscribers: their\u00a0detailed show notes for each episode\u00a0are only available to people who join their list.", "duration": "1:11:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/440.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1467009042, "title": "439: Founder of The Onion, Scott Dikkers", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "The Onion is one of the most consistently funny publications I've ever come across.

He has authored and coauthored many bestselling humor books, the majority of which still enjoy significant popularity all across the globe. Dikkers, however, first came to prominence as the artist and creator of the comic strip titled Jim\u2019s Journal.\n\nThe world started talking about Dikkers\u2019 talent and uniqueness when he founded the planet\u2019s first humor website TheOnion.com. The introduction of this site changed the world of comedy significantly.\n\nDikkers has also showcased his creativity and amazing sense of humor through a number of films. Spaceman, which was released in 1997, was his first feature film. It was a science fiction film boasting a serious touch of rich comedy. He went on to direct Emmy and Golden Globe-winning comedian Chevy Chase in his 2003 movie Bad Meat.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to describe Dikkers\u2019 achievements, and legacy is brief. It\u2019s probably because the man managed to reach the top at a very young age and has succeeded in remaining there for almost three decades.\nDikkers and Jim\u2019s Journal\n\n\u00a0\n\nDikkers\u2019 first prominent creation Jim\u2019s Journal appeared in The Daily Cardinal, a newspaper published to serve students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for the first time way back in 1988. Since then the guy has never looked back.\n\nDikkers created Jim\u2019s Journal with the aim of parodying the customary four-panel comic strips. The strip was character-driven and included a central character that didn\u2019t have any distinct personality. There used to be no observational humor, and the strips didn\u2019t even provide any insight. They used to end without any gag, and some of them didn\u2019t even have a conclusion. In words of Dikkers, they were \u201canti-humor\u201d strips. He used to say that the content of those strips created humor by making fun of other humor.\n\nJim was the protagonist of the comic strip. The strip, however, didn\u2019t feature experienced processed by him. Jim used to record all his experiences as he moved passively in his world. It\u2019s true that the author of Jim\u2019s Journal chose not to provide any context, but every single individual who has the experience of living in a shabby apartment building, doing a minimum wage job, or has been to college, will not find it difficult to come up with a suitable context.\n\nThe comic strip shows Jim muddling through school and several blind-alley jobs along with some of his friends. All of them have vague dreams of being part of the space project or the entertainment industry, but none of them ever tries to turn their dreams into reality. Also, these people share another amazing thought. For them, life is never meaningless or absurd; the only word that can describe life, according to these people, is \u201cfunny\u201d. Jim says that it\u2019s okay if someone just exists and places an order for a pizza now and then.\n\nThis weird, but amazing comic strip appeared in the university\u2019s newspaper till 1997, after which it was discontinued for unknown reasons. After a hiatus of 14 years, the online version of the strip was made available to the public. Since April 2011, Jim\u2019s Journal is getting published on GoComics; the newly published series included both classic and new c...", "duration": "1:18:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/439.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Comedian", "Great Books", "Podcast", "Scott Dikkers"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1466791298, "title": "438: Rules To Live By, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today's show has me sharing some bits and pieces of advice I've picked up for how to be a bit more thoughtful in your day to day life, as well as all of your deep, dark, mysterious questions answered.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022 If you stay at someone's house, make the bed\n\u2022 If you stay multiple nights, strip the sheets\n\u2022 If someone makes you dinner, eat it and be grateful\n\u2022 If someone opens the door for you, thank them\n\u2022 Hold the elevator if you see people walking towards it\n\u2022 Stay to the right side of the escalator so people can get by you\n\u2022 Better yet, WALK on the escalator.

In 1995, Marcus graduated from Northumberland High School. He attended graduated magna cum laude from the West Virginia University. He graduated with a B.A. in Spanish with a minor in Physical Education. In high school, Marcus served as the captain of the football, baseball, and wrestling teams. Between 1997 and 1999, Marcus served as a church missionary in Chile. Sheridan is also the author of three self-help books that are all published. These books include Stop the Yawns, Heavenly Father's Angels and Teen Talks to Stop the Yawns. Marcus owns and founded of The Sales Lion.\n\nMarcus Sheridan is the founder of www.poolschool.us, which is among the most informative and educational swimming pool online sites. Marcus married his high school sweetheart, Nikki, and they both have four children: Danielle, Joseph, Larsen, and Casey. In the year 2007, the Indiana University named him as the Young Entrepreneur in Residence. Marcus is the first person who came out with a rating system for the fiberglass pool manufacturers.\n\nHis successes can be traced as a communications and business leader from his missionary activities in Chile. Having never spoken Spanish before, Marcus was put in a position to teach and speak to large audiences, which eventually killed his fears of public speaking. This fear would later turn into a great strength. By the time he ended his mission in Chile, he had already realized he had a knack for communicating to others. He later utilised this ability by becoming a full-time professional speaker.\n\nRiver Pools and Spas\n\nAfter his missions in Chile, it was when he married his wife, Nikki, and completed his degree at West Virginia. In his quest for his first job after college, his two close friends from home approached Marcus. The friends had just started a company in the swimming pool industry- River Pool and Spas. The two friends asked Marcus to be their first employee in the fledgling company. He responded positively to the request and joined the company.\n\nCharged with running the place as his two friends were working out, in the field. He stayed on in the company and later became the third partner in the enterprise. The company had been running okay until 2008- this was when the stock market experienced a major collapse. This failure resulted in a drastic fall in the values of the homes. This way, few people could afford luxury goods leave alone in-ground swimming pool. It was in these stressing business moments that Marcus started to study online marketing principles. He engaged himself in reading things like inbound marketing, social media marketing, and content marketing among others.\n\nOn reading the principles of marketing, Marcus, and his partners realised they needed to be great communicators, and this would help them act like consumers. By acting as a consumer, they could be able to answer any question online leading to more traffic on their website and this translated to increased sales. With their 20-page website, they brainstormed any consumers' issues and turned them into titles of blog posts. He and his partners would then answer the questions without ignoring any questions from the customers. Currently, the website has 850 pages,", "duration": "1:04:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/436.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Man", "Marcus Sheridan", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Gary Vaynerchuk", "sales", "social media marketing world"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1466187488, "title": "435: A Get Off Your *ss Rant, A New Intro, and Your Questions!

He is well known by how he started a big company from his own hobby \u2013 something he was passionate about. He is the founder, CEO and the president of Verastarr, an Audiophile company in Atlanta, GA. It is quite fascinating how Mike Powell started up the company. The company (Verastarr) was founded July 12th, 2003 by Mike Powell himself purposely for music lovers and audiophiles. He named the company Verastarr after his grandmother who was called Vera. He was employed elsewhere at the time of starting the company but he realized that time was passing by and he wasn\u2019t doing what he loved so he ended up quitting the job to start his own career from his hobby.\n\nDuring the initial stages of the company\u2019s growth, he faced many challenges mostly due to the fact that he had no enough money to fund the infant company. He had to sell his own Triumph Trophy as well as the monster Ducati bike in order to be able to provide enough finance for the solo mission he was in. it then started as a silver Reference and Silver Signature line of Cable Company. It expanded to become one of the biggest companies in that region dealing with the creation of 100% original cable designs. Moreover, it offers amplifiers which bridges high end 2 channel as well as Home Theaters. Their amplifier designs are being used by Sony Company, LG, Industrial Light and Magic, among other audio system manufacturing companies.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nJim Salks\nJim Salks is a designer, who makes exotic speakers and monitors. His career started off from his own hobby. In his early ages, he wanted to build a music\n\n\n\nrecording studio. Of all the architects he approached none of them was knowledgeable about noise control and room acoustic balancing. Due to that, he began to learn how to do things for himself rather than relying on the architects.\n\nLater around the start of the millennium (around the year 2000), he wanted to have a pair of high- end speakers but he did not want to pay for them citing to their inflated prices and other personal tastes. Due to that, he started building speakers for himself still from his hobby. In the next couple of years, he had built many speakers for other people but he did not much consider it to be his career. As time went by, he was faced with many internal challenges in his place of workshop (his backyard) due to too much snow covering his equipment each day. At that point, he was left with only two choices; to either quit completely or take this hobby and make it his career.\n\nHe got lots of discouragements from almost everyone around him and also competition for the same products was high. Without second thoughts, he decided to venture into the business fully. He rented a stall somewhere and that is how he started off. Currently, he makes exotic high-end speakers for different purposes and places.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nLinks and Resources\n\u00a0\n\n \t\nDAC - Digital to Analog Converter\u00a0\n\n \t\nElac\n\n \t\nAndrew Jones\n\n \t\nSalk Sound\n\n \t\nMike Powell\n\n \t\nRune", "duration": "41:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/431.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Jim Salts", "Mike Powell", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1464973840, "title": "430: \u201cThe Guitar Story\u201d, and Free Coaching Friday!", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Free coaching Friday, y'all.

Today's co-host for Episode 429 is Vince Reed of InternetTrafficFactory.com, turned to the internet and an ad on Craiglist about making money with Google ads, after the real estate market crashed in 2007, he turned himself around and positioned himself as an invaluable resource on how to generate more leads for your business.\n\n\u00a0\nMike and Vince Discuss:\n\u00a0\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"5:15\"]\u00a0Events\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"14:56\"] The importance of investing in yourself\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"18:13\"]\u00a0Branding, Messaging, and Consistency\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"20:46\"]\u00a0Early Vince and How Football was almost his career\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"36:09\"]\u00a0Real Estate\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"44:50\"]\u00a0How traffic became Vince's\u00a0thing\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"52:15\"]\u00a0How to generate traffic in 2016\n\n \t\n[spp-timestamp time=\"54:36\"]\u00a0Where does the traffic come from\n\n \t[spp-timestamp time=\"60:31\"]\u00a0Old school traffic generation\n\n\u00a0\n\nVince grew up in Watts, Inner City LA living with his mother until he was eight years old.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was getting in trouble too much, so had to move in with his Father, his behavior had been so bad he couldn't even read in the first grade, Vince had to re-do first grade when he moved in with his Dad.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWatching his father's work ethic and putting him in sports changed his attitude and behavior. Playing sports helped neutralize and decompress him, from all the violent things that were going on around him back in his old neighborhood in LA.\n\n\u00a0\n\nVince played all different sports growing up but in '98 got a full scholarship for Football at the University of Colorado in Bolder.\n\n\u00a0\n\nVince never reached his full potential in Football. A few injuries and a lack of mental toughness stopped Vince from going pro.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe used to lie to himself saying \"You never made it to the NFL because you got hurt\" but that's not what happened, He was skilled but mentally wasn't there, used to cut corners with training, never pushed himself to do more. He was a gifted player but never took advantage of his gifts,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I don't want to say the same thing about my football career in my business.\"\n\n\u00a0\nGenerating Traffic and Leads in 2016\n\u00a0\n\nUnderstand the age we are in, we are in the social media boom, similar to the real estate boom, you have an opportunity to seize this moment. Ten years from now you are not going to have the ability to build communities and do what you do today via social media.\nVince doesn't think there will be another opportunity to have the Opera effect.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow is Opera successful? She built an amazing community. She's talked with a lot of successful people, and now she has such a high level of influence because she created a community. You have the ability to do that with social media.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow in 2016, it is all about community. All Vince focuses on is building great communities, the same thing that got people to his first event and the same thing that allows him to sell a product/service.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstead of thinking of trying to drive traffic to my capture page or my website, start thinking how can I drive traffic to your community that you are building, doing so will cultivate evergreen leads.\n\n\u00a0\n[spp-tweet tweet=\"Most people go a mile wide and an inch deep, you want to go an inch wide and a mile deep\"]\n\n\nLinks & Resources\u00a0\n\n \tVinceReed.com\n \tInternet Traffic Factory\n \tElite Marketing Pro\n\nPeople Mentioned\n\u00a0\n\n \tMark Hoverson\n \tJonathan Budd\u00a0\n \tChris Cash\n \tJeremy\u00a0Bloom\n \tBen Kelly\n \tMichael Lewis\u00a0\n \tDonald Strickland\u00a0\n \tHines Ward\n \tRobert Hirsch\n \tGary Vaynerchuck", "duration": "1:09:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/429.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Guests", "Lead Generation", "Man", "Podcast", "Vince Reed", "Facebook Ads", "Facebook Groups", "Football", "Leads", "Marketing", "Solopreneur", "Traffic", "Youtube"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1464676670, "title": "428: Pivoting on Your Solopreneur Idea with Greg Hickman", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today's episode features my buddy Greg Hickman, recorded in his living room in Denver Colorado. \u00a0You may remember Greg from his company Mobile Mixed. \u00a0Greg had focused on building your entrepreneurial business with your mobile device. \u00a0But he found it was too hard to build it to the level he wanted. \u00a0So, he completely scrapped the idea and started something new. \u00a0As it turns out, the new idea was even better. \u00a0In this show we talk about when you know when to \"cut the cord\", and admire Greg's bravery to abandon his idea despite his ego telling him otherwise.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDon't\u00a0Priorities\u00a0your Schedule, Schedule Your Priorities\n\n\nMike and Greg Discuss:\n\u00a0\n\n \t[4:49 ] Traveling around Japan\n \t[18:12 ] Freeing yourself from notifications, Virtual Staff and Delegating\n \t[30:36] The Pivot\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Pivot\n\n\u00a0\n\nSince the last time Mike and Greg spoke, Greg ran MobileMixed a resource for running your business from your mobile phone. Now he has made a drastic and public pivot, from mobile to automation with his new company System.ly, a client based operation that specializes in creating sales funnels and marketing automation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGreg had been running MobileMixed for the better part of a decade. It was what he was known for. This led to speaking gigs, a podcast and a blog all about the topic, mobile.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOff the back of the podcast/blog, Greg created a mini-agency for businesses that wanted to implement mobile into their strategies. The focus was on small businesses as Greg came from a big brand background, he decided against working for big brands so decided to give big brand strategy to small independent retail businesses.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGreg found the sales cycles really long, customers didn't understand they had a problem and didn't get mobile marketing, so he had to educate them in mobile marketing, identify they had a problem and connect it to them, which was long and painful.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe agency flatlined at 7k per month and Greg started to feel like he wasn't getting anywhere. On his podcast Zero to Scale, he said he needed to try something else. His co-host said, why don't you give yourself a 30-day challenge.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe 30 Day Challenge\n\n\u00a0\n\nGreg challenged himself to find 2 to 3 customers in the next 30 days that are willing pay to money to help them with Infusionsoft. Using the network he cultivated from speaking gigs and events Greg used email and phone calls to drum up some leads and within seven days Greg landed 6 paying clients and realized the pain was real.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust because you decided to do something once, doesn't\u00a0mean that's\u00a0where you need to end up!\n\n\u00a0\nLinks and Resources\n\n \tBoutique Japan\n \tGregHickman.me\n \tSystem.ly\n \tiTranslate Voice App\n \tVirtualStaffFinder.com\n \tZero to Scale Podcast\u00a0\n \tZag\n \tInfusionsoft.com\n \tMobit.com\n \tUpwork.com\n\n\u00a0\nPrevious Episodes Featuring Greg:\n\u00a0\n\n \tEpisode 62: Whats in your pocket could change your whole business with Greg Hickman\n \tEpisode 151: Live from Podcast Movement\n \tEpisode 76: Behind the scenes at Creative Live with John-Lee Dumas, Nick Unsworth and Greg Hickman\n\n\u00a0\nThis episode is brought to you by Hostgator! \u00a0Get 30% off your entire hosting package by using the promo code \"solo30\" at\u00a0hostgator.com", "duration": "51:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/428.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Greg Hickman", "Guests", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1464449916, "title": "427: Free Coaching Fr\u2026Errrr, Saturday", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Howdy. \u00a0Today's a Free Coaching Saturday, because I didn't have 3 seconds on Friday to make it happen. \u00a0Today's short and sweet, and we talk about what to launch when you have entrepreneurial ADD, if there's any space in the Entrepreneurial Podcast space, and when to launch your blog.", "duration": "18:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/427.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1464163469, "title": "426: Music, Mysticism and Solopreneurship with Stuart Davis (best of)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "He\u2019s been described as an \u201cavant-garde pop mastermind\u201d and one of the most unique and endearing live acts in America today. And he\u2019s our guest for episode 92, my friend and one of my favorite fellow musicians, Stuart Davis.\n\nStuart typifies solopreneurship: he\u2019s a musician, a TV host, and a painter. He\u2019s also one of the most learned and yet knowledge-hungry people I\u2019ve met. To describe him fully, you have to be willing to expand your own awareness of labels like \"Buddhist\", \"philosopher\", and \"artist\". There's a reason he's been called the Twisted Mystic.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nBefore he was the Twisted Mystic, Stuart was simply a kid who loved music. From a young age, he would spend 6 or 7 hours a day learning instruments and the fundamentals of music. He was consumed by his love for it.\n\nIn his early 20s his passion came to fruition when he was invited to play at the Guthrie Theatre in his hometown of Minneapolis, which is the equivalent of playing Red Rocks in Colorado. If neither of those examples give you a perspective, just know they are both places musicians would love to play.\n\nFrom his time in Minnesota, Stuart followed his love for music \u00a0to Boulder, Colorado where we met and played together.\u00a0 He is one of the most eclectic, intelligent and musically-inspiring artists I\u2019ve had the privilege to play with. And in episode 92, he shares what has shaped his career and who he is today.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n \tCan we ever fully realize our true genius?\n \tEmbrace discomfort from early on?\n \tThe X then Y factor: what Stuart has learned from this and how it runs parallel to your journey\n \tOne of the pinnacle moments of his early music career\n \tWhat keeps him saying yes?\n\nStuart\u2019s eclecticism has broadened his life from being a musician to today living in Amsterdam where he raises his daughters on a boat and expresses his artistic side through painting, music, and any other medium that strikes his fancy.\n\nIn this show, you\u2019ll hear what books, teachings and experiences have influenced his desire to expand his creative repertoire as well as the fascinating story behind how he met his wife (who is Ken Wilber\u2019s former wife).\n\nI brought Stuart on the show not only because he\u2019s a brilliant musician, but also because he\u2019s a solopreneur at heart. He says yes to opportunities, even when he\u2019s afraid and he embraces the ups and downs and winding turns of solopreneurship. He tells us what has kept him true to himself along the way.\n\n\n\nEpisode Resources\nStuart's web site\nStuart's TV show\nStuart on Facebook\nStuart\u00a0on Twitter\nThe Guthrie Theatre\nGo Daddy\n\n\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\n\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\n\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)", "duration": "1:31:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/426.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Stuart Davis"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1463981203, "title": "425: Become Socially Powered with Erin Cell", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Live from Sunday Funday in Denver, I sit down with Erin Cell of sociallypowered.com. \u00a0She's a high-end social media manager that came from the corporate world. \u00a0We talked about her transition from corporate to Solopreneur, her learning process, how to price herself, and what's next in social media.\n\n\u00a0\nMike and Erin Discuss:\n\n \t\nTransition from leaving corporate America\n\n \t\n15:13\u00a0MLM\n\n \t\n18:39\u00a0Influencers in the Social World\n\n \t\n21:13\u00a0Late to the game\n\n \t\n25:58\u00a0Positioning & Getting Clients\n\n \t\n31:12\u00a0Impetus of Socially Powered\n\n \t\n39:16\u00a0Managing someone else's social\n\n \t\n42:36\u00a0Platforms you have to be on right now\n\n \t\n47:53\u00a0Who to Socially Power the Socially adverse\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nErin was born and raised in Potwin, Topeka Kansas until the age of 22, now lives in Denver Colorado.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer working life began in telecommunication, with AT&amp;T and then Century Link but got laid off right after 9/11. Erin joined a temp agency, and her first gig was working for a commercial roofing manufacturer in their customer service department. This temp gig ended up lasting 12 years.\n\n\u00a0\n\nErin started doing social media on a volunteer basis for an organization that was very close to her heart, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. As Erin was thinking about to leave corporate America, a friend asked have you ever thought about doing this for businesses. She was already doing this for non-profit companies so why not help other business owners that don't know what they are doing,\n\n\u00a0\n\nErin now knew enough about the platforms to know what she was doing, and sufficient to help others who had no idea what to do, it took Erin five months to transition from her regular gig to working on her own.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSocially Power the Socially adverse\n\n\u00a0\n\nPick one platform and commit to posting about three posts per week.

His Mom moved to Florida leaving behind young Ray with his Dad and abusive step Mom.\nHe was only five years old when he recalled going to Kindergarten with a bloody nose only to confront his Dad with news of his abusive other-half. His Dad didn\u2019t take kindly to hearing such news and beat him calling him a liar.\nThis scared Ray enough to bury it deep within and not bring it up anymore. He was only five years old. The abuse would continue until he was given the choice of where he wanted to live, stay where he was or move to Florida with his Mom. So he chose to live with his Mom in Florida.\nThe damage was already done for Ray, an abusive past led to Ray mixing with the wrong people through his teenage years, even failing High school. He spent a lot of time around drug dealers and wasted a lot of time doing the wrong thing. One morning he awoke after being high on drugs, staggered to the bathroom and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, he hated what he saw. He hated himself, and he hadn't seen his Mom in a long time. He stopped and said to himself \u201cScrew it!\u201d and hitchhiked home, cut all ties to his drug past and everyone who had a negative impact on him, got three jobs to occupy his time and stopped returning people's calls.\n\n\u00a0\n\n0 through to 6 is such an important age for children.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow a Dad himself he realizes he wasn't present for his two older boys in their 0 through to 6 years as he was hell bent on achieving and providing now feels he is a dad for the first time again and is now ever present.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nLinks and Resources\n\u00a0\n\n \tRayHigdon.com\n \tThe 1st Entrepreneurial\u00a0book Ray picked up: Building Wealth by Russ Whitney\n \tNo Excuses Summit\u00a0\n \tRay's Facebook Page\n \tiwantsololab.com\n \tThe Tim Ferriss Experiment\n \tBlab.im\n \tGoogle Hangouts\n \tPeriscope\n \tFacebook Live\n\n\u00a0\nPrevious Episodes Mentioned\n\u00a0\n\n \t280: How to thrive and make money matter with Cole Hatter\n \t412: How to crush webinars with sololabber Anthony AJ Joiner\n\n\u00a0\nThis episode is brought to you by Hostgator! \u00a0Get 30% off your entire hosting package by using the promo code \"solo30\" at hostgator.com.", "duration": "1:08:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/423.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Guests", "Man", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Ray Higdon"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1463378443, "title": "422: FCF Part Deux\u2026Targa California Porsche Edition", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Free Coaching Friday, live from my hotel room in Paso Robles at the Targa California! \u00a0FCF: You ask the questions and I\u00a0knock 'em down.\n\nIf you haven't listened to one of these episodes before this is YOUR chance to ask questions: ask anything you want on whatever you want, any topic you want: bring it on!

Nathan stops by Studio 86 to tell us the inside secrets of how he grew his Instagram account to over 745 THOUSAND followers in 1.5 years!\n\nMike and Nathan Discuss\n\n\u00a0\n\n \tThe origin of Foundr\u00a0[20:11]\n \tGetting Sued\n \tInstagram Strategy [51:49]\n\n \tHow Nathan generated money from Instagram\n \tStrategies for growth and tactics that will allow you to grow faster\n \tOrganic Growth\n \tPaid Growth\n \tHashtag Strategy\n \tAnd more\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNathan on his usual 40 to 50-minute commute, said to himself, \u201cyou can do so much more, you are destined for much more.\u201d He just plodded on with his day job and did some soul searching. His boss would micro-manage him, and he learned some hard lessons, he treated him like dirt. This job was part of a graduate apprenticeship and part of this he had agreed when he finishes his degree he would be allowed to take off two months to 6 weeks to travel around Europe.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter traveling around Europe he decided he did not want to go back, it was on this trip Nathan read the Four Hour Work Week and Rich Dad Poor Dad, these books opened up his mind, and it was from then he decided to do his masters in marketing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe got a part time job while doing his masters, doing what he has done at his last job but at a travel agency. The books he read just clicked over in his mind and decided he wanted to fuse his love of technology with his love of IT with online marketing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe heard of this thing called the 30-day challenge on how to make your first dollar online. It was produced by a guy named Ed Dale based out of Melbourne about four years ago. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was a free video course that taught you step by step the basics, you purchase a domain and try and rank for that domain by writing articles, doing keyword research.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing this new found knowledge, Nathan found a niche in reviewing Men's Cologne. He learned a hard lesson, \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe amount of money you make is equivalent to how well you serve your community\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll he was focused on was how to make his first dollar online. He quickly realized his idea of reviewing cologne was not a good idea. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe lesson learned was, even though that first thing didn't work, you did something, you got to understand the workflow of how to get something to work online.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEd Dale sent an email out to his email list saying he was doing a free conference, Nathan attended and learned a lot about the online world. At the end of the meeting, Ed Dale announced that he was excited to release a new software product that allowed people to create their very own digital magazine.\n\n\u00a0\nInstagram Strategy\n\u00a0\n\n \tFigure out where your audience is, for him it was instagram\n \tHave a link in your bio to a mobile optimized page\n \tHave multiple landing pages and alternate between them\n \tBe super consistent and post super valuable content every day\n \tPost multiple times a day\n \tSchedule posts in Latergramme (later.com)\n \tGive all images in the description a call to action to offer engagement, like tag a friend or double tap if you agree\n \tFind popular hashtags in your niche and post up to 30 in the comments\n \tPost the best possible curated content by re-posting photos or videos from other accounts with high comments and likes, you will build a lot more trust (make sure you credit the original account in the description)\n \tShare for share - track down other instagram influencers that have large followings to get as many shout outs as possible.\n\n\u00a0\nLinks and Resources\n\u00a0\n\n \tFoundrmag.com\n \tSexy Seven", "duration": "1:31:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/413.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Guests", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Masterclass", "Nathan Chan", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1461356852, "title": "412: How to CRUSH Webinars w/ Sololabber Anthony \u201cAJ\u201d Joiner", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today's episode is with Anthony \"AJ\" Joiner, who designs and executes webinars for radio and media personalities in Atlanta. \u00a0He also happens to be a Sololab member, joining my group around 18 months ago. \u00a0When we first chatted, he had many business ideas (As most of us do), and we got him focused on one thing: \u00a0Webinars. \u00a0Since then, he's created a\u00a0killer,\u00a0scaled webinar business, and he's here to share his secrets with us today. \u00a0Get your Evernote ready, because this one is a doozy.\n\nAJ grew up in a small town in Louisiana and was raised by his grandmother.

The Author of \"Profit First\", he's smart and fast on his feet. \u00a0In this\u00a0highly politically incorrect (but quite amusing) episode of The Solopreneur Hour, we chat about how Profit First came to be, share a batch of very politically incorrect stories, then find our way back to some really meaty financial content. \u00a0For me...a \"best of\". \u00a0For you...it depends on how thick-skinned you are. :)\n\u00a0\n\"Live lean first, then start to worry about what to do with your money\" - Michael O'Neal\n\nMike and Mike Discuss:\n\n \t\nThe Envelope System [14:28]\n \t\nThe Profit First System [47:45]\n \t\nFinancial Behavioral Techniques [56:53]\n \t\nParkinsons Law [59:23]\n\nLoss Aversion \n\n\u00a0\n\nPeople prefer to avoid losses to acquiring new gains. Most studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's a human behavioral wiring, which when we possess something, losing it is very difficult, and we do illogical things to retain it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSolopreneurs come across loss aversion when dealing with taxes. Once we possess something and it\u2019s pulled back there's a negative association. when we make our money and have to hand over a proportion to the government out of our own pocket, there's now loss aversion.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut if your business reserves it in advance, the emotion of loss aversion gets subverted. Pre-accounted money was stored. Now instead of coming out of your own pocket, it\u2019s coming out of the business accounts, your business is now doing you a favour, it has become a behavioral trick and become a positive association. \n\n\"Losses loom larger than corresponding gains.\"\n\nParkinson\u2019s Law\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs the supply of the availability increases, our demand for it increases, but as it decreases we become more frugal, innovative and use less of it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe generalization of Parkinson\u2019s Law states the demand upon a resource tends to expand to match the supply of the resource. An example Mike uses for this is an everyday product, toothpaste.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen you go to brush your teeth, you have a brand new tube of toothpaste. It is very likely you will fill your toothbrush with a long bead of toothpaste. As you get down to the end of the tube of toothpaste, you squeeze out the last little bit to brush your teeth. Either way, your teeth get will get brushed. But when you have a large supply of toothpaste in the tube, you use a lot.\nLinks and Resources\n\n\n\n \tMikeMichalowicz.com\n \tProfitfirstbook.com\n \tThe Profit First Podcast\n \tMike Michalowicz Other Books\n \tkachingbutton.com\n \tsolohourbook.com - for the free audio book of Profit First\n \tRev.com\n \tCapital One 360\n \tWill it fly by Pat Flynn\n\n\nPrevious Mike Michalowicz Episode\n\n \tEpisode 132 Making a memorable brand putting profit first\u00a0\n \tEpisode 109 Pay Yourself First\n\nEpisode 411 was brought to you by Hostgator!", "duration": "1:20:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/411.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Great Books", "Guests", "Man", "Mike Michalowicz", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1460970805, "title": "410: Life After Playboy, & Building A Vitamin Biz w/ Andy Schreiber", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "The right mindset is key to being a Solopreneur, to understand there is a constant learning process draws parallels to Musicians and Athletes where mentality, you're never finished, the goal posts constantly change.

They soon offered him a full-time job. It wasn't exciting to him or what he wanted to do but he had to do something and thought he can learn from this experience.\n\nAt first, he was doing marketing promotions for a movie theatre chain. He progressed into radio and TV ad sales, then from there he was lucky enough to get a job in international film and television programming sales, all spanning a 25-year career.\n\nIn 1991, Andy was working in radio and tv advertising for a syndication company. The companies biggest advertiser was US army. The first Gulf War was in mid flow and in times of war the armed services stop advertising, considered bad form when there is an active engagement going on. Two weeks before a big advertising campaign was due to go live, the US army pulled out and left the company in bad financial shape, so Andy got laid off.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFollowing unemployment, Andy joined a temp agency and got asked if he had any moral objections to working at Playboy\u2019s international film and marketing distribution department. Andy jumped at the opportunity offered by the agency and soon pursued a permanent position within Playboy\u2019s marketing department.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAndy had successful career at Playboy spanning ten years, his last position at the company was Vice President of Home Entertainment, selling the rights to all the different films Playboy produced.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Andy met Vinnie\n\n\u00a0\n\nAndy first met Vinnie Tortorich at Playboy when Vinnie first arrived from New Orleans. Vinnie didn't know anybody when he first arrived in LA, so a friend of a friend introduced him to a lady that worked at Playboy. He came to Playboy and met this friend of a friend who happened to work with Andy, and he started to hang out there, and soon Vinnie and Andy became buddies. \n\n\u00a0\n\nVinnie was trying to figure out how he would get his career launched out in LA and he knew that Andy was in Marketing so invited him to lunch one day to help him out and give him some ideas.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOver the years, they have both been looking to get into business together. They have started a couple of businesses that didn't go anywhere. It wasn't until the success of Vinnie's book and Podcast did they both decide to go into the vitamin business.\n\nhttp://149.202.51.233/~hwrzppib/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/EP-410-_-Clip.mp3\n\n\u00a0\n\nLinks & Resources\n\n \tPure Vitamin Club\u00a0\n \tAndy on Twitter\u00a0\n \tVinnieTortorich.com\n \tThe Sexy Seven\n \tThe Solopreneur Hour on the Twitter\n \tThe Solopreneur Hour on Instagram\n\nPrevious Guests Mentioned\n\n \tVinnie Tortorich 402:\u00a0Celebrity fitness trainer\n \tAdam Carolla\u00a030:\u00a0Hollywood\u2019s Most Successful Solopreneur, Masquerading as a Comedian\n\nClick here to get info on Sololab, a Unique Mastermind\n\nEpisode 410 was brought to you by Hostgator!", "duration": "1:08:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/410.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Andy Schreiber", "Fitness & Health", "Guests", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1460742855, "title": "409: A KILLER Business Idea Waits for You\u2026and Free Coaching Friday", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hiya kiddos.\n\nFree coaching Friday, y'all.

Mike decided to do the same. He had nothing. No money, no resources.\n\nThe night after he met his friend he went to his little apartment, and there was a brand new credit card with $8500 limit on it. He turned on the tv and there was Tony Robbins, (earlier with his friend he made the vow of next time he saw Tony Robbins on tv he would buy his programs.) He picked up his phone and with his brand new credit card ordered his products. \n\nHe had it rush delivered so paid a little extra, two days later he got this box of CDs. He listened to the first 15 minutes on the 1st CD and noticed a coupon to get a discount at a Tony Robbins event and he called and signed up for everything. With the expense of this event, CD's, travel, and accommodation, Mike had filled up that brand new credit card. \n\nHe was in a room two weeks later with 3000 people jumping up and down and to his horror guys were hugging each other, totally not what he had expected. \n\nAfter spending the first two days trying to work out how he would get out of there, he decided just to go with it. He started to feel like an entirely different human being. He opened up his body and his heart and began to understand what Tony Robbins was saying about physiology. He started to pay attention to his feelings and emotions in ways he never had before. \n\nHe walked out of the event with a newfound commitment to life.\n\nWithin 90 days he and his partner had turned around the business, within 6 months a billion dollar advertising agency presented an offer to buy their business. A year later he had purchased a boat (46-foot boat on the Mississippi River) and lived on it for five years. He and his partner sold the business and they had enough money to pursue a dream of theirs initially brought them together 10 years prior, produce an independent feature film.\n\nThe core elements Mike learned from this experience was he really understood, who he was, how he learned, how he behaved, how he thought processed information.\n\n\u201cNo thyself and be true to thyself\u201d\n\nSelected Links and Resources\n\n\twww.mrbz/show - finish the survey and get \u201cPublish & Profit\u201d book for FREE\n\n\n\t@mikekoenigs on Twitter\n\n\n\tIMDB Page\n\n\n\tMike Koenigs Show, Thursdays, 18:00 PST\n\n\n\tMike's Books on Amazon: \u00a0\n\n\n\tCrowdfire \n\n\n\tSurvey Monkey\n\nThis Episode\u2019s Sponsor \nHostgator", "duration": "1:32:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/407.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Guests", "Mike Koenigs", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1460134812, "title": "406: Free Coaching Friday, My Redneck Voice, and out in LA This Weekend", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey all! \u00a0Another free coaching Friday is in your earballs.

I had $14 to my name, and I didn't know what I was going to do next. All I knew was I didn't want to work an hour for a dollar ever again.\n\nToday's guest was previously a Victims Advocate for a Police Department and after reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki begrudgingly joined a Network Marketing Company and had never looked back. Now the author of the book Living Your Life Alive, Autumn Shields.\n\nMichael and Autumn Discuss:\n\n\tHow and why Autumn chose a career around the police and courts\n\tWhy her dream job was not enough anymore\n\tWhy Network Marketing?\n\tThe misconceptions about Network Marketing\n\n\u00a0\nMore About Autumn\nAutumn raised in a family of Entrepreneurs. She grew up watching her family work hard and grow multiple businesses with multiple revenue streams in the landscaping industry around the Denver area.\n\nFrom a very young age, Autumn would help her family in the offices and learn the different businesses, untoward to her the leadership skills that would be passed on.\n\nShe would grow to watch her parents work hard but also play hard, but when she landed her dream job, Autumn realized she was working hard, living the dream but was not playing hard.\n\nShe was brought up with her parents work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit, but these gifts did not unravel for her until her mid 20\u2019s.\n\nDream Job, A nudge in the right direction\n\nThe day Autumn decided her dream job was on a career day in 8th Grade! As early as that. The teachers asked, what do they want to be? She knew she wanted to work with Cops but didn\u2019t want to be a Cop, and she knew she loved the dynamics around the courtroom but didn't want to be an attorney and loved counseling people but didn't want to be behind four walls. Law and justice were the lures for 8th Grader Autumn in the pursuit of her dream career.\n\nAutumn wanted to do something different every day; she felt her parents lived a ridged life with their business, doing the same thing day in day out. While interviewing a lady from Colorado for career day, who\u2019s job was a Victims advocate for a police department, she said a key phrase that rang true to her, \u201cI get to do something different every day, no two days are the same.\u201d\n\nThis experience was what Autumn describes in her book as a \u201cNudge\u201d. A \u201cNudge\u201d, Autumn describes as something that won\u2019t go away, something that you cannot ignore and burns deep inside of you and keeps you always thinking about it. This career day and interviewing the lady from Colorado was her first real nudge in her life.\n\nThe dream begins to fade (17:52)\n\nFamily happened, Children happened, Divorce happened, Remarrying and new family happened. Life happened for Autumn, living paycheck to paycheck and growing restless while also remaining optimistic that things will get better.\n\nDays were merging, and there were never enough hours in the day, the desire never was to be a stay at home mom. Something had to give.\n\nPeople get too optimistic about tomorrow and not about making changes for today, Autumn lived like that for a few years, just thinking tomorrow is going to be better, tomorrow is going to be better, but she loved what she did. She watched so many of her friends not finding anything that they loved, and she loved what she did, but she wasn't living her life and wasn't playing hard. She had the make-up to play hard.\n\nThe search for a part-time job\n\nAt the same time while looking for a part time job, Autumn found Robert Kiyosaki book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, the book got her thinking how can she get her money working for her, all she knew was trading time for money. She thought when it came to residual income that you had to write a song and create an album and hoped it went big or win the lottery or drill for oil, she just didn't know there were other options out there.", "duration": "1:05:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/405.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Affiliate Marketing", "Autumn Shields", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Love & Relationships", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Woman"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1459748931, "title": "404: Your Most Important Asset\u2026Your Family, with Jim Sheils", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "A lot of today\u2019s Solopreneurs are extremely passionate about their children and create their businesses to help build better lives for their families.

He was at a job he hated (Pharmaceutical Advertising - Designing Sales Brochures for Doctors symposiums on irregular bowel syndrome.) and called his best friend up who had recently moved to Arizona, they then both moved to Santa Barbara to begin a 17 year partnership in Real Estate investing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore recently Jim done one of the most selfless things someone could do for somebody and donated a kidney to his father.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis dad, even though he was already in his 70's was a good candidate for the transplant because of the longevity of his father's family. The kidney problem started decades ago when Jim's dad, he describes as \"a stubborn old Irishman\" refused to get antibiotics for strep throat, (which is a sore throat with fever caused by streptococcal infection). He decided to \u201ctough it out\u201d and the condition went away, but if you don't get the antibiotics to fight the infection it actually lodges in your kidneys and he got a kidney condition that came to fruition years later. \n\nFive years ago he went into almost renal failure and was in hospital for about 40 days. Jim decided what was going on was ridiculous and said to his father he will donate one of his kidneys. After much arguments with his father and research and conversation with his wife they went ahead with the transplant.\n\nDonating the kidney to his father was an almost spiritual experience for him and was partly the reason for the creation of Board Meetings. It wasn't just the relationships with his sons but also the 1-on-1 time Jim spent with his father.\n\nThe lesson Jim learnt from this experience was life is about connections. \n\n\u00a0\n\nReal Estate Life (37:29)\n\n\u00a0\n\nJim and his partner have been in the real estate game now for 17 years after moving to Santa Barbara . They started with $12,000 each of savings and decided to buy and sell hud foreclosed homes in Bakersfield, California as Santa Barbara was too expensive at the time. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter going back home to New Jersey in 1999, they managed to pull in more investment from people they knew to buy more homes in the Bakersfield area in return for profit on their investments.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTeaming up with a successful realtor in Bakersfield opened a lot of doors for Jim and his partner, She helped hire small contractor crews around Bakersfield to do the rehab work. They built the relationship deep, even to the point where she would loan them money.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBoard Meetings Origins (44:22)\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter moving to Santa Barbara, Jim got bit by the surfing bug.

He's the man behind Pure Vitamin Club, the first vitamins with no fillers, and is the best-selling author of Fitness Confidential, an insider's look at the true world of fitness and health.\n\nOn episode 402 we're catching up with him about his new segment on The Adam Carolla Show, how his book continues to do so well and what's next for him.\nMore About Vinnie Tortorich\n\nIf you've missed Vinnie's other episodes have a listen to them here. We cover his back story, how he met his lovely and talented significant other Serena (former Bond girl) and the hows and whys of his Pure Vitamin Club.\n\nBut today we jump right into one very cool addition to his already-packed schedule: a bimonthly segment on The Adam Carolla Show! It's called Fit or Bullshit, and Vinnie debunks various health and fitness myths many people believe are true. Vinnie shares how this opportunity came to him, as you hear it pay attention to the important role third party validation played!\n\nIn this episode you'll hear:\n\n\tHas Vinnie ever had a 9 to 5 job?\n\tHow did he land a biweekly spot on one of Adam Carolla's podcasts?\n\tThe importance of third party validation, and how to get it.\n\tWhy hasn't he published his second book?\n\tThe two scams people are using now to be \"best-selling\" authors.\n\tAnd much more!\n\nBecause he is a trainer to many celebrities and other Hollywood elite Vinnie works with people you and I have heard of: Howie Mandel being one of them. He and Howie have become friends over the years, as Vinnie has done with many of his clients, and in all that time he's never asked Howie for an introduction or a favor of any sort.\n\nIn fact, Vinnie says that's why he has so many Hollywood friends: he never asks them to do things for him, which is what everyone else in their life does.\n\nBut one day Vinnie and Howie were having coffee and chatting. Howie mentioned Adam Carolla was coming over to shoot something in Howie's studio. Vinnie was intrigued and they talked more about what Adam would be doing there. Soon their conversation continued on to other topics (like the millions of listeners Adam gets on his show!).\n\nWhen Vinnie left he jokingly said to Howie tell Adam I would love to be on his show - and Howie did! Adam agreed, but then it fell through the cracks. Now this is where the story gets even more interesting, and where you should be listening for the lesson of third party validation.\n\nVinnie's name came up again a year or two later, through someone else on Adam's team. Chris Laxamana, one of Adam's people, suggests to Adam he should have Vinnie come on. His name rings a bell in Adam's mind and he remembers Howie's recommendation and he tells his people to book Vinnie.\n\nOriginally it started as a one-off: Vinnie would record a show with Adam and Dr. Drew, and that would be that. But Vinnie and Adam got on so well that when Dr. Drew left after an hour, they just kept recording!\n\nAfter they wrapped up Vinnie was leaving - you don't linger if you want to be taken seriously in Hollywood - when Adam asked him if he would want to see his race cars. Naturally Vinnie jumped at the chance and they spent another hour together looking at Adam's cars and talking about them.\n\n\nIt didn't end there though: shortly after that first recording Dr. Drew asked Vinnie to come on his show, and he did. Then Adam's team called Vinnie and asked if he'd want to be a regular on Adam's show and if he would be willing to come up with a game for that regular spot. Vinnie agreed and sent them 20-30 concepts, after they had asked him for 12. Another key point in the story: overdeliver!\n\nOn this episode you'll also hear about the gifts Vinnie brought for everyone the first time he recorded with Adam Carolla and ...", "duration": "1:20:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/402.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Health", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Vinnie Tortorich"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1458950189, "title": "401: Effective Coaching and Productivity Hacks, with Willem Van Zyl", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Since we all have the same amount of time in our day how do some people seem to get more done than others? Why are some people more productive than others?\n\nIf you want to get more done in less time - and what solopreneur doesn't? - our guest for today has your number.\n\nWillem Van Zyl, productivity coach and expert, joins us to talk about his productivity coaching business, his suggestions for implementing new habits and creating lasting change as well as what makes a good coach a good coach.\n\nListen in for all of that and more on episode 401 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Productivity and Willem Van Zyl\n\nWillem was born and raised in the countryside of South Africa. He moved to Capetown for university and began working in software development before he even finished his degree. He parlayed those experiences into a job with an online education company after graduation. It was to be the ideal training ground for his current work in productivity.\n\nAfter some time in online education he created his own software development company, a firm he built for 8 years before venturing into productivity and coaching. Today he's transitioning from his firm into coaching on the subject of productivity full-time.\n\nOn today's show Willem explains why and how he became interested in productivity, why video game music is a killer way to get into the zone, and how to create a new habit by tying it to an existing one.\n\nIn this episode you'll hear:\n\n\tIf someone is good at something does that mean they're good at teaching it too?\n\tWhy you need to have a scientific mind for business.\n\tWillem's coffee and nap technique for being productive during a long day.\n\tHow to eat your frog first thing in the morning, and what that means.\n\tCan limiting the time you spend on a task make you more productive?\n\tAnd much more!\n\nOne of the most frustrating things for Willem about his software development company was trading time for dollars. It's very hard to scale that type of a business and have it run without your hands in it. That frustration coupled with his burgeoning interest in productivity opened his eyes to the possibility of being a productivity coach.\n\nWhile trying to build teams and manage clients and projects, he became interested in how people work and what makes someone productive but the same thing doesn't work for someone else. So in his free time he studied it: he read all the books he could find, experimented on his own and documented the process.\n\nAs he found what worked and what didn't, he also saw an opportunity to create passive income with coaching. He could write books, offer courses, etc...all things he couldn't do with his software development company.\n\nOne of the things he discovered that enhances productivity for everyone is listening to video game music. If you hope onto YouTube you can find the soundtracks of numerous video games, including this one called the Elder Scrolls Oblivion IV soundtrack. Listening to that soundtrack or any other from video games helps your mind focus in on the task at hand. Video game companies have designed their soundtracks specifically to do this!\n\nAnother trick Willem shares on this episode is to eat your frog first thing in the morning. If you aren't familiar with the phrase it is from a Brian Tracy book called Eat That Frog. And the idea is that if you tackle your most impactful yet often least enjoyable task in the morning it will set you up for greater success the rest of the day.\n\nNow before you can eat your frog you need to know what that frog actually is. Willem typically has his clients write down everything they do every day for a week, then together they review the list.\n\nAfter reviewing it they decide what tasks the client really has to do that no one else can, what can be delegated, what can be automated, and what can be deleted. Typically Willem has found people only have 3 or 4 high value activities they must do every day.", "duration": "1:08:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/401.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Willem Van Zyl"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1458933378, "title": "400: How The Solopreneur Hour Has Changed Your Life, Your Favorite Episodes, and Questions!", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "In this epic episode of the show, YOU answer the questions!

Listen in for all of that and more on episode 398 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Cam Adair\n\nThe first time Cam realized he had a video game problem was when he began lying to his parents. Now most teenagers lie to their parents at least occasionally but Cam was lying every day about big things.\n\nHe lied about his whether or not he had been doing his homework. Then later when he dropped out of high school for the second time, he lied about actually having jobs. He would tell them he was working but in reality he was staying up all night playing video games, and then sleeping during the day while they were at work.\n\nOne night he truly hit rock bottom emotionally: he had been very depressed living in his parents' basement and lying about his life. He had been thinking of suicide and one night while he was eating a bowl of soup he penned his suicide note.\n\nBut some friends called and invited him to see a movie. He accepted their invitation, went out with them and realized his life didn't have to feel so terrible, things could get better. So he went home and told his dad he needed professional help. His parents had been incredibly supportive of him all along so naturally they agreed and Cam saw a counselor.\n\nIn this episode you'll hear:\n\n\tWhat is the greatest outdoor show on Earth?\n\tWhen did Cam first realize he may have a video game addiction?\n\tWhy running away from something only works if you're running to something else.\n\tHow did he land his first Tedx talk?\n\tHow many people are estimated to be addicted to video games?\n\tAnd much more!\n\nAt the time Cam was vehemently opposed to anti-depressants so his therapist made him a deal: if Cam got a job in the next week there would be no recommendation for anti-depressants. If he didn't get a job then they would try the medication.\n\nCam found a job at H&amp;M and the structure it provided help him rebuild and get a second chance. With that newfound sense of control in his life he knew he had to quit gaming, so he gave it up cold turkey. He also wanted to have better social skills, he felt he was lacking in that area and wanted to do something about it.\n\nSo he created a new routine for his day, and filled his gaming time with time at nightclubs instead. His new day looked like going to work, eating dinner with his family, taking a nap and then going out to nightclubs (and going out sober).\n\nThe new plan worked for awhile, but Cam eventually relapsed. By this time he had quit his H&amp;M job because he hated having to ask permission to take time off, he had also moved to a new city for a fresh start. The move was a disaster. His new roommate was a professional poker player and when he found out Cam used to play video games he encouraged him to play again. It didn't take long for Cam to fall off the wagon and get hooked again.\n\nBut Cam had a new awareness this time: he realized he was gaming for a reason. He wanted the social experience gaming provided plus the escape from the depression he felt. And gaming provided measurable growth and\u00a0 a way to feel a sense of purpose and challenge in his life.\n\nWith that realization in mind he decided to quit gaming but he would do it on his own terms this time. Cam gave himself a last indulgence, a final hurrah with gaming and then sought help online. An Internet search showed there wasn't any good advice being shared, something that frustrated Cam very much.\n\nHe wrote a blog post called How to Quit Playing Video Games Forever.", "duration": "1:14:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/398.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Cam Adair", "Career Advice", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1458330757, "title": "397: Solopreneur Family Man, Harsh Rides, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Free coaching Friday, y'all.

In today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour, I break down the who, what, when, where, why, how of social media.\n\nI cover the ins and outs of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Anchor, Periscope, and Snapchat. I'll also talk about where they came from, who should be using them, and techniques and tactics for success. \u00a0I hate to say it, but this show is pretty actionable. \u00a0Sue me!\n\nSocial media has become an integral part of any solopreneur's business strategy. But there are diverse platforms out there today: which outlet does what and for whom? Which one is right for you?\n\nTo give you an accurate look at each of those on today's episode I'll explain the benefits of Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Snapchat, Periscope and Anchor plus the drawbacks of each. And remember the platform that is hot today can be replaced tomorrow (just look at Meerkat!) and the strategy that works today may be obsolete in 3 weeks. That's the way of social media: it's constantly changing and evolving so we have to change and evolve too.\n\nI'll start with Facebook. Today Facebook is great for groups and for your personal page: get people to know you, like you and trust you. It still works well for that. What Facebook no longer works well for is unpaid engagement. In 2009 I could post something and get far more engagement than I do today, and I have 5,000 friends today. In fact it is estimated that Facebook's engagement is at 3% right now! That's unpaid of course. If you pay you reach more people. That's the way it works today.\n\nNext up is Twitter. Twitter used to be the place to connect with anyone. If someone had a Twitter account odds were good if you @ mentioned them they would respond. Then spambots were on the scene and that no longer worked. You can still use Twitter for getting more eyeballs on your content if you choose the right hashtags (ritetag.com) but it's not what it used to be.\n\nThird is Pinterest. Pinterest is the place to be if you are an Etsy person or if your audience is into Etsy or anything else crafty. If you're a mom or want to connect with moms Pinterest is a great way to do so. It's also great for weddings and all things bridal, for photography, and for creating vision boards. If your audience is into any of those things that is your platform of choice. I experimented with Pinterest and didn't get much results so my audience isn't there. But again if yours is dive in and figure out how to connect with them.\n\nFourth is Instagram. Instagram has had the biggest transition of all of these platforms in the last two years. People have discovered how addicting it is to use it and last year it really blew up in terms of numbers and engagement. But the writing is on the wall: soon you'll have to pay to play. It's been bought by Facebook and it'll go the way of Facebook too: paid engagement trumps all.\n\nHowever Instagram is still a great place for coaches, trainers, fitness people and the like to reach their audience. There's a trick to using hashtags on this platform that I explain in today's episode, and it's a great way to reach your target clients.\n\nFifth we have Periscope. Periscope is a live video stream app that burst onto the scene in March of 2015. One day everyone was Meerkating, the next they were on to Periscope. Guy Kawasaki started using Periscope the day it came out, and he announced it while I was interviewing him on stage at Social Media Marketing World. He never went back to Meerkat and pretty much everyone else followed suit.\n\nPeriscope is a fantastic tool for anyone with a physical service. Take for example one of our SoloLabbers, Miriam. She is a sensational organizer and can (and she does) use Periscope to show people how she organizes closets, desk drawers (she did mine in the photo on this page), etc. She can show people how she does this using Periscope and reach her target audience.\n\nSixth is Anchor. Anchor is brand spankin' new as of the publication of this show.", "duration": "1:08:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/396.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Podcast", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1457938390, "title": "395: Knowledge for Men, with Andrew Ferebee", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Andrew Ferebee stops by Studio 86 for a great chat about manhood, attracting the ideal mate, and entrepreneurship.

Til then sit back and enjoy episode 395 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Knowledge For Men\nAndrew's journey to starting Knowledge for Men began after a major romantic relationship ended; he was in a very painful place emotionally and sought knowledge about relationships. He read everything he could about women, dating and relationships; he learned as much as he could and then applied that knowledge in the dating world.\n\nIt took many years for that knowledge to pay off, and Knowledge for Men was one of the rewars. The site was originally a blog where Andrew posted about his own thoughts on self-discovery, pain, happiness, letting go of the past, dating, breakups and being lost in life.\n\nAfter taking one job in particular post-college and going through a serious breakup Andrew decided it was time to go out on his own. He set up a plan, saved for six months and then quit his job. He spent the next six months traveling around the country attending seminars for men, dating workshops and every personal development program that interested him. And he wrote about his experiences on his Knowledge for Men blog.\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat is one thing skateboarding taught Andrew?\n\tWhy safety is so key for women.\n\tHow to know you're ready to start anything.\n\n\tHow to navigate a relationship when only one of you is an entrepreneur.\n\n\tWhat Joe Rogan had to do with the start of Andrew's podcast.\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\n\nAndrew wrote epic posts typically 2,000 words or more and published them every two weeks. The blog began to grow, gain traction and be shared. Some of his articles would get 10,000 shares on Facebook and Reddit, and all of them had over 250,000 views in just a few weeks after their publication.\n\nAnd all of the content was free. He wasn't even asking for email addresses! Andrew hadn't given one thought to his monetization strategy, he didn't even know what that meant. Soon he couldn't keep up with content production so he tried his hand at YouTube videos. They fell flat.\n\nThen his brother suggested he start a podcast. His brother was a big fan of Joe Rogan's and thought Andrew could do the same thing with his own show. So Andrew got a mic, and got started. Today he readily admits he had no idea what was he doing at the beginning! But he got better over time and has done over 250 podcast interviews.\n\nHis experiences also resulted in retreats for men and three books including The Dating Playbook For Men, The Breakup Manual For Men and The Porn Pandemic - all of which are best-sellers on Amazon today.\n\nOne of the key topics we delve into today is how to have a relationship if only one of you is a solopreneur or entrepreneur. Andrew says the key is to have the other person on board. Do they share your values and do they believe in what you are doing? If so there is always a way to make it work. And if they don't it's time to end things or stop them from going any further. Shared values are critical to the success of any relationship so make sure you're both on the same page.\n\nOn today's episode Andrew shares what to expect from his retreat, how to communicate in a way that allows a woman to be more feminine (even if she's coming from her masculine side) and much more about dating, and relationships as a solopreneur! Listen in for some great insights from Andrew and me on episode 395 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What has been your biggest dating or relationship lesson you've learned as a solopreneur?

Do you immediately think logo, like the famous Nike swoosh? Or do you think of the way you feel when you're behind the wheel of your favorite car, or the way you feel when you step inside a Ralph Lauren store?\n\nBranding goes beyond a logo; at its core, branding is about how you feel when you interact with a company. Joining us to talk about all this and more is my fellow San Diego resident and brand consulting expert, Re Perez. Re is the creator and brand strategist behind many incredible brands, including our friend Nick Unsworth's Life on Fire brand.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nRe Perez has a long history of branding from his early days of graphic communications at NYU to his recent business, Branding for the People. He knows the ins and outs about what makes a brand an actual brand - and not just a company with a nice-looking logo.\n\nAnd in episode 89, he shares his insights and vast knowledge on how to create that perfect brand for your business.\n\nRe believes that if you look at branding solely as your logo, you diminish the full potential of what a brand can and is meant to do. We also talk at length about the necessity of a creative brief, what it is and why it is one of the most vital tools you can have in your back pocket when you're creating your brand and your visual identity.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tHow a simple word creates an entire picture: the library effect.\n\tThe location ninja lesson and why it's important for your brand.\n\tWhy it took me 3 months to get 8 words, and why it was worth the wait.\n\tWhat's the first step in building your brand?\n\tWhy business cards are dead - unless they do this one thing.\n\nTruly, when you pinpoint your brand, people get what you're up to instantly. And one of the fastest ways to create that strong brand is with a strong creative brief. Re breaks down the components of a creative brief and how to accurately convey your message in each section. He also stresses the same message David Roth did when he was on the show and that's to answer this one question: \"What feeling do you want to give people with your business?\"\n\nWhen you find the answer to that question, you've taken an important step in discovering the who, what and why of your brand.

Secret Table, the passion project brought to life by Pablo Fernandez.\n\nPablo is our guest for this episode of The Solopreneur Hour; he joins me live in Studio 86 to talk food, people and solopreneurship.\n\nToday he shares what his 10 years in real estate finance taught him and how the lessons from that time led him to combine his lifelong passion of food, community and entrepreneurship to create the successful enterprise that is Secret Table. Tune in for all of that and more on today's show.\nMore About Secret Table\nPablo comes from a long line of entrepreneurs in the food world, going back as far as his great grandmother who ran a pastry business in Guatemala. His parents brought him to Riverside, California when he was two, leaving behind the upheaval and political turmoil that was happening in Guatemala at the time.\n\nDuring his childhood Pablo was surrounded by food, community and entrepreneurs. His mom ran a real estate brokerage and his father owned and operated a restaurant. Pablo would spent a lot of his childhood working in the restaurant and today his mom and dad still run that family business.\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow to make Guatemalan black beans!\n\tWhy a cast iron skillet is a kitchen necessity, and how to season it.\n\tWhat's the mission statement of Secret Table?\n\n\tWhy there are no shortcuts to greatness.\n\n\tWhat's the magic secret to selling out events when no one knows you?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\n\nThere was a family culture to food and some of his earliest memories are of helping his grandmas and his mom in the kitchen. But watching his parents hustle also left an impression: he admits he was always been proudly unemployable and by 17 Pablo was an entrepreneur striking out on his own.\n\nThe start of his career though was real estate finance. He spent 10 years in that industry before the genesis of Secret Table would take place. He was on the cusp of attending in the finest culinary institute in the country when his business blew up. Because he wasn't totally sure he wanted to be a chef and he already knew he didn't want to be a restaurant chef thanks to a local chef he had befriended at a fine Italian restaurant in Riverside, he opted to stay with his business.\n\nThings continued to look bright for his business until 2008 when the market crashed and he lost everything. Like many others he was overleveraged and the 5 years he had spent building that company and all of its assets were lost.\n\nTrue to his solopreneurial spirit though that loss would not keep Pablo down for long. He took a six month sabbatical to Spain, got back to his roots of food and community. He returned to the States, took various consulting gigs with major banks trying to continue what his real estate finance career only to find his heart was no longer in it.\n\nSo after some conversations with his brother they came up with the origins of Secret Table. They started off like any good solopreneur does: they started small, worked out the kinks and got in their reps. They began by hosting small cooking classes and dinner parties for friends for a small fee.\n\nHe and his brother enjoyed it so much they eventually wanted to create a larger event for the public. So they set the date, found the venue and set a goal of having 100 people in attendance - the maximum for the space they had secured. And then they hustled: Pablo called 500 people, texted just as many and sent hundreds of emails as follow ups. It worked! In less than a full week they had sold out the event.\n\nToday they continue Secret Table by hosting regular events but keeping the menu and the location secret! Invited guests know the area in which the event will take place but not the specific location. On the day of the event the location is sent to all registered attendees; they find out what's on the menu when they arrive!\n\nPablo dishes (pun intended) on the mission stateme...", "duration": "1:07:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/390.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Fitness & Health", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Pablo Fernandez", "Podcast", "Real Estate"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1456727083, "title": "389: Putting On Live Workshops, Massive Kickstarter Wins, and Podmastery II, with John Lee Dumas", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Our returning champion is once again on the show.\u00a0!

He had set some ambitious goals, something he is known to do, and he returns to give us the results.\n\nOn today's show he shares how long it took to reach his first campaign goal, and how he felt about the final tally. You'll hear him break down his numbers and also stress the importance of having an engaged audience, whether you're launching a book, a podcast, or any other endeavor.\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat was John's stretch goal for his Kickstarter campaign and why?\n\tWho gets value from being in the hot seat at our Podmastery event?\n\tHow John helped me become the co-host of The Hines Ward Show.\n\tWho are the podfathers?\n\n\tWhat is Inspired by 11?\n\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\n\nAnd the lesson of engagement is one of the greatest lessons John and I have learned as a result of our respective podcasting careers: build an engaged audience in the process. Initially that should be your focus: engagement before monetization.\n\nWhen we started our shows we both were focused on engagement. John had no idea how he was going to monetize EOFire. And while I had some ideas for potential revenue I was focused on growing my audience and reaching people, way before asking them to spend their hard-earned dollars with me. Engagement first, monetization after.\n\nEven though we both took that approach to our podcasts, our actual styles on the mic are very different - which you'll hear in today's episode! But that helps people see the wide spectrum of opportunity there is within podcasting to do your own thing with your unique voice and style. The principles of engagement, professionalism and work ethic remain the same even though our execution is different.\n\nWhen you attend Podmastery 2 you'll see this and hear this firsthand. We're both pros at what we do and believe in the power of podcasting, and making our industry be as professional as possible. To that end we decided we would create an event for people to learn what we know about podcasting so we created Podmastery.\n\nPodmastery was a smash hit and we're bringing you the new and improved version! This time we're spending 3 days in Los Angeles with the next set of podmasters.\u00a0 Instead of doing it all in two days this time we have a day devoted for three different groups: VIPs, beginners and advanced podcasters.\n\nDay one is VIP podcasters. With only 4 spots available they may be gone by the time you read this (go here if you want to find out). Day two is open to the first 15 people who haven't yet launched their podcast, beginners. And Day three is also open to the first 15 people, but this day is for the advanced podcasters who are already up and running.\n\nWe share what we else learned from doing the first Podmastery (and how you can apply those lessons to any live event you plan) plus John and I share the backstory on how I was first introduced to Hines Ward and eventually became his co-host. Tune in for that and for so much more on episode 389 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What can you do for a live event?

And then retiring from it? What would you do next?\n\nA great example of how to transition from one successful endeavor to the next is our guest for today's show: Super Bowl MVP and 4-time Pro Bowler from the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mr. Hines Ward.\n\nWhether or not you're a football fan you'll want to hear what life has been like since he retired from the NFL, especially what he has been doing in the business world.\n\nWe'll dive into that as well as the launch of his podcast, The Hines Ward Show. Tune in for the 387th episode of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About The Hines Ward Show\nIf you're new here or missed Hines' previous visit to the show have a listen here for more on his background. I brought him back not only because he's a great guest and my favorite member of the Steelers, but because he recently launched The Hines Ward Show. It's his very own podcast, which we co-host together and interview some of the biggest celebrities in sports and in Hollywood today.\n\nThe official launch was Monday February 21st and it's been an exciting ride, one Hines admits to being nervous about! He wants to provide a place where he can connect with his fans in a real way and it's important to him that his listeners enjoy the show.\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tDid he ever think he'd have a podcast?\n\tHe is a reality TV show junkie: true or false?\n\tWho owns more shoes: Hines or his wife?\n\tWhat does he do on a day to day basis that we can do to be successful?\n\n\tWhat businesses has he been approached to do?\n\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\n\nAlways the consummate professional, Hines has had to learn to let go of the training professional broadcasting and being in the NFL gave him. As a broadcaster there was always a producer, or a boss who wanted things done in a certain way so he worked with what they wanted. As a player in the NFL he learned very quickly how to give answers that wouldn't be misconstrued.\n\nBut as a fledgling podcaster he's leaving that on the sidelines and letting his full personality shine through on the mic! Today we talk about what that's been like for him, whether he feels the need to be liked, and what his post-football career has brought him.\n\nEven before he left the playing field Hines was thinking of his post-NFL season. By year 10 of his 14 year career he began to really think about retirement. He had been smart with his money along the way and hadn't spent much of it on extravagant things so many other players do. He had heeded the advice of two people he trusted: his financial advisor and his agent.\n\nUnfortunately that trust was misplaced. When he began to examine his portfolio and started checking his accounts things simply didn't add up. Hines has a degree in accounting, so he knew and still knows his way around numbers.\n\nWhen he couldn't even access one of the accounts in his name he started firing people. Fortunately his marketing person (who was also a lawyer) helped him and they were able to sue for some of the money his financial advisor had taken from Hines. But there was nothing Hines could do to replace the money his agent had stolen.\n\nAt the same time he was going through a divorce and was also invested in a bar. Due to mismanagement by his partners in that bar allegations of insurance fraud made the news. Hines had nothing to do with it, but it added to already incredibly stressful time in his life.\n\nAs a result of those experiences he is a much more cautious business partner today, and has learned (the hard way) how to vet and decide who to trust. By guarding his money and his interests more carefully today he has gone on to own a wonderful restaurant in Pittsburgh called Table 86. And he has also started the journey of creating the Hines Ward brand with The Hines Ward Show and other endeavors.\n\nToday Hines talks about the crucial role discipline played in his NFL success as well as his business success today.", "duration": "1:05:49", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/387.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Hines Ward", "Man", "Men's Style", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1456127951, "title": "386: Joel Comm on Snapchat Mastery, & Why You Should Care", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today it seems everyone - from moms to solopreneurs to big brands - is snapping, blabbing and 'scoping. But the man who has been ahead of it all and leading the live streaming revolution is our guest for episode 386, Joel Comm.\n\nJoel is what I'd call a social media pundit; he knows the ins and outs of the latest apps and trends before nearly anyone else. And he does it because he's curious and wants to engage with people, not because he wants to find the latest way to make a buck.\n\nListen to edition 385 of The Solopreneur Hour to hear about the live streaming revolution Joel is leading, and much more.\nMore About Live Streaming\nJoel is one of my favorite people to have on the show: he's been here 5 times now, including this episode. His other four shows you can find here. I love talking with him and having him here not only because he's funny and smart, which he is, but also because he's genuinely following his interests first.\n\nHe follows his curiosity, finds ways to help people with his knowledge and then makes money as a result. He doesn't start with profits first, he starts with his interests and passions first, profits come after.\n\nOn today's episode he shares some of those latest interests like Snapchat and Periscope; he shares what he's learned about them and how he uses them differently. We also talk about which events he speaks at and attends. You'll get a glimpse into the curiosity-driven and exploratory mind that is Joel Comm!\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWho hosted the first Saturday Night Live?\n\tWho should emulate Gary V and who should not?\n\n\tWhat does SASE stand for and why did Joel do a snap about it recently?\n\n\tJoel has been livestreaming for 8 years: true or false?\n\n\tWhat is the most authentic form of social media today?\n\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nJoel has been live streaming before it was really a \"thing\" in the internet marketing world. He played around with and explored a mobile app from Hangwith back in 2008, and continues that exploration today. From the start he chooses which trends to dig into based on his thought leader friends like Brian Fanzo.\n\nThe real test for him is whether or not he's actually curious about what the new app or widget does. Then he discovers whether or not there's it's a venue through which to create and share content and engage with others. If he answers yes to both then he dives in, and suggests it to others.\n\nOne such app he's doing that with right now is Anchor. Joel describes Anchor as being a microcasting app. It allows people send out two minutes of audio content to their followers.\n\nUsed correctly those two minutes are meant to engage people with questions. People can reply to your wave (that's what the two-minute audio content is called on Anchor), like it and share it. He describes it as being a minipodcast.\n\nAnother app he's exploring is Snapchat. Snapchat is a moment-sharing application that allows you to take photos or 10 second videos you share with your followers. If you create a narrative or a story you can share it with all Snapchat users. There are some creative add-ons to photos like emojis and text that you can use as well.\n\nSnapchat is different from other photo apps or video apps because your snap as it's called (the photo or video you create on Snapchat) is gone in 24 hours. Unless you save it or someone else saves a screen shot of your snap it disappears into the ethers.\n\nJoel uses Snapchat every day to create a narrative or a story his followers can watch. At the start of every day he asks himself what kind of narrative he is creating for the day, and then he creates it.\n\nAnother app we explore today on this show is Periscope. He explains the 5 ways he repurposes his daily scope, why he chose the \"top 5\" theme for his scopes, as well as the metrics he's getting on Periscope and Snapchat.

And what should we do if our significant other isn't a solopreneur - do we give up our dreams? If not how do we bring them along on our journey?\n\nHere to answer those questions and more on episode 384 of The Solopreneur Hour is the one and only Vasavi Kumar.\nMore About Vasavi Kumar\nVasavi Kumar has been with us before -\u00a0 in fact this episode is her third time here, her trifecta! If you've missed out on her story have a listen to her previous two episodes.\n\nTo spark your memory Vasavi is the vivacious, free-flowing coach who helps you get clear and handle your \"it\", whatever it is. She is a rare breed in the coaching community: she actually walks her talk. She's been there, she's done it. She knows how to help you face whatever you're going through and come out on the other side with greater clarity, purpose and fulfillment.\n\nWhile catching up with her on episode 384 we talk about relationships and why really liking yourself is the most important relationship you'll ever create. Having recently been divorced Vasavi learned to face many of her own doubts and fears about herself - which she shares today.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat was her biggest fear when taking a step back from her coaching?\n\tWhy do we stay in bad jobs and bad relationships?\n\n\tHow to know if your relationship or partnership is a good one.\n\n\tWhy you only need 8 seconds to know if you like someone.\n\n\tThe most authentic place to give from: what is it?\n\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nVasavi has always been one to buck convention. She was raised in a traditional Indian household and always did certain things in a certain way because that was how Indian women did them. But eventually she had to face up to the fact that she was the only one who was going to live her life.\n\nUltimately she knew she didn't want to have regrets on her deathbed so she pursued her dreams, no matter what anyone else thought.\n\nIn 2014 after finishing culinary school in Austin and spending six months in India she realized her path included getting a divorce - something Indian women simply did not do. But to stay true to her own values and to practice what she preaches, Vasavi knew she had to end her marriage. And that's what she did.\n\nIt turned out to be the blessing she intuitively knew it would be. Both she and her ex-husband have stayed friends and are now thriving in their respective passions.\n\nOn this show she shares how to listen to your intuition about other people, why she had to learn to love herself, how she let go of her co-dependency tendencies and why we're each responsible for our own happiness.\n\nMost of us have had the experience of meeting someone and instantly not liking them or not wanting to be around them. There won't be any specific reason, there's simply a feeling that tells us to move away from them. That is our intuition telling us who to have in our lives, and how to avoid those we shouldn't!\n\nOften we don't heed that intuitive nudge and we find ourselves in relationships and partnerships that don't serve us. We aren't fully ourselves when we're with them, and we are constantly trying to fix something or we're often fighting with them: all signs of an unhealthy relationship.\n\nThis can happen in both our personal lives and our professional lives as well. Vasavi tells how she did a lot of free coaching for people early in her career because she wanted to help others. But when she took a hard look at the real reasons she also saw she was giving unsustainably. She didn't have money for her bills, yet she gave away her time.\n\nThe cure was to get really honest with herself: she had to recognize her own skills, abilities and talents, and then set her prices.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/384.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Love & Relationships", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Vasavi Kumar", "Woman"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1455476063, "title": "383: 3 Steps to a GREAT Online Business w/ Chris Farrell", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As a solopreneur we all start somewhere. Sometimes we start with a topic we know a lot about, sometimes we see an opening and we go for it, learning along the way. Our guest for today saw an opening to serve his audience in a simpler, more effective way than email: a membership site.\n\nChris Farrell of Help My Business joins us for episode 383 of The Solopreneur Hour, live from Traffic and Conversion in San Diego.\n\nOn this show we chat about why he chose to build a membership site, how he got into online marketing in the first place and whether or not he's always been unemployable.\nMore About Chris Farrell\nAs you'll hear on this episode Chris is a Londoner. He was born and raised in East London - hence the cockney accent! Until his early 30s he worked in radio and wasn't the least bit entrepreneurial. He had always had a good job and was working for \"the man\". By 32 he was the mid-morning DJ on the #1 radio station in London.\n\nBut there was always something he couldn't wrap his mind around: how did people make money online, travel the world and run successful businesses? Was it actually legitimate or was it smoke and mirrors?\n\nSo in 2008 he got started in the online marketing world to see for himself. He knew nothing about that world, and knew no one! So initially he tried to do it all himself, and learned everything he could.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWas Chris always unemployable?\n\tWhy it's important to say yes.\n\n\tThe power of gratitude in shifting your mindset.\n\n\tHow do you know if you truly understand something?\n\n\tWhat is his take on the level of professionalism in podcasting today?\n\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nSince then of course he's realized people can and do make good money online through legitimate businesses, his being one of them. Even though it is fairly simple to do so, it isn't easy. His advice to get started making money online boils down to three simple steps:\n1. Find a profitable niche.\nFigure out where people are already spending money and then choose one area to focus on.\n2. Build a list of people interested in that area.\nSimple: find people who are interested in what you are selling, and get them on your email list.\n3. Market to them with products related to their interests.\nContact them with offers and opportunities about products they are interested in, or related to their interests.\nThose are the steps Chris took to get started. He created his own products because he couldn't find many products he was passionate about. While doing so he built his list, and then marketed to them with offers on those products.\n\nBut he also realized it would be more valuable to people if he built a membership site where he could continue to create products and add content, rather than emailing them constantly. So that's what he did. He built a membership site all about internet marketing. He shared with his members what he was learning firsthand, what he loved and what he was passionate about. His success has continued to grow from there.\n\nOn today's episode we cover many other topics from men's fashion to music to podcasting. In particular Chris shares his view on the state of professionalism in podcasting today. He explains more on the show, including why just having the equipment doesn't make you a professional podcaster any more than having a bicycle makes you an Olympic cyclist.\n\nHe is a definitive source on what it takes to succeed behind the mic and in the online world.

Brian Rose of JVZoo on Mad Men Marketing vs. What Actually Works", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Most of the marketing you see still relies on the Mad Men style of advertising: look at what's great about our product.\n\nBut as a solopreneur you know that doesn't work. Gone are the days of touting your product's features to the masses, and expecting big sales as a result. Today's marketing is about connection and communication with your tribe.\n\nHere to talk more about that is the founder of JVZoo, E. Brian Rose. EBR, as his friends call him, shares why he started his company, his origins in affiliate marketing and online marketing, and much more on episode 381 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About JVZoo\nToday JVZoo is THE site for affiliate sales, but EBR's history in online marketing predates the site. In fact his roots are in TV production and radio. As a kid he dreamed of being on the radio so when he got the chance during his time in the military he took it. But when he heard a recording of his voice he was mortified: his Boston accent was so thick! So he practiced, practiced and practiced til it was gone.\n\nAlso while serving he was a TV producer for military television. He enjoyed the production side so much that when he left the armed forces he tried his hand at a video production company. It failed miserably, but being the consummate solopreneur he moved on to the next thing.\n\nIn the mid 90s he landed what he thought was his dream job: he was a contractor for NASA. In his role he had three projects to complete within the year, he and his team finished those in the first few weeks. To kill time in his cubicle he began surfing the internet. At that time in the evolution of technology he was one of the few to have high speed internet, and he took full advantage of it.\n\nWhat he saw online blew him away: the Internet was evolving right before his eyes, and he wanted a piece of the action. He wanted to move to California to get into the mix, but in the mean time he taught himself to build a web site and his next ventures grew from there.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat does the E in E. Brian Rose stand for?\n\tHow did Rich Dad Poor Dad become so popular?\n\n\tWhat defines good marketing online today?\n\n\tHow much did Super Bowl ads cost this year?\n\n\tWhy porn shows us the latest in online marketing.\n\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nSoon he was finding ways to send traffic to sites, and this was in a time when you got paid to do so. It didn't take long for the checks to start coming in and EBR knew there was much more he could create in the online marketing space.\n\nUntil then he had been heavily involved in affiliate sales, physical product sales and generating traffic, but he found out about something called online marketing and information products. He found forums like the Warrior Forums, and read about people selling ebooks and other info products.\n\nHe soon took his turn and created an ebook called Google Red Carpet. It took off like a rocket! It was so successful that the godfather of webinars, James Jones, approached him about turning it into a video course and doing webinars to promote it. The topic he covered in Google Red Carpet is something EBR is passionate about it and something he loved sharing with others so he agreed. And that is the criteria for anything he has ever done before or since: he must love doing it and be passionate about it.\n\nWe also get into how JVZoo was started from an airport conversation with a competitor, what his Marketing Mayhem conference is all about and the latest trends he's seeing in the online space today.

But have you considered that your eating choices could be slowing you down in your business? They might be and our guest today can help you.\n\nAbel James of the Fat Burning Man brand joins me to talk about all that and more in episode 380 (encore of episode 48) of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nAbel has one of the leading health podcasts where he\u2019s interviewed Tim Ferriss, Lewis Howes, and many more notables. He's also a successful solopreneur who has had the #1 app, and he is a best-selling author.\n\nAbel's online home is Fatburningman.com and today we chat about our backgrounds in music and how musicianship has influenced our solopreneur careers, the impact nutrition has had for both of us, and the lost art of being Renaissance man.\n\nFrom an early age, Abel has been a hustler and an innovator. As he says in this podcast, he didn't grow up with much money so he had to create it from nothing. If he wanted something he had to create the money to get it, so that's what he did!\nListen in as Abel and I share:\n\n\tWhy it's vital as a solopreneur to model yourself after people who are socially, morally and ethically responsible.\n\tHis sure-fire tips for getting healthy without denying yourself.\n\tThe value in living as a Renaissance man or woman and why it's become a lost art.\n\tWhy saying you don't have time for something is a cop out.\n\tThe number one way to set yourself apart from everyone else.\n\tAnd much more!\n\nHis foray into internet marketing came in the late 90s, and he hasn't looked back since. His early start came via buying & selling on eBay, selling music online, among other things. Today he creates podcasts, books and apps, including launching an app ranked #6 (ahead of the ever-popular \"Angry Birds\"!).\n\nOnce we cover his background and our shared interest in music - including the podcasters' band we want to create! - we get into even more goodies like why you need to protect your intellectual property on the internet today.\n\nIn terms of intellectual property everyone (or so it seems) is a solopreneur today, and they have their solopreneur business. But what happens after you've launched something you've poured your heart, sweat and time into and you see copycats of your exact product a week later? How do you protect yourself from that? It happens far more often than you think and you'd do well to prepare yourself.\n\nWe also talk about the importance of physical labor versus creation, when he became unemployable, what he does with the Fat Burning Man brand and why being a Renaissance man is a lost art.\n\nOne of the key points to listen to is his brand and the change he is bringing to the world with it. You'll hear the passion he has for quality food and how he shares that on his podcast, his apps and his other products - it's not about getting a six-pack yesterday, it's about the mental, emotional and psychological component because that's where real change is made.\n\nI had a blast with him on this show, and I hope you are both entertained and educated when you listen. Abel and I have jam-packed this episode with tons of value - and lots of laughs. It's clear he is a man who walks his talk from the way he eats to the way he runs his solopreneur endeavors.

He's a man of many talents and interests, much of which he shares on today's show.\n\nOn episode 378 of The Solopreneur Hour we talk God, drums, Rick & Morty, and a bunch of other intelligent, thoughtful stuff.\nMore About Chase Reeves\nChase grew up in an upper middle class family in the San Francisco bay area. He was the kid who had lots of friends in a lot of different groups, but never felt like he fit in within any of them. He was a terrific soccer player, liked to play guitar and loved the drums. He was a punk rock kid who played in bands in San Fran's metal scene.\n\nOn the flip side he also became highly involved in the evangelical world as a teenager. In fact he is trained to be a pastor! He attended Westmont College, a Christian liberal arts college where he earned a degree in religious studies. He wanted to pursue a PhD in history so he could write historical fiction about the time period between the death of the last apostle and the canonization of the New Testament.\n\nAlthough he obviously pursued a different path he remained an active churchgoer til about eight years ago. On today's show he talks about the fact that he and Jesus are \"seeing other people\", his interest in exploring other religions, and why he is defining success for himself.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWho won the Instagram account of the year?\n\tWhat is the intention behind Fizzle?\n\n\tWhat is Chase's definition of \"emotional jazz\"?\n\n\tShould companies be better employers or should more people be solopreneurs?\n\n\tPlus a special bonus comedy bit about yoga!\n\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOne of the things Chase has learned in his career is to define success on his own terms. There are and always will be vanity metrics that anyone can use to say they're successful or they've made it, but his definition of success doesn't rely on that.\n\nAs you'll hear in his voice on this episode he wants to do things he loves for the sake of that love and the way doing those things make him feel. It goes far beyond any specific result and chasing other people's terms.\n\nAnd that's something you as a solopreneur can make a note of: what's the thing you love to do? The thing you lose track of time talking about? That's what you should pursue, even if it doesn't seem like what you've been told you should do. Don't do something or go down a certain path because you think there's a big audience and a lot of money in it, do the thing you love because you love it.\n\nChase also explains how he has always wanted creative freedom, autonomy and self-expression: key components of why they do what they do at Fizzle. Most of us today aren't awarded the opportunity to explore any (let alone all) of those possibilities in a typical job, and that's why many of us strike out on our own.\n\nHe has seen Fizzle community members come in because they want to be creative, be expressed and be autonomous but couldn't find it in the outside world so they come to Fizzle for help in creating their own business where they can be and do all of that.\n\nWe also talk about good being the enemy of great and great being the enemy of extraordinary. Chase's advice is simple: all you can commit to is doing the work you can do, so do it and don't worry if it will impress others.\n\nToday's episode wraps up with a lesson significance and on drums! We really run the gamut on topics on this episode so sit back and enjoy number 378 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: Are you working on the thing you love every day? What is it?

And you will love Pat Flynn's latest book; it's called Will It Fly?.\n\nOn episode 377 of The Solopreneur Hour, Pat and I dig into the impetus for this book, what publishing route he chose and why, as well as his alternative to the traditional customer avatar advice.\nMore About Pat Flynn\nIf for some reason you haven't heard of Pat or have missed his previous visits to the show (which are all here by the way), Pat got into the online world 8 years ago as a blogger and a self-professed \"crash test dummy\".\n\nHe's the founder of Smart Passive Income, a site he created after getting laid off as an aspiring architect/job captain at an architecture firm. The site was built to show people how he had successfully sold an online course helping architects pass their LEED exam, and how he grew an audience in the process.\n\nOver the years he's continued to be that \"crash test dummy\" for his audience and try new things, validate or invalidate them and then passes along his results. People love him for it, as well as how genuinely kind and authentic he is. Over and over again when his fans meet him they tell him he's the same person online as he is in real life, something that had been sorely missing in the online community before Pat came onto the scene.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat was Pat's scariest moment on stage?\n\tWhy did he avoid labeling himself a CEO for so long?\n\n\tWhy a pre-launch group is so powerful.\n\n\tWhy real world feedback is critical to the success of any endeavor.\n\n\tHow Pat is using a hybrid of self-publishing and working with a publishing house.\n\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOne of the things his audience also says to him, whether in person or online, is how much they want something that is just Pat, and is more than blog posts and podcast episodes. Hearing those requests along with his new CEO mindset Pat decided it was time for a book and so Will It Fly? was conceived.\n\nIn true Pat Flynn fashion he gathered a pre-launch group of around 500 people and tested his early drafts on them. In exchange for early access to the book this group was asked to give feedback, provide their favorite quotes and leave reviews on Amazon. It worked like a charm, and helped both the group members personally and professionally and helped Pat flesh out what worked and lose what didn't work til he had a final product both he and his audience loved.\n\nOn today's show Pat shares more details on why he went with a pre-launch group, the three phases of the book's release, and his chapter on discovering your customer's P.L.A.N (versus creating a customer avatar).\n\nHis chapter on discovering your customer's P.L.A.N. is a great lesson for anyone in any industry. If you're stuck where you're at or you're creating a new business you'll want to take note of this.\n\nThe traditional advice is to create a customer avatar and while Pat feels that's important he also knows firsthand the value in empathizing with your audience. He has always felt his people's struggles and challenges, and that's one of the things that has made him so successful.\n\nSo rather than creating an avatar he encourages people to create a customer P.LA.N. He breaks it down like this:\nP is for problem:\nYou are discovering your customers' problems. You need to know what problems they have so you can solve them.\nL is for language:\nKnowing how your customer describes their problems, knowing the phrases and the overall language they use, helps you connect with them. When they see you \"speak their language\" you instantly gain credibility and trust in their eyes, crucial elements to sales and success.\nA is for anecdote:\nWhat are the stories your customers they tell about this issue? You can find these stories by asking them this question: \"Tell me about a time when you ____\".

And no one knows that better than John Ruhlin, the number one sales guy for Cutco. Cutco is largest cutlery manufacturer in North America and is one of the largest direct sales companies in the world.\n\nWhile still holding that record and his standing with Cutco, John went on to found The Ruhlin Group. His firm specializes in year-round strategic gifting and appreciation programs to connect with C-level executives.\n\nOn episode 375 of The Solopreneur Hour John joins us to talk about all of that and more. Kick back, listen in and enjoy!\nMore About John Ruhlin\nJohn's initiation into the world of sales, gift-giving and business is a bit of a circuitous one, like it often is for solopreneurs! He grew up in rural Ohio, about 1.5 hours south of Cleveland. When he went to college he started off pre-med, he wanted to be a doctor.\n\nTo pay for that degree he began working for a cable company. After falling off a ladder several times (from 30 feet) and not getting hurt, he realized it was a wake up call. He needed to do something else to pay for school, or he might not be so fortunate the next time he fell! So he joined his friend who sold Cutco knives.\n\nWhile with Cutco he had terrific sales training: he learned the art of overcoming objections and how to build relationships. One of those relationships was with his girlfriend's dad. That man taught John the true key to giving gifts, creating referrals and solidifying relationships: give gifts that take care of the receiver's inner circle (like the receiver's spouse, significant other, assistant, and/or children) and you'll create a bond for life.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow often should you give gifts?\n\tWhen did he know to switch his pre-med studies to PR and marketing?\n\n\tOne key question to ask yourself before giving a gift.\n\n\tWhy it's not just the thought of giving that counts.\n\n\tHow can gifts keep you top of mind with someone?\n\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOn today's episode John shares his craziest gift that he ever gave, and how it brought him referrals and exposure that millions of dollars in advertising would never have gotten him, as well as the keys to getting started with giving gifts, whatever your budget.\n\nThe keys to getting started are simple: personalize the gift, make it a surprise and make it something they can use repeatedly. All too often we receive personalized gifts, but they are personal to the SENDER, not the recipient.\n\nThink about the last conference you went to or meeting you attended - what swag did you get? Did it have the company's name on it or yours? Odds are it had the company's name on it, and odds are you either tossed it in a drawer somewhere or gave it to Goodwill. No one wants to wear a polo shirt with your company's name on it, nor do they want a mug with your logo on it - not unless you're Nike, Lululemon or the like.\n\nInstead make the gift you give personalized with their name, or engrave it to their entire family. One of John's favorite gifts to give as a follow up when meeting someone or after they've set aside time to talk with him is a personalized Cutco knife with a handwritten note.\n\nWhatever gift you're giving ask yourself if you would give that gift to them at their wedding. If the answer is yes it's a gift you can give. If the answer is no you need to rethink the gift and your personalization of it.\n\nThe second key is to make it a surprise. Don't tell someone you're sending them a gift - it ruins the surprise! Once you tell them they'll start worrying you're going to send them something they won't like or won't be able to use.

All of that and more on episode 374 of The Solopreneur Hour - hope you dig it!\nMore About\nOne of the greatest feats we will ever face as solopreneurs is simply the fear of doing it, and that's one of the reasons I devoted an entire chapter to the subject. The purpose of this chapter and of this episode is to help you get past those fears, to face them and do the thing you're going to do anyway.\n\nBefore we dive into some of the material I cover it's important to understand the format I chose for each chapter of the book.\n\nFirst it starts with a quote about the theme of the chapter. Since chapter 2 is about fear I chose a quote about fear. Second I share a story of a successful solopreneur. Third is the meat and potatoes: the chapter's topic, and then I wrap with the resources from that chapter.\n\nNow in this particular section of the book, chapter two, I cover things like turning your fear into opportunity, the pros and cons of being a solopreneur, how to tackle some common beginning solopreneur problems so you can better face your fears and mindset techniques to also help you face your fears.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat is the key to your future solopreneur success?\n\tHow I transitioned from working behind the scenes to being in the spotlight.\n\tWhy time freedom is worth so much more than money.\n\tWhat is wealth according to Rich Dad/Poor Dad?\n\tHow you can use your mortgage to your advantage.\n\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nWhen it comes to facing your fears of solopreneurship it's important to be transparent about the pitfalls and the opportunities. Let's start with the downsides: you are completely responsible for your success or failure, financial instability, and the stress that goes along with that.\n\nBeing 100% responsible for your success or failure is often one of the reasons people become solopreneurs. For me I was tired of working for middle managers who wouldn't know a good idea if it hit them upside the head.\n\nBeing a solopreneur means there is no more middle manager and you can implement any idea you come up with. That also means you are responsible if it fails, and if it succeeds. You need patience to see things through to their ultimate success or failure, and you also get the joy of exploring your own ideas and the fulfillment that comes with it.\n\nAnother downside is the financial instability. Most of us will need to take steps to prepare for this because we live paycheck to paycheck. On this episode and in the book I give you ideas on how to do so. But it's important you are aware of the instability from the beginning. Much of your life, including your finances, will fluctuate as a solopreneur. This can add real stress to your life, with your spouse/partner, your friends and in your other relationships.\n\nBut there are significant upsides to going it on your own. The big three are time freedom, financial freedom and location freedom.\n\nTime freedom cannot be overestimated. As I get older I am much more focused on having experiences, and the more time freedom I have the more experiences I can be open to creating. I recently spent 10 days with my brother helping him move, and it was a true bonding experience for us. That was something I could not have done if I had had a regular job.\n\nFinancial freedom is another great benefit to solopreneurship. No one decides how much you earn but you. There are hundreds of ways you can make money as a solopreneur, both long-term and short-term. And once you master just a few of those (which the book will help you do), you'll become amazed not only when you lose track of zeros in your PayPal ...", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/374.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1453488994, "title": "373: Stevie Wonder Selfie, Scheduling Your Priorities, and Free Coaching Friday", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Ok...Stevie Wonder is not on the show. \u00a0But I *did* take a selfie with him, so that was pretty cool.

And often that vision means creating your lifestyle first, and fitting your business within that (rather than the other way around).\n\nOne man who has experienced that change and evolution is Corbett Barr, CEO and Founder of Fizzle.co.\n\nHe joins us today to talk about his first startup experiences, and how his failures lead him to the success he has today. We'll dive into the origins of Fizzle, Sparkline and more on episode 372 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Corbett Barr\nCorbett was born and raised in Portland, an area he left for awhile but has recently come back to. Growing up he was both a nerd and an athlete: he played four years of varsity soccer in high school and was also one of the top academic achievers in his class. High school was also where he met his future wife, they've been together ever since!\n\nUnlike many of our other guests Corbett was very employable he says. He worked full-time while in college and then became a consultant after graduation. He worked for a firm consulting with Fortune 500 companies; he traveled to large corporations and showed where they were inefficiently using technology and provided solutions for them to be more effective in terms of money and data.\n\nEven though he enjoyed his work most days he always felt that solopreneur itch and knew he'd eventually scratch it!\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat was the PayPal Mafia?\n\tCan you make money with any business idea and good execution?\n\tCan you niche down too far?\n\tWhy there's no such thing as bad data.\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nThat day came when he and his wife moved to San Francisco so she could attend graduate school there as a fine artist. They were both starting over fresh so when he met with a former colleague about an idea for a startup Corbett decided to get on board. It was time to try his hand at entrepreneurship and he became co-founder with his former colleague.\n\nAnd it was a roller coaster ride from the beginning: they landed a few million in venture capital backing, built an office and hired 10 employees. They continued on that path for three years. But in 2008 they were running out of funds, the financial crisis hit and their investors were scrambling for money. So when Corbett and his co-founder asked for more backing it came with stiff terms, and eventually they decided to close up shop.\n\nCorbett and his wife took an eight-month long road trip to clear their heads, sort through their experiences and find what was next. He originally thought he would take that time to find his next startup and rebuild his vision of what a successful business looked like, but the more people he met and talked with the more that vision changed.\n\nHe began blogging about the people and conversations he had on their road trip, and soon his audience grew. Within the first year of his blog 500,000 people had visited his site.\n\nAnd he also understood from blogging about his experience, his travels and his audience that he wanted to build his life around his next business, not vice versa. This was at the same time Tim Ferriss' The Four Hour Work Week and lifestyle design were becoming wildly popular.\n\nOut of his soul-searching, blogging and audience building, Corbett created four new courses. Though they were all successful he wanted to combine them under one roof, and offer them through one platform. The groundwork for Fizzle had been born, and today they offer 500 different courses in one online location covering everything business-related from marketing to audience creation to building your first product.\n\nCorbett shares more details on what Fizzle has evolved into today, as well as why the \"fake it til you make it\" slogan only applies in certain situations.

Check out the Growth to Freedom podcast every Monday - after you listen to episode 371 of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About Dan Kuschell\nAs a kid Dan wanted to play professional baseball, from the age of 6 he knew it was his dream. So he told his dad who encouraged him and helped him.\n\nOne of the most impactful things Dan's dad did for him was to take him to his first personal development workshop at the age of 10. That experience opened the gateway for Dan, and showed him the necessity of mindset, coaching and growth to being successful at baseball and anything else he did in life.\n\nAfter high school Dan wasn't drafted by the pros so he went to Aquinas College for two years, then Wayne State University for another two years. During his summers his sister helped him intern at an agency she was working at in Detroit. That agency was a direct response marketing firm.\n\nWhile there he learned from such greats as Tony Robbins and Brian Tracy among others. Dan was fascinated by human behavior, and the psychology of why people did what they did. He was curious about why people responded certain ways to certain messages versus others. Soon direct response seemed a much better and more lucrative option than anything else he was considering after college.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tA great coach does this - what is it?\n\tWhat are the two types of marketing?\n\tWhat are e.l.f. tools vs h.a.l.f. tools?\n\tWhy you should go out and do things solo.\n\tThe one phrase to take your offer to the next level.\n\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nAt the age of 22 Dan took his life savings and started his own business. He took what he had learned from the agency he interned at and set out on his own. He wanted to do what they did, but also wanted to know what he could do better and do in a more innovative way.\n\nSo he hired someone who had cashed out from Apple, and had him develop a software program that assessed your ability to sell. The program had seven categories of selling, and would determine where you were weak and then Dan's firm would help strengthen those areas. While this may not sound all that remarkable today, Dan was doing this in 1992!\n\nOn today's episode Dan shares his motivation in growing his company, some of his failures along the way, as well as his assessment of Pat Flynn's 10 steps to a successful sales page. He adds a few extra bits to Pat's 10 steps, you'll want to hear what they are!\n\nWe also talk about the six human needs, and how tapping into those can be the difference between being what Dan calls a \"sales pest\" versus a \"welcome guest\". If you're curious what those 6 human needs are check them out:\n\n\tCertainty.\n\tUncertainty/variety.\n\tSignificance/purpose/meaning.\n\tLove and connection.\n\tGrowth and mastery.\n\tMaking a difference/contribution.\n\nYou'll have to listen to hear how to expand on those six to deepen your rapport with your audience, and it is well worth your time to do so!

Anytime a solopreneur, an entrepreneur or a company puts a lot of effort into their copy, I garner\u00a0huge\u00a0respect for them.\n\nToday's guest, Mish Slade, is a copywriting ninja. \u00a0She's on a mission to eliminate the cheesy \"corporate speak\" from companies by writing fabulous copy, and her company, Mortified Cow, is dedicated to just that.\n\nAside from traveling around the world for the last couple years and being a digital nomad with her husband, she's been working on her latest book May I Have Your Attention Please (available on Amazon January 25). We dive into all of that and more on episode 368 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Mish Slade\nMish had a fairly typical upbringing: she was born and raised in the suburbs of London with her mom, dad and her brother. She went to university where she met her now husband and spent her free time writing for the campus paper.\n\nAfter graduation she interned in New York at a Jewish newspaper and learned to write feature stories. She fell in love with the city! When she returned to London she took a job with a digital agency there, and her husband went to work in PR for Warner Music.\n\nWhen he later proposed she accepted on the condition that they would take a six-month sabbatical to New York City so she could fully explore and immerse herself in the city. He accepted her condition, they married and set about making the sabbatical come true. They saved six months' worth of living expenses before quitting their jobs and moving to NYC.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat is a typical day like for them as digital nomads?\n\tWhere did the name Mortified Cow come from?\n\tWhy she recommends the \"show don't tell\" approach to writing copy.\n\tThe need for a unique angle when writing your own copy.\n\tHow can you make your writing more targeted?\n\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nThey spent six months not working in NYC, just living and exploring and learning. There were wonderful experiences and not so-wonderful experiences, but it was worth it for them. Near the end of their stay they both came to the conclusion they wanted to do this long-term.\n\nSo next up was figuring out how: how would they be digital nomads? What would it take to travel and live around the world? On today's show Mish explains how they've set up their day to day lives and how they work as digital nomads, plus how they utilize services like AirBnB to travel from country to country.\n\nOne tip Mish has for wanna-be travelers is to save. If you're planning to leave your job and travel she recommends doing what they did: have six months' of expenses saved up. But if you have a job that can be done anywhere then use AirBnB to rent out your place while you're gone.\n\nWe also dive into copywriting: she shares her suggestions on the importance of finding your voice when writing your own copy. You have to know who you're serving, why you're different, what you stand for and what you're about before you begin any kind of messaging. Otherwise you'll simply fall into the \"corporate speak\" well so many others do.\n\nIt's important to know what is unique about your company and who your ideal client is so you can speak to them in a natural, human way. She has a chapter on being human in her book, that's how important the topic is! She has several other chapters we discuss, and much more on this episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What did you learn about copywriting today that you're going to use in your business?

Unfortunately for most of us, achieving our goals sometimes falls short.\n\nThat's where John Lee Dumas and his new Freedom Journal step in. His promise is that if you go through The Freedom Journal\u00a0and complete it without accomplishing your big hairy goal, he'll give you your money back.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is worth the price of admission. Get yours here and then enjoy episode 369 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About The Freedom Journal\nGoal setting is one of those things we all know we need to do, but not all of us do it. One man who does set and accomplish his goals is John Lee Dumas of EO Fire. If you're a regular listener of the show you've heard him here numerous times, and today he joins us to talk about why goal setting is important, how The Freedom Journal helps in that process and where the idea for the journal came from.\n\nOne of the questions he is asked most often by his EO Fire listeners is what makes an entrepreneur successful. After interviewing over 1200 of them in January of 2015 (a year ago), he was pondering his answer yet again.\n\nUntil then he had always answered: hard work. And while true, he also knew there was more to it than that. He was talking about this topic with Kate, his significant other, and the answer came to him: it's goal setting. Successful entrepreneurs, every single one he had interviewed, set and achieved their goals. That was their key.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat is John's next 100 day goal?\n\tWhat non-profit is John partnered with for this launch?\n\tWas The Freedom Journal always going to be a journal?\n\tWhat are micro-goals and why are they so important?\n\tWhat is the movement he hopes The Freedom Journal creates?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nJohn also realized that was something many of his EO Fire audience members struggled with. And being the entrepreneur he is he wanted to find a solution to solve their goal-setting problem. Enter The Freedom Journal.\n\nNow the process of actually distilling his knowledge on the subject was another matter. It took a lot of effort on his part, and input from trusted confidantes for John to see the process he used in his own life to set and achieve goals.\n\nOne of the patterns that emerged was that it took him about 100 days. When he decided to create his 7-day a week podcast it took him about 100 days from concept to launch. When he created Podcasters' Paradise it took him 100 days to do so. So 100 days was a pattern for the successful creation and fulfillment of a goal.\n\nTo follow that 100 day cycle he wanted something tangible, something physical his audience could use. It couldn't be an app or a Kindle book or a PDF; all along he wanted it to be a hardbound, beautiful journal that they could see, touch and use every day.\n\nOn this episode John shares what he did next to actually make The Freedom Journal a reality, why he maintained 100% of control over the project and why the journal has its specific layout. He shares all of that plus his morning routine on episode 369 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What is your 100 day goal?

Today he continues the dual-home trend by calling both Los Angeles and Trinidad home. For the upcoming Olympics he'll be representing Trinidad in the sport of boxing, but most of his training is happening in LA.\n\nJust as he calls multiple ports home he always calls multiple vocations his passions: boxing/fighting, acting and track cycling. His interest in boxing/fighting began in high school, and it's a craft he's been honing ever since. Today he trains at the famed Wildcard Boxing Club in LA, Manny Pacquano's club. While working out there Daniel has met the likes of Mickey Rourke, Mark Wahlberg and Dave Chappelle.\n\nOn this episode Daniel talks about meeting those guys, how he got into acting, how to athletics has helped him navigate that super competitive world and what lessons you as a solopreneur can learn from his experiences.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy did he use ankle weights around his waist?\n\tIs there a difference between a fighter and a boxer?\n\tHow did he get into track cycling?\n\tWhose career would he like to emulate?\n\tWhat was his first real acting gig?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nWhile in college Daniel was on the football and the basketball team. As such he got first choice of classes, being allowed to select his courses a year in advance. One year he procrastinated on choosing and wasn't able to get into any course other than acting!\n\nIt did work out on his favor however. For their mid-terms they had to act in a play and on opening night as the cast waited for the curtains to be raised Daniel noticed everyone was nervous. But he wasn't. He was excited. To him it felt like a competition, he got the same rush he got from facing an opponent in the ring, on the field or on the court.\n\nWith that the acting bug had bitten him, and he was hooked! He continued to hone his skills, taking more classes including improv and studying the Meisner Technique. Again Daniel wanted to become a master and it's a craft he continues to perfect today.\n\nSince then he's gotten a manager and an agent, and proactively puts himself out there at events so he can land more acting gigs. When he goes to those events he's focused on creating personable connections and having real conversations with the people there. He finds out in advance who will be in attendance and then learns whatever he can about them.\n\nHe's a naturally curious person so he looks for something interesting or noteworthy about the other person - through his online research - and then thinks of a few specific questions he wants to ask them. For example if they went to the University of Michigan he'll make a note of that and then ask if they've ever been to a Wolverines game.\n\nDoing so shows people Daniel genuinely cares about who they are as a person, not just what they can do to help his career. And that genuine caring and connection stands out in the other person's mind after they've met him.\n\nDaniel also explains how he improves himself on a daily basis, what he's doing to become a better actor and where his focus is at before the upcoming Olympic Games in August 2016. Check out all of that and more on episode 366 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What did you learn from Daniel on today's show?

How about a deep sea dive to the Titanic? Maybe sing a few tunes with your favorite band of all time?\n\nThese seemingly impossible dreams are not impossible to Steve Sims from The Bluefish, a high-end concierge service to make all of your dreams come true...if you can afford them.\n\nThis episode, like many others, illustrates that the path to success is often zany, twisted, and illogical.\n\n\u00a0\nMore About Steve Sims and The Bluefish\nDespite what he does today and who he does it for you wouldn't have guessed Steve Sims didn't grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was born and raised in East London to a family that, according to him, had aspirations of being middle class.\n\nBut they were honest, respectful, dependable and hard-working; all values they instilled in Steve. They raised him to be true to his word, and everyone in their neighborhood was the same way. If you said you were going to pay someone on Tuesday you paid them on Tuesday, no matter what. And that's one of the things Steve attributes his success to today: when he says something will get done it gets done, and people respect and appreciate that about him.\n\nIn today's online world with our endless social media channels it's far too easy to put up a front and pretend to be someone you aren't, and say you've done things you really haven't. So Steve's honesty, transparency and dependability are refreshing for his clients.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat is the chug test?\n\tWhy money isn't the pinnacle of success, and what really is.\n\tWhy did he start handwriting notes and what did he learn by doing so?\n\tWhere did the name for his business come from?\n\tWhat is our greatest asset?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nOn today's episode Steve brings more of that honesty as we we also talk about his short-lived banking career and how he made the transition from being a doorman to hosting his own parties and connecting with others there.\n\nIn the late 1980s Hong Kong was experiencing a financial boom, that period in their economic growth was called the Asian Tiger. One of Steve's friends was in on it. He encouraged Steve to apply to work in Hong Kong in banking, everyone was being hired to go there and get involved in the markets.\n\nEven though he knew nothing about banking he made it sound like he had worked in the financial markets in the private sector and the man interviewing him believed him! Two weeks later a plane ticket to Hong Kong showed up for Steve and he was off.\n\nHe landed on Saturday, went to orientation on Monday and by Tuesday morning he was fired! It was a very short-lived banking career, but it proved to be the turning point that would lead him to starting The Bluefish.\n\nSteve was feeling dejected and didn't know what to do next. One day while at a bar (still in Hong Kong) a woman asked him if he'd be a doorman for their establishment. Steve has always been a big man with a physical presence; he said yes and started working at the club.\n\nEventually he connected and built relationships with many of the affluent patrons; because he looked after people who had money he started throwing parties for them, doing things for them and continued to cement those relationships. It took some time to grow from there but that was the start of The Bluefish.\n\nOn episode 365 of The Solopreneur Hour Steve shares more about what's made him so successful, some wrong turns he made and how he was set right along the way. He also gives a real-life example of his process in making the seemingly impossible possible! This is a great lesson in how and why to embrace being uncomfortable, how to position any request as a win-win for both parties and how doing so will help you succeed as a solopreneur!\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What is the one thing you dream of hiring The Bluefish to do for you?

This show was an instant \"Best Of\" for me, and will become the outline I follow when it's time for Solopreneur Hour live events! \u00a0Enjoy episode 363 of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About Ignite Your Movement\nNick Unsworth is our returning champ for today's show, he's been here numerous times and was gracious enough to record this one on his birthday. If you haven't heard his back story or any of the other episodes he's co-hosted have a listen here.\n\nSo today we catch up on the latest and greatest in his life including his recent wedding and honeymoon, the biggest business nightmare he's experienced (and how he turned it around) and the what, where, when and why of his latest Ignite Your Movement event in Los Angeles.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow did Nick know it was time to do his first event?\n\tWhat's the biggest mistake first time event hosts make?\n\tWhy living a life on fire isn't just about this one thing.\n\tWhat fuels Nick to do what he does?\n\tWhat to expect from Daymond John and Tai Lopez at the next Ignite event!\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nNick has wanted to do live events for quite awhile. In fact he's been interested in putting them on long before they became the \"it\" thing to do again. Events have been so impactful for him and his business that providing valuable and informative events for other people was a way to give back and give others the opportunity to have the same experiences he did.\n\nHe also knew he wanted to do events differently than they had been done before, and he wanted to do them in his own way. His ultimate goal was transformational 3 day events, but he knew he couldn't start with those. So instead he developed one day events and grew into the 3 day model.\n\nNick also started with the free ticket model. The model works like this: you offer free tickets to anyone who wants to attend. You run Facebook ads to promote the offer, when people click the ad they are sent to a landing page. On the landing page it clearly spells out the details of the free offer: they give a 100% refundable deposit of $47 or $97 (whatever makes sense for your numbers) and provide their first and last name, and their telephone number.\n\nAfter giving that information they are taken to a second landing page where a video of you pops up and again explains the fully refundable deposit and how they will recoup their money. Now they have a free ticket and you have a lead!\n\nBut it doesn't end there. When they show up to the event you create a moment on stage where you tell them to hold up their envelopes with the checks in them and wave those checks in the air. You tell them they can keep the check and deposit it, or they can turn the check in and in exchange receive a course (or some other offer) worth X amount of money.\n\nNick followed that model for a long time before going over to the paid ticket model. In fact this is his first event where the tickets are paid, and not free. His tickets for this event are buy one get one free so two people can share the cost of the ticket, and he gave all the listeners a coupon code for $100 off. He says they may legitimately sell out the ballroom he's reserved in Los Angeles so get on that offer stat!\n\nHe also explains who will be in attendance at this event - from Tai Lopez to Daymond John (FUBU, Shark Tank) to Michael Bernoff among many other big names you'll recognize. Listen in to hear all of those details on episode 363 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What are you committed to getting out of the Ignite Your Movement event?

Learning how to cultivate and grow solid relationships with the thought leaders of your industry is the fast track to business (and personal) success.\n\nHere to explain how to do so is former Clinton White House Staffer John Corcoran. He is a\u00a0master of cultivating these relationships, and on episode 362 of The Solopreneur Hour, he shares the tricks and tools of the trade. Get ready because this is one of those episodes that will set your Evernote on fire!\nMore About John Corcoran\nIf you missed John's previous visit you'll definitely want to listen to it here. We delve into his back story including his days working in the White House on Bill Clinton's staff, why he started his own law firm helping entrepreneurs and small business owners.\n\nBecause we covered his background previously we can get into the nitty gritty on this show, something I love to do for you. On today's episode John shares why he does so many webinars (he did over 100 this year!), how NOT to approach someone to be your JV partner and several specific tactics he recommends for building relationships with influencers in any industry.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat are the 3 main topics John does webinars on?\n\tHow to become more charismatic: can anyone do it?\n\tWhat are CRMs and why should you know?\n\tWhy doesn't he bring his phone out at events?\n\tHow to fully leverage an event, even when you don't get to connect with everyone there.\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nOne of the many reasons John loves doing webinars is the connections it creates with people around the world. Live events are incredible for this, but not everyone can make it to every conference, trade show or mastermind. And when they can't webinars are a great alternative.\n\nAnd I'm not kidding when I say John loves doing them, he did over 100 in 2015! In about 18 months he grew his email list to nearly 30,000 doing webinars. And he did so spending less than $1,000 on Facebook ads.\n\nInstead of ads he does JVs, joint ventures. He approaches people he's already created relationships with (that's a BIG key) and asks if he could do a webinar for their audience. The people he asks have large audiences and email lists, and they are much warmer than Facebook traffic so his attendance rates are high and people are receptive to his offers.\n\nThe key to this equation is building that relationship with the potential JV partner well in advance of making the ask, and that's something John does extraordinarily well. Naturally we touched on this topic today too: how to build those relationships in a real and genuine way.\n\nOne of his suggestions is writing handwritten notes and sending them in the mail. You can drop them a line and let them know you're thinking of them. If you see something in a magazine or newspaper tear it out and send it to them.\n\nOr if you find yourself thinking of writing notes but never actually doing it send a text or an email. It's better to do what comes quickest and most naturally to you rather than not communicating at all!\n\nYou can also send them a personal video just to say hi or make a quick video with someone you want to introduce them to. This works really well if you are at an event - the two of you can shoot a short video saying hi and sharing contact info live from the event and then email it to the person you're introducing the new connection to.\n\nJohn also gives recommendations on using Contactually (or any other customer relationship management tool, CRM) to get the most bang for your buck, and how to tactfully turn someone down if they aren't a fit for your audience.\n\nThis truly is an episode loaded with effective strategies designed to help you build genuine, solid relationships and friendships that will impact your bottom line financially and personally.

Roberts on Building A Business from His Passion", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Our guest for today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour was once a world record-holder in powerlifting, and now is a successful serial entrepreneur with multiple business wins under his belt.\n\nA.J. Roberts is here to discuss how to be a professional at anything, how to properly stand on the shoulders of your predecessor giants, and how he got into the internet marketing world after his powerlifting days. Check it out on episode 360 of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About A.J. Roberts\nAs a kid growing up in Southampton England A.J. found a calling in basketball. In fact it was time as an exchange student in Kansas that started it all. He took his love of the game back to England where he obsessively trained and dreamed of being in the NBA. At only 5'11\" it was a long shot, and after coming back to the US and playing with guys who had his talent and extra 5 or 6 inches A.J. threw in the towel.\n\nBut he learned an important lesson: he knew he could go all in on his NBA dreams and have a shot at making it, or he could pursue another path. It was a wake up call for him, and a lesson he has relied on ever since. To this day if he decides to go for something he is all in on it.\n\nA.J. explains a bit more about his basketball days as well as another valuable lesson he's learned: how to stand on the shoulders of giants. There's a right way and a wrong to go about it. The first thing to know is to give first. Give to the other person without expectation of receiving anything.\n\nIf you don't know what they need you can proactively ask what they're working on and then find a way to help them. Or if you don't have anything to help them with simply be their friend. Talk to them about what they love outside of the business world, find out via social media and chat with them. Not everything is about business all the time.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tCan you be in business and be an amateur?\n\tWhat the progression of a rap artist teaches you about successful solopreneurship.\n\tWhy it isn't just about doing what you love, and what else you need.\n\tWhat is the Tim Ferriss method?\n\tIf you're doing a launch of anything how far in advance should you be planning?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nSpecifically if you are planning a launch of anything plan it at least a year in advance.\u00a0 Whether it's a book, a podcast, a product, etc. you'll want to find out who is most influential in that area. Then figure out how you're going to connect with them: can you go to events and actually meet them? That's the ideal scenario. Otherwise there's social media.\n\nIf you start with those two strategies in mind you'll be laying the foundation for a fruitful friendship. Start by giving to your influencers, creating friendships and a connection based on value rather than your needs. Then when you do actually launch you'll be in a stronger position to ask them for help.\n\nAnd be sure to ask for their input and their guidance before you release your new product, include them in the process. If they really are so valuable to you because of their knowledge show them - ask for their help and then listen to what they offer you.\n\nA.J. has applied those strategies and found success throughout his career. In his early days he started running gyms and then joined a consulting firm in the fitness space. Together they built up many successful companies; they wanted to parlay that success into franchising but A.J. did not. So he left to go into the internet marketing space.\n\nHe was familiar with it because they had used IM teachings to help their clients' businesses grow. A.J. wanted to see the same kind of financial results he was hearing about in the IM world and jumped in with both feet. He built and become a partner in an 8-figure software company, but left his partnership behind to go back to his true passion: health and fitness.\n\nToday A.J. has his hands in a few honeypots! With his ultimate aim being to eliminate obesity A.J.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/360.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["A.J.

Have you wondered what's the best way to take your idea and make it into a viable product? Our returning guest for episode 359, Mr. Stephen Key, can help you.\n\nStephen is an inventor extraordinaire as well as an author and a speaker. He rejoins The Solopreneur Hour to talk about what he's been up to since his previous visit a year ago, what he revised in his book One Simple Idea and what he's learned about the world inventions in his nearly 40 years as a solopreneur.\nMore About Stephen Key\nIf you missed Stephen's previous visit to The Solopreneur Hour find him here on episode 201. We dug into his backstory and how he's become the inventor and patent expert he is today.\n\nOn this episode Stephen and I spend a bit of time talking about one of the three pillars of freedom: time freedom. There's a lot of discussion about being a solopreneur to create the income you want, not what is dictated to you.\n\nBut sometimes we overlook how important and healthy it is for each of us to have time freedom. Whether it's taking a few weeks to spend with your loved ones for the holidays or going off with your family for 6 months like Stephen has done, that time freedom is truly priceless. And it's a gift many solopreneurs overlook because they aren't making six figures yet.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy he likes knocking on doors.\n\tWhy you need more than just money to get your idea off the ground.\n\tWhy you don't need to reinvent the wheel with your idea.\n\tHow can you do a focus group without actually doing a focus group?\n\tWhat is the best protection for a product in the marketplace today?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nTime freedom and flexibility is something Stephen treasures, as is the knowledge he's gained in his nearly 40 years as a solopreneur. He's learned so many lessons like walking away from an idea or a project, and working smarter rather than harder.\n\nWe discuss those lessons, as well as what's changed in the world of ideas and why Stephen revised his book, One Simple Idea. In the past pitching your idea meant creating a one page sell sheet, but today it means making a one minute video.\n\nIt also means using crowdfunding and social media to test your idea, get proof of concept and connect with companies who would be willing to license it from you. Crowdfunding is so powerful because people speak with their wallets, before you put your product on the shelves. If your pitch is strong enough and the idea resonates with enough people you can get your idea funded.\n\nAnd if you have proper funding and a strong online audience companies will take notice; they will want to license your concept. Stephen gives the great example of the Woof Washer 360.\n\nWoof Washer 360 was an idea that all the big companies turned down. The inventor came to Stephen and his team who suggested he take it to social media and crowdfunding. A video was made, garnered 70 million views and a big licensing deal followed!\n\nOn this episode Stephen answers the question of what he'd today if he were starting over with nothing, and what he'd have to show for his efforts after a month. It's an interesting scenario and what he says in response will teach you a lot about the solopreneur hustle. We've got all of that and more on episode 359 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What is the next thing you're going to do to get your idea made?

She moved back to California for a years until her parents officially divorced when she was 10. By the time she was 16 she had been enrolled in 9 different schools!\n\nOut of that experience she learned how to develop authentic rapport quickly with genuine people. Today it is one of her innate talents and has led to working relationships with incredible people like Sir James Dyson (before he was knighted), Sir Bob Geldof, and later internet marketing greats like Yanik Silver and Jayson Gaynard.\n\nDuring our chat we dive into how she met these people, and why it was about showing up and putting herself in the right place at the right time with a true commitment to be there for other people.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat does it take to put on a boxing match?\n\tWhat was the one thing she said she'd never do in her career?\n\tWhy showing up in life is more than half the battle.\n\tHow did she meet Sir Richard Branson on Nekker Island?\n\tWhat are some of the worst limiting beliefs?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nFrom her PR boxing career to working with Sir James to present day Shaa has always believed showing up is the most important key to being successful in work and in life. She interviewed a then-boxing star in the UK for an article for Cosmoplitan magazine and he liked her so much he asked her to work for him. Without hesitation she said yes and knew she had been given an incredible opportunity.\n\nShe worked very hard to prove him right and show her appreciation for the doors he had opened for her, and that work led to an introduction to Sir James Dyson. Working with Sir James was an experience she calls priceless! She says no MBA in the world could compare to what she learned from him.\n\nHer next evolution was working with Sir Bob Geldof on an internet travel site before the dot-com bust. They sold the business and got out before the bubble burst, but again that experience was incredibly enriching for her.\n\nSir Bob helped her set up a social network for teenage girls called My Kind of Place. She exited too early she says, but again learned valuable lessons by jumping in and saying yes to opportunity. In fact she was so grateful for all the opportunities she had been given she started Smarta, which has now become the largest site in the UK for entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n\nBeing the entrepreneurial maven she is Shaa didn't stop there. She wrote her first book, Stop Talking, Start Doing and loved the creation process. And she was very successful with it: it was the top-selling business book in the UK for 14 months straight. It broke every record.\n\nBut she didn't take her writing seriously; she thought it was just a hobby, and not something that she could make a real living doing. While on holiday with her best friend in Portugal they received a copy of her second book's final version and cover art. When her friend saw how Shaa lit up about the book she asked her why she wasn't doing this full-time. And Shaa, without thinking, replied that creatives can't make a real living!\n\nShaa saw the limiting belief that had been holding her back in that instance, and she took action. Within 10 minutes she had emailed her board of directors at Smarta and had gave them her notice of resignation. She began burning all the bridges and ties that were stopping her from pursuing her love of content creation, and she hasn't looked back since!", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/357.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1450067121, "title": "356: Recording Artist Jennifer Paige on Kickstarter Campaigns and going Indy", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today's show, episode 356 of The Solopreneur Hour, is with pop music sensation Jennifer Paige. \u00a0You'll remember her from episode 87, and from her hit song \"Crush\" which you've sung-along to 560 times.\n\nJennifer is running a Kickstarter campaign to finance her new album so we talk about that as well as what it's like to go from a label-signed musical artist, and the pros and cons of doing it yourself.\n\nYou'll hear that\u00a0 and her new single, Let Me Love You, at the end of this edition of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About Jennifer Paige\nJenn is always a delightful guest, and her episode today is a really fascinating inside look at the music industry. She's done it all: she's created multiple albums with big record labels and has made music with an indie label as well. And now she's branching out into completely new territory for her: funding her latest album via Kickstarter and then branding, producing and marketing it all on her own.\n\nThe idea of a Kickstarter campaign or any other type of crowdfunding for this album came from her manager. Her manager had worked with a crowdfunding team on another artist's album and the experience was so positive he recommended them to Jenn. She's always willing to try new things and take on new challenges so she said yes, even though she had no idea what to expect!\n\nThe team recommended she come up with a bunch of rewards to offer to contributors, and Jennifer brainstormed by considering things she'd like to do if she were someone giving money. A few of her ideas were a private acoustic concert, a sunset cruise, a girls' day out in Nashville, etc.\n\nHer only struggle with doing the campaign was feeling like she was asking for handouts. She wanted people to feel like they were a part of the process and were getting a unique experience they couldn't get elsewhere, so all of her rewards have been created with that in mind. And she's also going to be filming the actual creation of the album so people can get a true insider's view!\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's it like to go from a major record label to being a completely independent artist?\n\tIs there a difference between session musicians and road musicians?\n\tIf she could only take one artist's collection with her to a deserted island who would it be?\n\tHow did she get comfortable being in the spotlight?\n\tWhat does success look like now vs 15 years ago for her?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nOn today's episode she talks about what she's learned from her Kickstarter campaign, what motherhood is like with her new baby Stella, how she works with studio musicians, and the inevitable need to write and produce music when it's in your blood.\n\nThe campaign has taught her to face fears of the unknown, she says the artists who succeed today and in the future will be those who embrace change and are resourceful. She's proven herself to be both!\n\nAnd motherhood has also taught her many things including how much she can actually accomplish in a day! Her day revolves around her 1-year old daughter's needs now and she prioritizes accordingly.\n\nWith the birth of her daughter and her latest Kickstarter campaign Jenn has embraced changed and has been hustling again! She's never stopped learning and growing, which is why she's been so successful as an artist. Episode 356 of The Solopreneur Hour is a great lesson in change, growth and challenges. Tune in to hear it all and to hear Jenn's latest single Let Me Love You. \n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What insights did you gain from Jennifer's episode that you can act on right now?

The engagement we get now will go down unless you pay to promote that post.\n\nKinch Reindl\nQ: What Facebook page type do you recommend for podcasters? The entertainment category would seem like the logical place since it has options like 'radio station' but they don't have 'podcast' in there.\n\nA: Good question. I put Entertainer on mine, I don't know all the different types. I think you have to go with the content of your show. If your show is about auto racing then sports figure would be appropriate. Go with the overall content of your show, that's probably the move.\n\nBrad Brown\nQ: Hey Michael, if you were launching a new podcast right now, with no existing audience or brand to leverage off of, what would you be aiming for from a numbers/downloads perspective?\n\nA: I think the litmus test is at least 500 downloads a day then you could call it a reasonable success. The watermark of very successful is 1,000 downloads a day; if you're getting 30k-60k downloads a month that's a pretty good draw and you can monetize that show. My bar for sponsorship is 2,000 a day.\n\nThat's not to say you can't have a podcast if you only get 200 a day but that switches it from a business model or moneymaker to a hobby, but that also depends on your strategy. Dr. Mark has a big upsell strategy: if he brings someone into his licensing program it's worth $15k or more! So he has a platform that helps, so it depends on your business strategy and your niche.\n\nScott W. Mulvaney\nQ: Have you put your mic and audio kit recommendations back up online yet? You've definitely already been through the beginner gauntlet so being able to research the different package themes you've put together is valuable.\n\nP.S. For YouTube video content do you recommend going to the zoom level over a basic AT lapel mic jacked through an iPhone for selfie or iPad stand recording?\n\nA: It's not me, I didn't pull them. BSW did. When they revamped their stuff 5 months ago they pulled all their kits down. I did reach out to them the other day and asked where it stands with them, hopefully they are back online.\n\nI'm curious about you the listener: what is your favorite USB interface? I have a Beringer that isn't great so it's the one piece I'm upgrading.\n\nTo answer your question about the YouTube video content I have the new Sennheiser clip mic digital. It has the real Sennheiser ME 2 microphone capsule, and it's great for video. If you're doing high end recordings with a DSLR then I love the Zoom H6, their shotgun microphone is rad.\n\nNiel Reichl\nQ: I have just made my first $10 through the podcast Ultimate Guide to the Filipina through a PayPal donate button on my site!!!

The good news is it can be learned and today's episode is a point by point guide to doing so! There are nine points in total, but they're easy to remember and I've included suggestions on how to implement all of them.\n\n1. How to Connect When You First Meet Someone.\nThere's a lot that happens in the first few seconds of meeting someone and you can do plenty to make a good first impression. Be sure to smile and look them in the eye while you shake their hand. Also concentrate on remembering their name. To really embed it in your mind you can shake their hand, look them in the eye and say: \"John it's really nice to meet you John.\" Now you've said their name twice so you remember it, and you've made eye contact with a smile to let them know you are friendly. All of which will go a long way to making a good first impression.\n\n2. If You Want Others to Like You Don't Criticize Them.\nThis may seem like a no-brainer but just notice the next time you're talking to someone, and catch yourself if you're about to critic them in some way. To really take this step to a whole new level try going a month without complaining or criticizing, and see how different you are at the end of that month.\n\n3. If You Want People to Gladly Do You Favors Show Your Appreciation Frequently.\nShow your appreciation when someone does something for you, whether it's answer a question you asked or let you crash on their couch for a night. Go out of your way to show your thanks and gratitude by sending them a thank you note, some flowers or buying them a drink or dinner. You'll be amazed at how much more willing people are to do things for you when you practice showing appreciation.\n\n4. Be Interested, Not Interesting.\nThis also goes a long way towards helping you connect like a pro to make friends and influence people. Learn to ask questions, not be the center of the questions. Not sure what to talk about? Use the FORM method: F for family, O for occupation, R for recreation, M for motivation. Those are all things about themselves that people love to talk about.\n\n5. Show Appreciation For Others by Talking About What's Important to Them.\nThe bottom line is people like people who are like themselves, find out what the other person likes and use your body language to mimic them so they'll open up to you and share that information. Once you strike on a topic that you can see matters to them ask more questions: if it's their kids ask how old they are, what activities their kids like to do, etc.\n\n6. Remember Someone's Name.\nThere's a trick I learned when I moved to new cities: when I go somewhere like a networking event, a restaurant or a bar I'll learn the waitress' name or the bartender's name and I strike up a conversation with them. Later I'll open my Evernote and make a note of who they are and where they work so the next time I come in I'll check that note and remind myself of that person. I make sure to tip them well if it's a service industry person and learn things about them.\n\n7. Avoid All Arguments That Can't Be Won.\nThis is a lesson many people on social media need to learn in today's climate. Posting political or other ideological posts on Facebook does nothing to persuade others, only to alienate people. As solopreneurs we don't want to alienate people because we disagree on one topic (and we probably agree on countless others); we want to include as many people in our tribe as possib...", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/354.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Life Coaching", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1449510423, "title": "353: The Secrets of a Music Pop Star with Jennifer Paige (encore)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "When you were a kid, did you ever sing-along to the radio and dream of being a pop star?

All of that and more coming right up!\nMore About This Show\nBrad Brown\nQ: Hey Michael O'Neal! Hope you're doing well mate. I wanted to bounce something off you and the rest of the soloists here. I popped a question to you for one of your Q&amp;A shows a month or so ago about a side project I've been working on. The good news the website and podcast officially went live today. I would love some feedback. You can check it out here.\n\nI also have a webinar scheduled with one of the best triathletes in the world on Friday. So far, we have over 450 people registered for it so super stoked about that.\n\nI would also love to hear your thoughts on the podcast launch strategy I am thinking of:\n\nWeek one and two, 5 pods per week so 10 to start and launch with (done that already). From week three publish 3 a week. I have already submitted the podcast to Stitcher. I am thinking of waiting until January to submit the show to iTunes. Once submitted we will have about 20-25 shows already published and we will have a fairly decent sized list (1000) that we can email to ask for subscriptions, reviews etc.\n\nOnce we drop off new and noteworthy then up it to 5 a week so as to boost the download numbers and to keep us in the rankings.\n\nOr, just submit it to iTunes now and see what happens?\n\nA: Rad! Congrats on taking action, well done! It's a cool brand and a cool idea, I think you'll do great with it. The web site looks great, I took a look. And great on the webinar: you had an idea and took action to make it a reality.\n\nOn the podcast launch: you want to submit two hours of podcasts on day one. If your show is one hour you'd submit two, if it's 30 minutes then you'd submit four shows.\n\nI don't recommend doing 5 days a week and then dropping to three days a week. If you're normally going to be 3 days a week then start there. You want to give people something to download on your first day beyond your first episode. The testing done on this says 2 hours of content is the sweet spot.\n\nDave Hartman\nQ: I always forget my dang questions by the time Thursday comes around so I'll say this: The interview you did with Matt Farah of The Smoking Tire was one of the best you've done.\n\nAlthough I am a car guy I had never seen any of their work but am checking it out now. The part that I found most valuable was hearing a content creator's struggle to make money more efficiently across multiple channels and finding a way for it to work.\n\nToo often we hear from people making money online by teaching people how to make money online and Matt was a breath of fresh air. I would definitely enjoy hearing from similar guests in the future. Keep up the great work.\n\nA: Thanks Dave! Matt was great and I agree it was cool to hear how he made a tweak to change things. I loved hearing how he liked cars and made that into his daily work life. He shared how he changed his YouTube strategy to do a lot less, and make more money. It was a content creation hack and a big mindset shift that Matt talked about.\n\nThanks for your kind words Dave, much appreciated.\n\nShelby Kifer\nQ: You and Matt Farah talked super briefly about a video teaching some basics of performance driving. How about a few pointers?\n\nA: Wow that is a show in and of itself. I'll take you through a process. Grab a piece of paper and a Sharpie. Draw a circle about 5 inches wide. In the top of the circle put A for acceleration. Directly below the A put B for Braking. On the left side of the circle put L for L and on the right put R for right.\n\nSo your circle should look like a compass.

I always enjoy my chats with Joel: he's funny, innovative and insightful. We are sympatico in a lot of ways, meaning we share similar views on many topics.\n\nToday some of those topics like the guerrilla marketing he used for his kaching button and the latest iteration of the iFart app. One of his techniques is creative swag. And there are three things all creative swag should do according to Joel, and if your swag doesn't do these three it's not going to get you the results you're looking for.\n1. Does it (your swag) get attention?\nYou're trying to be memorable and stand out so your swag does need to grab people's attention. If it doesn't find something else that does.\n2. Will people use it?\nNow that you have people's attention will they actually use your swag? If they use it you're much more likely to be top of mind. If it just sits in a desk drawer somewhere likes hundreds of other swag stuff it's useless and you need new swag.\n3. Will people keep it?\nThis goes hand in hand with the first and second questions. People have paid attention to your swag, they've been using it but are they going to keep it? Most of us are so inundated with stuff, especially after a conference or event, that we toss most of the things we get. If your swag is memorable, something they use and enjoy they are more likely to keep it.\nAnother useful topic Joel dives into that is in tandem with using swag is making your business or your brand memorable. What good is swag - no matter how cool and fun and memorable it is - if your brand doesn't stick in people's minds? It's rubbish.\n\nSo to really make your brand memorable Joel has some advice: come from a place that is truly you. Be unique in a crowded marketplace, don't be afraid to take a risk and do what others aren't. You don't have to follow in someone else's successful footsteps to be successful. Just because a particular platform or approach worked for them doesn't mean it will work for you. And it certainly won't if you don't put your unique stamp on it.\n\nTelling the story that is you and your company is also advice he gives: you must tell a story that hasn't been told before. And if your story is uniquely you then it hasn't been told before. Why are stories so important? Because stories are shared.\n\nJoel says there is no such thing as viral marketing. there's only the organic retelling of stories and sharing of stories. That is what we refer to as \"viral marketing\". Don't try to be \"viral\" - simply tell your story, and touch people's hearts. When they resonate with who you are and what you're sharing your story will be spread by them.\n\nThose are just a few of the knowledge nuggets Joel gives on this episode! We also discuss his recent sabbatical during which he unplugged for 18 days and his high-level mastermind coming in 2016.

Everything I learned about podcasting I learned from Cliff's podcasting tutorial and the rest is history!\n\nCliff is a great-hearted dude, and recently, he's lost over 100 lbs! He's working hard and it's paying off. Find out more Cliff about here, and then dig into episode 350 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Cliff Ravenscraft\nBack home in sunny San Diego, I have a great chat with the podcast guru himself, Mr. Cliff Ravenscraft.\u00a0 Now, before you go thinking this is going to be all about creating a podcast think again! On this episode we talk about his transition, and how he manages to balance a family of 5, his workaholic tendencies, and his need to \u201cgive back\u201d.\n\nCliff was a successful insurance salesman in his parents' business when he got into podcasting. This was in 2005, the really early days of our industry! And he did it because he was passionate about getting his message to the world, and helping others in the process.\n\nHe has since launched multiple different podcasts but his first was called Generally Speaking. Originally his idea was to do 3 episodes a week, one about the TV show Lost, another about his faith and the third about technology (one of his lifelong passions). But by the second episode his fan base made it clear all they wanted was to hear about Lost. So that's what he gave them: a show about Lost.\n\nThrough a combination of hustle and timing Cliff's third episode brought him 17,000 subscribers! Even by today's standards that's a great start but back then it was phenomenal.\n\nSo he continued to work on podcasting and related projects over the next few years. Gradually he cut back on his insurance hours from 60 hours a week and 10-15 podcasting hours a week to 40 hours on insurance and 40 hours on podcasting. At that point he knew he had to leave the comforts of a 9-5 job and pursue podcasting.\n\nThat first year was rough: he made $11,000 and he was the sole breadwinner. Somehow they managed to make it through, his family of 5, and the following years improved.\n\nToday Cliff has multiple projects, multiple streams of income through his various businesses and he makes $25k or more on a monthly basis. His persistence was clearly worth it and Cliff says it was his passion that pulled him through.\n\nAnd that's why he advises to find what you're passionate about it (not necessarily a need in the marketplace) and follow that: passion is the thing that will get you through the tough times.\n\nWe also touched on a few other things on the show including a daily gratitude ritual I learned from David Wood of The Kick-Ass Life that Cliff is going to do with his family, and you can do too. It goes like this:\n\nWhoever is sitting at the dinner table has to do this:\n\n\tName 2 things you\u2019re grateful for from that day.\n\tName 1 thing you were good at today.\n\tName 1 thing you\u2019re looking forward to.\n\nDavid and his family do that every single day, and it\u2019s such a great way to stay connected to the important things. It's a valuable ritual to bring more gratitude into your life, and one of the many pearls of wisdom you'll hear on episode 350 of The Solopreneur Hour!\nThanks Cliff!\nLet Cliff know he knocked it out of the park by clicking this link and sending a tweet!\n\nRemember...your passion is that thing that you can talk about for hours.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to cash in on your passion!\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY:\u00a0What two things are you grateful for, what one thing were good at today and what are you looking forward to?

That was the case for today\u2019s guest, Matt Farah of The Smoking Tire.\n\nOn episode 348 of The Solopreneur Hour Matt talks with us about his very early love of cars, and how he parlayed that into a successful career as an automotive journalist and the origins of The Smoking Tire.\nMore About Matt Farah and The Smoking Tire\nMatt\u2019s grandma jokes that he could identify different cars by their wheels at the age of 2! By the age of 5 Matt\u2019s dad had given him an edition of Car & Driver, and Matt was enthralled. Although the cover was that of the latest Corvette it was the spread on the Delorean that really peaked Matt\u2019s interest.\n\nWhen his family moved from New Jersey to Atlanta they settled about a block away from an exotic car dealership called Formula 1 Imports. Matt\u2019s mom took him there on a weekly basis and he struck up a friendship with the dealer. Matt made such an impression on the dealer that he, the dealer, called Matt when they got new cars in the show room.\n\nAlthough Matt didn\u2019t love one brand of car over any other that passion continued in high school. He and his friends all owned Mustangs and would spend their time customizing their cars. His friends went drag racing, so Matt followed suit.\n\nBut the automotive industry as a career path didn\u2019t open up for him til about 6 months after college. Matt had majored in photography, a degree that was obsolete nearly the minute he graduated because the first real professional digital camera hit the market then. All those countless hours in the dark room were rendered useless.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow much did they make on All Cars Go to Heaven in the first 60 days?\n\tWhat is on his car bucket list?\n\tWhat impact did Top Gear have on the automotive journalism world?\n\tWhat is his Million Mile Lexus project?\n\tWho should go into automotive journalism?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nBecause he couldn\u2019t get work as a photographer Matt took a job with a creative branding agency in New York City. His day to day life consisted of rebrands for big companies and redesigning their labels.\n\nWithin six months he was fed up with monotony. He asked himself what he really wanted to do - what could he spend his days doing that wouldn\u2019t make him want to kill himself?!\n\nHis answer: cars. He could talk about cars all day long, and that\u2019s when Matt decided to work in the car world. He started off working at a car dealership just being an errand boy, washing cars and being an assistant for the sales people. Then he went to an exotic car dealer and discovered the myth, the legends and the reality of exotic cars.\n\nWhile working there he met Larry, a man who is now Bugatti\u2019s detailer. Together they decided to open their own detailing shop for exotic cars. Soon they were washing and detailing cars for all the local exotic car owners, and they realized these guys only drove their cars to the shop for detailing but nowhere else. Matt and Larry put their heads togehter and came up with an idea: they would start a car club where all the members would meet once a week and drive together for the day. The New York Car Club was born.\n\nAs the club evolved, Matt had the idea to shoot videos of their drives. One day someone suggested to Matt that he mic up and host the videos. So he did. He told some jokes, and interviewed some of the guys driving.\n\nLiterally one week later Matt had a call with a job offer to join a guy\u2019s YouTube network of car shows as the host. \u00a0Matt sold his half of the car detailing business and took the job.\n\nFor the next two years Matt was the host. But when the market tanked in late 2008/early 2009 so did the company that was paying him and Matt had to look elsewhere. So he and his friend Tom - the man who had originally suggested he host the car club videos - moved to LA and started The Smoking Tire.\n\nIt took another two years before TST showed any profit,", "duration": "1:10:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/348.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Matt Farah", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Video Marketing"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1448060563, "title": "347: 10 Ways to Stay Healthy While Working HARD, with Melissa Ramos", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As solopeneurs one of the keys to our success is our health. We've talked about this subject a few times because without health and vitality solopreneurship is an even more difficult path.\n\nJoining us to share her expertise is Melissa Ramos of Sexy Food Therapy.\n\nShe's a certified nutritionist with a background in Chinese medicine and is a regular on The Social, Canadian television's version of The View.\n\nOn today's show she shares the story of how she made the leap from an ad exec to a nutritionist, her 10 tips for staying healthy during a launch and plenty more on episode 347 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Sexy Food Therapy\nMelissa's career began in advertising, but a part of her always knew she should be doing her own thing. Her father is an entrepreneur and she inherited his spirit. It became crystal clear to her one day while sitting in a meeting talking about a mascot's foot for two hours.\n\nShe wondered why she was doing what she was doing, it felt meaningless and unfulfilling. She wanted to help people, and do something to make a difference. So she started taking nutrition classes part-time and eventually went full-time til she completed her certification as a nutritionist.\n\nNext she wanted to study Chinese medicine. Melissa took the proceeds from the recent sale of her home and paid for the schooling; it was incredibly expensive, but worth every penny for her.\n\nShe loved both paths of healing and wanted to make them accessible, engaging and still fun for people. From that love and that intention she formed Sexy Food Therapy. At the beginning she was doing it all herself as most solopreneurs do!\n\nBut it was a kick in the proverbial pants from Chris Ducker that helped her outsource her video editing, and eventually she hired a general VA and then a second VA. Today she's able to focus on helping more people through programs and memberships, and having her team support her in those efforts.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat did she know about online marketing from her time in advertising?\n\tWhy did she opt to use a private Facebook group as part of her membership program?\n\tHow she set her price point for her latest program.\n\tWho gave her the kick in the pants she needed to start outsourcing?\n\tWhat is ashwaganda and why should you care?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOn this show we talk about her latest launch, Sexy Lady Balls, and what she did when things went wrong during that launch as well as who she has been influenced by and how she started from ground zero in online marketing.\n\nOne of the greatest lessons she's learned during all of her solopreneur trials has been how to take care of herself, and this is especially true during a launch. Her 10 tips are listed below:\n\n1. Outsource.\nYou are not superwoman or superman! Get Chris Ducker's book if you need elp on figuring out what to outsource but be sure to get help. You can start small. She started with a video editor, gave him a template to follow for editing and it made a big difference.\n\n\n2. Drink energizing chocolate milk.\nThings like coffee and Red Bull and other energy drinks will drain your adrenal glands. And without adrenal glands your health drastically suffers.\n\nSo instead of those drinks try Melissa's chocolate milk recipe:\nTake an unsweetened nut milk like almond milk or coconut milk (no soy milk).\nThen add cacao powder and maca powder.\nThrow in a dash of cayenne pepper and some cinnamon.\nNext add 2 teaspoons of coconut oil\nAdd sweetener and pinch of sea salt.\nMix it all together in a blender and you have healthy chocolate milk that is delicious and energizing.\n\n3. Go easy on the alcohol.\nMelissa is not against alcohol by any stretch but she does recommend not using it as a stress-relieving crutch. She suggests no more than 4 servings a week.\n\n4. Take your adrenal and immune support.\nWhether it's in pill form or as a tincture look for supplements with licorice or ashwaganda, holy basil,", "duration": "1:14:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/347.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Fitness & Health", "Health", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Melissa Ramos", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Woman"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1448040820, "title": "346: Fan Mail Friday!", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey y'all. \u00a0Here's another episode of fan mail Friday, for you lovely solopreneurs!

Undoubtedly the death of my beloved Dexter was the hardest thing I've done while going through this process. It's thrown me for a major, major loop. What gets you going again is the pure love of what you do.\n\n@GHART\nQ: What do you think about Gary V's viewpoint that were in a bubble of entrepreneurs.\n\nA: I believe that wholeheartedly. Last year was the podcasting bubble. I think you can't just say you're an entrepreneur, you have to be doing something that is entrepreneurial and have that time freedom. Being on your own and being your own business counts.\n\nAnd if you're going to be a coach you have to have something you're good at. You can't just you're an Instagram expert and have 411 followers. Don't be a Kardashian in the online business world, focus on a skill, be good at it and then teach it. Before that you're not an expert, you are a wannabe and shouldn't be coaching others.\n\nThom Singer\nQ: How do you climb to next level when you are booming along - but stretched thin as a solopreneur.\n\nA: I would say that's the perfect occasion to find someone to outsource to, it's the perfect time to start working on the business and not IN the business. When you have more money than time so find a VA to help you. Read Chris Ducker's book Virtual Freedom and do James Schramko's sticky note process (which you can hear on this show).\n\nJeremiah Johnson\nQ: Hi Michael,\n\nI'm a 34 year old classically-trained opera singer. After years of horrid financial choices (and racking up 200K in student loans) I'm trying to help other musicians make better choices. I've recently started a financial coaching business for musicians.\n\nI want to offer a product that is helpful, but not so expensive that musicians can't afford it. I'm less worried about me making money than I am about them being helped. Short of offering it for free what is the best pay structure? A Paetron (monthly) set up or just helping people at a reduced rate? Thanks!\n\nA: So Jeremiah there's a million things in this that are telling. Have you made good financial choices now and there's evidence you know how to be financially stable in the music industry? First and foremost. You can't coach people on this until you've done that.\n\nSecond: you are putting your own financial outlook on someone else. You're assuming they can't afford what you're trying to offer.\n\nI've did this too when I started with my network marketing company Isagenix. I could only afford the 9-day program so I assumed that's all other people could afford. Once I changed my mind and made that shift all I sold was the bigger program and that's all that I did. My business grew exponentially!\n\nSo there's a mindset shift that needs to be accomplished in your own psyche Jeremiah. The idea of them wanting to donate when you don't have a real brand it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. The way you could swing this would be to share your journey with people if you haven't yet accomplished a better financial situation for yourself. And if you have figured it out break down the processes you've done and then be fair about it. Instead of doing a single product you can do a subscription model for $19.99 a month. And give them all the resources to go along with it.\n\nYou probably just need a tweak of how you implement this idea. Be careful about coming in at a reduced rate, it's also a reduced perception of value.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/346.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1447871661, "title": "345: Rad New Apps + Resources from MarrsMarketing.Com", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Solopreneurs! Our good friend Dawn Marrs (dot com) is back, and as per usual she doesn't disappoint with her new website Marrs Marketing, and a host of great new app and resource suggestions.\n\nToday's episode kicks off with a rousing discussion of the state of Facebook, the divisiveness of the country; we later move into the \"pseudo-coaching\" world, and then dig deep into great apps and resources.\n\nGet your evernote ready and enjoy episode 345 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About New Apps, Resources and Marrs Marketing\nIn case you're new to the lovely and talented Dawn Marrs or have somehow missed her previous visits have a listen here. You'll hear more about her background, what she does and how she's become so successful in the online marketing space.\n\nAnd that's one of the topics of discussion today: the online marketing space and the slew of marketers out there branding themselves as coaches, freedom entrepreneurs and lifestyle designers. Every time you turn on your Facebook newsfeed or open your email there's another person pitching another product, coaching session or some other offering.\n\nThat's not the issue we talk about though, we talk about the problem of newbie marketers branding themselves as experts on everything - when they haven't done the work to back it.\n\nThe next time you consider hiring a coach or buying a product from someone be sure to find out what the back story is. Has this person actually done a successful product launch that you'd like to do? Or have they just read some books and are now going to have you pay them to teach you what they've read?\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow do you know if someone is an expert, or just a wannabe?\n\tWhen should you become a coach?\n\tWhat tool does Dawn use for her membership sites?\n\tSimple suggestions to stop your site from being hacked.\n\tHow does Dawn stay current on the latest technology?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nObviously we all have to read and learn in order to do anything, but the point Dawn and I make on this show is to have the results to show. Coaching is important and something we wholeheartedly support, but coach with someone who has the results you want.\n\nAnother topic today is Dawn's latest and greatest apps and resources! Every time Dawn is here she shares another (or several) noteworthy app and/or resource, and today is no exception.\n\nShe's super excited about ClickFunnels. What the company is doing is worth checking out because they combine beautiful landing pages with checkout pages and with webinars. If you're selling your own product or service you need a checkout page, and you need one that integrates with PayPal or Stripe or your preferred payment source.\n\nWith ClickFunnels you can also set up easy-to-use funnels to run your webinars, and that's another beneficial asset to have when you're making your products and services of your own available to the world.\n\nWe also talk about Clef (an app I recommend that Dawn has never heard of!), WordFence, ManageWP and RoboForm: all of which help prevent hacks to your websites and your other online accounts like email and Skype.\n\nFinally we wrap up with a chat about Apple TV 4 and whether gaming is a waste of time or simply a way to unwind and de-stress from a hectic day.

Keep that in mind as you listen to episode 344!\nMore About Passing On Your Legacy\nWhen my brother was here recently I asked him if he ever remembered our dad having a \"teaching moment\" and showing how to do something. I asked because my childhood memories mainly consisted of our dad being the CEO at home and at work, he was the breadwinner and Mom was the homemaker.\n\nHe wasn't the kind of dad who took us out to play a game of catch, and he didn't show us how he did so many things. My dad was the kind of guy who could put a new roof on, landscape the yard and fix anything around the house. He was very handy, but he never passed that on.\n\nConsequently I've taught myself many of the same things he knew how to do. And in the process when someone offers me suggestions on how to do those things I listen, whether or not I asked for their advice. I've found I'd rather over-explain and offer unsolicited advice to someone, than see them struggle.\n\nFor me that's a way of including that person when I offer them advice, and that's something my dad never did. It wasn't something most dads of the 80s did; he was definitely a product of his time.\n\nBut I think today we have an obligation to each other to teach what we know, and to include each other in our knowledge. We could go back to Native American cultures and take a cue from them. They had to pass everything down through teaching and sharing their knowledge. The only way anything was learned was by studying and listening to someone in the village who already had that knowledge. If it wasn't passed on it was lost when that person died.\n\nAnd we can do this in our daily lives through our activities. If I'm out with friends and I see someone sitting by themselves I'll strike up a conversation and offer to include them in our group. A majority of the time that solo person will join us and new conversations, new friendships and relationships happen as a result.\n\nI'd encourage you to do the same. And if you have kids be conscious of showing them things as they grow up and even into their teenage years. Share what you know with your kids, with people you work with and make passing on your legacy a conscious decision and a daily practice.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: How are you going to be passing on your legacy today?

Do you buy them and then transfer them over or buy and point them. Does it matter for SEO which of these are done? What's the detail in this bit of batter?\n\nA: I point them, it makes no difference in terms of SEO. When you're setting up your website use a temporary domain, change it when the website is all set up and ready.\n\nTODD\nQ: Maybe this could be a Friday's podcast question thing but I have a problem that no matter how much I read I can't seem to fix by myself. I have manifested some wonderful things in all parts of my life but business success. I don't know if it's a self-worth problem or what but I start things but never follow through.\n\nI tried different businesses of all kinds with the same results, procrastination and self sabotage. Anybody have some insight into this or a solution let me know, please!! Very hard to write this.\n\nA: Thank you for being vulnerable Todd. The best thing I can say is when it's 2am and you're still doing something you know you're on the right track. If that's not the case then maybe you haven't found your \"it\". It's easier said than done I know, but it's important to work backwards from the things you're passionate about to how to make it work.\n\nWhat do you want your life to look like? Every month at the beginning of the month write down your goals for that month. Put them on SoloLab and share them, so it's out there in the world.\n\nAlso write a letter to your past self from your future self, then mail it to yourself. There's something to the power of intention and putting it out there. If you're really passionate about what you're doing and putting yourself out there enough you'll be successful at it.\n\nRYAN AYRES\nQ: Aweber or Infusionsoft?\n\nA: These are both mailing list tools, CRMs, and each are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. Aweber is on one end and is fairly simple, while Infusionsoft is very complicated and more expensive. Aweber is fine if you're starting out, I used it and then graduate to ConvertKit. Check out Nathan's episode on the show where we talk about it. It's a good middle ground and I use it, I like it.\n\nCABVINE\nQ: What would you advise to combat bright shiny object syndrome?\n\nA: I'm the king of it. That will never, ever, ever go away! You will continue to have ideas until you're dead, it's how your brain functions. The difference is this: the successful people are very confident those opportunities will continue to come. You know you'll have more cool ideas so you know to see this one through until it's humming along, and then you can move on to the next one.\n\nJIM GEPPERTH\nQ: What one thing did you do for your business that had the most positive result?\n\nA: By far and away I paid very little attention to what was going on - on purpose I didn't do what they were doing. I started this because there were no conversational entrepreneurship shows out there. This is heavier lifting than other types of podcasts, there was a space for it. So having my own voice and being different in a sea of same was the #1 thing I did for my business.\n\nRYAN AYRES\nQ: 1-10. What's the level of podcast opportunity even with decent saturation for biz shows?\n\nA: Good question, I don't know what it would be like if I launched this show today. It's important you find what you love and do something different with it.

He wants to know how they do what they do, and what led them there and what drives them forward.\n\nOn Today's Show You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's the link between curiosity and creativity?\n\tWhen did Sam get serious about photography?\n\tWhat's the main goal Sam has for Off Camera with Sam Jones right now?\n\tWhat is the key to being a great interviewer?\n\tWhat is one of the first things he does when he sits down with a guest?\n\tAnd much, much more.\n\nSam also believes a conversation is 90% chemistry, and every conversation is an opportunity to learn something new about the other person, about the world or about a particular subject. What would be different in your business or in any area of your life if you took that same approach to the people you speak with and interact with?\n\nWe also talk about working on spec and hustling to get a break. At one point Sam wanted to work as a photographer for magazines. He knew to land any gigs he'd have to get his portfolio in front of them, and his portfolio was massive. This was pre-Internet so he had to physically FedEx his slides and his slide projector to any directors he wanted to connect with.\n\nThat was far too inefficient so instead he went to NYC, took his portfolio with him and cold called art directors to set up appointments. Getting in front of those art directors and building relationships led to many more opportunities than simply mailing off his portfolio.\n\nSam hustled to land those opportunities and he also hustled when he caught other breaks in his career. Once Tim Robbins saw his photograph in a newspaper - Sam was an Associated Press (AP) photographer for several years - and Tim hired him to come on set and be the unit photographer. That meant Sam was responsible for taking still photographs during the filming of the movie.\n\nBeing hired by Tim led to a mini-career as a unit photographer and Sam took advantage of the hours of downtime on a set to ask the actors to pose for him. Sometimes he'd do it for free, sometimes he'd get paid and other times he'd fib and tell them the studio wanted more photos of them!\n\nPeople said yes, according to Sam, because he was genuinely interested in and respected the work the actors do. And being genuinely respectful, curious, and eager opened the door to working with these actors and to striking up real ...", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/342.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Artist", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1447087863, "title": "341: Taking A Leap of Faith with Magnus Walker (best of)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Our guest for the 341st episode of The Solopreneur Hour is the iconic Magnus Walker (find him on his blog here). Never heard of him? Don't worry you won't forget him after listening to this show.\n\nHe's spent his entire career zagging when everyone else was zigging, and is completely unapologetic for it. \u00a0Why should he be? He's built a tidy little empire, owns a dream loft, is deeply in love with his partner Karen, and has one of the most enviable Porsche collections in the world.\n\nHis career path has been forged in \"yes\", and \"let's try that\", never thinking of the repercussions. \u00a0This is a fascinating hour with fashion designer, movie set mogul, Porsche collector, and Tedx Speaker Magnus Walker. \u00a0Listen in and enjoy today's edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nMagnus Walker has led one heck of an interesting life. He was born and raised just north of Sheffield, England, an area that has brought us musicians such as Def Leppard, Human League and Arctic Monkeys (among others). Although it was and still is a musical hotbed, it is an economically depressed town. Magnus saw very little opportunity for himself there and quit school at the age of 15.\nHaving grown up on American television and other American influences he moved to the States in 1986 and has made it his home. At the time he was living in Los Angeles and started selling clothing on the boardwalk in Venice, a fairly common and lucrative practice back then. He made patchwork jeans and sold them to the hippie-wannabes, he made Dr. Seuss Cat In The Hat-style hats for the ravers and sold glam rock style pants to the Melrose Boulevard rockers.\n\nAll of those experiences led to Serious Clothing, a rebellion masquerading as a clothing company. The company reflected Magnus' personality and values, and because it was an authentic reflection of him people responded. The clothing company became a hit, being sold everywhere from Six Flags and other amusement parks to Melrose fashion boutiques. Serious' success cemented the foundation for his future endeavors.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tWhat's Magnus' favorite question to ask about an opportunity?\n\tAmerica's Next Top Model was shot at his home: true or false?\n\tHow big is the loft we recorded in?\n\tWhat put him on the Porsche map?\n\tWho did he flip his first clothing buy to and how much was it?\n\tAnd much, much more...\n\nAnd one of those future endeavors is the loft we recorded at today. In 2000 he and his wife Karen bought an enormous warehouse where they could live and work. Before they bought the loft they were renting in two separate places and were tired of it, it simply made sense to invest this loft and make it their home. So they did, a year later they had finished the remodel on it and moved in.\n\nWithin a few months of doing so they were featured in an LA Times article about downtown loft spaces and the revival of that area. They were given a prominent focus in the article, and their phone soon began ringing with requests to rent the place for filming. Doing what he has always done, Magnus said yes and they were in business. Their first experience of doing so was a little rough, but the cash they made showed he and Karen the opportunity and possibilities in being a filming location. So they altered some things in their next agreement and were in business!\n\nWithin the next year they made so much money it became a serious financial pillar for them, and with their interest in the clothing industry waning they stopped Serious Clothing and focused on being a movie/TV/commercial filming spot; it was a leap of faith but that's been Magnus nature all along. They moved into a loft nearby to live, keeping their first loft as their business space.\n\nThe location biz took off for them and they were happy to have made the leap. Not long after Magnus started a thread on a web site called Pelican Parts, a site that dubs itself the largest source for Porsche and BMW parts.", "duration": "1:15:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/341.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1446796020, "title": "340: Your Solopreneur Q&A", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hi Solopreneurs!\n\nWelcome to today's weekly Q&amp;A session of The Solopreneur Hour.

Til then sit back and enjoy this Q&amp;A edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show - Your Solopreneur Q&amp;A\n\nDAN BYERS\nQ: I use power point (slide decks) for presentations and I feel it's dated. Do you have any suggestions for newer presentation programs or apps that might be more user friendly and better-looking?\nA: 1. Who says you need a Powerpoint? Some studies have shown your listeners are more engaged when you don't have slides. So consider doing it without the slides.\n\nBut I'm using Keynote, the Mac version of Powerpoint. Find someone on Upwork or Fiverr who could dress it up for you. You can get motion video, music and videos. You can create your own and hand it to a designer with your brand info and ask them to make it interesting.\n\nKATHERINE BROWN\nQ: What book would inspire a 21-year old into solopreneurship?\nA: The Sexy Seven! Check the resources below or go to the Resources page and find the link.\n\nSAM WEEGMAN\nQ: What do you think of Soundcloud for podcasting?\nA: I haven't used it but I think it looks great. I think it's cool that you can see the waveform, I think the user face is very cool.\n\nHAPPY HOUR CONNECT\nQ: Do you ever share passwords?\nA: Sometimes I do. I have a strategy: when you're starting a new endeavor create a new Gmail account for each. Use that email account to sign up for everything related to that endeavor, then if you want to outsource you can give them access to that account.\n\nSometimes you have to share passwords so be super careful about what you're sharing and who has access to it.\n\nCRYSTALEE DENT\nQ: Do you use a VA?\nA: I don't. I have Lara who does the show notes for these episodes. And I have a new person I'm just starting to work with - he approached me - and we're figuring out how we're going to work together. He contacted me and offered to work for free for a week, and he did. The best move is to reach out to someone having already done the thing.\n\nSAM WEEGMAN\nQ: Have you been doing kettlebells?\nA: Yes! I have every morning. Since January -nearly every single day- I started doing my age in push-ups and got up to 50. I do that every day and I do kettlebell swings every day. I started with 20 and I'm up to 31 now, my plan is to get it up to 75. I'll have to be really fit to get there! If I can do 75 swings with a 55-pound kettlebell I'll be in good shape.\n\nRYAN GAMBOA\nQ: I'm trying to find a good investment. I just sold a few classic cars and am sitting on some cash.\nA: Good for you, that's a great thing to have! I think I'd go back and listen to 305, Jason Hartman was on. He's a real estate investor and I'd also listen to Cole Hatter on episode 280. He has a lot figured out in the real estate investment world and solopreneur world.\n\nBut you know I love vintage Porsches, I'd grab some 912s, early 911, 956s and maybe some Karmin Gaia. And then vintage Rolex, Heuer, Omega are all good watches to invest in.\n\nI suggest investing in things you know about, bottom line.\n\nTODD MIDDLEBROOKS\nQ: How do you feel about companies that restore and customize vintage vehicles vs self-restoration?\nA: I really enjoy the self-restoration, it's part of the journey and the challenge. You need ingenuity, skill. But although it's tedious it's not as complicated as it might seem. It's a lot of research - know the right message boards to go to and where to ask questions.\n\nI like doing things myself, but I love that there are restoration companies. There's a place near me in San Diego called Autobahn Interiors and people ship their cars to this place from all over the world to have them work on.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/340.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Fitness & Health", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Real Estate", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1446628487, "title": "339: Dream Business Academy, with Jim Palmer", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As a solopreneur how do you know when it's time to get a coach or even to become a coach yourself? And how do you know which coach to trust? Our friend and repeat co-host Jim Palmer is here to give us the answers.\n\nFor episode 339 of The Solopreneur Hour Jim dropped by to talk about how he became a coach, who needs a coach and how he knew he was ready to host his first live event.\nMore About This Show\nIf you missed Jim's previous visits to the show you can listen to them here. His back story is discussed at length on those shows, so today we skip that and dive deep into his knowledge of business, coaching and the importance of live events.\n\nSpecifically Jim shares what got him started as a business coach, who needs a coach and how to choose one, plus the approach he takes for creating live events for his audience.\n\nWhat peaked Jim's interest in coaching was the number of people who asked him how he had become so successful in his own businesses. When Jim started his solopreneur journey he faced numerous challenges, and overcame them to grow several businesses into multiple six-figures and beyond.\n\nPeople took notice and wanted to learn how he had achieved that level of success. Naturally Jim saw an opportunity there; he could reach more people and help others grow their businesses as he had if he became a coach. His \"Dream Business\" Mastermind and Coaching program was born.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat time freedom really means as a solopreneur.\n\n\tThe \"when I\" syndrome: are you suffering from it?\n\n\tWhere do his brilliant ideas happen? Hint: it's not his office!\n\n\tWhat is the only type of music he can listen to while writing?\n\n\tHow he wrote six books in six years.\n\n\tAnd more!\n\nAs his coaching business grew Jim considered hosting his own live events. It took his own coaches to help him have the courage to go for it.\n\nJim knew putting on events involved a lot of upfront costs: securing the hotel conference room, securing lodging for participants, hiring the caterer, etc. And that intimidated him. Doubts crept in: what if no one showed? What if he got on stage and forgot everything he'd ever learned and just blanked? What if the entire event was a bust?\n\nBy working with his personal coaches he overcame those fears. In fact he absolutely loved his first live event: he felt like he was doing exactly what he was meant to do. He loved it so much he continued to host those events and today he puts on two live events every year.\n\nOn the topic of who needs a coach and when Jim says everyone does. Anyone who is successful has a coach from professional athletes to millionaires and billionaires.\n\nJim recommends seeking a coach if you're stuck, just starting out or want to grow to the next level. If you have a particular talent or skill you can probably easily turn that into a business, but if you want that business to be very profitable you'll need help in certain areas where you don't have skills and that is when a coach becomes critical.\n\nAlso on episode 339 of The Solopreneur Hour we discuss the plethora of coaches out there today and how to choose someone who knows what they're doing as well as how to cultivate your most brilliant ideas.

Tune in for this very fun, candid and interesting edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show and Hines Ward\nFor those of you who don't know who Hines Ward is he's a Super Bowl MVP, a two-time Super Bowl champion, an Ironman athlete and a Dancing With The Stars season winner. He's also the founder of Helping Hands Foundation, a charity we talk about on this show.\n\nI've followed his career after he was drafted by the Steelers and have always been impressed by his tenacity, his commitment and his attitude on and off the field.\n\nToday we chat about what it was like to grow up as a biracial kid in Atlanta in the 1970s, how his mom showed him the meaning of persistence and dedication, why he started his foundation and how he's transitioned from being a premiere athlete to life post-NFL.\n\nHines was born in Seoul, Korea and lived there until he was a toddler. His mom is Korean and his dad is African-American. Back then interracial relationships were not accepted in Korea and were barely tolerated in the U.S. His mom was kicked out of her country and her family shunned her when she married Hines' dad and gave birth to Hines.\n\nSo his dad brought them to the US and they settled in Atlanta. Their marriage didn't last and Hines' mom became his primary caretaker. She worked multiple jobs to make sure he had the best life possible. They were seldom home together, but she always made sure to have food prepared for his meals and let him know how much she loved him. Hines knew she was working so hard for him, and that's a lesson he has carried with him throughout his life.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow he has proven haters wrong over and over again.\n\n\tHow did he land a spot on Dancing With The Stars?\n\n\tWhat's the worst part of playing in the NFL?\n\n\tThe connection between being a football player and being a solopreneur.\n\n\tHow he played without an ACL!\n\n\tAnd so much more.\n\n\nEven with his mother's love and support growing up biracial at that time in history was hard. Hines didn't fit in with either the black kids or the Korean kids, both sets of kids made fun of him. He struggled to find his identity, especially without his father around.\n\nBut that didn't stop him from dreaming big and going after those dreams. From early on Hines wanted to be a Super Bowl MVP; he would play football at recess and pretend to be whoever that year's MVP had been. He envisioned himself in that role, and worked tirelessly to be the best athlete he could be so one day he'd step into that role.\n\nHe also worked hard at school so he could go to college. Kids would make fun of him and call him an \"Uncle Tom\". Naysayers said a lot of things but Hines just ignored them and carried on being the best he could be.\n\nAnd it eventually paid off. He was drafted by the Steelers in the third round as a special teams guy. But by his fourth season he led the team in receptions - and he did so as the fourth man on the depth chart. That meant the team had 3 other guys ranked ahead of him in their receiving core. Hines proved he was a great asset to the team, and would continue to do so throughout his career.\n\nWhen he helped the team win a Super Bowl and was named MVP it was a dream come true for him. He was elated, and was not prepared for the whirlwind of attention it would bring from his home country of Korea.\n\nAs is his nature Hines found the positive in the situation. He visited orphanages and met with the biracial kids there. He heard their stories of helplessness and their contemplation of suicide.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/338.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Hines Ward", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1445884608, "title": "337: 10 Life Lessons I\u2019ve Learned in 44 Years (Plus 1 bonus!)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Happy birthday to meeeeeee! Solopreneurs thanks for being here today on my 44th birthday.\n\nOn last week's Q&amp;A I had a question last week pop up from a listener who wanted to know the \"three things I learned in 44 years\". It was such a great question I decided to extend it to 10 things and make a show out of it.\n\nSo, here are my 10 life lessons (plus a bonus!) on episode 337 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n1. Stuff does nothing, memories do everything.\nThe first of these 11 life lessons I've learned is this: the things I cherish the most from my life haven't been things, but the memories I've shared with my dear friends. And often those memories involve travel. As much as I like nice things, what I remember most have been the places I've gone and the experiences I've shared with people I hold most dear.\n\n\n2. Own a dog.\nLife lesson number 2 is courtesy of Dexter. Everything I've learned about loyalty and love I've learned from Dexter. Losing him has been 10 times worse than losing my parents. That being said I encourage everyone to own a dog. If you're on the fence about it just do it, it'll be more than worth it.\n\n3. Don't ditch your hobbies just because you're older.\nIf you sang, swam or danced when you were younger keep doing it - that's life lesson number 3. Don't stop doing things just because you have kids or have gotten older! Don't stop doing life just because you aren't a kid anymore.You have a choice to make your life great, keep your hobbies.\n\n4. Play an instrument.\nI don't know where I'd be today without drumming so that brings us to life lesson 4. It makes me feel better no matter what. If you used to play an instrument or have always wanted to play pick it up and play again, or start taking lessons.\n\n5. Make fitness and health an integral part of your health.\nLife lesson 5 is about health and fitness and well-being. If I hadn't found Isagenix years ago I don't know what kind of shape I'd be in today. It not only changed my physical well-being, it also changed my mental health. The people I became friends with changed who I am; I'm so grateful to Isagenix and the friends I made through that company.\n\n\n6. It's never too late to reinvent yourself.\nToo many people think life is over when they reach a certain age, that brings us to life lesson 6. At 37 I didn't know anything about internet marketing, solopreneurship, coaching, podcasting, network marketing, not any of those things when I started this journey. I learned all about it in the last 6 yrs! And I did so by saying yes first, even though I didn't know the \"how\". \n\nYou can too - say yes first and then figure out how. It isn't necessarily in our nature to approach life this way but you can strengthen that muscle by repeatedly saying yes and going for it.\n\n\n7. You can decide to be happy if you want to.\nLife lesson #7\u00a0 is we are 100% responsible for our own happiness. If you don't feel happy and you feel unfulfilled you can change those feelings. Whether you're going through a break up or losing a job or not launching your dream business yet you can decide to be happy despite all of that. You can choose to be happy regardless of your circumstances.\n\n8. Don't let society tell you what choices should be right and wrong.\nTake life lesson number 8 with a grain of salt; don't kill someone or covet your neighbor's wife. But whatever lifestyle you want to live go do that. If you want a certain marriage or relationship go do that; if you don't want to be married don't do it. \n\nBe the first person to dance, be the first to volunteer, just go out and be you! Society gets it mostly wrong so why follow it? You do you!\n\n\n9. Follow your own path but model others' habits.\nLife lesson number 9 is important for solopreneurs especially. If I had started Solopreneur On Fire it would've done nothing. Why? Because I would've modeled the show, NOT the habits. John's habits are what has created his success, not his show,", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/337.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1445574508, "title": "336: Why I Am So Naughty, and The Q&A Periscope Simulcast", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hi Unemployables!

I'd love to see you in the group, find out more about what you're working on and how I can help you.\n\nWhether or not you chimed in this week with a question I know you'll get something from today's show so sit back, relax and enjoy this edition of The Solopreneur Hour podcast.\nMore About This Show\nWe've got a bunch of questions from our Periscope session (follow me on Twitter to see more broadcasts and participate) so let's dive on in.\n\nQ: What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0best\u00a0song\u00a0to\u00a0listen\u00a0to\u00a0with\u00a0your\u00a0stereo?\nA: Right now When Hell Freezes Over by The Eagles on the Hotel California album is my favorite song to play on my stereo right now.\n\nQ: I\u00a0just\u00a0started\u00a0my podcast. What is one of the best ways to grow and gain listeners?\nA: If you're within the 8 week period of New & Noteworthy now is the time to really grow your audience and rock. Do ceaseless and endless promotion. Go to Ritetag.com and get 6 relevant hashtags for each episode and Tweet every single one of them when they're released. Putting the names of other people your audience listens to (like Pat Flynn, Joe Rogan, etc) and your show sounds like is another way to be found.\n\nQ: Jimmy\u00a0Chamberlain\u00a0or\u00a0Dave\u00a0Grohl?\nA: For me it's Jimmy Chamberlain, I think his stuff is really interesting and Dave is more of a basher.\n\nQ: What\u00a0are\u00a0your\u00a0top\u00a03\u00a0lessons\u00a0from\u00a0your\u00a044\u00a0years?\nA: I'm going to make that Monday's show! Monday is my birthday. I won't answer your question now, come back on Monday and listen in.\n\nQ: Best\u00a0practices\u00a0to\u00a0grow\u00a0a\u00a0great\u00a0coaching\u00a0business?\nA: Coach what you know. You can't coach on things you have no idea about. Gary V at Thrive was talking about the surge of people out there calling themselves coaches but don't know anything about what they're coaching on! You don't have to be an expert to be a coach but you have to KNOW something about it. However you can coach people if you know more than the average person.\n\n@RyanAyres53\nQ: Best guests that have gone solo from big company experience? I'm currently at Microsoft. \nA: For those of you at a 9 to 5 and are miserable the jumping off point is to read my sexy seven. Read them in order, you can get them here. Listen to Rick Mulready, Vasavi Kumar and Dan Martell are all great examples. And every episode is dedicated to just that: how to leave your job and be a solopreneur so listen to them all!\n\nQ: When\u00a0posting\u00a0links\u00a0on Twitter, what's\u00a0best: short\u00a0(trackable)\u00a0or\u00a0longer\u00a0ones\u00a0that include the show\u00a0address?\nA: I like the short ones because there needs to be room for hashtags. So I do compelling title, short URL and 6 hashtags.\n\nQ: Did\u00a0you\u00a0know the drummer\u00a0from\u00a0Kiss,\u00a0Eric\u00a0Singer,\u00a0is\u00a0huge\u00a0watch\u00a0guy? What is the best watch under $200?\nA: I didn't know that about Eric Singer. As far as watches I'd say Melbourne Watch Company, a great automatic Melbourne for under a grand. Another one I like but haven't bought yet is Autodromo.\n\n@DavidAaronJohns\nQ: On\u00a0Facebook\u00a0ads\u00a0how\u00a0granular\u00a0should\u00a0you\u00a0get\u00a0with\u00a0your\u00a0target\u00a0audience?\nA: Pretty damn! It depends on the product itself but the closer you can get to your avatar the better. That's the bottom line.\n\n@thetruechallenge\nQ: Do\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0fitness\u00a0goal\u00a0for\u00a044?\nA: Yes I'm sleeping poorly, drinking whiskey and eating poorly because Dexter is on his last legs. But I just ordered a 55-lb kettlebell and am going to start using that. I'm going to get back to Tim Ferriss' slow carb diet, playing racquetball again and using kettlebells twice a week with a cheat day on Sundays.\n\nQ: Does it annoy you when people ask for advice on your Q&amp;As but don't follow the advice?\nA: It's no skin off my back anymore,", "duration": "1:08:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/336.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Musicians", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1445413579, "title": "335: Back to The Future with Mike Michalowicz (Best of Episode 109)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Yea, I totally went there. Back to the Future style on October 21 2015.\nProfitability is the lifeline of your business as a solopreneur. Without profits, you really don\u2019t have much of a business. And many of us have little financial education so we don\u2019t know how to generate sustainable profits.\nTo resolve that issue for us is our guest for episode 109, Mike Michalowicz. Having built and sold two multi-million dollar business early in his career, Mike is a man we can all learn from. In this episode we talk comedy, finances and the joys of being a scrappy solopreneur.\nMore About This Show and Mike Michalowicz\n\nThroughout his career, Mike has almost always been an entrepreneur or solopreneur. However, he did hold two jobs in the past. He was so unemployable at that point that even though he stayed on as an employee after Robert Half International bought his company, he was fired from his role one year later!\nFollowing his natural inclinations as a solopreneur, Mike has explored a variety of media outlets. He created a TV show pilot, hosted news segments on MSNBC and also shared the stage as a keynote speaker with such notables as Guy Kawaski and Michael Gerber.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tExploiting your inner savant and how it\u2019ll help you find your niche.\n\tWhy business plans don\u2019t work.\n\tHis thoughts on how to get started in business with little or no money.\n\tWhy your lack of money in the early stages of your business is actually a GOOD thing.\n\tHis technique to becoming more profitable and how to apply it.\n\tWhy he doesn\u2019t mind when people copy him.\n\nOriginally I connected with Mike after I stumbled upon his web site, the copy was so cheeky and funny that I reached out to him; I wanted to know if he had written it himself. Indeed he had and after having him on the show, it was clear the copy merely reflects who Mike is as a person. It\u2019s what we like to call brand consistency and it\u2019s one of the keys to his success.\nIf you enjoyed hearing Mike on this show, send us a Tweet or leave a comment below about your favorite takeaway: maybe you scrapped your business plan or set up your bank accounts.

One such fellow solopreneur joins us today to share his story, Mr. Joel Boggess.\n\nOn episode 331 of the show Joel Boggess chats about an almost tragic fall at age 5 became a turning point in his life and his mindset.\n\nToday it has become motivation, and a gift he shares with the rest of the world through the Relaunch podcast (which you can find on iTunes 3 days a week)! Check it out on this edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Relaunching with Joel Boggess\nWhen Joel was just a young lad of 5 he and his dad went off on a hike with a few other fathers and sons. The kids trailed off and went exploring on their own, the fathers not far away. The boys all clamored up a hill nearby and saw a bridge at the top. Joel was an adventurous sort so he went over to check it out.\n\nHe walked about half across the bridge, set himself down on a track and hung his head over the side to wave at the fathers below. He then heard a train coming down the tracks on his right. What happened next is a mystery to him; he doesn't remember and for good reason.\n\nJoel landed at the bottom of the bridge, some 30 feet below. Miraculously he survived. The medical team took him to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible (this was 40+ years ago, before cell phones and GPS and the like). He had lost so much blood after he fell they were unable to put an IV in his arm.\n\nHe spent three weeks in a coma, had 3 skull fractures, had lost hearing in one ear and was unable to use his right side. When he regained consciousness he had to relearn the most basic of functions: his balance, walking, etc. But he was fortunate to be alive, and everyone knew it.\n\nJoel relearned and fought back; his parents enrolled him in karate a few years later to help him stand on his own two feet (literally and figuratively). He earned his way to a black belt, and found a natural affinity for the discipline and focus karate taught him. They would become his tools to rebuild and relaunch his life.\n\nLittle did he know then that relaunching would be the major theme for him. In fact he has gone through eight previous iterations of shows before landing on Relaunch as his brand, but it's safe to say he has found his thing with this one!\n\nOn today's episode with Joel we talk about the #1 issue he sees most people limited by, the 3 vital ingredients to relaunching any area of your life successfully and why he's so passionate about helping people become a more powerful version of themselves. Check it out on episode 331 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What did you learn from Joel and how are you going to apply it in your solopreneur journey?

You have some great advice. This question is for the Friday Question Day. I have a podcast that I love: Straight From the Horse's Mouth Radio Show.\n\nIt combines my two loves horses and art. I have conversations with some of the most interesting and creative people in the horse world. I talk with: authors,photographers, inventors, artists, vets anyone with a unique perspective of horses.\n\nMy problem is trying to get my show out there. I am in the outdoor category on iTunes yet my show may appeal to a wider audience. Perhaps my niche is wrong. I have no problem finding guests for the show. Marketing is the issue.\n\nSFTHMouth is on social media & every podcast platform. It is now a year since I started. I ask my guests to leave a review on iTunes, but this is rarely done. I promote their brands by linking back to their websites, posting on all social media.\n\nMaybe I haven't given the show enough time, or I need to pivot. Need advice thank you from one of your senior listeners.\n\nP.S. I am interested in being part of your network marketing company.\n\nA: Here's what I see from your website: the website is fine. I'd figure out something better for your URL - podhorse, horsecast, something more consumable.\u00a0 Your logo could be integrated more.\n\nAfter looking on iTunes your reviews look like people haven't actually listened to the show, you could use some more actual reviews. Your keywords need to be deeper, in your author description and not in your title.\n\nAlso don't put SFTHMXX - just put the episode number. Make sure all of your headlines for your episodes are compelling.\n\nOn social media every time someone compliments you ask them to leave a review, send them the link. This has worked really well for me.\n\nAnd consider coming to Podmastery, this is exactly what we do there.\n\ndouglasjfoley\nQ: Where do you get the best return on advertising spend (if you spend any on ads)?\nA: I don't really. The hot hand is Facebook ads. Podcasting is a platform so it's a great way to move the needle, when you guys sign up. Facebook ads are where it's at if you're going to go down that road.\n\nlifes_loser\nQ: Just recently got to over 1300 followers on Instagram. How many do you need to make money and how do you make money using followers?\nA: The short answer is 10,000. There are a few ways to make money once you're there: people will pay you to post to your audience on their behalf. You can also put one active link in your bio, and have a lead magnet linked up there. Post and send people there, offering them something free. Then they're in your list. Also product placement, companies will pay you to post pictures of you with their products.\n\ngetoutdoorsnow\nQ: I've heard you reference your podcast episode about building Instagram followers but can't find it in your episodes, simply 'too much' good content, what number is it?\nA: Episode 154 with Sue B. Zimmerman is a good place to start.\n\nSecond: I'm looking to build a platform & knowledge based for people who work in, or active owners in apartment buildings, condos/associations/strata (same thing around the world just a different names), about how to manage the work volume, building construction types, repair types, how to save money for your building, I'm thinking podcast/webinar, any recommendations?\n\nA: The first thing I'll ask is this: is there an audience?", "duration": "38:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/330.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1444172559, "title": "329: Mailing List Masterclass with Nathan Barry of ConvertKit", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As solopreneurs building on rented land like Facebook or Twitter or Instagram is one of the worst things we can do, having an email list to market to is one of the best.\n\nHere to talk about how to connect with and grow your email list is Nathan Barry, one of the founders of ConvertKit. Nathan is an accomplished designer, app developer and all-around entrepreneur who had a vision for a better email service provider with ConvertKit.\n\nOn episode 329 of The Solopreneur Hour we talk about his design background, growing up in the outskirts of Boise, Idaho and how to fully utilize email and autoresponders.\nMore About Nathan Barry and ConvertKit\nNathan got his start in the wilderness just outside of Boise, Idaho. He was home-schooled and spent much of his free time playing in the outdoors. Today he still enjoys those beautiful mountains and lakes of Boise by skiing, snowboarding and paddleboarding with his family.\n\nHis early career days were focused on design; he became interested in that world because of a former girlfriend. The relationship didn't last but his love for design did!\n\nFrom there he explored the world of apps and later wrote several of his own books, including The App Design Handbook and Designing Web Applications. He also penned Authority, a guide to self-publishing. He's been prolific to say the least.\n\nAlong the way he tinkered with his former email service provider (ESP) and had to create lots of work-arounds to get it to do what he wanted it to do. He wanted to send different emails to people who had bought versus people who had not. He wanted to resend emails to people who hadn't opened it the first time it was sent. It was a clunky and inefficient process to do so.\n\nIn this show you'll also discover:\n\n\tWhy to not end your speech with a Q&amp;A.\n\tWhat did his childhood smell like?\n\tWhen you should and shouldn't outsource.\n\tWhy being late to the email service provider scene has been an advantage for ConvertKit.\n\tThe #1 mistake you want to avoid: what is it?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nNathan researched the other ESPs on the marketplace but they were either too big and expensive or didn't offer the right features. Being the entrepreneur he is, he and his team created ConvertKit.\n\nOn this episode Nathan gives us the scoop on what ConvertKit does that the other guys don't, what it's been like to arrive late to the party in the email service provider world, and how that's actually been a big advantage for them.\n\nNathan also tells us exactly what he'd do if he were to take two days and create his autoresponder series from scratch. The first step is to put up a dedicated opt-in page where people can give you their email address in exchange for your gift. The second thing he'd do is create a short email series sequence that gives people your very best content.\n\nIf you've been putting off creating or updating your sequence for your audience Nathan says to start small. Rather than trying to give them 30 days' worth of email, send them 3 messages.\n\nWhen you're ready to create more emails space them out over a period of time. You can send 5 messages but do so over a period of 15 days and frontload your messages to send more often in the beginning, and slow the pace towards the end of those 15 days.\n\nNaturally those features are available with ConvertKit, Nathan set it up that way! He also shares how consistency has played a pivotal role in his success, and what they're up to next at ConvertKit. Check it out on episode 329 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What are you going to do differently with your email autoresponders thanks to Nathan?

If you aren't in one you need to find one. Can't find one you want to join? Create your own! Pat talks about his mastermind groups, the three he is in, and how they were critical to his early success.\n\nWhen he was just starting out he had no knowledge of or background in internet marketing and online business. But he had a great product, he had traffic coming to his blog and he knew there was something there.\n\nSo he joined a mastermind group and learned from people who had more experience and knowledge than he did. They showed him how to capitalize on his existing structure and product and turn it into a successful business model. He gives the full skinny on just how he did that on today's show and how you can find a mastermind that's right for you (or create your own!).\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow much did he receive for his first sale?\n\tAdversity breeds _______. We fill in the blank.\n\tWhy are negative comments useful?\n\tWhen and why feeling nervous is important.\n\tWhy did he record the first episode of his SPI podcast three times?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHe also shares some fashion tips during our chat, another subject we've covered a few times on The Solopreneur Hour. If you're tempted to skip over that part or ignore fashion all together, consider this: people are going to judge you based on how you present yourself.\n\nAnd your clothes are part of your presentation and part of how people are going to judge you.\u00a0T-shirts and jeans are fine at home, but what about events and networking? If you want to be taken seriously you need to dress the part. Take note of successful solopreneurs like Pat and follow in his footsteps: dress up and dress sharp when you're meeting others. Pat and I talk specifically about how to do this and how to do it right.\n\nWe also talk about his typical day, and the freedom and flexibility his solopreneur journey allows him. He generally wakes up early with his two kids and makes breakfast with them, plays with them and watches some educational TV with them. He spends the first half of his day with his kids and his wife.\n\nAfter he cooks lunch for them - he loves to cook - his wife takes over and he goes to work for a few hours. This is typically when he records episodes of his show. He wraps up in the late afternoon and then has family time again til the kids go to bed. Then it's back to work writing blog posts, working on various projects, etc. All of which he does in the late evening til around 1am while everyone else is fast asleep.\n\nHow does he manage to stay on track while he's working? He used to set an alarm to go off every 30 minutes. That alarm was his reminder to stay on task, and stay off of social media! Eventually he didn't need to have the alarm go off because it became routine for him to notice whether or not he was actually working, or just being distracted.\n\nPat also talks about how to deal with those \"look squirrel!\" moments we all have as solopreneurs, how to channel those ideas but still stay focused on your current project or goal. We also chat about how he deals with haters, where his innovative ideas come from and much more!", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/328.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Men's Style", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Pat Flynn", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1443766931, "title": "327: Becoming Richard Branson, Checking in with Jess, and your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Howdy solopreneurs and welcome to episode 327 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nThis is our weekly Friday Q&amp;A.

I know you sometimes answer listener questions, and I've been wondering if it's possible to create a successful business with a traditional store front?\n\nI know your tag line is all about location freedom and time freedom, and everything is digital now, but my dream involves not just selling items, but creating a local community based around it. I'm having a terribly difficult time finding resources that support the idea of being able to excel in a business that also has a traditional brick and mortar store. Any thoughts/advice/resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: 1. Focus on getting people on your mailing list. Have a physical clipboard where they sign up or an iPad where they sign up. Or try Square. 2. Depending on the type of the store start holding free clinics. If you are a bike shop hold free bike clinics.\n\nMiranda\nQ: Well I have an income problem. I make $20,000 a year before taxes. I thankfully have no bills but I would like to not live with my parents some day. I've also recently started a business on Amazon but it hasn't really taken off yet.\n\nI'm having trouble deciding if I should devote money and time to get some more education for a job I don't really want and but would give me more money and allow me to work from home (which I do want).\n\nOr if I should just stay at my current job, keep working on my Amazon business and see where I am in like a year. Which seems like a very long time to live at such a low income and 9 to 5. (I'm not known for my patience.)\n\nA: Split the difference: is there something that can work with the knowledge you have and you spend money on an online course so you become really, really good at that thing. I don't know your niche or what you do or what you want to do I could give you more suggestions. Look at the trends: are their things you can do and learn really, really well? Try your hand at copywriting, it is the Holy Grail!\n\npipmckay_rawfirelife\nQ: Hello Michael! I have really been enjoying your Q&amp;A sessions for a while now, so I am hoping to participate finally. I have a couple web businesses that I am slowly getting in order. The first one I put up was emulating an already existing business so I could learn from that business model and try to get a little income flow.\n\nAnother one that I started is called waterpluscoffee.com and has taken a backseat due to not really knowing how I was able to monetize the concept and going down a bit of the wrong website rabbit hole. Started as a fan site for people that take their gourmet coffee black and wanting to promote the aeropress and other preferred methods to achieve the most delicious cup of coffee. But I don't necessarily have the time to blog as a priority.\n\nThese two sites I am wanting to work toward semi-passive income so that I can eventually stop working as a freelance photographer and devote my time towards my true love and brainchild a site called RawFire Life,which would be a food first, food/fitness/fun lifestyle website with a with a restaurant chain idea as it's end goal.\n\nSo I'm asking for a brainstorm session on the coffee idea then a breakdown on time structuring to accomplish the goals for these businesses. Thank you for your time.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/327.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1443565477, "title": "326: What Comedy Can Teach You About Sales, with Butch Bellah", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "There are definite similarities between the world of a solopreneur and that of a comedian. Joining us today to draw those parallels is Butch Bellah, comedian, author and successful salesman.\n\nOn episode 326 of The Solopreneur Hour Butch shares his journey from sales to comedian to author.\n\nHis latest book, Sales Management for Dummies, is available as of October 2015 and we explore what it was like to write and publish that book as well as his life on the comedic road.\nMore About Butch Bellah\nButch's comedic career didn't begin the way you might expect. He graduated high school, spent a few weeks at college before deciding he simply wanted to get to work. He left, joined a company's sales department and worked his way up to eventually buy that very business at the age of 35.\n\nHe self-published his first book, The 10 Essential Habits of Sales Superstars, and was later contacted by the publishing company responsible for the For Dummies line about doing a For Dummies book on sales management.\n\nDespite all of the lessons he learned throughout his business career, Butch will be the first to tell you his 10 years on the road as a comedian was by far and away the best training ground for sales.\n\nIn this show you'll also discover:\n\n\tHow long is 5 minutes in stand up time?\n\tWho are some of the biggest names he worked with in comedy?\n\tWhen did his biggest learning curve happen?\n\tPeople don't buy what they need - what do they buy?\n\tHow can you share the voice of your brand?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nIn January of 1991 Butch took the stage during an open mic night at a local comedy club. He had always been the funny guy among his friends, in class, and anywhere else. He liked to be the center of attention and will gladly tell you he's never met a mic he didn't love!\n\nBy spring of that same year he was headlining clubs - a feat nearly unheard of in comedic circles. But he was never one to rest on his laurels and he busted his tail for the next 10 years traveling around the country doing the circuit, learning from his fellow comedians what to do and what not to do, and honing his craft the entire time.\n\nAt the end of that decade he was burnt out and the comedy scene was changing. Clubs were closing fast, and the ones that remained open were only doing so on weekends (not weeknights). Butch decided to leave comedy. Although he doesn't regret it, he does miss it.\n\nOn this episode we talk about what he misses, what he learned from comedy that has helped him in the sales world and what was the hardest thing about writing his latest book, Sales Management For Dummies.\n\nOne of the areas we dive headlong into is the parallels of the construction of a joke and a sales conversation. In comedy Butch would start his joke with the punchline. He was setting his audience up to get it later on when he closed. It's the same in sales: you start with your close, your punchline. And you lead your audience from there through the joke (or the sales process) and then lead them back to the finish/close/punchline.\n\nFor example on this show we often say \"the how is none of your business\". And it's not. When it comes to your goals, your dreams and aspirations the how of those is none of your business.\n\nWhat is your business is getting to work and taking action. If I tell you there's $100k on the roof of the house across the street and it's yours but only if you get it in the next 15 minutes will you go get it? Of course you will! You don't have any idea how you're going to get it yet, but you know you're going to get it.\n\nSee the connection? We draw quite a few more on this show, listen in to hear them all on episode 326 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What is the experience your brand is leaving your customers with?

The experience of being a Porsche enthusiast and owner doesn't stop with simply owning a beautiful car. In fact that's just the beginning and the company widely promotes this.\n\nAs a fellow racer and Porsche aficionado JJ shares his enthusiasm by being an instructor for a local Porsche club in his area. Having local driving clubs is one of the many ways the company of Porsche promotes the love of their cars.\n\nLocal instructors like JJ help owners discover the true beauty their car holds; those owners learn how to turn, handle the speed and experience the elegance of their Porsche. They discover what is available to them with a Porsche.\n\nIn this show you'll also discover:\n\n\tWhat is The Fibonacci Sequence?\n\tWhere is the coolest office JJ has ever had? (Hint: it's NOT Madison Ave.!)\n\tHow should a t-shirt actually fit?\n\tWhat was it like being at LeMons?\n\tHow to find someone's fashion to model yours after.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nAs you listen to the discussion of Porsche as a brand, be thinking of how you can take what Porsche does and apply it to your business. Ask yourself how you can further your audience's experience with your brand.\n\nIt's important you understand what you are leaving your customers with, and what they are saying about your company when you are not around. Are they talking passionately about you when you're not there? If they aren't, what can you do to change that? How can you create raving, lifelong enthusiasts of your own like Porsche does?\n\nOn today's show we also talk about fashion. JJ is our beacon of fashion and style here at The Solopreneur Hour, if you missed his first visit to the show on episode 24 you can find it here.\n\nJJ explains how fashion can often be individually-based, and how to find someone you can model your style after. If you can find a celebrity of your height and build whose style you admire take a look at what they wear and how they wear it.\n\nWith that in mind get to a good retailer like Nordstrom's and find a stylist who can help you, and make it a stylist whose fashion sense you dig. For example if you're a classic-type don't ask a rock star-looking stylist for help.\n\nAnd even if you aren't buying an entire new wardrobe ask that stylist to pick out a few good pieces they would dress you in. Be willing to get outside of your comfort zone; if you're really committed to changing your style and becoming more fashionable it'll be worth it!\n\nWe also talk about JJ's venture out on his own, what that process has been like and his incredible experience at this year's LeMons with the Factory Porsche team! Check it out on episode 325 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What is the experience your brand is leaving your customers with?

As I type this from our VRBO (Vacation Rental By Owner) here in Monterey CA, it is a crisp Northern California morning.\n\nToday's show is a \"Best Of\" of...myself. \u00a0Whether you're in the boardroom, the living room, or even the bedroom, you probably have to call on some sales techniques to negotiate your way through the day.\n\nIf you're a parent or an employee, you have to use sales techniques all the time. That's what episode 324 of The Solopreneur Hour is about! Enjoy!\nMore About This Show - And Being in Sales\nNo matter where you are with your solopreneur idea or venture there's one thing you have to understand to have any kind of success: you're in sales.\n\nYes, you read that right. The dreaded \u201cS Word\u201d. We are indoctrinated to think that, by default, being in sales is \u201ccheesy\u201d. It\u2019s that kind of thinking that keeps us from achieving the goals we really want to achieve with our finances, and our overall lifestyles.\n\nBut here's what most of us have been missing about sales: when done properly selling provides a WIN for both parties. You're a solopreneur with a certain skill set, knowledge and talents. Someone out there needs what you have.\n\nYou'll Also Discover on Today's Show:\n\n\tWhat is the #1 thing that turns people off from sales?\n\n\tWhat do you need to be successful in any sales situation?\n\tThe value of receiving permission.\n\n\tHow can you structure your response to engage and get permission?\n\n\tHow NOT to pitch yourself: a real-life example.\n\tAnd much more!\n\nHow else are they going to know about you if you don't sell yourself and sell what you do? They won't. Think of sales as providing solutions to people's problems - not as sleazy and cheesebally.\n\nIn this solo show, I break down what sales is exactly and how to approach any situation properly. Sales is simply this: disseminating the right information at the right pace at the right time. Understand who you are speaking to and what they need BEFORE you talk about your product and service. \n\nFor example you wouldn't simply approach a girl at a bar and tell her how great you are would you? Of course not. The way you present your business in any situation is the same. You have to connect first and engage with the person. \n\nWhen you do you're following a gradient: you are understanding who you're talking to, what their problems are and what they need to solve those problems. Once you know all of that information then you can seek permission to share your solutions.\n\n\nThat permission piece is so critical and so often overlooked by most people. Whether you're posting on social media or you're speaking with people at a networking event, spewing out how great your product or service is isn't going to win you any new clients or friends so don't do it. It's not how great sales people become great, and it won't work for you.\n\n\nSo how do you engage, connect and get people's permission to share your information? I detail it on today's show, tune in to find out! Thank you & see you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: What are the three ways you'd describe what you do?\u00a0Let us know in the comments below!\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast?

What are the top 5 dog owner tips you can share?\nA: 1. Get pet insurance! I didn't do that and now since May have spent no less than $15,000 on Dexter's care treatment. I don't regret spending that on him for a minute, but I do regret not getting that insurance!\n2. Combine your exercise with your dog's. Every time I hit the ball or throw the frisbee for Dexter to go after it, I do 7-10 push ups while he runs after it. Or I'll do a plank pose while he chases it.\n3. I promote autonomy, I think dogs will learn if you allow them the opportunity to do so. Dogs will figure it out.\n4. If you can go with a grain-free diet if possible. I can't say his condition was caused by his food but I wouldn't be surprised if it was.\n5. Don't take your dog for granted. Dogs are only capable of pure, unconditional love.\n\n18.)

He also has a tumor in his chest that is very aggressive. The vet said his latest round of chemo may have been making him feel like he had the flu, and then gave us antibiotics for him. He started feeling better soon after and I'm hoping he continues to rebound.\n\n19.) When should a solopreneur say \"enough already\" and get a 9-5 or leave their 9-5 for a solopreneur life?\nA: The latter half is when you don't have a choice or your side hustle is paying your bills. The other way around, it depends on the business. If it's a podcast and it hasn't latched on within 3 or 4 months then you need to reframe it, if you want to use it as a platform. But if it's a blog that can take up to a year! And if you don't care about making money at it then just keep doing it.\n\n20.) How do you ensure you do not work IN the business but ON the business?\nA: For a period of time you have to work in the business but once you've done that you can move to working on the business.Here's an example you can follow to help you work on it and in your business: James Schramko says to buy a pack of sticky notes. On each note write a task you do to make your business run. Then bundle those tasks in logical bundles. Now you have batches of tasks you can outsource to someone and you can tell them exactly what to do and how.\n\n21.) I get the impression that business for you is as much about people as it is about profit. Should this be the case for every business?\nA: I'm not super financially motivated. Sponsors for the show and people joining SoloLab are the two ways I make money with this, and I'm so grateful for all of you who listen and make it possible, and to all of my SoloLab members. I really love my coaching calls I do and putting out these shows brings me so much joy.To answer your question I say people come first!\n\n22.) I stopped doing Google ads for a few months and now rely more on direct google search links and social media. My website has improved the bounce rate but what should I do to improve conversion. I am considering a free \"ebook\" or pdf etc but is this still relevant in today's video rich demanding environment?\nA: For sure I would absolutely do a PDF or a resource guide. Give something for the audio people, the video people and the kinesthetic people. I suggest Lead Digits made by LeadPages to help with conversions. Always experiment! Ask your list how they like to learn and what their biggest struggles are.\n\n23.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/323.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1442821391, "title": "322: The Science of Getting Rich, with Dave MacArthur", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Our solopreneur hour buddy The Mechanic to Millionaire himself Dave MacArthur, is back on the show for episode 322! \u00a0In this episode, we break down the secret to ... The Secret.\n\nIt's a book called The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace Wattles. \u00a0It, to some, is the original personal development bible. \u00a0The book contains a number of fundamental principals, that, if you follow them, you'll end on the right side of wealth.\n\nDave is a fountain of information, and this edition of The Solopreneur Hour is a\u00a0great\u00a0show to listen to if you want to get your head on straight and stop getting in your own way.\nMore About The Science of Getting Rich\nIf you'd like a bit of Dave's backstory you can hear it on his first visit to the show. Rejoining us today Dave updates us on what's been going on in his life over the last 2 years, what has been happening with his business and what has been key to his success with the Mechanic 2 Millionaire community.\n\nWe also talk about the laws laid out in The Science of Getting Rich and how understanding and implementing these laws will help you design the life you want, rather than lead the life you've been given.\n\nThe law of attraction became very popular as a result of The Secret, but how many of us know about the law of non-resistance? Or the law of vibration? Knowing, understanding and implementing these three laws can help any of us direct our lives exactly where we want them to go, regardless of outside circumstances.\n\nOn this episode you'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat is the third mind and why is it so powerful?\n\n\tWhat was his original vision for Mechanic 2 Millionaire?\n\n\tThe #1 problem in the world is what?\n\n\tWhat a jar can teach you about life.\n\n\tAre there such things as coincidences?\n\n\tAnd much, much more.\n\nThe law of non-resistance tells us not to resist the circumstances in our lives. Worrying, talking about, stressing about the obstacles that come our way goes against this natural law and stops us from achieving our goals.\n\nFor example a stream meanders down a hill. When that water meets a boulder does it stress about the boulder? Does it talk about how to get around that boulder? No, it simply goes around the boulder. So too must we be like that boulder. We must go around our circumstances and not give them any power by acknowledging them, talking about them and worrying about them.\n\nThe law of vibration states that everything has a vibration. Even if we can't see the vibration something emits it does have a vibration - everything from walls to colors to piano keys.\n\nIf we want to bring something into our lives we have to match the vibration of that thing. If you want your ideal life you have to match the vibration of that ideal life. We attract what we are in vibration with. This goes hand in hand with the law of attraction.\n\nSo how do we match the vibration of the things we want that we don't have right now? Picture a time in your life when you excelled and were proud of something you achieved.\n\nNow get into the feeling of that moment: what did it sound like it? What did it smell like? What did you hear and see? Get into that state and then envision your ideal life with this same feeling to help you vibrate and attract that life.\n\nAlso create vision boards to help you visualize the life you want to design for yourself. Feel those same feelings from the moment you just pictured while looking at your vision board and you'll begin to attract avenues and pathways to create that life. It's not up to you to know the how, it's just up to you to want it, feel it and take action as those pathways open up.\n\nThese laws have been the key to Dave's monumental success, and after reading and studying The Science of Getting Rich he knows these same laws will help anyone achieve whatever it is they set their minds to.\n\nOn this episode Dave candidly shares where he was before learning these laws, just how bleak his outlook was and how they have changed his entire life.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/322.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Dave MacArthur", "Fitness & Health", "Health", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Isagenix", "Network Marketing", "Science of Getting Rich"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1442554062, "title": "321: Your questions, answered briefly.", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey there solopreneurs!

And how do you get past that feeling of disappointment if you do?\n\nA: My engine rebuild is a great example of this. I thought it would take 8 and we'd be done. We're now 40 hours in! That happens a lot in our solopreneur world. I think the way you set yourself is to know stuff's going to happen and rarely do things go perfectly according to your plan.\n\nHeather Gray\nQ: Sorry to know, Michael, that you're having a tough week. I am blown away by your authenticity Wednesday morning in your update. Many podcasters talk to us about being grateful that we listen. You really demonstrated the relationship you have with your listeners and your respect for it. Please know that we return it to you in spades.\n\nA: Thanks Heather. It was the first time I was just not up for recording, I wasn't in the head space to deliver entertaining content or value.\n\nI take this show seriously and I'm incredibly grateful for all of you who listen, and I like to take you along for the ride. Sometimes that ride is a great new idea like Rennch. And sometimes it is real life like that day when I needed to be alone, and to be with my dog Dexter. He's been with me through everything you know about my story.\n\nHe came to me 2 days before my dad died and his birthday is the same date my mom died; he's an incredibly important part of my life so I needed to be alone with him on Wednesday. I'm glad you all are here with me. Thanks for your message Heather, it is very much appreciated.\n\nJonny Keeley\nQ: Hey man. Question about Instagram. Being a hot platform right now, how can we effectively use it to help grow our business? Thanks man.\n\nA: A couple things: commit to posting daily on a consistent basis. Second you have to dial in your hashtags. Post to Instagram first with a nice call to action within the post itself, and then the first comment is your hashtags. Third go to the app Kick or Group.me there are groups of people who will do a S for S or a share for share. They'll allow you to share their info on your Instagram account, and they'll share yours.\n\nBrad Brown\nQ: Hey Michael, hope you're well. You've been talking the last while about creating a side hustle in a different niche to The SH.\n\nHow do you decide how much time to spend on the new project compared to your main hustle? I'm working on a passion project on the side (www.thekonaedge.com) and I find that it is distracting me big time from my main business.\n\nA: Kona Edge is a beautiful site, wow! However I have to disagree with you; this is my main focus, I don't think this is a side hustle. It happens that this is my journal: I document my journey and other people's journey, if anything I'm finding lessons and passing them along.\n\nBut if you find your side gig is incongruent with your main hustle maybe your main hustle isn't the right hustle, that's what I'd say about that.\n\nIn terms of time once your main focus is locked in and on cruise control, then you can start exploring other things.\n\nAdam Shipley\nQ: I've been a professional strength and conditioning coach and nutritional researcher for almost 14 years.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/321.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1442426500, "title": "320: The Super Mega Q&A, Part I", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "33 good questions sent in by ONE\u00a0listener in a 2-part series, right into your earballs. \u00a0This dude sent in 33 good questions because he was \"catching up\" from previous Q&amp;A shows he'd missed!\n\nSo, I decided to answer\u00a0all of them, spanning two episodes. \u00a0Here are the first 16:\n\nThe first 16 questions in our Q&amp;A:\n\n1) How often should a brand refresh it's style and image?\nA: Good question. I don't know if there's a timeline, sometimes things just get dated. Take Google for example, they were 15 years in before they did their first brand refresh. So some of it depends on culture. Base it on your industry: tech needs to be more often, mom & pop shops less so. My latest venture, Rennch.com, is another great lesson in branding and I share its history on this episode.\n\n2) How important is it for a brand to inform its customers and market if its own values change over time (a solo brand for a 20 year old may change by the time they are 55+ years old)?\nA: I don't think a brand will change that must, it shouldn't. A brand is the feeling you leave your customers with.\n\n3) Why should I bother with Periscope to brand a business?\nA: I don't think you would brand a business with it, but it's very hot for growing your business.\n\n4) Is \"the Twitter\" dead or dying in regards to engagement?\nA: Not if you're a celebrity or a Twitter power user. It's still the #1 way most very successful people communicate with the outside world. So you still want to be there so you don't miss anything. You've got to grow by engagement.\n\n5) Where is everyone on Google+ (outside the USA)?\nA: No one's on it. Well not no one but I think there are some who use it. It's good for your rankings on Google, it gives you some juice on there.\n\n6) Are Google hangouts still relevant?\nA: I think so. We use it for our Thursday SoloLab hangouts (SoloLab is my group mastermind, every Thursday you join us and get any of your questions answered).\n\n7) I was born in England, can I use this as an excuse to wear socks with sandals to my wife?\nA: No you cannot. Not ever.\n\n8) What podcasts do you listen to?\nA: On my podcast app I listen to Adam Carolla, Bill Burr, The Nerdist, Joe Rogan (those last two are guest-dependent), Off Camera with Sam Jones (that's my #1: easily the most insightful and deep conversations), The Tim Ferriss Show from time to time, Bill Maher's Real Time, HT Guys, So Money with Farnoosh Torabi, Here's The Thing with Alec Baldwin (my second favorite of interview podcasts), Doug Loves Movies, Smart Passive Income, The Art of Charm, Around the NFL podcast, Dave Dameshek, CarCast with Adam Carolla, The Terrible Podcast, Come to Papa.\n\n9) How does a solopreneur break into a foreign language market?\nA: You could teach a foreign language. Like my friend Gabby's business on YouTube is Go Natural English. Or you could have your thing translated into any language you want, it's not impossible to break into other language markets.\n\n10) What 5 things would you do different in your business over the past 12 months?\nA: I would've done a few webinars. I got really tripped up with my Life After 8 Weeks course, it wasn't done in a way that was sustainable so it needs to be redone and I just haven't. I'd focus a little harder on my mailing list and would email you guys a little more. I should have someone doing that for me, someone to handle my funnels and emails, etc.\n\n11) Do you bother with A/B testing?\nA: Yeah I do. A/B testing is when you have two nearly identical things and you put them out there to see which gets more click throughs. I do it with headlines, headlines of shows; I tweak stuff all the time.\n\n12) How is Instagram doing for your business?\nA: My Instagram is growing like a weed. I'm not using it for business yet, I'm growing it. Once it gets to 10k followers I'll think about monetizing it. A few ways you can get paid: you can post for people and they'll pay you for it.

Enjoy hearing all about that and his Thrive event on episode 319 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Eradicating Mental Health Issues\nIf you've don't know Wes or his back story check out episode 61. Be prepared for a story unlike any you've ever heard before.\n\nWes has taken on many seemingly big goals in the past, and he's reached them. But this time he's really stepping up his game and on today's show he explains what he's doing, why he's doing and his vision for the future of humanity.\n\nWes has set a goal of eliminating mental illness by 2025. And he doesn't mean eliminating it from our vocabulary and getting rid of labels, he means eliminating it entirely. He intends to eradicate it from the human experience. He believes we as human beings no longer need to be slowed down or at the mercy of PTSD, bipolar, depression, Alzheimer's or any other mental disorder.\n\nWhile to some this may sound like a lofty goal, it isn't to Wes. He sees the science and believes this is possible, so much so he's willing to stake his name on it.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy his new home in Lake Arrowhead helps him do what he does.\n\tWhat is his driving force and why?\n\tCan we change what we're born with?\n\tThe three pieces of financial success.\n\tAnd much, much more.\n\nScientifically we've proven the brain regenerates itself, it creates new neural pathways and can heal itself - so why not heal itself of mental illness? Although it takes more than just science, today we have the solution when we combine science with mindset, nutrition, and getting the right people involved.\n\nBefore you dismiss his mission consider how many times in human history we as a species have collectively believed something to be impossible, only for us to be proven wrong.\n\nRemember that we collectively thought the Earth was flat and if we sailed too far we'd fall off? We were wrong. Remember when we thought it was impossible to put a human being on the moon? We did it.\n\nThose are just a few times in the history of humanity when the impossible has been made possible. So why couldn't we do the same for mental illness? Wesley believes we can and we will. His mission is for this is to come true, even though he doesn't know the how piece of this. And that's a valuable lesson for any solopreneur: you don't have to know the \"how\" of what you've committed to, you just need to commit.\n\nListen in for the rest of today's episode as we talk about how Star Trek points the way, why we have to stop allowing ourselves to be limited by what we believe is possible or impossible, and the full insider details on his Thrive event - including some offers available ONLY to listeners of The Solopreneur Hour!\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What audacious goal are you going to set for yourself after listening to Wes today?

My question is, what does being an entrepreneur actually mean? Is it just being self-employed? Is it being your own boss? Is it not working the 9-5? Love to hear your thoughts. Thanks man.\n\nA: In the grandest scheme of things it's a mindset. It's the ability to see a problem in the world and solve it - for money. It's about not worrying the how of what you do - just doing it.\n\n___lash____business___tips\nQ: I'm growing a lash and beauty business, and helping others with their online marketing, and training in my brow craft.\n\nMy question is how do I pull it all together to leverage my time to help others, serve my local clients and train? Should I do workshops, seminars, online courses? I've written several beauty marketing guides, and have sold a couple but I know my followers need marketing and business help...how can I solve this when it's only moi?

The products will help you feel better, perform better and have more energy.\n\nTo answer the second part of your question I did their 30 day program, I took before and after pictures and shared them on social media. Naturally people wanted it when they saw I lost 13 pounds in 11 days. When they signed up I got paid for it.

I like your question \"What did your childhood smell like?\" Any suggestions for creating similar questions that engage both the left and right brain?\n\nMateo Echabarne\nQ: Tell us about your 911! I'm a car guy without a car, or a budget, so I have to live vicariously through you! What are you doing to it? I need all the little details!\nA: I got into racing in 2003, won a championship with my 89 Honda Civic xi. I sold it right away because I knew I had done with it all I could. Next I bought a 1972 Porsche 911, they were affordable back then! I didn't get it inspected, and when I drove it back from New York where I bought it, it died in the middle of Nebraska. I replaced the engine but soon realized I had made a bad purchase.\n\nMy buddy told me about a car rotting away in a field that he suggested I buy and put my new engine in. I bought it for $5k, it was 1969 911T. It was a much better car even though it was a rustbucket!\n\nI spent the next few years and 4,000 hours refinishing this car. Along the way my parents would pass away. Mixed into the coat of the first primer of my 911 is my parents ashes. I wanted them to surround me with love so my car carries them with me all the time!

People today are too easily offended, frankly. \u00a0Nicole Arbour thinks you shouldn't be so easily offended (I happen to agree) and is unabashedly herself.\n\nSolopreneurs face every kind of challenge and obstacle imaginable. From unsupportive family and friends, to long working days (and nights) to internal doubts and fears, we experience it all. And some of us deal with it in different ways. Our guest for today's show faces hers with laughter and comedy.\n\nOn episode 316 of The Solopreneur Hour Nicole Arbour joins us to talk comedy, difficulties and why you're going to offend people sometimes and that's okay.\nMore About Nicole Arbour\n\nNicole Arbour is a long-time dancer, performer and comedian. She's widely known in YouTube circles and has recently gone viral, for the umpteenth time, with a satirical video about Instagram models. It's a hilarious video with a real message to the scantily clad girls on Instagram encouraging them to be more than just a pretty face for likes.\n\nBut that video wasn't her first brush with brazen comedy. One quick glance at her other YouTube videos and you'll see she isn't afraid to offend people by saying what she thinks. She's completely comfortable with her own voice. She has a raving fan base for that reason: she's authentic and she keeps it real.\n\nOf course Nicole wasn't always so outspoken in public. In fact she says she used to tone things down based on who she was dating in the past. If her significant other worked in children's entertainment she worried she would hurt his career by being bold and blunt. But that changed significantly when she was in two car accidents.\n\nIn this episode you'll also discover:\n\n\tWho are the funniest people Nicole knows?\n\t\u00a0For her what is more terrifying than stand up?\n\t\u00a0Why she doesn't use a script for her videos.\n\n\t\u00a0What is her first love?\n\tWhat are her income streams and how have they evolved?\n\n\tAnd much more!\n\nIn 2008 she was in a very bad car accident, so bad she couldn't walk for the next several years. She had pain in her neck, back and radiating down through her legs. She was in constant pain and eventually became depressed. She was bedridden for much of the time as well. Of course Nicole tried every imaginable solution, saw every doctor yet nothing seemed to resolve her pain and anguish.\n\nOne day she read a doctor's report that said she was disabled and could qualify for lifetime disability benefits. Nicole was still in her 20s, and was far too young to give up. She couldn't believe this doctor was saying she would be disabled for the rest of her life.\n\nIn that moment something shifted for her and she committed to getting better no matter what. She wasn't going to allow her life to be one painful day after another; she would dance again, she would be fully functional again. So she turned to the principles of cheerleading and Nicole committed to cheering herself through the pain, the depression and the agony.\n\nAnd she did. When she would get out of bed in the morning she would play positive audio books and messages from Dr. Wayne Dyer, Louise Haye and Joel Osteen. Rather than taking pills for her pain she read and absorbed the positive messages she had posted around her house on sticky notes.\n\nIt worked. She was able to dance again - her first real love - and get back to living her life on her own terms. Until she was in another car accident in 2014, and her injuries all flared up again. To her it was life's way of testing her and making sure she really did want that life she had been working so hard to get back to. And today she's healthy again; she does visits her chiropractor and acupuncturist and does daily stretching.\n\nOn this episode we also talk about Nicole's hilarious family and how they've always dealt with adversity through comedic relief, what's next for her and some ninja tips on taking great videos with your phone!\nListen in for all that and more on the 316th edition of The Solopreneur Hour.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/316.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Comedian", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Nicole Arbour", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Video Marketing", "Website / Search Engine Optimization"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1441352051, "title": "315: A BIG announcement, and your Q&A", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome Solopreneurs! Today we've got an extra exciting show for you. I'm finally spilling the beans on the big announcement I've been hinting at. (Wish us luck!) And we also knock down your Q's one at a time!\n\nAs you probably know most Fridays we do a Q&amp;A show. I ask you for questions on Thursday and then I answer them on the following day's show, and that's exactly what's in store for you on episode 315 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Our Q&amp;A Solopreneur Coaching\nIf you want to hear the big news you've got to listen, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag here. :) And trust me it's pretty darn great!\n\nBut if you want to partake in the questions on our weekly episodes join us on the Proudly Unemployable group and look for my question-requesting post, then drop yours in. Now let's get to some answers for this week's questions and some solopreneur coaching!\n\nkrispysglass\nQ: I'm currently a homeowner but recently quit my job to pursue my business, while working a paycheck job I obviously had my w2 which made me eligible for a mortgage, what are things we should do being entrepreneurs to still be able to have viable income for larger purchases?\n\nA: I just went through this today; I'm trying to finance a new car and want to finance some of it because it's good to have rolling credit. It is difficult; the strategy is to set yourself up as an S-corp then you can pay yourself as a regular employee so you can show you have a regular steady income. Definitely check with your tax accountant though - this isn't my area of expertise!! Try CPA on Fire.\n\n1__kikapoo\nQ: First I'd like to say thank you for having Q&amp;A Friday! I bought a domain name. I hired an Elancer to create the site for me. Unfortunately they did everything except complete the site in English.\n\nHere are my questions:\n1. Should I pay someone else to complete the site in English and try to see if the site can make money? (The purpose of the site is to automate the job application process. (ihateapplyingforjobs.com)\n2. Should I forgo completing the site and try to sell the domain?\n3. Should take a completely different route and I try to learn how to buy and sell domains by signing up for a course?\nThanks\u2028-Kisha\n\nA: I think #1 is the best thing - pay someone to finish it in English and see if it can make money. I think it's a great brand. I just checked your site and it needs a professional designer to tweak it a bit. Get an English speaker and finish it.\n\nStart with a creative brief: your audience, avatar, etc - and what you're going to do for them. How are you different than Monster.com? It feels like your brand is meant to simplify things for the job seeker and their job application process in a different way than Monster or LinkedIn. If that's not your intention then we need to dig back into the branding process. Answer the questions why you're different and you're qualified to do this.\n\nNiel Reichl\nQ: First off, thanks for always reading my name right. yes it is Reichl read like Michael.

That I still have to count how many characters can fit in. Hope I shared something of value to other podcasters out there.\n\nOh and thank you as always Michael, your content has forced me to keep on pushing out content until people drop off their stools.\n\nA: When you're doing the title of your show\u00a0 you want to frontload it.

It was there that he began to hone and refine what is today his voice and perspective. Some like it, some don't but since then no one has ever accused him of being a fence sitter!\n\nAt the age of 18 he started his first radio show simply because he was bored with everything he was listening to, and he knew he had to have a way to stand out among the crowd. And he found it with his radio show, and the candid conversations they had during their broadcasts.\n\nIn this episode you'll also discover:\n\n\tWho are the people who need you most?\n\tThe difference between finding your what and finding your why: Steve explains.\n\tWho are the people who say money doesn't matter?\n\n\tAre you meant to do just one thing with your life?\n\n\tWhy volunteering is important.\n\n\tAnd much more!\n\nAnother critical point that helped him find his voice was starting the company Liquor by Wire, it was like FTD for liquor. People would chose the liquor (wine, beer or spirits) they wanted and then could ship it anywhere in the US.\n\nThat company launched in 1995 and by 1998 it was doing multiple millions in revenue. Steve wanted a new URL for the site so he bought Liquor.com from a someone squatting on it. He paid $7500 for it, and today that name alone is worth a quarter of a million dollars. Steve explains what happened with his Liquor by Wire company, and how he eventually bought then sold then reclaimed Liquor.com!\n\nOne of the most important takeaways we talk about on this show is how to figure out who you are and what you want to do with your life, and it's very simple: take action.\n\nIn reality we aren't going to discover what our what is unless we get off our duffs and try different things. Until we do that we're just wasting time trying to figure it out, and staying in our heads about the whole thing.\n\nBy taking action and sticking with something through ups and downs we'll find our what. Rather than being focused on instant gratification and instant results, we have to take action, acknowledge our experiences and our talents, and stay in the game long enough to see tangible results.\n\nOn this episode we also talk about his strategy for making his book a New York Times best seller, and what his day to day life is like. Listen in for all that and more on the 314th edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What has Steve taught you in this episode?

If you saw today's guest before you spoke with him you probably wouldn't guess he's a downhill skier, skydiver, painter, 10th degree black belt and a sailor (among many other things).\n\nWhy wouldn't you guess that about him? Because he's in a wheelchair.\n\nBorn with Muscular Dystrophy, P.J. Dixon has defied the odds to not only live 35+ years beyond his life expectancy, but to live those years to their fullest. Listen in to hear his amazing story on episode 313 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About P.J. Dixon\n\nNot only was PJ Dixon born with Muscular Dystrophy he was born with a rare form of it, and became the poster child (literally) for the disease in his childhood. He was so gregarious and engaging as a child that the Muscular Dystrophy Association put him on posters in his town, then his state and then across the nation. In no time he was speaking to audiences of 600 people or more regularly.\n\nBut it wasn't all bright lights, big stages and laughter. Muscular Dystrophy is a progressive disease and P.J. continued to lose capabilities as he grew older. He suffered from depression periodically, and had to learn to love himself through it all. His mom had always taught him he could do whatever he set his mind to, regardless of his disability, and he embraced even the most painful moments.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's his version of Mecca?\n\n\tHow P.J. was featured on Japanese television.\n\tP.J. teaches and trains in a form of martial arts: true or false?\n\t\u00a0At what age did he start speaking on stage?\n\n\tWhat is his mission in life?\n\tAnd much more.\n\nOne of his biggest breakthroughs came as the result of an accident. P.J. has used a manual wheelchair since college and one day he was crossing a busy intersection. He made sure he was safe from oncoming traffic, but a large SUV took off unexpectedly and collided with him.\n\nThe car stopped mere inches before crushing his pelvis, which surely would've killed him. Through rehabilitation over the next four months P.J. began to understand his true calling: to love himself first, and let that love spill over to everyone he came in contact with. Today P.J. is the ultimate love guru: he helps women find the man of their dreams and get engaged in one year.\n\nIn this episode we also talk about what men and women each can do to help prepare themselves for their ideal relationship and why loving ourselves is such a critical piece of success.\n\nWhen it comes to preparing ourselves for our perfect partner or creating the ideal environment for our relationship, men and women can do different things.\n\nFor men P.J. says it's invaluable for them to know who they are as men. To be confident, to be masculine and to know how far they are willing to go to protect those they love. To be confident and masculine as a man you don't have to be arrogant or cocky, just know who you are and be confident in that knowledge. Women will be attracted to that, and even more so if you can be spontaneous and make them laugh!\n\nWomen can be that safe space for a man to talk about his feelings - no judgment and no interruptions. To create that environment for him women can take him on a walk or play catch with him or go for a drive. Do something side by side, men don't communicate face to face unless it's for sex or fighting! And when a woman can be that safe harbor for a man to talk about his feelings and to be vulnerable with her she becomes someone he wants around forever.\n\nP.J.'s got plenty more words of wisdom on episode 313 on the all-important subject of love, as well as how we can stay positive in the face of any obstacle. Tune in for all of that and more on episode 313 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What has P.J. inspired you to do after hearing his story?

Without further delay let's get to some answers and some solopreneur coaching!\n\nKevin BigHappy Smith\u00a0\nQ: Long-winded question. I'm not a youngster but I am far from old. I am a 54 year old man who recently retired from over 30 years of government service. After a 6 year stint in the Coast Guard I served 24 years as an Air Traffic Controller.\n\nFrom all of this I have learned that my super power (so it be) is to remain in a state of absolute calm no matter how bad or deep the shiz around you is.\n\nThe problem is this doesn't really subject itself to a whole lot of income opportunities in the real world. I'm not an entrepreneur, don't have the drive for it.\n\nHowever, I don't mind taking the path that has already been carved by someone else. The only rules I have are I won't be someone's boss and I won't have a boss. You talk about network marketing, explain what this takes from someone to get into. Can you do it half way? I don't need a 6 figure monthly income, just something in the very low 5 figures. What else is there similar to network marketing that is out there?\n\nI don't mind working hard, just want to do it for myself, not anyone else. Love the Friday shows. Thanks for doing them.\n\nA: Part one: Your ability to stay calm in a crisis is something you can market, I think. It's how an ER doctor, a trained first responder has to think: they have to be a calm in a storm. There's a real way to spin that into the real world; if you can think of a way to quantify that and then you've got something to work with.\n\nPart two: yes you can do it a few hours a day. Align with a company that you resonate with, pick one you like and then do the 8 steps of being a successful solopreneur. And then give it time, it takes real study and real work.\n\n\u2028\u2028Kevin BigHappy Smith\nQ: Shorter question. I spend a good deal of time raising my 10 and 7 year old children as well as my 2 year old puppy. I work on teaching my kids to have the tools on how to be happy as well as a good amount of time of raising a responsible dog. Ideally I'd like to create a program that teaches children about happiness (and I'd like to include my dog somehow). Riff on some ideas about this if you'd like.\n\nA: I love it, I think that's a great idea. It'd be cool to have a bootcamp for a week: teach kids life lessons on responsibility, and you could do it with a dog theme. Kanine Kids or something like that could be a name for the business. Practice on your kids and some of the neighborhood kids.

To start that transition we often create a side gig.\n\nThe man who has made multiple six figures doing just that: taking side gigs and turning them into multiple streams of income is none other than our friend Dr. Mark Costes.\n\nDr. Mark joins us to talk about his latest venture, the Six-Figure Side Gig Podcast and how he helps others by leveraging his knowledge into products and additional income streams. We dive into all of that and more on episode 311 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Six-Figure Side Gig\n\nDr. Mark has made several appearances on The Solopreneur Hour (you can find them here) so if you haven't heard his back story have a listen! In a nutshell, Dr. Mark has gone from being a successful dentist with multiple practices to a dentalpreneur with multiple sources of income from helping countless others follow in his footsteps.\n\nToday he has multiple streams of income helping other dentists and other practitioners grow thriving practices, and by providing a franchise-type system for dental assistant schools that other dentists can buy and set up for their own additional side gig income stream.\n\nIt all began because he was running six successful practices, but was burnt out. He had very little time or energy to give his family, and he was losing his love of dentistry.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhen did he first commit to leveraging his knowledge?\n\n\tHow becoming an entrepreneur has helped him enjoy dentistry again.\n\tHow many income streams does he have?\n\tWhat's the #1 thing he's learned from his podcast?\n\tWhat was my most terrifying moment on stage?\n\tAnd much more.\n\nSo he spent a year developing a curriculum for a dental assistant school. He worked tirelessly over that year, and then opened his first school. Once the school was underway he handed over the curriculum to his staff and had them run it. He is there for the orientation night and for graduation night, but otherwise his team handles everything.\n\nThat one school grew to over a dozen, and when other dentists started asking him how he was doing it Dr. Mark got serious about marketing the school as a way for other dentists to make additional income. The idea took off and today he has 140 schools throughout the United States.\n\nBut being the entrepreneur in dentist's clothing that he is Dr. Mark didn't stop there. He took his passion for coaching, which initially was him consuming all the coaching he could get his hands on, and now offers his wisdom to others wanting to create a six-figure side gig. He does this with his twice-weekly podcast Six-Figure Side Gig and also with personal coaching.\n\nHe helps clients in multiple industries; he has a real estate agent who is building an empire with his real estate agent training school. And he's also working a doctor to create a CNA/medical assistant school system like Dr. Mark did for dental assistants.\n\nOn today's show we talk more about his most recent podcast Six-Figure Side Gig and what he's learned from the notable people he's interviewed, and why and how he started holding events for the dental crowd. Plus he gives us the formula he uses to translate his knowledge and experiences into products and programs.

And today I'm bringing him to you for the two-year anniversary of this show.\n\nThe very insightful Chase Jarvis of Creative Live joins us for episode 310 of The Solopreneur Hour; we talk creativity, the importance of play, why we need to pursue what moves us and not what we think will pay the bills and his journey from photographer extraordinaire to CEO.\nMore About Chase Jarvis and Creative Live\n\nChase Jarvis has been creative since childhood; he loved photography but didn't pursue it as a career until later in life. He let society and culture influence his early career path, but eventually quit everything else to pursue the art of taking photos.\n\nAnd he became masterful at his craft, following climbers, skiers, snowboarders around the world to take the most authentic and breath-taking shots imaginable. He parlayed that knowledge, his skill set and his passion for creative expression into the formation of Creative Live in 2010.\n\nJust a few short years after that I found Creative Live through Sara France (her episode is here), and really admired the production quality of his programming. Then in 2014 I had the honor of meeting Chase in person when I spoke about podcasting on a Creative Live course. And the circle completed itself when he joined us for this episode, on our second anniversary.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhen was the first time he picked up a camera?\n\n\tWhy Chase makes playing a priority in his day.\n\tThe truth behind the importance of your why.\n\tWhat's the 10 year overnight success?\n\tWhy are restrictions and guard rails a vital part of creativity?\n\tAnd much more.\n\nOn today's show Chase and I talk about his experiences leading up to the creation of Creative Live, why he thinks creative play is so important for everyone, the truth about that voice that drives us to achieve more (and never acknowledges our accomplishments), and why he thinks being a CEO is a creative role and will soon be perceived as such by everyone.\n\nThere's a dirty little secret that Chase let out of the bag when we talked and it's this: whether someone is a billionaire or still struggling to pay rent, as a solopreneur or entrepreneur there's always a voice pushing for more achievement, and to accomplish the next big.\n\nBut that's only part of the secret, the other half of the secret is that that voice isn't what leads us to achievement. Success doesn't always beget success, and success often creates MORE Impostor Syndrome.\n\nThat's what very few people are talking about: that nagging voice in your mind at 3am isn't going to go away when you become the next Tim Ferriss or John Lee Dumas. Chase relies on play and meditation to quiet that voice, and he believes those two things are important for all solopreneurs and entrepreneurs.\n\nWhich led to our next topic: the role of creative play and why adults need it so much. If you can think back to what you loved to do as a kid just for the sake of doing it, why have you stopped? If you loved to ride your bike for hours do you still do it? Or do you let everything else get in the way?\n\nChase makes time every day to play and encourages other solopreneurs and entrepreneurs to do the same to keep that joy alive and to continue to feed their spirit.\n\nWe also dig into his role as a CEO and how different that has been for him, and yet similar. He sees being a CEO as a creative pursuit. Whether he's building a business or creating a sketch, there is creativity in it for him. There is no either/or for him, he isn't a CEO or he's an artist; he is both. And he believes that is the future of all CEOs: creatives who are building enterprises and endeavors, and the business is their canvas.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/310.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Chase Jarvis", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Creative Live"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1440141874, "title": "309: 2 Years of Solohour, How to Cure Hiccups, and a lot of S-Bombs.

I've been listening to the podcast for awhile and I have learned a lot from you. Last Friday you had only a few questions to answer so I hope that you can fit my issue onto the next Q&amp;A show.\n\nI've gone to AskPat, and asked many other people over the years, but nobody has helped me out yet. I have an issue that has been holding me back for years now.\n\n5 years ago I had someone make a website for me to sell my genealogy service through. In case you don't know, genealogists build family trees and conduct family history and such. I don't really have any interest in being a blogger - I just want to sell my service.\n\nWhen I had plenty of money I didn\u2019t really care that the site wasn't getting traffic, and now that a really need to site to turn a profit, I have no money to put towards SEO.\n\nOver the years I have added a bunch of blog posts in an effort to gain traffic, but it has not helped as I only get something between 25-100 visitors a day. I can go into a random blog post on my site, copy and paste a complete sentence into Google and my page will not even show up.\n\nThe site is Brooklynancestry.com. I am hoping you can take a look and see if there is something that I could do that would an impact on my traffic.\n\nI own the domain BrooklynGenealogy.com domain as well and I have been thinking about making a separate site by moving half of my blog posts over to the new site.\n\nI am not sure how Google would respond to something like that. What do you think?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance you may be able to provide. I hope you keep the podcast going - it's a great listen. Thank you.\n\nA: Two ways I'll attack this: my instinct is to tell you to bag the blog. Why? You aren't passionate about it. I don't know that this is your thing.\n\nThe second thing I'd do is to try to find someone in New York who is a good writer, who can write with a good journalistic narrative. Give them some of the information of what some of these family trees do and what they are. Link them up on Medium.com and reframe this. I'd get a domain name that has more mass appeal - The History of Brooklyn.com.\n\nImplement those things. Also get a designer to redesign it. Download Yoast SEO (it's a plugin) because it allows you to structure your blog posts with proper SEO keywords. Make your web site headline more interesting to everyone and give them good engaging content. When people see that and they see your articles are laced with history they'll be interested in the services you offer. Add a footer at the bottom of your posts where you let them know what you provide.\n\nCreate a partnership with a great writer, there are plenty out there who are in need of work out there! Link it out through medium, get Yoast and have a much sexier web site title. Finally make sure you have a Google Places account for your business in Brooklyn. Have 5 YouTube videos like Brooklyn Ancestory, Brooklyn family history, Brooklyn geneaology, etc. Find out what people are searching for and use those keywords in your YouTube videos.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/309.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1439977084, "title": "308: David Wood Returns, and talks Mindset, Investing, and Network Marketing", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Solopreneurship can come in many forms: from online marketing to the creative arts to network marketing.\n\nTo talk about the latter and how it relates to any solopreneur's journey in any industry our old pal David Wood rejoins the show. This episode was recorded live at Joe's Crab Shack in San Diego, California after a great weekend of training at the annual Isagenix convention.\n\nWe chat over a couple of drinks and a great appetizer and cover (among other things) network marketing, the vehicle David has used to make millions of dollars. \u00a0David's always full of stories and wisdom, so sit back and enjoy episode 308 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show and Network Marketing\nDavid was a guest on The Solopreneur Hour many moons ago - back on episode 6! If you missed it have a listen here, and learn much of his back story. To quickly recap: David is known as the Trainers' Trainer and is one of the best in all of the world, having trained with T. Harv Eker and other notable leaders. He's also a multi-million dollar business owner, investor and speaker who has several podcasts including The Kick Ass Life and Crank It Up!.\n\nClearly David knows a few things! And on today's show he and I dive into many of them, from the innate power of women to real estate investing to why people are taking notice of and joining network marketing now like never before.\n\nWhen it comes to the power of the female, women everywhere (whether in network marketing or another industry) realize and fully act on their power. No longer are women separating work and family, having only one and not the other. Women know they can be fiercely independent and fiercely in love, according to David.\n\nIn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's the difference between growing income and increasing wealth?\n\n\tWhat's the shortest employment David ever had?\n\n\tHow a solopreneur views failure - and how everyone else does.\n\n\tWhy you don't need other people to like you, but you do need empathy.\n\n\tWhat percentage of people hate their jobs today?\n\n\tAnd so much more.\n\nAnd that fierce independence and love are evident in the network marketing industry where David takes center stage and trains thousands every year. As more and more people experience job dissatisfaction and job loss the interest in network marketing increases. The stigma is falling away as younger generations (especially women) are seeing the potential and joining in droves.\n\nDavid has had tremendous success in network marketing personally, and he's taken that success and amplified it in his real estate endeavors. He kindly shares with us his strategies for real estate investing on this episode.\n\nHe says there are several types of real estate: buy and hold for the long term, and flips including executive flips. He has done both but prefers the former of buying and holding for the long run.\n\nHe likens real estate to the golden goose fable. In the tale a farmer has a golden goose that lays a golden egg each day. One day the farmer gets greedy and kills the goose so he can remove all the eggs at once. To his dismay the farmer discovers there are no golden eggs inside the goose and he has now killed the source: he will receive no more golden eggs.\n\nDavid says real estate is like the golden goose: your property is the goose and the golden egg is the cashflow from that property. No matter what the market does so long as you keep that goose (and you made sure to buy a good goose to begin with) you will continue to receive your golden egg.\n\nHe doesn't stop there with the knowledge bombs though! On today's show we also talk about the top 3 reasons people don't succeed in network marketing, why you should be the leader other leaders are looking for, and the two most important days in a person's life. You'll have to tune in to hear it all!

We dive into the who, what, where, when and why of buying a business, versus building one on episode 307 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About How to Buy vs. Build Your Business\n\nMost solopreneurs start out wanting to build a business of our own. We have a unique idea, vision or product we want to bring into the world. And we go to great lengths to make that happen: we learn all we can, take action, learn from those actions, pivot if needed and take more action as necessary.\n\nBut what if you're just really passionate about a particular industry and want to skip those initial building stages? We all know a majority of businesses fail, so can we skip the failures and move straight to the success?\n\nYou can if you buy a business, and if you know what you're doing. One of the few men out there teaching on this subject is Ace Chapman. Ace has been buying and selling businesses since he was 19. He's had his share of wins, losses, ups and downs. He teaches from that knowledge and he's here today to give us the insider scoop on how to buy a business.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's a 2 multiple and why should you care?\n\tWhat percentage of businesses for sale are advertised?\n\tAce's first start up business was what?\n\tWhat is OPM and how should you leverage it?\n\tWhat are the two most popular types of deals right now?\n\tAnd much more.\n\nAce's first entry into buying and selling a business wasn't the most auspicious start! He bought an online business at 19, and he left college and an incredible scholarship to do so. When he tried to sell it the Internet bubble burst and the company was bought for 1/10th of what it was really worth. He didn't get a penny of the proceeds, it all went to his investors.\n\nBecause he was no longer in school he took a job offered to him in the corporate sector. But he didn't last long! He left after just a year because he saw the successful people in that company who were 30 years ahead of him, and he didn't want what they had.\n\nHe knew in his heart he'd rather pound the pavement looking for deals then while away his days in a cubicle. To him Corporate America was simply akin to a slow death, and he wanted no part of that.\n\nOn today's show he shares how he went from that initial bust to later success and financial boon. We also discuss what industries have businesses available in, how to find the deals and the components of an actual deal he recently did.\n\nHe also explains how much cash we should have to get started, and the other steps to take if we're interested in buying businesses rather than (or in addition to) building them.\n\nEven if you don't think you'll want to buy a business you should tune in to this episode! Knowing what makes a business attractive to buyers will key you in on what you need to create with your business and where to go in the long run. Tune in for all of that and more on episode 307 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What type of business would you be interested in buying?\u00a0Let us know in the comments below!\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast?

Is this at odds with your goal of being a Solopreneur, or do think being a Solopreneur is a transition stage?\n\nDo you think this was the area you and Michael Gerber clashed at last year? Finally, did you get the mp3 for your 300th show?\n\nA: I'd say I'm trying to go to the B, I think I'm promoting the B quadrant. I'm outsourcing the jobs and remove myself as much as possible. This is a service-based business so there's no way to take yourself out of the S in that setting, but you can absolutely make the rest of your business B-based.\n\nNiel Reichl\nQ: I have just launched the podcast Ultimate Guide to the Filipina. My avatar is Stephen, a 66 year old US retiree coming over to the Philippines looking for a Filipina wife. The podcast aims to help him find his way around Filipinas who are just in for his money and find true love and much more in the Archipelago many call paradise.\n\nI joined a very active Facebook group of expats in the Phils and learned more of their problems which includes being seen as a walking ATM (cash cow others call it), having a new family with unlimited number of relatives and corresponding financial problems, what food and drinks to avoid, what mosquito repellant lotion to use - the basics a tourist or ex-pat needs to know once they come over.\n\nWhat I need are more problems to solve. What are your top three problems when you came over to the country that you would pay to avoid?\n\nP.S. The podcast airs twice a day, we now have a little over 1,500 downloads after being available since Aug 5.\n\nA: Good numbers, congratulations! I'm not the guy to ask. I was in the Philippines at a 5-star resort! Language barrier would be the first thing because you'd feel like a fish out of water. Maybe clothing and culture, and food: what you're eating, what you should wear and what people are used to. Maybe what activities? Match them based on that.\n\nMy sense is you should've had this on your radar as you set the podcast up: you should've had an endless list of things you were going to talk about.

Vote for that panel here!\n\nShanna Mann\nQ: Just a general question: why do podcasts generally use unscripted, usually not even prerecorded 'ads' for their sponsors? Did someone test this? How did it become the norm? Even if you like a sponsor, it can't be easy to sit there and freeform extol their virtues every time you record.\n\nA: Most don't! John Lee Dumas doesn't, Start-Up doesn't but I think Tim Ferriss does.\nThere's a certain skill set you need. But sponsors prefer live reads but many hosts don't have the proper training to do a live read.\n\nYenchen Lin\nQ: I know it's The Solopreneur Hour, but I don't think anyone can operate EVERY aspect of the business solo.

Our guest for today has\u00a0done this by putting his money into real estate.\n\nToday Jason Hartman has a brilliant real estate podcast on that very subject! His company also helps\u00a0solopreneurs and successful business owners alike put their money into real estate and having that money work for them.\n\nWe dive into the particulars on episode 305 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Real Estate Investing\nJason Hartman has been in the real estate biz since he was a teen. He saw an informercial on the subject one day, got a book written by one of the gurus at the time and read a few chapters of it.\n\nBut his mom picked it up, read the entire thing and got heavily into the real estate investing world. A few years later there was an RE (real estate) conference nearby and his mom encouraged him to attend. So he gathered up a bunch of friends (9 to be exact!) and his mom and they all attended.\n\nThat experience inspired him to get his real estate license and at the age of 19 he was in college and had a part-time job working for Century 21 (a real estate company).\n\nBy 20 he had bought his first investment property, less than 2 years later he sold that one and bought a condo in Irvine which he moved into. He made some money on that deal (he remembers it being about $15k), and continued to invest. Jason's learned so much in that time, and he shares some of that today on the show.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow do you know where to invest?\n\tAll real estate is local: true or false?\n\tWhat's the modern version of organized crime, according to Jason?\n\tCan you (or anyone else)\u00a0actually predict appreciation or depreciation?\n\tHow to invest if you have more time than money.\n\tAnd much more.\n\nSpecifically Jason and I cover what a rent to value ratio is and why it's so important, and how to get started in real estate investing wherever you are financially.\n\nA rent to value ratio is the value of home versus how much you can rent it for. Jason likes the rent to value number to be 1% at least, or he says the cashflow doesn't make sense and he won't do the deal.\n\nSo what that means is if you buy a home for 100k he wants to see it rent for at least $1k a month. One percent of 100k is $1k. If you buy a home for $300k it needs to rent for at least $3k a month, those numbers will meet his 1% rent to value ratio and can be applied in any geographic market.\n\nJason's company is set up to help people create these kinds of deals in any part of the US. In general his investors tend to be successful business owners and solopreneurs who want to make their money work for them.\n\nTo work with his group the ideal set up is to have $20k to invest and a high credit score (720 or above is best but 620 and up is possible).\n\nIf you don't have that kind of cash Jason's podcast and his other resources can get you there. You can learn about wholesaling, flipping or other forms of real estate investment to generate that $20k, and then you can take that money and work with his group.\n\nOne of the other resources Jason and his team offers is live workshop trainings. He has one coming up in San Diego at the end of August (2015). The event will teach you how to analyze a market, how to analyze a property, and how to acquire a property. You'll also find out how to manage your property manager and how to manage property from a distance.\n\nJason is offering a special discount for any solopreneur listening to today's episode!

I wanted to hear how his first camp offering went last year, what he's planning to do the second time around and generally find out what's been going on in his world.\n\nLast year was the Good Life Project's first in-person, multi-day event. Jonathan and his team brought 250 people together from around the world to create a unique community experience. The people were mainly entrepreneurs and other movers and shakers who are up to good things in the world, and want to do more!\n\nOver the course of 3.5 days they spent their time learning through workshops, playing through creative and artistic activities and rejuvenating their minds, bodies and spirits.\n\nIt went so well in 2014 Jonathan and his team decided to do it again 2015! In fact they are expanding it to include up to 350 attendees this year, and now have a better idea of what to expect and what to prepare for.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow do you know if you have found the ultimate success?\n\tKill your darlings - what that means and why you have to do it.\n\tWho did he do his first Periscope with?\n\tHow many books does he read in a week?\n\tWhat is maker time vs manager time?\n\tAnd much more.\n\nWe dive into more details on what camp entails for the participants and for Jonathan's team, as well as his thoughts on Periscope. Recently he did his first 'scope with Derek Halpern in Central Park, NYC. The day after he did his own solo outing and showed his viewers' his podcasting set up.\n\nWhen people emailed him and said they were disappointed they missed that show Jonathan wondered why people are on Periscope and what they hope to get out of it. So he asked them on his next 'scope. And they told him: curiosity and community.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have a prediction for the future of Periscope he does see it as a way to build connection, rapport and a deeper level of intimacy with your audience.\n\nAnother way he's building rapport with his audience is his upcoming book. Although he can't tell us the title just yet, he did give us a breakdown of what his day looks like when he's in the midst of writing the manuscript.\n\nHe usually gets up a few hours ahead of his family, meditates and does some breathing exercises before making coffee.\u00a0Once the coffee is made he reads for an hour or two.\n\nBy that point in the morning his family is awake and they have breakfast together. Then he delves into his writing and spends a few hours in creation mode. According to Jonathan none of us have more than a few hours of solid creative focus we can give per day, and right now he invests his time in writing his manuscript.\n\nAnd that leaves his afternoons open for meetings, interviews and non-maker mode activities. He explains what maker mode is and what manager mode is - and how to use each as well as why we need to \"kill our darlings\" as entrepreneurs, and a whole lot more on today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: What do you think is the future of Periscope?\u00a0Let us know in the comments below!\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast?

She started as a cross-country ski racer in Maine, but always had a penchant for fashion.\n\nWe chat live in Studio 86 about her journey from the slopes to the beaches of socal outfitting ladies with custom bespoke Brazilian bikinis.\n\nThis is a great conversation about taking risks, starting small, and persisting until you find the product that the market wants. Check it out on episode 302 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0Joanna Kinsman\nFrom the age of 2.5 Joanna has been an athlete. Her parents introduced her to cross-country sking at that tender age and it shaped who she has become. Learning to practice during\u00a0brutal winters\u00a0Maine took determination and fortitude, but she did it.\n\nWhen it came time to choose a college she went to the University of New Hampshire and continued as a cross-country skier throughout her undergraduate years.\n\nBut throughout all of the practices, competitions and training her dream of being a fashion designer never left her. Her mom was a seamstress to a fashion designer and her dad was an entrepreneur so it's not hard to see where her influences came from!\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat was the first piece she designed?\n\tHow did she get introduced to internet marketing?\n\tWhen did she have her pieces first featured in a fashion show?\n\tWhy does she choose to create custom suits?\n\tHow her accessories line came to fruition.\n\tAnd much more.\n\nBut her path to creating Kinsman Swim was a windy one, as is so often the case for solopreneurs. She always knew she wanted to design\u00a0swimwear, that was her fashion focus. And she started delving deeper into it when she moved to Boston. She became a personal trainer and after about a year and a half she decided to move to San Diego.\n\nRather than waiting for everything to fall perfectly into place, she took action. She bought a one-way ticket to San Diego, sold her car, found a place to sublet near the ocean and she left Boston behind.\n\nWithin a few months of being in town she found a job as an executive assistant, and learned internet marketing in that role.\n\nFrom there it was a matter of timing and connections. Through another work opportunity she connected with a designer in Boston who offered to feature her swimwear if she could get a few samples together in time. Naturally she went for it!\n\nRather than letting what she didn't know hold her back she learned as she went. She didn't know everything about making high-quality bespoke swimwear, she just knew she wanted to do it and she was willing to take calculated risks to figure out.\n\nAnd that's exactly what she did. Today she runs a swimwear business based in San Diego, and makes both custom and stock swimsuit pieces by the sea. She's also branched out into accessories made from bikini string pieces and has a beautiful line called Kini Bands.\n\nWe talk about how she tests her ideas and where Kini Bands in particular came from on today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTION OF THE DAY: Where can you take a calculated risk in your business today?\u00a0Let us know in the comments below!\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast?

They are hustling for their next gig, and always perfecting their craft.\u00a0Joining us today to talk about that hustle is one of the best drummers you've never heard of, Tim \"Figg\" Newton.\n\nOn today's show Tim and I talk about his love of the drums, how to overcome Impostor Syndrome and a solopreneur coaching lesson on making a six-figure income as a drummer. That's all here on episode 301 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0Solopreneur Coaching\nTim is like so many of solopreneurs: he hasn't put himself out there because he thinks he needs to be better. When in fact he really is great at what he does, and he is most certainly good enough to teach others!\n\nThis episode is a lesson in really understanding that most of the time what you know IS enough. All you have to do is know a bit more than the person you're trying to reach. Once you're there you're ready to go out and help other people. You don't have to - and nor should you - wait until you're the very best.\n\nWhether you're a drummer, a musician or not at all musically inclined you can learn from this show; you'll learn how to recognize your own Impostor Syndrome, how to overcome it and whether or not you really do know enough to take action.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhen did Tim get his first gig?\n\tWho taught him how to play?\n\tWhy comparing down is a much better choice than comparing up.\n\tIs it your job to make people learn what you teach?\n\tWhy you don't need to be the best to be a great teacher in your industry.\n\tAnd much more.\n\nTim has a history of hustling. Before he was a teenager Tim was getting paid to play gigs. He grew up on gospel drumming and it shows; he's one of the foremost experts on gospel chops today.\n\nBut he has gone the route of so many other talented musicians and solopreneurs: he focuses on his craft, not marketing what he already knows.\n\nWhen I ask him about on this episode we have a chance to dive into his own doubts and self-criticism - something we have talked about on this show many times, The Impostor Syndrome.\n\nYou know you suffer from it if that voice in your head is always telling you not to do something because you aren't good enough. Tim's voice has been telling him he has to be one of the best before he can really put himself out there.\u00a0So rather than marketing his skills and his knowledge ala Mike Johnston, he plays as many gigs as he can.\n\nWhile that's a good choice it doesn't generate a lot of cash. Tim loves it because he gets to make a living playing the skins - what drummer wouldn't want that?!\n\nBut there are several alternatives that would allow him to still play drums and play plenty of gigs (and be particular about the gigs he plays), but make a healthy income. And on today's show Tim gets a live coaching session\u00a0about what those alternatives are and which ones appeal to him.\n\nI also break down a step by step plan for implementing some of those options, and check in to see what Tim thinks about the whole concept!

If we can dream it up and build it, we can make money at it. A great example of this is none other than Kenyon Salo, Checklist Destroyer at The Bucket List Life.\n\nKenyon joined us previously for episode 160 and\u00a0shared his background, and that leaves us wide open to talk about for today's show! We chat about his thriving\u00a0income from Airbnb and how his brand The Bucket List Life helps his network marketing business. Check it out on episode 299 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0Earning With Airbnb\nAs the leader of The Bucket List Life he helps people fulfill items on their bucket list. He's also active in extreme sports like skydiving, BASE jumping and rock climbing. All of those activities take him around the globe so he came up with the brilliant idea to rent out his home while he was away.\n\nLike any great solopreneur he learned through trial and error about what it would take to make his place a premium rental...and he's turned that knowledge into 5 figures a month with Airbnb.\n\nHe's done so by paying attention to the details: having his home clean, with fully stocked amenities and little touches like instructions on how to use different appliances, etc. He also leaves a bottle of wine for every visit along with a hand-written welcome note and two glasses to share that bottle. He's found taking the time to do those extra gestures earns him rave reviews on the site, and the ability to charge a premium price for his home.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHas Kenyon ever worked in Corporate America?\n\tThe power of community and the role it's played in his success.\n\tHow should you price your rental on Airbnb?\n\tWhat skydiving record would he like to break?\n\tHow did Kenyon get into extreme sports?\n\tAnd much more.\n\nOne of the benefits to renting on Airbnb is the ability to determine when he'll rent, to whom he'll rent and when he wants to be at home. He'll make his home unavailable for a few months in the winter, and then rent it out during the summer for extended periods of time.\n\nDoing so gives him the added incentive to take road trips and make travel plans - he has to leave because someone else is coming to his place! When he visited us for today's show he was on an extended road trip through California, and people were renting his home back in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nAnd if you think you have to live in a destination location like Boulder or San Diego think again. People are coming to your town for reasons you can't even think of: they may have a work conference, a family wedding, or any other number of possibilities.\n\nWhen asked if he worries about bad things happening he says he makes his deposits high - you have control over your deposit, cleaning fees, and how much you'll charge for a night with Airbnb - and trusts his instincts. He doesn't have to rent to someone just because they are interested. Plus Airbnb has insurance, and so should you.\n\nWe also spend time talking about how building a community with The Bucket List Life has supported his network marketing business, and he graciously answers your questions live on air.

Even if this isn't in our natural wheelhouse it's something we can all step into - and apply what we learn in the process\u00a0to every other area of our lives.\n\nRejoining the show to talk about how we can apply performance principles to steal the show on and off the stage\u00a0is the one and only Michael Port. It's all here on episode 298 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0How to Steal The Show\nMichael Port, if you missed his previous appearance on this show, is a former\u00a0actor and multiple New York Times best-selling author who has taken lessons learned from the world of performance and translated them into everyday life.\n\nOn today's episode we talk about tried and true techniques to get your point across,\u00a0six performance principles as well as a bit about his upcoming book, Steal The Show.\n\nOne of the first things to keep in mind is the need for authenticity. The second is to create your persona and the life you truly want to live. While these may sound contradictory Michael explains why they are not. It's simply a matter of bringing the best parts of yourself front and center.\n\nFor instance do you want to be bold but for some reason you don't always act boldly? Then imagine yourself as bold, tap into that feeling within you and act accordingly.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWho are the greatest performers in the world and why?\n\tWhere does real self-expression come from?\n\tWhy talent is NOT the differentiating factor in a great performer.\n\tThe one thing to keep in mind during any interview.\n\tWhy you really do know enough.\n\tAnd much more.\n\nMichael and I go into detail on how to\u00a0create yourself as the person you most want to be and do so authentically. This in essence is an actor's job: to create a reality and make it real in their performance. And it's what solopreneurs can do to bring forth the life they truly desire.\n\nWe also talk about the key to being comfortable with criticism and then we dive into some principles of performance.\n\nThere are six main performance principles:\n\n1. Get a\u00a0clear objective.\nWhat do you want and why do you want it?\n\n2. Act as if you.\nThis we touched on a bit earlier - act as if you have what you want and you are being who you want to be.\n\n3. Raise the stakes.\nYou have to be willing to take some calculated risks to create the person and the life you're going after.\n\n4. Say yes and.\nThis is a principles we've talked about on the show previously and it comes from the world of improv. By saying yes and we are improving upon the conversation and keeping the juices flowing; a simple no or a denial shuts down any movement.\n\n5. Be in the moment.\nDevelop good listening skills to be present with the people and the world around you. And being in the moment will help you evolve and adapt as the world changes.\n\n6. Choose early and choose often.\nGet yourself a coach before you are confused and overwhelmed and have explored multiple paths. Hire someone before you think you need to.\n\nMichael and I give you a real-world example of how to put these six principles into play on this episode.

We've got everything from the best protein powder to how to utilize whiteboard videos on this episode so let's get to 'em!\n\nTony\nQ: How many people do you currently have in your mastermind group Sololab? How do you mange that number of people and what is the approximate annual turnover of people through the group?\n\nA: Right now we have around 60. My current cap is around 70, 80 was too much! Most people stay in for 3 quarters or so on average.\n\nJJ Mayo\u00a0\nQ: Thanks for answering my question on the show. Very cool! I'm a college professor looking to move out of higher ed. It's going downhill fast IMHO. I want to take some of my university sports nutrition courses online.\n\nAs you know nutrition is not that much different between sports. Thats why I was asking if Fuel for Endurance was too broad. I could create online courses that have the same information with different covers.\n\nThere are a ton of training plans out there but few if any nutrition programs for endurance athletes. Will definitely look to upscale my logo and check out SoloLab. Thanks again for time!\n\nA: The marketplace is ready for something unique for endurance athletes, there's not much out there to support that sport. Consider creating something to help joint and muscle breakdown for aging endurance athletes - that would be a great benefit.\n\nDave Mac Arthur\u00a0\nQ: I want to know EXACTLY what to do to look like that at 50!\u00a0 #detailsbob\n\nA: Set up your system, get to where you know what you're eating and prepare yourself. In the morning Drew eats oatmeal with flax seed, 1/2 cup of nuts, protein powder of some sort, frozen fruit and almond milk. Great protein and great carbs - that's it. For lunch is chicken breast on a salad. Simply it's some form of protein with vegetables, ideally organic chicken and some form of vegetables. That's a basic winning strategy.\n\nWorkouts are upper body and lower body workouts, focus on big muscle groups and pay attention to joints (push-ups versus curls). If you want a great muscle burn with muscle mass do your exercises slower. Take a day off in between; Drew works out 4 times a week.\n\n\u2028Ellen Reaves\u00a0\nQ: What's the best protein powder if you want to lose weight?\n\nA: There's no one product that's the holy grail but if you had to pick one go with whey protein.\n\nThom Singer\u00a0\nQ: Did you do any meaningful follow up after WD conference - we all know the follow up after an event is key -- but most get busy and don't take actions. What did you do?\n\nA: My goal was to connect with a few interesting guests and I have done that. I have one scheduled, working on another and waiting to hear back from a third.\n\n\u2028Sean Gilgore\u00a0\nQ: Divorce and being a solo entrepreneur.

Anna is a talented actress and voiceover artist who knows what it takes to create a successful career in Hollywood; she knows the good, the bad and the challenge\u00a0of it all.\n\nToday we cover what a typical day is like for her - there isn't one! Some days she's on set by 6:30am, other days she's recording voiceovers in her home studio and yet other days she's auditioning for various parts.\n\nTypically those roles come in through her agent now but in the beginning she had to do a lot of hustling to create work for herself.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's her link to Young and The Restless?\n\tWhat's a water cooler show?\n\tA table read vs a workshop: what's the difference?\n\tWhat two things do you need to make it in hollywood?\n\tAnd much more.\n\nAnna also gives us the update on the pilot she and her husband were pitching. After her last visit to The Solopreneur Hour, their pilot was well-received around town. Someone suggested they make a web series with it.\n\nShe and her husband thought that was a good idea so they continued to pitch it, but as a web series. Soon they had signed a 3-month contract with a studio to do so.\n\nAs it often goes in Hollywood they waited, and waited. And nothing happened with their pilot. So the contract expired and they just got the rights back, now they're deciding what to do next.\n\nThey may run a Kickstarter campaign and raise the money themselves to shoot it. They could also find a producer with ties to the various networks and pitch it with that person as part of the deal. There are plenty of options and avenues, the point is they're persevering as all great solopreneurs do!\n\nWe also talk about it what it's like being on set. Anna says it's generally a long day with a lot of waiting around, not nearly as glamorous as many people think it is.\n\nAnd often the actors have to rehearse and be tapped into their characters from the very start because shooting isn't done in a linear way. Typically scenes will be shot based on location and availability, even time of day.\n\nThat means\u00a0if the location of the final scene (or any other scene) is only available at the start of production they will shoot that scene then - not in sequential order like you might expect. It's called block shooting and it's the way most films and TV shows are shot.\n\nThe takeaway again is that as an actor you must be prepared from the very beginning, just as other solopreneurs must be ready from the start!\u00a0Listen in to hear more from Anna on the wild, wild world of Hollywood and solopreneurship.\u00a0See you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\nPlease Visit Our Sponsor To Support The Show!\nHostgator\u00a0-\u00a030% Off\u00a0Hosting and Free Website Transfer\n\n\nSelected Links and Resources From This Episode\nLearn more\u00a0about\u00a0Anne Vocino\nAnne Vocino's previous visits to The Solopreneur Hour\nAnne Vocino\u00a0on the Twitter\nAnna as the voice of the chipmunk on Young and The Restless\nSololab, a Unique Mastermind", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/296.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Anna Vocino", "Career Advice", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1437377326, "title": "295: How To Set Up Your Solopreneur Business 101", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to episode 295 of The Solopreneur Hour! Ladies and gentlemen in this very actionable episode, I walk you step by step with how I set up all of my solopreneur ventures.\n\nI cover every stage of the process from email to account setup to wordpress to branding, etc.\n\nIt's all here for you, listen in, take notes and apply it to your next solopreneur business.\nMore About Solopreneur Business\nThe first thing I do when starting any new endeavor for myself or my clients is to\u00a0search for the new domain name. You'll need email, and\u00a0new accounts for hosting.\n\nThe second step is to check the availability of all\u00a0the social media outlets with that new company name. You're just checking availability at this stage.\n\nSo I make sure Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and the rest of the usual suspects are available. Sometimes I've had to get creative and come up with abbreviations or shorter versions of the business' name. Like with this show it's Twitter account is @solohour\u00a0and so is its Instagram account.\n\nThe next stage of this is to\u00a0go to gmail and get the email account for that biz. This will be your general catch-all acount, make it simple and keep in mind you'll be handing this off to a VA in the future.\n\nFourth is to actually lock down those social media outlets we talked about in step two. You know they're available so sign up and acquire those accounts for your business.\n\nThis next step is a big one: you need a brand. And the\u00a0best way to get it is to define your avatar, your target market, and write up a creative brief (google it to find an example). you're going to hand the creative brief off to a designer and they'll create a logo for you. The logo is just one aspect of your brand but it's important to nail that aspect along with all the others.\n\nSixth is your web site and your web site's hosting. There are lots of options out there but I use HostGator because of their malware removal, automatic back ups and overall great protection at a great price. See the resources section below for some options.\n\nNow we're getting towards the finish line - once your web site is up and hosted you'll need an email provider and a way to capture the emails of your visitors. There are loads of options here again. I like Aweber for my email provider and I use LeadPages right now.\n\nYou can choose from Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Aweber, Infusionsoft, and others for your email provider.\n\nAnd I also recommend OptimizePress for lead capture.\n\nThe final step is to pick your platform. You can't be everywhere and communicate with everyone - nor should you.\n\nBut you should pick one platform to focus on and let all the others be ancillary. Are you going to podcast or use video to connect with your tribe? What about social media or public speaking? Maybe blogging is your thing, or self-publishing or even traditional marketing.\n\nChoose one, get great at it and build your audience there. You can branch out but let that one platform be your primary focus.\n\nAnd that kids is how I start my a new solopreneur business!

If you could get one ultimate guest on the show, who would it be and why?Let's start the campaign to get him/her on!\nA: Hines Ward, Tony Hawk, Chris Hardwick are all people I'd love to have on the show! But above all others right now I'd love to have John Mayer here.\n\nBrian Lofrumento\u00a0\nQ: What's the one action you're going to take in your business that you picked up from WDS 2015?\nP.S. It was awesome meeting you!\nA: My favorite messages were from Darren Sivers of CD-Baby. I hope to have him on the show; I loved his message of keeping trying until something works.\n\nThom Singer\u00a0\nQ: What was the best business advice you learned at World Domination Summit - and why should others attend that event?\nA: If you want to be a forward-thinking person surround yourself with others and Portland is fun! And continuing with Derek's messaging to answer your first part of your question, be transparent and be available for people.\n\n\u2028Steve Zellers\u00a0\nQ: What are some of your best ideas around prioritizing and finishing things? I have so many plates spinning that sometimes I just stop.\nA: It's not my strong suit but I'll say if you love what you're doing enough it's not going to stop! You'll keep at it. I also love the idea of swallow the frog: the first thing you do at the beginning of the day is the thing you're most dreading. Do that and feel good, then move on to the rest of your day.\n\n\u2028Travis Royboy Scanlan\u00a0\nQ: My podcast \"Chrome Pipes & Pinstripes\" is all about getting stories out of hot rodders, car builders, artists, etc.\n\nSince it launched its been on an aggregated \"network\" feed and never on its own. So I've never had the New And Noteworthy bump. Would you put the show on it's own feed? My 66th episode comes out today.\nA: I'm frankly offended I haven't been invited to be on the show! Just kidding. To answer your question definitely make your own show with your own RSS feed. Give yourself 6-9 months from there.\n\n\u2028Mark R. LePage\u00a0\nQ: Who was the most inspiring person that you met at WDS (on or off stage)? Why?\nA: The most inspiring was Kid President and his dad and his handler Brad. He was a very inspirational dude, very sweet and funny!\n\n\u2028Brad Brown\u00a0\nQ: Is Chris Froome doping?\nA: I don't know. I haven't watched one stage of this, I clocked out when they took Lance's titles away. The rest of his accomplishments were swept under the rug and I was bummed out by that.\n\n\u2028Robert Bone\nQ: I started blogging about a hobby of mine a few months back and started to build a Twitter following, and because of how it has evolved it's now looking like I'll be entering the world of podcasting.\n\nThe problem is my Twitter username is more geared towards website & blog.\u00a0Should I change my Twitter name to something more relevant, or start a new account from scratch?\nA: I don't know your Twitter name so I'm not sure. But in general if you have less than 1,000 followers you can start a new account - just make sure it's easy to read and easy to remember.\n\n\u2028Muttaqi Ismail\u00a0\nQ: Hey Mike, love the show and I love making these whiteboard videos.

Those ideas come and go ALL the time for each of us.\u00a0 The bad news? I've Even if you're successful the ideas will continue to come.\n\nThe good news? With a bit of focus, you can make one thing profitable before you move on to the next. And that's what you should do, that's the path to success. Follow one idea, get it humming along and then move on to the next one.\n\nThat's the first half of the show and for\u00a0the second half I revived an oldie but goodie: \u00a0you're probably in sales but don't realize it. Check it out on episode 293 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show - And Sales!\nNow that this show has found its rhythm and hit its stride I've been exploring other ideas. As a solopreneur I am inundated with ideas and opportunities; some of them I see and others come across my path.\n\nIn this episode, I talk about what my newest solopreneur venture looks like, and how no matter where you are on the timeline the same things bugging you right now will bug you a bit later.\n\nBut before you can get to the point of exploring those other ideas\u00a0you need to focus on one thing\u00a0and make it work. It's easy to get distracted with the next shiny object, but don't! This is where a coach can be so valuable. They will keep you on track and on point to reach your goals with that particular idea.\n\nYou'll Also Discover on Today's Show:\n\n\tHow many platforms are there to choose from to build your brand?\n\tWhat do you need to be successful in any other sales situation?\n\tThe value of receiving permission.\n\n\tHow can you structure your response to engage and get permission?\n\n\tHow NOT to pitch yourself: a real-life example.\n\tAnd much more!\n\nOnce that idea is solid and the business from it is running smoothly, then look at your other ideas and start exploring.\n\nBut no matter where you are with your next solopreneur ideas there's one thing you have to understand for financial success: you're in sales.\n\nYea, you read that right. The dreaded \u201cS Word\u201d. We are indoctrinated to think that, by default, being in sales is \u201ccheesy\u201d. It\u2019s that kind of thinking that keeps us from achieving the goals we really want to achieve with our finances, and our overall lifestyles.\n\nIn this solo show, I break down the sales cycle. It is simply this: sales is about\u00a0disseminating the right information at the right pace at the right time. Understand who you are speaking to and what they need BEFORE you talk about your product and service. \n\nYou wouldn't simply approach a girl at a bar and tell her how great you are would you? Of course not. The way you present your business in any situation is the same. Whether you're posting on social media or you're speaking with people at a networking event, spewing out how great your product or service is isn't going to win you any new clients or friends - so don't do it.\n\nSo what's the right way to engage, connect and get people's permission to share your information? I detail it on today's show, tune in to find out!

Storytelling is the cornerstone of good, entertaining content from presentations to speeches to copy - all things solopreneurs need in their businesses.\n\nOne man who knows how to tell a great story is\u00a0David Nihill of 7 Comedy Habits.\n\nOn today's show he and I have a great chat about growing up in Ireland, what makes a speaker great, and how a normal person can tune their presentations to be funnier. Enjoy today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Storytelling\nMany\u00a0people think\u00a0the art of storytelling and the craft of public speaking either come\u00a0naturally or they don't, but our conversation today\u00a0proves it's a learned process. We also help you\u00a0begin your journey of being the funniest, most entertaining person in the room!\n\nGrowing up in Ireland David learned firsthand why storytelling and comedy are so important to business, friendship and any type of human interaction. The Irish as a whole are a storytelling people. Visit the country sometime and you'll experience it yourself - people are more interested in who you are (i.e. your stories) than what you do.\n\nDavid also discovered the value of comedy in coping with everyday life. Again the Irish as a whole are a funny group of people who have seen tremendous adversity throughout their existence. And they've mastered the art of telling a joke (or \"taking the piss\" as they say) to find relief from their troubles.\n\nIt wasn't until David's friend Jack Kavanaugh severely injured his spinal column that he began honing these skills however. To raise funds for Jack,\u00a0David and his mates through a comedy fundraiser. They nominated David to be the emcee; he was always telling jokes and stories so they thought he'd be a natural at it. He was terrified, but decided what Jack\u00a0was facing was far worse than David's own fears so he went for it.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's the key to telling a great story?\n\tThe link between tragedy and comedy.\n\tCan you learn to be funny?\n\tWhat is punching up?\n\tWhat you should NEVER say in a speech or interview.\n\tAnd much more.\n\nAfter they still weren't getting any publicity for spinal column injuries and they were stumped as to why: they hired great PR people to help them, contacted loads of publications but no one ran with it.\n\nSo when his girlfriend encouraged him to try out for NPR's The Moth, David again put his fears aside and went for it, and he was amazed when he won. But that meant an even greater challenge for him: to speak at their national gathering in front of 1400 people!\n\nIt went so well someone from the event gave David's talk to a TED Talk producer. That producer contacted David. David was flattered but what he really wanted was for his friend's story, the one in the wheelchair who started all of this, to be told.\n\nDavid connected them and his friend went on to give a TED Talk. But not just any TED Talk; his friend spoke, then stood up at the end (remember he wasn't supposed to stand or walk again) and proposed to his girlfriend.\n\nFrom these experiences David realized the importance of storytelling. If he and his friend Jack hadn't first shared their own stories they could never have gotten the message to the world about spinal column injuries and healing from those injuries. Today they have both gone on to speak and make an impact in the world.\n\nOn today's show David tells us some of the keys to being funny and engaging when speaking or creating content: make yourself likeable first and foremost, then tell a story that everyone can relate to and see themselves in.\n\nHe also recommends writing down your stories and your bits. Then record yourself speaking them, and listen. Get it transcribed if you can and read where you're adding extra content. What fat can be trimmed to make your stories relatable, engaging, funny and to the point?\n\nHe's learned in comedy every three lines should be a punchline, something to make people laugh, or they'll get bored.", "duration": "1:15:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/292.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Comedian", "David Nihill", "Great Books", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "Comedy", "Public speaking", "Storytelling"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1436511349, "title": "291: Q&A from Portland with Special Guest Jessica Shaanan", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey guys and gals!

Joining us to talk about this very topic is the brilliant (and hunky) Eli Wilhide.\n\nWe have a great chat about growing up in a tough environment, winning the lottery (it's true!) and how he came to speak over 2500 times with Tony Robbins on episode 290 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nEli Wilhide wasn't born into many advantages. By the age of 2 his blue-collar working father was in a wheelchair and by the time he was 5 he and his mom were living on their own barely scraping by. His hometown in eastern Maryland wasn't the best place to grow up. KKK rallies were held there and as Eli describes it, he lived in a bad neighborhood in a bad town in a bad part of Maryland.\n\nBut one day all of that changed: his mom came home from her waitressing job beaming. And she sat Eli down and told him the amazing news: they had won the lottery. She was going to make sure he went to college and she was going to go too. And they did.\n\nAlthough Eli didn't know what he wanted to do exactly he studied kinesiology and nutrition. He loved those areas and wanted to find a way to help people, his other passion.\n\nOn today's show Eli shares how his journey after college led him to Los Angeles which led him to Tony Robbins. He also talks about how he persistently pursued Tony's company until they agreed to give him a job! He was so determined and so clear in his pursuit he made that opportunity come true.\n\nYou'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow much of their lottery winnings did his mom give away?\n\tWhy he lived in a tent outside Boulder for 8 months!\n\n\tWhat's the #1 thing you can do to be successful according to Eli?\n\n\tHow many seminars has Eli given for Tony Robbins' company?\n\tThe Competency - Confidence Loop: what is it and how can you utilize it?\n\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nAnd that's one of the biggest lessons from today's show and one of the main points Eli shares: get clear on what you want and be so certain of it that you actually make it happen in your life.\n\nWhile he never purports that to be an easy task he does say it is how we create what we want in our lives.\n\nSo how do we actually create that level of belief? Eli tells us: everyone has two primary thoughts to work past and they are the belief that we are not enough and the belief that we will not be loved.\n\nThe simplest way to overcome these beliefs is to get a coach. And to work out every single the day. By working out he doesn't mean just physical exercise, he means mental and emotional as well. Find something you can do every day to strengthen your mental and emotional muscles and build certainty; by doing so you can overcome those limiting beliefs of not being enough and not being loved.\n\nCheck out today's episode to also hear Eli's take on how he does this for himself every day, and how he went from being a self-professed \"weird kid\" who didn't talk much to being a professional motivational speaker and coach today!

Rather than listen to the fears and doubts in her mind, she shared her dreams with people she trusted who encouraged her to go for it.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhether or not Amy has a Harley tattoo.\n\tHow much Amy studied to learn what she knows now.\n\tWhen Amy became \u201cunemployable\u201d.\n\tWhere she went for inspiration and training at the beginning of her career.\n\tHow much she loves (or doesn\u2019t) public speaking.\n\tWhat a day in the life of Amy Porterfield looks like.\n\nBut rather than jump feet first into the content creation pool, she started out as a consultant. She did a lot of 1 on 1 work with clients while she honed her social media skills and her taste for online marketing. After about 18 months of client work she fired them all and went full speed into online marketing.\n\nHer first product was a course teaching authors how to market their book online using social media. Although she didn't have a published book of her own she had worked with several authors including Tony Robbins (obviously), T Harv Eker and Deepak Chopra. So she had authority and knowledge in her area. Her first step was to offer a free webinar and give content away, and she promoted that webinar using social media like Facebook ads, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.\n\nFor her first webinar 25 people showed up (50 had registered), but things hadn't gone as planned. She had nowhere to send her attendees to buy her product! Something had gotten lost in translation during her outsourcing and her site wasn't ready. So she used email marketing to follow up and make sales when it was.\n\nBut the point was she took action and went for it, even if things weren't absolutely perfect. And she made sales! She remembers selling 15-20 courses at just under $200 each so she made a few thousand dollars on her first attempt.\n\nToday that's the strategy she sticks with: promote a free webinar on social media, deliver the webinar and offer a product for sale at the end. She says she's a simple girl and wants to stick with what works - and that strategy has been working for her!\n\nAmy also shares what she recommends doing and resources she suggests if you are on launching your product and are on a shoestring budget. She's got some killer advice on that topic! Plus we get into what she does on a daily basis to set herself up for success, and why she believes in giving yourself some breathing room between products throughout your calendar year.

Welcome to another edition of Find Your Swing\u2122. We're bringing back the one, the only Dawn Marrs (dot com).\n\nIt's been quite awhile since Dawn and I have done one of these shows together, and I've missed having her on! She's like our favorite pair of gloves, a perfect fit. And our perfect fit has returned for episode 288 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0How To Find Your Swing\u00a0(Solopreneur Coaching)\nFor those of you new to these shows, the Find Your Swing episodes are all about YOU! You write in with your background, hobbies, passions and potential business ideas and we read them on air, then give you our feedback.\n\nWe'll help you figure out what your next step is if you're currently in business, or if you need ideas on how to meld your skills and interests we'll give you some of those too. In short we'll help you find your swing with some solopreneur coaching.\n\nOn today's show we hear from several of you, including a listener with a background in exercise science, a flash animator who has made a career in Hollywood, and someone with a tech blog already underway...plus a few more!\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's happening with the main co-host of the show?\n\tThe importance of avatars, no matter how successful you are.\n\tWhen do you actually know enough to start your business?\n\tHow to use modeling properly, without being a clone.\n\tA stellar business idea we give away.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOur listener from Hollywood\u00a0is currently\u00a0a flash animator and has been a caricature artist as well as an animator for Disney. He is truly a creative artist, and most of his hobbies and passions revolve around guitars. We have multiple pieces of advice for him today: create a course or product showing people how to make custom guitars, or teach them something with an online course to bring in passive income.\n\nAnother suggestion I make for our flash animator friend is to have a podcast interviewing people like him who have made a career in Hollywood in unusual or niche jobs. It's a great way to tap into that market that wants to work in Hollywood, but not necessarily as an actor, director or producer.\n\nWe also hear from a listener with a tech blog. He's been blogging for years and has a tremendous amount of content. I recommend he double down on what he already has built, get some tips from Copyblogger and grow his audience. He should post regularly, create an actual schedule and also generate a wider readership by guest blogging on other tech sites. Dawn recommends he go through the process of creating an avatar so he can specifically target his people for a higher return on his time and efforts.\n\nI'd also like to see him spruce up his current site, bring on a professional web site designer and clean up the site a bit. He should have a Contact Me or Work With Me page while he's changing things around. What he has is good, now with a few adjustments he can make it even better and really focus on growing and monetizing his audience.\n\nThose are just a few of the people we hear from on today's Find Your Swing!

When we add to the mix\u00a0intention, focus and commitment we can create a movement. Here to share how he has created his own and what led up to its creation is Wesley Chapman of A Human Project.\n\nOn today's show Wes shares what's been happening since his last visit to the show and what A Human Project is all about, on this episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About How to Create a Movement\nWes has been on the show twice now and we went headlong into his past, and how he's created tremendous success in his life despite an incredibly difficult\u00a0upbringing. We discussed extensively what that was like for him and how it's shaped who he is and what does. To hear all of that\u00a0go here.\n\nToday's episode is a culmination of his previous visits, Wes has married his horrific childhood and his business acumen to create A Human Project. A Human Project is a for-purpose organization designed to\u00a0empower youth from any type of dysfunctional situation, whether it's an abusive home life, feelings of depression and thoughts of suicide, school bullying, or any other difficulty.\n\nWes shares openly about the lives he's touching, why he set the audacious goal of impacting 25 million lives, where this entire movement started and what's next for A Human Project.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy did he create A Human Project?\n\tWes explains his goal of impacting 25 million lives.\n\tTrue or false: he did 360 interviews last year.\n\tThe importance of attention and appreciation.\n\tWhy core business principles always apply.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nAfter reaching high levels of achievement in business and entrepreneurship Wes was looking for more. He knew inside he was meant for more than just financial success and recognition, and he went in search of it.\n\nHe tried to be a motivational speaker, but that didn't really fit. Nothing was \"it\" until one day he spoke to a group of 6th, 7th and 8th graders, many of whom were living through nightmares. They were suicidal, they were physically cutting themselves, others were being bullied and being set on fire by their classmates...the terrifying list goes on.\n\nAnd after he spoke to them the principal asked him to stay a bit longer. When Wes agreed the principal showed him a line of a few hundred students waiting to speak with him. He had resonated with them, and spent the next four hours sitting knee to knee with them and listening to their stories, offering help and resources for each and every one of them.\n\nWithin hours his email Inbox was filling up and text messages were pouring in from these kids sharing what they had started working on since seeing him earlier that day. One girl in particular sent him a length and detailed text message describing how she had intended to kill herself that day, but after hearing Wes speak and talking with him she didn't. The final line of her text message read: You saved my life today.\n\nWes was overcome with emotion, and fell to his knees. He and his significant other, Jodi, decided in that moment it was time to do something on a much larger scale; they were going to positively impact these kids and create a movement in the process.\n\nFor the next 3 days Wes didn't sleep; he got on the phone with everyone he knew from Les Brown to John Lee Dumas and began sharing what he was committed to creating. And with their support and Wes' tireless efforts A Human Project was born.\n\nToday he has created online programs for kids around the globe, and by 2016 there will be a summer camp for these children. In this episode he shares the dire situations of the children he's helping with A Human Project, and why it's such a deeply personal mission and calling for him.\n\nThis is an episode that will touch your heart, and show you the positive impact for-profit businesses can have on human causes, and the difference one person truly can make in the world.", "duration": "1:11:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/287.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Wesley Chapman", "A Human Project", "Gary Vaynerchuk", "Wes Chapman"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1435565278, "title": "286: Find Your Swing (Solopreneur Coaching), with Special Guest Matthew Kimberley", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Solopreneurs! Thanks for joining us on another installment of Find Your Swing (Solopreneur Coaching). It's been a minute! I've missed doing these with you all so I'm extra excited to bring these type of shows\u00a0back.\n\nToday's episode brings us an extra special co-host, Matthew Kimberley from episode 274. I say extra special because it's his first (and hopefully first in a long line of many) FYS co-hosting spots, and it was also his birthday on the day we recorded this show.\n\nPlus he's got the best podcasting voice of any non-podcaster out there so\u00a0tune in to hear him and our solopreneur coaching! Episode 286 is all about helping you find your swing on The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0How To Find Your Swing\u00a0(Solopreneur Coaching)\nFor those of you who have been with us for awhile you know how these Find Your Swing (Solopreneur Coaching)\u00a0episodes go: you send in your skill set, your background and your passions and we give you our thoughts on how you could create a viable solopreneurial business based on the info you provide.\n\nWe also provide solopreneur coaching if you're stuck in your business and not sure how to get over a particular obstacle, or how to best grow your business from where you are.\n\nIn short, we hear from you about where you are on your timeline, what's holding you back and we give you advice to move forward. Your mileage may vary but we do our best to give you our soundest suggestions and encouragement to get things rocking or keep things rolling.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's the law of reciprocity?\n\tThe simple way to get everything you want.\n\tWhat is jorkyball?\n\tAre you meant to serve everyone?\n\tIs it ever a good idea to marry two different business ideas?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOn today's show Matthew and I help one listener turn his love of the outdoors and natural living into a wilderness camp for kids and/or a camp on how to be a man. Our listener has always dreamt of having his own out-in-the-wild type camp, especially for kids. And Matthew breaks down how he can do this, WITHOUT relying heavily on the Internet.\n\nWe hear from another follower who has a background in insurance, and in sales. Matthew and I offer suggestions on how to bridge the gap between where's he at now (being an employee) to the land of solopreneurship. Sometimes it's simply about taking what you know and creating a business of service with it.\n\nThere are a few others we hear from on this episode but the final two we'll touch on here are employees in the medical arena.\n\nThe first is someone who works in sports medicine offices helping people rehab injuries and using yoga therapy techniques to do so. She also loves to write and edit, and is considering how to make a career combing these passions. We recommend she create her own methodology, trademark it and train other practitioners how to use her methodology. A great strategy is to follow what Bikram Choudhury did to create the Bikram Yoga system\u00a0and culture.\n\nAnd finally is our CT specialist (that is short for CAT scan) who has started his solopreneur journey much like Matt began his. Our recommendation for him is to STOP building what he's been building. Then ask and answer the following questions:\u00a0who do you want to serve, what do you want to do for them and how are you going to serve them? Once he's done that he can start building again.\n\nThose are just a few of the people we hear from on today's Find Your Swing!

We (and by we I mean the Royal We or me) also talk about how Dexter is doing and who's gonna care for him while I'm recovering.\n\nBut instead of giving you the summary let's just dig\u00a0into your questions and my answers, shall we?\n\nAdrien Hd Gamory\nQ: What kind've surgery are you undergoing?\nA: If you've listened to the show before you've probably heard our ever-present co-host, my cough. After countless doctor visits they suggested I get my deviated septum repaired, put stints in my nose and trim my uvula. It's a painful recovery, especially the uvula portion. I'm not looking forward to that, please send well wishes!\n\nQ: How to mentally get away from the overly saturated anonymous salesmen of buying into every tom, dick, and harry that sends a million dollar dream into your email, and how to effectively find the one's you need to listen to before you invest a ton of money on diluted products or advice that amount to nothing for your personal and business value.\nA: The best way to figure out who you want to coach with is to consume their content. Figure out if you like their style and you like how they deliver then sign up with them. Check out the next episode, 286, for more on this.\n\nJonny Keeley\nQ: Hey Michael. You've shared your journey and what exactly goes into creating a very professional podcast. Two questions what is your take on narrative podcasts - \"serial\", gimlet media's podcasts, etc. Also what goes into producing such a produced show?\nThanks and hope all will be well with your surgery.\n\nA: I've been saying for a year and a half that the pros are coming. Right now it's easy enough to get a podcast out there so everyone thinks they can do it. But not everyone is going to have the success that John Lee Dumas has, but depending on your skill set and what you create you might find success.\n\nNow the pros are here and I think narrative podcasts can be great and very successful. But they are a TON of work! Go back and listen to episode 200. It took me 18 hours to edit, and I didn't utter one word. It'd be hard for an amateur to do it and get traction. That being said I think they are cool and narrative storytelling requires a pro.\n\nParvinder Nijjar\nQ: Who will be looking after Dexter while you\u2019re recovering?\nA: I'll be with him, and depending on my recovery Jessica and Lara will help out if needed.\n\nDaryl Ramage\nQ: Take care.\nA: Thank you, much appreciated!\n\nMark R. LePage\nQ: What's the next project for the 911?\nA: Good timing Mark. I've decided to sell my motor and am upgrading to a 3.6 L from a 1995 Porsche 993. It's a 273 horsepower engine! With a few modifications I can get that to 300 HP, this can be a 3 second zero to 60 car when all is said and done. Follow me on Instagram to see it happen!\n\nQ: What's the status on your watches and cars podcast?\nA: I'm having a hard time finding a co-host!

If you didn't hear that episode find it here and get more of his backstory on that show.\n\nAs a brief recap Jordan and his team at The AOC have been around for nearly 9 years now, and they are one of the top podcasts in all of iTunes. They are consistently #1 in the Marketing and Management category, and in the top 10 of all shows. It's been nearly a decade in the making but they are THE source for helping guys become live better lives and become better men.\n\nOn this episode Jordan shares why The AOC was started, what he considers before booking a guest, and some of the latest trends in podcasting today.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat family member\u00a0thought of the name The Art of Charm\n\tWhy mastering people skills matters more than any technical skill.\n\tWhat famous game show host was kidnapped by the Prince of Indonesia?\n\tHow has he evolved as the show has grown?\n\tWhere do some of his best guests come from?\n\tWhat was previously the best \"men's magazine\"\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nThe Art of Charm was started because Jordan learned from a mentor that people skills are a much greater factor in determining a person's success than any other skill set. He began studying psychology and learning more about how best to connect, grow and develop relationships.\n\nHe also realized men didn't have a reliable, sound source for advice and information on life, career, love\u00a0and relationships. Seeing an opportunity he and his business partner A.J. developed The Art of Charm; and today the brand provides a podcast, programs and bootcamps all designed to help guys become extraordinary men.\n\nNow that The Art of Charm has grown into a worldwide phenomenon Jordan has developed a process to vetting the guests he brings on The AOC podcast. He fully admits to feeling a great deal of responsibility for the content the podcast shares, because of which he is very hands-on when researching each guest for the show.\n\nIn that research process his first and foremost concern is whether or not the guest's story is of interest to him. Jordan knows his listeners will find it interesting if he does, that's his first litmus test. His second is to look at people's social media presence and their following. That piece isn't a deal breaker, unless the guest claims to be an online expert and has no social media followers!\n\nBy and large some of his best guests have been referrals from listeners; listeners who know someone personally with a really great story that's relevant and noteworthy for The Art of Charm audience. And Jordan and I both agree when someone makes a guest suggestion for his show or this one one of the best ways to know if a story is relevant is to listen to previous episodes.\n\nWe also talk about the fact that the professionals and celebrities are now in podcasting, as we predicted on his first visit to the show. We discuss why that's a good thing, and what it means for the future.

Welcome to episode 283 of The Solopreneur Hour. In this episode, Jessica Shaanan lets us know how her solopreneur journey (you remember her from Episodes 181 and 211) is coming along. \u00a0She is living proof that intention combined with action equals results!\n\nYou'll also want to tune in for a very special announcement I have for all of you podcasters out there. Check it out on today's The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About The Solopreneur Journey\nIf you missed her previous visits to the show\u00a0you can have a listen to Jessica's backstory here and here. Today we talk about where she's been, where she is going, the actions she's taken and what her solopreneur journey has been like so far.\n\nIf there's one thing every solopreneur has in common during their solopreneur journey it's this: we all must get started. No matter your background or your interests or your business you have to start somewhere. And for most of us we don't think we're ready, ever. But Jessica is proof that even when you don't think you're ready you can still move forward and make progress.\n\nIn fact that's the thing that's going to advance your journey faster than anything else: taking action, and moving forward.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat to do when you don't feel ready.\n\tWhy you don't need to know anything beyond your next step.\n\tWhat is an artist's date?\n\tIf you have more money than time how should you move forward?\n\tAnd how to proceed if you have more time than money.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nWhen Jessica originally began her journey to become a health and wellness coach her plan was to enroll in the \u00a0Integrative Institute of Nutrition and follow their program, she'd learn how to become a coach as part of her training.\n\nBut what she didn't expect or plan for was to have clients before she finished; someone approached her about coaching not long after beginning with IIN. She felt like she wasn't ready, she didn't know enough - all the normal concerns solopreneurs have at some point in their journey! She chose to embrace the challenge, move forward and step into the role of coach.\n\nAnd that's a lesson for all of us: have a plan, get started and be flexible enough to open up to whatever shows up on your solopreneur journey. Part of being a solopreneur is changing, evolving and growing as you and your business expand. New opportunities will open up as you do.\n\nWe discuss that as part of Jessica's path and yours as well by attending events: put yourself in a position for new people and new opportunities to find you. Get yourself to a few events this year and see what happens! Even if you can only make one or two get out there, get connected and get in action. Finding like-minded people at events will take your solopreneur journey in new directions and will inspire you to take action.\n\nTune in to hear all of that and more on this edition of\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour. Enjoy and we'll see you next time.\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: What did you learn about getting started and taking action from Jessica?

One of the key pillars of solopreneurship is relationships and building networks. You can see it in any successful solopreneur\u2019s business.\n\nTo show you exactly how this is done the right way, I brought Jayson Gaignard on for episode 53 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0Your Net Worth and Network\nIn episode 53 Jayson Gaignard joins me to talk Timothy Ferris, masterminds, relationships and investing in networks.\n\nFor most of his adult life Jayson has been a solopreneur; he realized very early on he was unemployable. And like most solopreneurs, he has seen his share of highs and lows.\n\nA great example of this was when he generated $84,000 in just a few hours! He brought Timothy Ferriss of The Four Hour Workweek to Canada for the first time; and Jayson has also been $250,000 in cash debt with no business and no set plan: just his solopreneurial mind, his network and his considerable willpower to dig him out and rebuild.\n\nOn This Episode You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy action without vision is simply a recipe for disaster.\n\tThe 7 steps to forming and solidifying a relationship with ANYONE, even the \u201cgurus\u201d you admire and emulate.\n\tWhy the integrity of your word is worth more than anything else.\n\tThe importance of celebrating your wins and your progress, even when you think you haven\u2019t made it yet.\n\tAn unexpected yet simple way to connect and reach out with speakers after their events.\n\tAnd much more!\n\nWhether at the highs of highs or the lowest of lows on his journey, Jayson has understood, utilized and leveraged the value of his network. As he says in this show, \u201cI knew the bank could take my accounts, but they could never take my network.\u201d\n\nBrilliant eh?! But this wasn\u2019t the only brilliance Jayson shared on the show! We also dive into\u00a0into real life lessons on how he created, built and leveraged relationships and networks for success, and how you can do the same thing in your business.\n\nYou'll have to tune in and turn on to hear the rest, I assure you it's worth it!

Is that really true? Our co-host today, Mr. Cole Hatter, has an intriguing perspective on that topic.\n\nHe believes money can buy happiness \u00a0- IF used in the proper way to take care of you, those you love and your world at large.\n\nOn episode 280 of The Solopreneur Hour we dive into that perspective, as well as his upcoming event Thrive and what it really takes to make money matter. Check it out on today's show.\nMore About What It Means to Thrive\nIf you've listened to this show before you know we talk about the\u00a0three pillars to solopreneur freedom: time, financial and location. Today Cole and I\u00a0spend a lot of time talking about the financial pillar, how to thrive and what to do with that money when you are financially free.\n\nSince he was a wee lad Cole always wanted to make a difference in people's lives. His first career was as a firefighter, but all of that changed when he was involved in a tragic car accident. His next iteration was in real estate and that's where he really made a splash. He began making loads of money in his early 20s, and he spent it like you might expect a guy in his early 20s to spend it!\n\nWhen the market crashed and he lost everything, Cole again started over. He was wise enough to learn lessons from each of his previous experiences and\u00a0apply them to create even greater success the next time around. This time he spent wisely, invested wisely and eventually created financial freedom for him and his family.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat's his version of therapy?\n\tWhy the myth of job security is a dangerous one.\n\tDoes money buy happiness according to Cole?\n\tCan you get rich doing what you love? His intriguing answer.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOn today's show Cole shares how he involved his father as a business partner, and what it was like to retire his own dad. He also shares how to find the proper mentor if you're interested in the real estate market where he made his millions.\n\nOne particular gem from the show is Cole's advice on\u00a0why following your\u00a0passion may not be the best idea. He says your greatest interest may not lead to the financial success you're seeking. His advice? Instead make a list of your top 10 favorite things to do and explore which of them has the greatest potential to give you the lifestyle you desire.\n\nAfter you've done that then take the top item from those 10, and make a business out of it. Doing so will allow you to earn the money you want, while also doing something you enjoy...and you'll be able to do the rest of that list as a result!\n\nThe last segment of the show is about Cole's event, Thrive. It's a multi-day event with some of the biggest speakers and teachers on the planet! He currently has Gary Vaynerchuk on tap as well as Tucker Max, Jordan Harbinger, James Altucher, Lewis Howes and many others.\n\nThe topic for the event is money: how to make money in various industries (each speaker will talk about their niche), how to KEEP the money you make (what entities to use legally, how to protect you and your money properly) and finally how to make that money you have really matter in the world. The final piece of making your money matter will also touch on how to stand out in a crowded marketplace by branding your business as a for-purpose company.\n\nCole and I dish out all the details on his event, how creating it took him WAY out of his comfort zone and why 100% of the profits of the event are going to a non-profit. It's all on this edition of\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour. See you next time.\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: What are your top 10 passions, and which is the most viable to build your business from?!

Welcome back home, hope all is well#dexstrong. My question: I'm launching a real physical magazine in addition to my online magazine. It's a free glossy magazine about the homes and property industry in Ireland. As a freebie it's entirely\u00a0sponsored by advertisers.\n\nHow do I best hustle for paid advertisers? We are offering ads much cheaper than competitors plus online articles and editorial as a free bonus to provide a complete package for advertisers. Thanks!\n\nA:\u00a0Incentive your advertisers so they are being deployed online and offline, do something extra for them via social media or mailing list. The sweet spot here is to bring on a good copywriter who can write some innovative ads for these paid advertisers. Walk in with a strategy for your advertisers and you'll hopefully create a win-win.\n\n\u2028Harold Rhee\u00a0\nQ: I have a personal and business (my podcast) Twitter profile. Same for several other platforms. Should I get rid of one or keep both?\u00a0Thanks and positive thoughts for Dex.\n\nA: I faced this same scenario so I'd say for Twitter keep your business going. For Facebook, have a good personal FB profile because it's critical to success as a solopreneur. All the engagement comes from here! Instagram is now all business for me. If you want more details check out my social media marketing course to see what works, what to post and when.\n\nDave Conrey\u00a0\nQ: What are your thoughts on the Patreon business model for monetizing a podcast? Also, do you know anyone offhand that's running a kick@$$ podcast/website with Squarespace?\n\nA: Don't know anyone running a podcast or web site with Squarespace. I don't think Squarespace is great plug-ins, it works well for people who don't need plug-ins. Podcasting generally needs plug-ins so Wordpress is better.\n\nFor question one I don't know a lot about Patreon, I think Abel James may use this model. If you're going the donation route like Patreon be sure to mention it often, people need reminders. Advertising is just taking hold in podcasting and you really only need about 2,000 downloads a show at this point, so look into that as well.\n\nRobert Bone\u00a0\nQ: You often say you are bad at celebrating when you achieve a goal, did you celebrate after you uploaded your podcast recorded on a beach?\n\nA: That's a complicated question! A week before that show I was ready to come home. It was a lot of solo time and I missed my life! Plus the devastating news about Dexter, so I recorded that show because I needed to. But honestly that was the worst day of my trip because of Dexter's cancer so I didn't really celebrate. The news about him just put a damper on the trip.\n\nThom Singer\u00a0\nQ: How do YOU cut through all the crap, BS and bullshitters out there with programs and podcasts and identify the people to listen to, hire, and follow??--- what is the trick to finding legit.\n\nA: Great question! It's something everyone needs to ask because there's a lot of BS out there. The best way I know how to do this is to listen to their podcast, watch their videos, just consume their content and you'll get what their core beliefs are. If you are in alignment with yours you're a match.", "duration": "50:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/279.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Fitness & Health", "Health", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Video Marketing", "Website / Search Engine Optimization"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1433911493, "title": "278: Solopreneur Tips & Tricks with Dawn Marrs (Dot Com)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "On today's edition of The Solopreneur Hour we're reunited with my dear friend and yours, Dawn Marrs (dotcom). Dawn has been hard at work cranking out a daily podcast called The Social Media Marketing Happy Hour and she joins us to share what that process has been like.\n\nShe also shares what else she's been doing, her latest tool Solopreneur tips and some cool SEO suggestions for organic rankings. It's all here on\u00a0episode 278 of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About\u00a0This Solopreneur Hour\nIf you're joining us for the first time or somehow haven't heard Dawn on her numerous previous visits to the show check her out here. Dawn is a whiz bang of a copywriter, a kick butt online marketer and network marketer as well as email marketing aficionado. She says even if she were making millions upon millions she'd still geek out on email marketing!\n\nOn this episode she also catches us up on her podcast, why they\u00a0downshifted from daily episodes and what she does NOT recommend doing as a result and what's next for her in that arena.\n\nWe also talk about some great tools she's recently discovered including Stripe (like PayPal but better), SocialOomph (to replace the now-defunct TweetAdder) and Ontraport. Dawn loves Ontraport so much she's becoming a certified in it! It's a very robust customer relationship management program, and she dives into more details on this solopreneur podcast.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy you don't have to do one thing for the rest of your life.\n\tHow to be on top of Google's search rankings.\n\tSolopreneur Tips & Tricks\n\tWhat percentage of your content should be keywords?\n\tWhen did she realize online marketing really works?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOne of the most practical segments of today's show is our discussion about PPC and SEO. PPC is pay per click. Dawn hasn't used that in ages, and doesn't know if it's worthwhile. However she uses Facebook's PPC and says it's viable and worth your investment.\n\nWhen talking about\u00a0SEO, or search engine optimization, we break down a specific set of steps you can take to corner your local market. There's treasure to be found by mining local-oriented SEO, like honing in on keywords plus your specific nearby towns.\n\nThe first thing you do is create a YouTube video, then a blog post and then a Facebook page. All of these will be titled with your local keyword search that you want to own. Let's illustrate with an example so it's clearer on how to use this technique:\n\nYou want to be known for your excel spreadsheet training and you live in the San Diego area so you will use the keyword phrase\u00a0San Diego excel.\n\nNow you'll create a YouTube video sharing advice on Excel, and in the title and description you'll use the keyword phrase San Diego excel. Repeat with a blog post and then create a Facebook page by the same title.\u00a0If you live in a smaller area you can capitalize on your nearby large town, and simply include your small town in the description as well as other neighboring small towns.\n\nPretty great tip right?! Listen in to hear Dawn's other suggestions on how to stay on top of the latest tools available, and why every shift you make teaches you valuable lessons.

To hear the entire story listen in to episode 277 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nAs solopreneurs we all face fear, no matter what stage of development we\u2019re in and no matter how successful our business has become. Our guest for today\u2019s show is the perfect case in point.\nDespite being one of the most well-renowned drummers in the world, Mike Johnston always had a fear of doing drum solos. In the fall of 2014 he was asked to do a solo in front of 1,000 of the most educated and accomplished drummers in the world! Preparing for this challenge not only changed his drumming life, but how he views business as well.\nIn this episode Mike and I talk about his passionate commitment to his personal brand, the lengths he recently went to to maintain the integrity of his brand while being featured on the cover of DRUM magazine - and why it's important for ANY solopreneur to embody that same level of commitment.\n\u00a0If you\u2019re new to the show or simply haven\u2019t heard of Mike Johnston and his background check out episode 20\u00a0and his other visits to the show.\nWe also get into tackling and overcoming fear: there's the proverbial 900 lb gorilla that EVERYONE faces wherever they are in their lives. For Mike it was doing a live drum solo for the elite crowd of PASIC.\nAnd there are many solopreneur lessons woven into his drum solo tale that all of you can take to heart:\n\n\n\tHow to face your own personal 900-lb gorilla: the steps to take to find success.\n\tWhy\u00a0you don't need to reinvent the wheel to be a success.\n\tWhy to\u00a0find what you're comfortable with and follow it.\n\tHow being an unnatural drummer has helped him as a teacher.\n\tWhat Michael Jordan\u2019s career has to do with success.\n\tAnd much more!\n\nThroughout this episode you'll hear Mike's commitment to not just drumming but to personal excellence in all he does. You'll hear how deeply passionate he is about providing value for people that helps them and not focusing on how much money something will bring in.\nHe genuinely cares about making a difference for others in their drumming and their lives. It's clear his commitment to others' success has been the key to his success. He is always focused on giving something of value to all of his audience. He doesn't focus on how much money his new idea will make, he focuses on making something cool and useful for his drummers.\nIn fact, Mike says\u00a0when he has done or created something because he thought it would sell well it has always bombed! The lesson for you: focus on value and providing something that enhances people's lives, and the money will follow.\nAs you listen ask yourself: how can I relate this to my business? Then hear the invaluable wisdom Mike drops. This episode features stories about drumming and those stories provide lessons about life and business as a solopreneur.\nOne of those lessons is something we talk about here A LOT: find what you love, learn everything you can about it and surround yourself with people who will support you every step of the way. And once you've mastered your craft, give back and show others how to do the same successfully.\nCheck it out on this edition of\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour and we'll see you next time!\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: What is your 900 pound gorilla and what are you going to do today to face it?!

If you want to be successful and hang with the successful crowd it's important to look the part as well.\n\nAnd before you think that means spending a ton of money, think again. JJ Collier, one of my best friends, joins us to talk about men can look great on any budget. We discuss the 5 basic pieces every man needs in his wardrobe,\u00a0why a proper FIT is the most important aspect of anything you wear and some fashion basic rules to follow no matter the trends.\n\nThe reason I brought JJ on is because fashion is his life. He was a professional snowboarder who always had an eye for design and fashion. Even as a child he loved to draw and he was drawn to fashion, Ralph Lauren in particular! When he realized his pro career was coming to an end he dove headlong into studying fashion.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat James Dean, James Bond and Mad Men\u00a0have in common.\n\tHow JJ overcame some major self-doubt.\n\tEarn your money in jeans, and spend it while wearing what? JJ answers.\n\tHow to make good choices based on any budget.\n\tThe connection between fashion and confidence.\n\tAnd so much more...\n\nDespite a lot of internal self-doubt, JJ sketched out his designs and got out his sewing machine. He told his wife he was going put on a fashion show\u00a0with 36 pieces for 14 looks, and he was going to do it in Charlotte where they were living at the time. And he did! He held a fashion show of his custom-made pieces, took a bunch of orders and went through a hellacious 18 months following.\n\nAnd\u00a0doors began to open as a result. Solomon called him and wanted him to help them with their first apparel line. He politely turned them down initially, but his wife sweetly asked him to just interview with them to see if it could be a fit. So he did, and it was.\n\nFrom there JJ got his feet wet in the world of fashion and went on to work with Ralph Lauren and Spyder, to name a few. He's lived in France, and worked on 5th Avenue in New York City with his fashion idol Ralph Lauren. Today he's part of Spyder and loves what he gets to create with them.\n\nOn this episode we explore the details of JJ's background, how his mindset guided him from his pro athlete days to budding fashion entrepreneur and designer. We also discuss the top 5 basic pieces he recommends every man to have in his closet.\n\nFirst is a good pair of dress shoes (Cole Haan, Fryy, and Allen Edmunds are good bets). Second is a good pair of jeans. When in doubt go with Gap's 1969 Collection. Third is a cashmere V-neck sweater. Stick with solids and when you find a good brand that fits you, buy multiple colors. Again go basic: black, charcoal, white.\u00a0\u00a0J Crew is a good option for a novice or visit Nordstrom Rack if you know what you're looking for.\n\nFourth is a white tailored button down shirt from J Crew, Banana Republic or Gap. You'll most likely have to get it tailored, and JJ explains how to know what fits you and what to get tailored on your shirt. And finally you'll need a jacket\u00a0like a tweed sports coat\u00a0or a fitted leather jacket.\n\nIf you're at a loss JJ suggests going to a department store like Nordstrom, have them take your measurements and then try on a few expensive shirts just so you can see how they fit. And while you're there, find a sales person who is dressed well and has a style you would emulate. Ask them to help you find some of these pieces.", "duration": "1:47:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/276.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "JJ Collier", "Man", "Men's Style", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1433329094, "title": "275: Travel Hacks From a Beach in Thailand", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Location freedom is one of the greatest perks of being a solopreneur and it's one of the three pillars we talk about at length on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nIn 2009 I set a goal to work from a beach and today's show\u00a0is my achievement of that goal. Recorded from a beach in Thailand, episode 275\u00a0is a collection of travel hacks I've gathered over the last month in SE Asia and the lessons I've learned.\nMore Travel Hacks From a Beach in Thailand\nWhen you hear this episode you'll hear the waves crashing in the background as I sit on a beach called Katamai in Phuket, Thailand (that's pronounced foo ket). It's one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen and I wanted to share a little bit of it with you in this recording.\n\nIf you're just joining us I've spent the last month traveling various countries in SE Asia, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Hong Kong and obviously Thailand. I spent a week at Chris Ducker's annual Tropical Think Tank where I was invited to speak, and then I've taken the additional three weeks after to see this part of the world.\n\nDuring that month\u00a0I've realized a few things about travel and have uncovered some great travel hacks for my future trips, hopefully you can use them as well.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow to make traveling affordable.\n\tWhy a SIM card has been invaluable on this trip.\n\tWhy I skipped Bali and recorded from Thailand instead.\n\tDexter's diagnosis.\n\tAnd so much more...\n\nI've learned I need to split my travel into thirds: one third just to do touristy things, another third to explore my hobbies and the final third for adventure and relaxation.\u00a0That combination of activities and leisure time suit me best and allow me to get the most out of my travels.\n\nAs far as hacks, on this trip I've discovered 3 great resources I highly recommend: a SIM card for your phone, Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.\n\nWhenever you leave the airport of a new country be sure to grab some cash (50-60 bucks should be enough), then look for stands that sell SIM cards. Pick one up and you should be able to get 5 gigs of data for around $10. Use that to power up your Google maps for directions, and then to explore Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.\n\nHotels.com has gotten me some killer hotel rooms for great rates in every city in every country I've traveled to. Plus they offer a rewards program where you book 9 nights and your 10th is free. You can hang on to that free night and cash it in, or apply it to a super fancy hotel for a discount.\n\nAnd once I used Hotels.com to find a hotel, I checked the hotel's ratings on TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor never steered me wrong; I always knew if the hotel was in a good location and would be a nice place to stay.\n\nWhatever your next travel goal\u00a0is these three hacks should help you greatly, they certainly did for me. I also share why this goal has meant so much to me, and why I believe travel is incredibly beneficial for all of us at any stage in our solopreneur journey.

Listen in while we discuss Matthew's history, how he got involved in Book Yourself Solid and some of his best sales tips!\nMore About\u00a0Book Yourself Solid\nMatthew is the son of a priest, and was shuttled from school to school depending on where his dad was called to service. So when the opportunity to attend boarding school opened up Matthew jumped at the chance to be in a settled location for awhile.\n\nAlways the rebellious one Matthew began busking in London as a teenager, juggling and performing in the streets for money. He soon brought a friend along who would ask the crowd for money for Matthew's performances; with that tactic Matthew brought in more pocket money and his sales career was born.\n\nAlthough he took various jobs after boarding school, eventually Matthew found his way back to sales and into corporate sales. While in that industry he found Michael Port and joined his mailing list. He promptly ignored Michael's emails until one day he didn't! The opportunity to work in Michael's team was there and Matthew\u00a0went after it.\nIn This Episode of The Solopreneur Hour, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tAnother great lesson the importance of relationships.\n\tWhy didn't he go to college after boarding school?\n\tWho is the most effective sales person in any organization?\n\tWhat is white space and how does it apply to business?\n\tWhat did his childhood smell like?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nMatthew enrolled, became a graduate of the Book Yourself Solid school and now certifies other coaches in that same program. He's the man behind the scenes there and loves what he does. Naturally he's a gifted speaker himself and he brought the house down at Tropical Think Tank 2015!\n\nOn this episode we chat more about his background, his one night with nunchucks, and what his childhood smelled like. You'll have to tune in for our conversation on all of those topics, but one more we'll cover here is his sales tips.\n\nMatthew started out in timeshare sales in Malta and then into the corporate sales world. One of his passions is the psychology of sales and he passes along some great tips on this episode! The first thing he shares\u00a0is why the CEO of any organization is so much better at sales than a salaried staff person. There are several reasons for this, one being the obvious: the CEO is a position of authority and we're conditioned to listen and respect people in positions of authority.\n\nThe other is a little less evident but equally powerful: a CEO has the guts to look at a prospect and say you should buy from me and here are the reasons why. Most other sales people sidestep that direct conversation and instead act like their prospect is doing them a favor simply by listening to them.\n\nIf you want to make more sales you have to be aware of how you are positioning yourself and your prospect. Respect your prospect but don't put them on a pedestal. Don't undervalue yourself, reframe and reposition yourself as the person in charge and as someone of authority.\n\nCheck out today's episode to hear what else Matthew has to say on this topic, and to hear some fun cameos from previous guests of the show!\u00a0It's all on this edition of\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour.

Jeffrey Slayter is a world-renowned speaker and coach who has shared the stage with such notables as Richard Branson, John Gray and Les Brown.\n\nJeffrey is a fascinating guy who's not afraid to go against the norm. \u00a0We found a lot of common ground, especially in the fact that neither of us drank alcohol while we grew up. \u00a0I think that \"steeled\" us against some common need to \"fit in\" with the crowd, and has helped our entrepreneurial journey.\n\nWe also discuss how he rebuilt after losing everything, and how he recommends creating the lifestyle you truly want on today's show. Enjoy the 273rd episode of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About\u00a0Jeffrey Slayter\nBorn and raised in Hawaii, Jeffrey has long been a surfer and has always been an entrepreneur. It's in his blood: his father was the first CEO and the founder of oDesk. In fact Jeffrey remembers his dad and a few engineers planning the company while sitting around their kitchen table!\n\nStaying true to his bloodline Jeffrey had side hustles going even while in school. In junior high he saw kids standing in line for cafeteria food, so he picked up extra candy and snacks while at CostCo with his mom. He took that candy\u00a0and sold it to those same kids in line at school. He gave them the same candy without the wait time! He branched out into baseball cards as well; he says he has always looked for a need and a way to fill it, whether in school or later in life.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat is net time and how can you utilize it?\n\tWhen do people pay attention?\n\tDoes he get nervous before going on stage?\n\tWhat is one of the traits of successful entrepreneurs?\n\tWhat two things terrify most people?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHis early success came in the real estate industry. He made tons of money - millions - while in his 20s. And he also lost a lot of money. When he lost everything it made him stock of who he was and how he was identifying his own worth. When he had money he tied his self-worth to it; he thought he had made it because his bankers knew his name and he had money to burn.\n\nBut when all of that went away he was forced to look deep within himself to find out what truly mattered and what he was made of. He had to ask himself who he is when he has nothing, no big house(s) or cars or bespoke surfboards, etc. Once he asked the hard questions and found the answers,\u00a0he began to rebuild. Today he still has a big house, fancy cars and nice things but he sees them as simply a symbol of his work,\u00a0instead of a symbol of his own personal worth.\n\nAnd that's what Jeffrey recommends other entrepreneurs and solopreneurs: take stock of where you are, get real about it. All you have to do is to look at your bank account, your friends and your life. Simple? Yes. Easy? No. But the only way to create real lasting change is to get real with yourself. Only then can you make a shift.\n\nWhen you figure out where you are, you can then consider and reflect on what kind of life you want to create. Take some time for yourself, as much as you can, and turn off all distractions to really focus on the life you want to build.\n\nAnd then start building and start associating with people who are going to lift you up, not tear you down. Because as you change and grow the people you once spent time with are going to notice and feel uncomfortable because you're an example of what they could do with their lives but are choosing not to. You might even find you feel guilty, which is why it's so critical you find like-minded people to support you in breaking out of the norm.\n\nJeffrey has had to do this, and has some concrete examples to share on today's show from events to attend to documentaries to watch at home! We\u00a0also examine what a successful life looks like to him, and why we make going after our dreams so difficult!\u00a0Listen in and\u00a0we'll see you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.", "duration": "1:56:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/273.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Jeffrey Slayter", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Real Estate", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1432709756, "title": "272: Brett Campbell Teaches Entrepreneurs to Build A Lifestyle", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As solopreneurs one of the biggest payoffs is building our own lifestyle, and that is at the heart of what our guest for today's show loves to do! Brett Campbell is the head honcho at The Online Business Accelerator, and he simply loves to help entrepreneurs find their sweet spot and build a lifestyle they love.\n\nBrett and I have had a few adventures out on the town. \u00a0The more time you spend with him, the more you realize his heart is so big, and he's such a giving guy. \u00a0He doesn't need accolades, he just wants to help people build a great business around their ideal lifestyle...just like he has.\n\nOn the 272nd episode of The Solopreneur Hour we dive into how his solopreneurial journey began, how he helps people today and some killer ninja marketing tactics!\nMore About\u00a0Building a Lifestyle\nOne of the first things you may notice about Brett is he speaks funny; he's originally from Australia and has lived on the Gold Coast and in the neighboring country of New Zealand. He moved to New Zealand when his parents split up and he went to live with his mom at his grandmother's house.\n\nBorn without a silver spoon Brett knew early on if he wanted something he had to work for it. That message was hammered home throughout his childhood, and after their home was robbed (twice by the same people) he was even more determined to succeed. He never wanted his mom or his sister to have to worry about money again, he wanted to take care of them.\n\nGrowing up\u00a0he worked odd jobs and was always hustling,\u00a0but when he was kicked out of high school he took an apprenticeship as a cabinetmaker. He worked his tail off for a few years, negotiated finishing the apprenticeship a year early and then worked as a full-fledged cabinetmaker while being groomed to become a partner in the company.\n\nWhen things changed within the company Brett realized running a cabinetry business was not his dream so he left, to attend university. He did a year of that, again knew it wasn't his path and packed up his things to move to the Gold Coast of his homeland and become a personal trainer.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat his first business at the age of 12?\n\tWhat KFC can teach you about branding.\n\tWhich company has really great lead magnets you should emulate?\n\tHow many times a day should you post to your fan pages?\n\tWhy you should use Power Editor.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHe did well as a personal trainer making $65 an hour or more, but he was tired and still felt like he hadn't found \"it\". When he saw one of his roommates had bought a PDF of exercise instruction online a light bulb went off. Brett saw the possibility: he could create a product, sell it and make money without trading his own time for those dollars.\n\nBrett created a 21 day course\u00a0called the 21 Day Rapid Fat Loss Blueprint, and when he rolled it out to his list of 300 he anxiously awaited the results. It only sold 20 copies, and he was disappointed. He fully expected at least 80% of his list to buy from him, and he couldn't understand why they hadn't. But instead of chalking it up as a failure, he decided he needed a bigger list and that's what he did.\n\nOn this episode he shares some of those tactics he's used over the years to grow his list and how he brings in at least 700 new leads a day. One of his strongest recommendations you'll hear is to create multiple Facebook fan pages and syndicate your posts between all of the pages. He says you need to post 6-7 times a day to your page if you're international, at least 4 times if it's just national.\n\nBrett also recommends finding those past posts that have done well for you - have had high numbers of reach, views, likes and comments - and keep those in a Google doc or an Excel spreadsheet you host on Dropbox.

We discuss his favorite travel hacks, what he was like growing up and how to authentically connect with anyone\u00a0on episode 271 of The Solopreneur Hour Podcast.\nMore About\u00a0The Man of Mystery\nMark Anthony Bates is probably the best-connected man you've never heard of; he travels the globe speaking with elite\u00a0coaching clients, diplomatic organizations, and world leaders, that's why I call him the international man of mystery!\n\nYou won't find him on social media or on his own web site, he doesn't promote himself yet his name carries tremendous weight in highly influential circles. So how did he come to be who he is and what was he like growing up?\n\nMark says as a child he was a serious troublemaker, and not a class-clown type but a break-the-law type troublemaker. He was expelled from the 8th grade, the only reason they passed him on to high school was because they couldn't put up his antics any longer. His freshman year of high school he had all Ds, Fs and Incompletes. Mark wasn't dumb, he was bored because he learned in a different way then he was being taught. And he was incredibly curious.\n\nBut that curiosity led to more trouble. By 16 he was forcibly removed from high school by the police and was sent to a continuation school. Within 3 weeks he was kicked out of that school and eventually ended up at an honor camp. An honor camp is a step beyond juvenile hall, but a step before prison. It's not a good place to be. His parole officer there gave him a book called I'm Okay, You're Okay which shifted Mark's verbal and emotional communication. He began to change and was eventually released from the camp.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow to make someone feel like they're the only person in the room.\n\tHe has hasn't had a traditional home in how many years?\n\tWhy was he chosen to be a flight attendant out of 3500 applicants?\n\tWhy does he take gum to Singapore?\n\tHow he became a malt distributor, and what it'll teach you.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nSkip ahead to age 30 and Mark\u00a0wants to work for Pan-Am, an international airline carrier. They're the best in the business, and he wants to be in marketing for them. But he has no airline experience, so he approaches the situation uniquely and eventually lands a flight attendant position with them!\n\nOn this episode he gives the full story on how he did so (you'll definitely want to hear it, it's a GREAT lesson in positioning) and we also talk about how different he is today then that young man he was growing up. He has taken that innate curiosity and applied it to people and opportunities.\u00a0We talk about how he's learned to genuinely connect with others and a few examples of opportunities he's spotted and acted on, without knowing how he was going to execute.\n\nAs someone who coaches other coaches as well as professional speakers, Mark knows what it takes to make people feel at ease and how to create a connection. When he attends an event he goes in with the intention of genuinely connecting with the people there, not to get anything for himself but to know them and see if an organic relationship develops.\n\nHe says you can do the same thing but getting centered before you go in, which just means you can create a clear intention for that event (like you'll make every person you speak with feel special), acknowledge them and look them in the eye when you're speaking with them. Don't look at your phone, don't glance around the room to see who else you can be talking with, just be with the other person you're chatting with.", "duration": "1:56:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/271.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Love & Relationships", "Man", "Mark Anthony Bates", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "how to appreciate people", "man of mystery", "mark anthony bates", "Public speaking", "travel tips", "world travel"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1432361998, "title": "BONUS EPISODE: Traveling in Bangkok and Vietnam", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey everyone.

They didn't own a television for his first 10 years and he only listened to the radio one day when he snuck one home. He was 11 at the time, and discovered a whole new world when he turned it on!\n\nBut the one piece of technology his parents allowed him to have was a camera. When\u00a0Darren stepped into a dark room and created his first image he was hooked. He was a creative child and loved that this piece of equipment gave him an outlet to create something that was indelibly his and his alone. His love and passion for photography has only grown through the decades.\n\nToday he successfully runs two blogs: Problogger and Digital Photography School. He has made a great name for himself with both and has achieved things he never dreamt of when he started.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow many jobs did he have when he began his first blog?\n\tDid he think he was too late when he started blogging?\n\tIs he an expert coder?\n\tWhat did Ashton Kutcher message him about?\n\tIn what year did he start Problogger?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHe initially began blogging in 2002 and over the years has created at least 30 different blogs. His first topic was about a church he was the pastor of. It was a different type of church: no hymns, no sermons, just people talking about their lives and God while eating together. The plan was to have no pastor within 1.5 years as well, the members (including Darren) had set it up that way.\n\nSo with his days numbered as their pastor, Darren juggled his other part-time jobs (he had 5 total at the time) and delved into blogging. It took almost 2 years before he saw real money from it, and he was able to leave all of his jobs during that period of time.\n\nBy 2004 he was making nearly a full-time income from his blogs, and he started Problogger. It was divisive time in blogging history: one group of people believed blogging could be a successful business platform to earn an income from. The other half believed blogging should stay pure without ads or any other money-making strategy behind it.\n\nClearly Darren was in the former camp and his journey with Problogger was meant to chronicle that experience. It didn't take long after Problogger was started for people to call and\u00a0ask if he would write a book and if he would speak about blogging. He was floored. In fact, he thought some of his friends were playing tricks on him and he hung up the first few times he received calls like that! Darren could hardly believe it was true, but it was.\n\nToday he is happily at the helm of Problogger and Digital Photography School. He has found a way to successfully manage both and has found an outlet for his entrepreneurial interest in blogging and his lifelong passion of photography.\n\nTune in to hear him chat about what he'd do today if he were starting over in blogging and his suggestions for revitalizing a blog. Listen in and\u00a0we'll see you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY:\u00a0What would you blog about if you were to start a blog?

This episode was going to be trouble and I knew it as soon as I chatted up Dan Miller in the hallway at Social Media Marketing World, and he told me he was a car guy. \u00a0It was all I could do to\u00a0not\u00a0talk cars the whole time.\n\nAll joking aside, Dan shared SO MUCH wisdom with us and answered a number of great live questions. \u00a0Please enjoy part 5 of 6 of the author spotlight series with Dan Miller of 48 Days on this episode\u00a0of The Solopreneur Hour Podcast.\nMore About\u00a0Dan Miller and 48 Days\nIf you missed Dan's previous visit to the show have a listen here, it's a good one! When Dan joined us on stage during Social Media Marketing World 2015 we had much to discuss; From his upcoming Escaping Shawshank event to how he and his wife have made their marriage work through the ups and downs of entrepreneurship for 47 years (!) to a chat about cars, we cover a lot of ground. And we saved time for a few live questions from the audience.\n\nDan's Escaping Shawhank event is a 2 day in-person mastermind live event. Not only is the video crazy cool (find it in the Resources section below), but the concept is superb.\n\nDan and his team, including his wife, are bringing a group of people to the prison where Shawshank Redemption was filmed and they will spend 2 days defining and breakthrough what holds them back. Participants will go from prison to plan to payoff, according to Dan. And during our chat he shares some details on the itinerary for the event.\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy is Dan a small group kind of guy?\n\tWho does he invest his time with?\n\tWhy ignorance really is bliss sometimes.\n\tWhen did he become an entrepreneur?\n\tWhat's the difference between knowledge and understanding? Dave answers.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nEscaping Shawshank is just his latest in a series of entrepreneurial endeavors. As a young boy Dan was already showing his entrepreneurial spirit! One of his first endeavors was\u00a0cleaning his neighbors' cars of\u00a0tar and waxing them to a perfect shine after. He was 12 or 13 at the time, and never looked back after their early success!\n\nIt wasn't but a few years later he met his now-wife Joanne, they married not long after. From the get-go she knew she was getting a husband who was \"wired differently\" as Dan says. During this chat Dan and I talk\u00a0about how he and his wife have weathered the good and the bad during their 47-year marriage.\n\nOne of the keys has been to not simply give one of them tasks because the other didn't enjoy doing them or wasn't good at them. They support each other and utilize their different strengths as an asset. It's a topic they discuss on the site and on the 48 Days podcast.\n\nWhether or not you're in a couple Dan shares some additional\u00a0advice on how to be successful. He says there are three components: knowledge, understanding and application. Knowledge is learning about something, understanding is knowing how it's relevant and application is putting it into practice.\n\nFrom there Dan and I chat about cars and get some truly great questions from the audience. Tune in for that and we'll see you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY:\u00a0What are you learning and challenging yourself with right now? Are you always in learning mode?

He stopped by for a great, insightful chat at SMMW15 this year. \u00a0Sadly, the first part of this interview is cut off, but we saved the best for last! \u00a0As always, Pat is generous with his time and knowledge.\n\nWe chat about Legos (or as they like to be called Lego Brand Building Blocks), how he builds trust with his Smart Passive Income audience and his greatest why on this episode\u00a0of The Solopreneur Hour Podcast.\n\nThis is part 4 of 6 in our Social Media Marketing World 2015 series, please enjoy!\nMore About\u00a0Pat Flynn and Smart Passive Income\nIf you're new to this show be sure to listen to previous episodes with Pat right here. He's always a blast to have a conversation with! In fact, a chat over pizza with Pat was the origin for The Solopreneur Hour (you can hear more about that on previous episodes).\n\nDuring our chat at Social Media Marketing World Pat shares how he's built his Smart Passive Income audience over the years and established such a high degree of trust with them, as well as the responsibility he feels because of their loyalty. Pat never promotes something he hasn't used himself, and then only if he's had success with that product and he knows it like it was his own. He takes his position with his fans very seriously, and is in it for the long haul.\n\nPat also talks about something he hasn't shared publicly before: he refunds his fans' money if they use a product he recommended and had a bad experience - that is how committed he is to his fans and their trust in him!\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tPerfection is a way of ______. Pat fills in the blank.\n\tHow many Lego Delorians does Pat own?\n\tWhat is \"The Baby Effect\" and how did it impact Pat?\n\tWhat is P2P?\n\tHow he spent 44 hours and got a $50k return on that time.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHe's also incredibly transparent. Smart Passive Income's blog was started as a way to share with people what he has tried, what worked, \u00a0and what didn't. He celebrates his wins with his fans, and also talks candidly about his failures.\n\nAnd I've been one of Pat's fans for awhile and I've learned a lot from him. A\u00a0particular lesson I learned from my experience with Pat is something I share to this day; it's about\u00a0how to interact with someone you admire and respect, someone who is further along the timeline than you are.\n\nThe first thing you do when reaching out is to ask a specific question. I didn't email Pat and say \"How can I start a podcast?\", instead I asked him a super specific question about creating an online course. When I received a response from him, a personal email, I thanked him and sent him an iTunes gift card. It wasn't a lot of money, that wasn't the point! The point was to let him know I appreciated his time and that he shared his wisdom with me.\n\nAnd that's the perfect way to build a connection and the seeds of a relationship with someone you look up to: interact with them about something specific and keep it brief, thank them for how they've contributed to you and show that appreciation in some way.\u00a0Do what you can to give back and it'll be remembered.\n\nPat and I also talk about how he manages his email today, versus a year ago and he answers a few insightful questions from our audience at SMMW 15. Tune in for that and we'll see you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY:\u00a0What did Pat share about building trust with an audience that struck a chord with you?\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast?

We recorded this in front of a live audience at Social Media Marketing World 2015, our third in a series of six episodes.\n\nJoel was delightful and hilarious as always, while dropping some great knowledge bombs about Twitter, online business, and life itself.\n\nEven if you've listened to Joel before you'll hear things you probably didn't know about him and I guarantee you'll learn something new on episode 267 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About Joel Comm and Twitter Power\nHave you missed Joel's previous visits to the show? We've chatted a few times and you can listen to them all here.\u00a0To give you a quick recap of who he is and what we've talked about: his multiple best-selling books(New York Times\u00a0best-sellers of course), his mad online marketing skills and his humorous creation of the highly-lucrative iPhone app iFart.\nDuring this conversation we dish about his favorite things to do, his video game and vintage software collection and whether he ever turns \"off\". And we finish it up with a deep dive into his latest version of his Twitter Power book: Twitter Power 3.0 and what's new since version 2.0\nOn the subject of his favorite things to do Joel says he's just a kid in a grown up body! He loves his toys, he loves to enjoy his life and feels grateful for every moment of it. And that's the approach he takes to everything, including business. He pursues what comes naturally to him and knows good things will follow when he does. He never looks at his life as an ROI, he just lives his life.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat does he schedule?\n\tHow many million active users are on Twitter as of March 2015?\n\tThe origins of Yahoo! Games and how Joel factors in.\n\tThe story of how he appeared on The Daily Show.\n\tWho does he follow on Twitter and why?\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\nWe also dive into some of the nitty-gritty with Joel. He explains the differences in Twitter Power 3.0 versus 2.0. A few key nuggets he shares are Twitter's mainstream-ness: today every TV show, movie, or other media outlet has a Twitter account and uses it. Furthermore they create their own hashtags for their shows and their episodes.\n\nAnother key feature we have with Twitter now that we didn't in 2010 is video and photos. Today you can embed video in your Tweet and you can include a photo. You can say and share a lot more with these multimedia options now, and people do.\n\nJoel generously shares some basic steps to take to grow your Twitter followers. The main approach is to find people you like and admire who are in your field and follow them. Then engage in conversation with them: ask questions, answer questions and provide value. And don't overthink it, just be focused on giving rather than taking and you'll get the results you're looking for.\n\nOne final important topic we cover is his monetization strategy: he has never had one. He does what he loves, creates great content in the process and is paid back with speaking gigs, podcast appearances and offers to co-author numerous books.\n\nWhen you listen to today's episode you'll also hear him\u00a0tell several amusing stories, including how his book Social Poetry came about and how he was on The Daily Show for his iPhone app iFart!

On today's show we have one of the first people to ever merge copywriting and blogging: Mr. Brian Clark.\n\nFor nearly two decades\u00a0Brian has been in the online space and today he continues to create some incredible platforms. Listen in on this wonderful chat we had in front of a live studio audience at Social Media Marketing World 15. This is part 2 of a series of 6 spotlight series.\n\nDuring this episode\u00a0we talk about his early days of blogging, copywriting and entrepreneurship. We also chat about how to deal with haters and the network that is possible with his latest creation Rainmaker FM on episode 266 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nGoing From Copyblogger to Rainmaker.fm\n\nBrian Clark's first job was as a lawyer, and he hated it. He spent 4 years working for a law firm before he quit to blog. He had a hard time explaining to his mom that he wasn't going to be a lawyer, he was going to be a writer on the Internet. Today his parents are happy with his choice, even if they still don't understand what he does!\n\nBrian was far from an overnight success. His first company published ezines, they published via email because that's what you did in 1998 before the Internet heyday. He built an audience and thought he'd make money from affiliate sales on Amazon. He made $4 his first year.\n\nWith his savings dwindling, he knew it was time to make a change. He read Permission Marketing and a light bulb went off: he had to build an audience, and then sell them products they already wanted and needed. Brian had half of the equation already: he had an audience. Now he just needed to sell them something they wanted; with that thought in mind his second company was born.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Discover:\n\n\tWhy you should have haters.\n\tWhat is the most valuable skill you can have as an entrepreneur?\n\tHow he influenced Derek Halpern.\n\tWhy money can't be \"the thing\" that drives you\n\tBrian explains why audio is taking off now, rather than in the past.\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nBrian knew about law so he decided to start a newsletter on legal-related issues. He thought he'd pick up a client or two to help make ends meet too. First he got one client, then another, then a third and soon he was turning clients away. Eventually he settled on the best clients who paid him the most on a monthly retainer for the least amount of work.\n\nWith that business it became clear to Brian that he was an entrepreneur who knew how to write, and was good at it.\n\nHis third and fourth businesses were real estate brokerages built out of web sites, before anything like Zillow existed. At the time real estate brokers knew nothing about online marketing and online lead generation. But Brian knew plenty and he created two businesses using this model. From 2001 to 2005 he made a boatload of cash, but he was miserable.\n\nSo he sold his interest to his partners. The companies crashed and burned, he never got his payout. He highly recommends getting cash upfront, even if it's a lesser amount!\n\nWith those businesses under his belt he wanted to focus on what he was good at: online marketing and online content. Copyblogger was formed. The two concepts behind it were copywriting principles applied to blogging and selling to the audience (not relying on advertising for income).\n\nThe first few months of Copyblogger were lonely ones for Brian, but when he created a free PDF on how to make content go viral he touched a nerve. He reached out to the biggest bloggers around at the time and asked them to share it. Some of them loved it and linked to it, others hated it and still linked to it. That's when he knew sometimes even if people don't like what you have to say\u00a0or what you're doing\u00a0it's still okay.\n\nBrian built on that early success and is now a familiar name in the online space. And he's leveraged that knowledge to create a highly successful network platform with Rainmaker FM...", "duration": "1:56:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/266.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "Brian Clark", "content marketing", "Copyblogger", "copywriting", "ONline Marketing", "Rainmaker FM"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1431327353, "title": "265: Guy Kawasaki of Canva LIVE from Social Media Marketing World 2015", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey Unemployables! Welcome to episode 265. I'm excited to bring to you part 1 of 6 shows from my sessions at Social Media Marketing World 2015 (SMMW). This was a great episode with the legend himself, Mr. Guy Kawasaki, in front of a live audience, and it was a blast.\n\nWe had a great chat about cars, branding, flying helicopters under the bridge, and having an opinion!\u00a0Check it out on the 265th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About Guy Kawasaki and Canva\n\nIf you've lived in a cave for the last 20 years you may not know today's guest, Guy Kawasaki. But if you're an active social media user, a Canva user or an Apple aficionado you definitely recognize his name! Guy rose to fame as a Chief Evangelist for Apple back in the mid 90s. That was his second stint with Apple; he was an evangelist for their software from 1983 to 1987. He left in 87, built a few software companies of his own and returned in 1995.\n\nAbout that time there was nothing but bad news about Apple, but it was his job to share the good things they were doing. And that's what he did. He put out daily content to their listserv of around 44,000 people. If you don't know what listservs were they were the predecessors to things like MailChimp and Constant Contact of today.\n\nHis work helped sustain Apple through some very dark times. In 1995 Michael Dell of Dell Computers was telling Steve Jobs to take Apple's cash reserves, pay off the shareholders and close the company! Obviously Steve didn't listen to him and kept the company moving forward.\n\nGuy shares that particular story on this episode as well as his role as chief evangelist for Canva today, why he's on the board of a humane society and also gives his mental model for social media based on NPR.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Discover:\n\n\tWho are the most remarkable people, those who really stand out?\n\t\u00a0What is Guy's 10-20-30 rule and why does it matter to you?\n\tHis Jackie Chan story!\n\tWhat's the real reason he goes to South by Southwest?\n\tWhy it's important to be an early adopter of social media platforms.\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nOne of the most interesting and solopreneur-related topics we discuss is how he uses social media. Guy says he's never consciously chosen to shift platforms, it's more like he has embraced social media as a whole. He genuinely loves all things social media and choses to use the platforms as just that: platforms. He doesn't do social media to be social!\n\nHe explains it by comparing his use to how NPR has built their organization. NPR provides daily content that is so valuable, so informative and relevant. We the general public enjoy it and we tune in throughout the year to hear what NPR is providing.\u00a0And because they've provided so much to us throughout the year we feel an obligation to contribute when they hold their pledge drives.\n\nGuy says that's the model that he and his team use for social media. Their intention is to inform you, provide analysis so you understand the impact while also providing\u00a0entertainment and assistance. His use of social media is to constantly create and curate either information, assistance, analysis or entertainment.\u00a0And occasionally he will offer his books or tools (aka his own \"pledge drive\").\n\nThe hope is that by providing such great content consistently with occasional offers thrown in\u00a0you the reader not only feel it's ok to for him to promote his books or tools but that you'll want to reciprocate and buy from him during his \"pledge drive\".\n\nIn addition to that amazing nugget Guy gives a specific example of how he would do this if he were running the social media for Virgin America, which is also a fascinating pearl of wisdom. Listen in to get the goods on that and much more on episode 265 of\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour. See you next time!\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: What can you do differently on social media after hearing Guy's model?

All of that and more on episode 264 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nGoing From Orphan to Inspiration\n\nMario experienced more hardship and challenges in his first 26 years then many of us will see in our entire lifetime. His mom raised him in Germany away from his father whom he didn't meet until he was 30. But from the age of 10 Mario was in foster care because his mom was a drug addict. His aunt tried to step in and help but the German authorities believed he would be better off in foster care.\n\nAnd looking back Mario agrees. He lived in foster care throughout his teen years, although his mom did get clean and eventually earn back her parental\u00a0rights. While she was getting clean and he was being cared for by a foster family, he found sports to be an outlet for him. Basketball in particular was his sport of choice and he excelled.\n\nIn fact he did so well he pursued it professionally in Germany. Although it's not as revered there as it is here in the US, it was still a fun pursuit for him. He also pursued a spot in the German army, but left no long into his first stint. After that he worked for several years until he had the idea to go to Ecuador. He wanted some adventure and to learn another language so he moved there as did his friend who was originally from Ecuador.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Discover:\n\n\tHow foster care steered him in the right direction.\n\tWhat is the first step to financial freedom according to him?\n\n\tThe role Frank Kern played in Mario's success.\n\tHow to focus and capitalize on your unique ability.\n\tWhy small wins are so powerful in creating momentum.\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nMario spent 7 months in Ecuador where he fell in love with his now wife Maria, the sister of his Ecuadorian friend. Today they live in San Diego with their baby boy, but the first stop after Ecuador was Miami. It was the closest city to Ecuador so it was the cheapest flight and Mario booked it. His intention was to go to the US, save up $10k and go back to Ecuador to open a school teaching German to Ecuadorian kids.\n\nAlthough Mario hasn't done that (yet), he has done a tremendous amount since coming to America. He first was exposed to internet marketing not long after arriving in the States, but it took some time for his business to grow enough to support him and Maria. At first he sold jerseys to Germans on eBay; he sold jerseys they couldn't get there.\n\nHe knew the market well, knew the need was there and within a year was making about $2k a month. That was enough for him to quit his job at the front desk of a hostel in South Beach.\n\nFrom there he dove into article marketing, SEO and anything else that was hot in online marketing. He figured out how to make money doing one thing and doing it well, then he would move on to another topic. He dove in to each area, studied it, learned it and mastered it. Then he taught others how to do the same.\n\nIt was an approach that has served him well. Today he coaches people from all over the world. He travels to them or they come to him. And with his success and achievements under his belt, he decided his next mission was to create his Missionpreneur business. After a two-hour conversation with his wife Maria they came up with some core values for his next business: fun, highly lucrative and highly impactful.\n\nWith those core values in mind he created his Missionpreneur business and podcast. He teaches other people how to create and build fun, highly lucrative and highly impactful businesses.\n\nAnd one of the secrets he teaches them is something we've talked about repeatedly ...", "duration": "1:06:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/264.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mario Brown", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "overcoming obstacles"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1430895463, "title": "263: Living The Flipped Lifestyle with Shane and Jocelyn Sams", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to episode 263 of The Solopreneur Hour! I love episodes like today's when I get to speak to not just one guest, but two.\n\nAnd today's duo is even better: they are a married couple who now run a super successful online business helping other couples do the same.\n\nShane and Jocelyn Sams of Flipped Lifestyle are here to chat about what it's like to run a business together, what led them to create their brand and what's next. All of that and more on episode 263 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About The\u00a0Flipped Lifestyle\n\nFrom the mountains of Kentucky, Shane and Jocelyn Sams have built an empire with digital products. But neither of them started out as entrepreneurs; in fact, it took a bit of proof to get Jocelyn on board!\n\nWhen they first struck out into the online marketing world they were both working full-time and raising their son (they have since had a daughter). Shane found podcasts and listened to one of Pat Flynn's Smart Passive Income episodes. He thought he had struck gold, Jocelyn wasn't so sure until one of Shane's AdWords accounts started making some money. It wasn't much, but it was enough to pique her interest.\n\nUntil that point Shane had been learning about and trying numerous strategies to make money online. But Jocelyn initially focused on digital products and used what\u00a0she already knew, lesson plans, to build a business. That simple strategy paid off for them; today they run several businesses together and earn multiple six figures annually.\n\nOn This Show You'll Also Discover:\n\n\tDoes Shane miss coaching at all?\n\tWhat is an 11 cent moment and why is it important?\n\n\tThe most common reason people fail.\n\tWhat is the 168-hour calendar and how does it apply to business?\n\tWhat book changed Shane's life?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nThe secret to their success is a\u00a0simple formula they now teach other families with their flipped lifestyle business. That simple formula is this: take what you know, find an audience, find out what they\u00a0need and create a product for them. Build a web site, get a payment button on it and go. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to be good and it needs to help your audience.\n\nUsing that formula for themselves and for their audience, their success blossomed. Initially they were selling a thousand dollars' worth of products, then it became five figures a month, then six. It didn't take long for them to leave their jobs (Shane was a history teacher and a football coach, Jocelyn was a librarian), and work from home together full-time.\n\nAnd that brought with it its own set of challenges. They learned how to prioritize their time, and how to work together and stay sane! To stay sane they simply take time apart. They may go to the gym together but Jocelyn will go to a class while Shane hits the weights. Jocelyn might run with friends, and Shane makes time for playing his X-Box with his brother.\n\nOne of the key points they also share on today's show is the 168-hour calendar. We all have 168 hours in a week, it's the same for every single person on the planet. Shane and Jocelyn decided to map out what they do with their 168 hours.\n\nUsing accounting paper with a grid on it containing 168 squares, they filled in each square with how they spent their time. They looked for places they could stop doing less productive things\u00a0and add business-building time instead. While they were both still working full-time jobs they gave up cable TV and replaced that time with\u00a0business activities and their family. It helped them leave those jobs, and it's a technique they still use today.\n\nOn today's episode they share the impact this technique has had for them, their clients as well as the most common reason they see people fail with an online business and how they handled the logistics of being away at Tropical Think Tank\u00a0for 8 days! There are great lessons in all they share today so download the episode for the details!

John and I were flying to a friend's wedding when we recorded the first Planecast. We had such a blast chatting and sharing some entrepreneurial gold with you we wanted to do it again.\n\nOn this second edition of Planecast, John and I recorded an episode while flying to Vegas. We talk about podcasting, why not to outsource (too early) and why monetization should never be the reason you start any new endeavor. We dive into all of that and more on the\u00a0262nd episode of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About\u00a0Planecast with John Lee Dumas\nIf you missed Planecast episode one you can check it out here. John and I had so much fun on the first one we decided to do another one! For the first portion of the show we talk about how to know when to walk away from a new endeavor, how to know if something isn't working and you need to scrap it.\n\nAlthough we specifically discuss new podcasts, the same principles apply to any new business whether it's a podcast or any other platform. If you've been something for awhile and aren't seeing any results, it's time to take a good hard look at your project. Maybe it's a new podcast and you simply haven't nailed the brand. Perhaps it's a new product and you just haven't gotten it exactly right. Find the lesson in the experience, tweak what you're doing and go forward.\n\nIf you really find yourself thinking you've failed and you feel stuck remember this: hundreds of TV show pilots get made every season but only a handful get picked up. Keep making your pilot until it's one that gets picked up. You'll find something valuable in every attempt, just keep at it.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhy does John still edit his own show?\n\tHow I made $200k in the first 12 months of this show.\n\tThe most important step most entrepreneurs miss when starting something new.\n\tWhy you need to do what DOESN'T scale.\n\tWhat would John do differently today if he were launching a new show?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nJohn and I also discuss why you need to do the unscalable parts of your business, and every aspect of your business, before you start outsourcing any of it. If something goes wrong or someone doesn't show up when you need them you need to know how to do what they were doing for you. You can't do that if you outsource everything from the very beginning.\n\nOnce you've done every aspect of your business and you're finding you have more time than money, then and only then can you look at outsourcing certain pieces of your work.\n\nAnother key point we discuss\u00a0is the fullback brand concept. It's something we've covered in previous episodes but the essence of it is this: let your brand do the heavy lifting for you. When you get your brand really dialed in it will carry your message to your audience so clearly they will know exactly what you stand for and what you are providing.\u00a0When that happens you'll connect with the right people who want what you have.\n\nJohn and I both have evolved our brands, which is why we discuss this concept. Pay attention to the progression of both of our brands: neither of us started out with our names in the actual branding message. And there was a reason for that: we didn't have a strong presence or platform already in existence so very few people knew us or what we were about.\n\nSo we created brands that spoke to our audiences and communicated what we were offering. As people have gotten to know us as the face behind the brand we've rebranded and evolved to include our names in the overall branding message.

I love doing these for you guys: reading your questions live on air and then answering them. Whether it's a question about business, friendships, relationships, travel I answer it.\n\nOn today's episode we talk about recording a podcast on the road, following your gut, and actively marketing on Instagram. Plus a whole lot of audio equipment talk!\n\nThere's loads of great content on this one, so dig in and enjoy episode 261 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This\u00a0Solopreneur Coaching Session\n\nNow let's get into some questions from you dear listener!\n\n\nAlexa Williams Meisler\u00a0\nQ: What is the easiest way to record a podcast on the road with a Zoom? Exactly what else do I need to bring with me?\n\nA: You need a Zoom of course. I'll bring with me my Zoom H6,\u00a0my two new Heil PR35s which I just recently received from Michelle of Heil. Plus I'll bring two really short XLR cables. I'll line it into my iPad and record with BossJock. We hold the mics and record a conversation; I'll have compression on the Zoom H6 which blocks out external noise and that'll give us studio quality sound. And bring extra batteries!\n\n\u2028\u2028Parvinder Nijjar\u00a0\nQ: When is the Rich Franklin episode coming out?\n\nA: It came out April 29th and you can listen to it here. He's a really bright dude and he dropped some major bombs! He's at the top of his profession and he's incredible.\n\nQ: Do you think the free content model like Pat Flynn does with SPI is a good idea?\n\nA: He gives great content to build his audience as large as he can, then shares some of the things he uses in hopes of getting a commission.\n\nOr he creates a product and offers it to them. It's something called the \"fremium model\", and yes I absolutely think it's a good idea. The more you give to someone the more they will feel inclined to give back to you (in the form of buying from you).\n\n\u2028\u2028Sean Gilgore\u00a0\nQ: How do you define a friendship vs a partnership and how do you open the conversation when you want to do business with friends or make someone you do business with a friend? Also when a friend says no to your business proposition, or worse backs out, how do you handle it?\n\nA: You can go the \"don't get into business with friends route\" or you can go buy the book and delineate everything as though you were working with a stranger. Schedule time to work together and\u00a0have friendship time outside of that.\n\nMark R. LePage\u00a0\nQ: What is the single biggest change in your life since launching SoloHour?\n\nA: My life is less chaotic and I'm not chasing the next dollar. I'm more self-aware and truly a better conversationalist now then when I started this show.\n\n\u2028\u2028Zach Houk\u00a0\nQ: SoundCloud just opened it's full podcasting features for everyone, rivaling Libsyn. Previously, their features were limited, but now it seems to be cheaper and possibly more features than Libsyn. What do you think of using SoundCloud for podcasting hosting?\n\nA: If it's cheaper and has more features then I feel pretty good about it!\n\nQ: What makes a great logo? What examples of logo designs do you love?\n\nA: A logo needs to tell a story in one glance. You need to feel the narrative of the company just by looking at the logo. Go to Google and type in logo inspiration 2015. Switch to images or look at the articles. These will give you some ideas of great logos. Personally I love when the concept is integrated into the logo like the \"o\" in the TSH logo is a clock.\n\n\u2028\u2028Jackie Smith\u00a0\nQ: Ok Michael here is a question for you. \" How much do you use your gut instinct in your daily business decisions and should others do the same\"? And to expand a tad on this \" do you make business decisions when you do not have total peace about which way to go\"?\n\nA: Leaders decide so I make decisions quickly. Having no answer is worse than having the wrong answer so I'll make a decision based on some empirical data I'm looking at.

One of the greatest examples of this is the professional athlete. They\u00a0train tirelessly: rep after rep, day after day no matter how they feel and often no matter how the pain they experience.\n\nOn today's episode we're talking with one of the supreme athletes of the mixed martial arts (MMA) world. He's\u00a0a three-time ultimate middle weight champion who has created several successful enterprises; he is Rich \"Ace\" Franklin. We'll dive into all of that and more on the\u00a0260th episode of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About\u00a0The Mindset of a Professional Athlete\nWhen Rich was a young boy growing up in Ohio, MMA didn't exist in the US. His focus was football; he wanted to be a professional football player in the NFL and he played through his high school years.\n\nDuring\u00a0his freshman year of college his focus shifted; he had been a tall, skinny kid weighing in at 155 pounds (soaking wet he says) and 6'. Within those first two years of college he had put on 35 pounds of muscle, grew an inch and changed his entire body composition.\n\nHe also attended the first UFC fight and he was immediately interested. Back in those days there were three rules for all fights: no fish hooking, no eye gouging and no biting. Today the rules are a bit more extensive and intricate, but MMA has always been a combination of physical prowess and mental chess. And Rich's mental game is superb.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tIs MMA a young man's sport?\n\tWhy is mindset the difference maker in an MMA match?\n\tWhat is an \"earned meal\" and why should you\u00a0add it to your diet?\n\tWhy did the tradition of throwing coins into water start, and why does it matter?\n\tWho has the best athletic nickname of all time?\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\nRich spends 8 hours prepping for every 1 minute he is in the cage! Imagine if you applied that same approach to your business and spent 8 hours prepping for every 1 minute of a podcast, a webinar, a speech or a course you were creating - how different would your business look? That's why he is one of the elite: his mindset.\n\nOn today's show Rich shares why mindset has been so pivotal in his success both in the cage and off and he shares his latest entrepreneurial endeavor. Whether he's in a fight or he's creating his next business, Rich believes wholeheartedly in mental prep.\n\nEspecially when you're in the upper echelon of any field, you're going to be going against the best so you have to put in the time to study and create a mentally prepare mindset.\n\nBecause there are curveballs in anything and everything you do in life, you've got to be prepared and you've got to overwork the other guy (or gal). Having the right mindset is the cornerstone for that preparation. If you have the proper mindset you'll do the work until you're on top.\n\nRich has learned that lesson throughout his MMA career and while building several businesses. He talks about how his juice bar in Beverly Hills, ZeLin, had such tremendous success and why he ultimately sold it to become VP of One Championship in Asia and also to affiliate with Armor Gel, a silver-based gel that heals cuts, scrapes and wounds while also providing a protective barrier for your skin.\n\nWe've got plenty more where that came from so dive in for the full scoop from Rich on mindset, MMA and mental prep. Thanks to Rich for\u00a0co-hosting and to you for lending your ears! We'll see you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: Were you involved in athletics growing up?

So after graduating from college he tried a variety of jobs before starting his own business. He worked for UPS, in retail settings and in the restaurant biz. When his restaurant manager criticized the way he was making scooping butter for butter balls, Daniel knew it was time for a change.\n\nFrom there he did what all of us do: he read, he studied and he took action. One of the gigs he had held in the past was as a Kaplan tutor. Kaplan is an ACT or SAT test prep company that helps high school kids get ready for their college entrance exams (their ACT or SAT tests).\n\nA light bulb went off when he realized Kaplan was making bank off of his efforts. They took about 80% of the fees, while he did almost all of the work. But rather than compete against them he looked for an opening in the marketplace, and he soon found it. He discovered there was an elite college prep advisory industry. These are people who advise young students (some as young as 8th grade) on how to get into the elite universities of the world. Naturally these advisors refer their students to college prep programs like Kaplan.\n\nSo Daniel approached these advisors, offered to white label himself and work in-house with them and give them a portion of the profits. Now they could offer their students a full service package by having test prep under their list of offerings. In other words, it was a win-win for everyone.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat his\u00a0experience\u00a0in a presidential motorcade can teach you about networking.\n\tHow he got his SAG card and what it has to do with solopreneurship.\n\tWhat do butter balls have to do with his transition into entrepreneurship?\n\tWhy he isn't a fan of virtual summits.\n\tWhat did his childhood smell like?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHis business boomed overnight and soon was making great money. He often found himself going home with $10,000 worth of checks and cash from his services. He continued to build his business and offer classes, partnerships with schools, etc. The key takeaway from his experience for you is this: he started with something he knew how to do and he built his business from there.\n\nEventually he wanted to do something that was remote and he decided to create a web design and development firm. He took a look on elance and saw an opening, again. Many of the people looking for help were native English speakers while the people bidding on jobs were not. Daniel created a video pitching himself and his services in English.\n\nHis video created a feeling of trust and connection with the English speakers, they paid to work with him. And Daniel soon had more work than he could handle so he contacted the non-native English speakers and brought them on to help him. The clients were getting their needs fulfilled, the contractors and Daniel all earned money. Again, a win-win for everyone.\n\nAnd one day he wrote a manifesto to other 20 somethings who were frustrated with their jobs, and their careers. He hit a nerve and Rich 20 Something was born. Hundreds of emails poured in from people who read his manifesto. They wanted to know how he had done what he did, what advice he had for them. Daniel started to grow a following and over time, he was introduced to editors and other people who helped him get published in Entrepreneur magazine, and Business Insider.", "duration": "1:09:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/259.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Daniel DiPiazza", "Fitness & Health", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "Rich 20 Something", "Solopreneur", "Solopreneurship"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1429845768, "title": "258: Dealing With Setbacks, Solopreneur Finances, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Another Friday Q&amp;A show in the can!

Enjoy episode 258!\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore About This Show\n\nRobert Bone\u00a0\nQ: 1) I've been a solopreneur for nine years and most of my business is direct to private clients (magic and mindreading at weddings and parties).\n\nI want to do more corporate work, how can a solopreneur create the impression of being a bigger business? Much of my existing private business comes from referrals and people seeing me in action, therefore I can adjust my website, marketing and brand to attract new corporate clients, knowing the existing business is taking care of itself.\n\n2) Would you social media ninja course still be relevent for me? As I said, much of my existing business comes from referrals, could I use the Ninja course to leverage more business. Any sneaky thoughts to how?\n\nA: 1.) The next time you have a gig either speak to the photographer or bring your own with permission and a videographer, and have them shoot you in front of a crowd. After the shoot ask permission (give them a discount) to solicit testimonials from the crowd, ask the crowd for help and be honest about what you're looking for. Then\u00a0get their testimonials and put it together in a sizzle reel.\n\nThen uplevel your site, redesign it with great photos, great design and your sizzle reel. Look at it as an investment in your business.\n\nA: 2.) Yes, it would be very relevant. As would SoloLab, as a regular business builder we could help you with this.\n\nBruce Irving\nQ: How would you grow your audience for a podcast and website for a niche audience? If you were to start a blog or podcast but it was focused in a particular topic.\u00a0For instance I have one about the marketing for a pizzeria.\n\nWhat would you do to get people to know about it? \u00a0Tactics or strategies. \u00a0Hope that is more specific.\n\nA: The best way to speak about this or anything else is to do it. No matter what the endeavor you have to define your avatar. You could also put a kit together for one of their employees and train them on how to market the pizzeria (or other business) through SMS, social media, etc. You gotta get your hands dirty and prove this model works, then you can scale and the world is your oyster.\n\nMateo\nQ: Please bring jessshaanan\u00a0back on the show and ask her how her journey into solopreneurship is going. What is her latest win? She has the best female voice for broadcast I've ever heard, BTW.\n\nA: We worked on her first ever video, I'm helping her with that. But she doesn't have a clear avatar on who she's helping or what she's doing and we're working on that in a noisy niche. Find her on Instagram or reach out to me.\n\nPeacockoclock@solohour\nQ: My business took a huge setback as a result of a few consecutive poor decisions on my part. I consider myself quite resilient or as\u00a0@garyvee\u00a0would put it a punching bag for my business but thats not to say i didnt fall off the horse for a short while.\n\nWhat are your tips, from personal experience before The Solopreneur Hour how to come back swinging with huge momentum. Ps avid listener from show 1!\n\nA: One of the things\u00a0my dad always said to me was how good I am at picking me up by my bootstraps. And I am. It's cliche to stay failure is not an option but if your mindset is correct (and yours will get that way if you pay attention to how other entrepreneurs think), you just realize something didn't work and you move...", "duration": "56:49", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/258.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Friday", "Q&A", "Questions", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1429657760, "title": "257: Why Arman Assadi Left Google", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Google is considered one of the most innovative, fun and rewarding companies to work for. So why would someone leave? To pursue their solopreneur dream of freedom and personal satisfaction, at least that's why today's guest left.\n\nArman Assadi of Why I Left Google is here to chat about what it was like working at Google, common themes he sees among successful people and how to transition from a job to your own solopreneur gig to live a freedom lifestyle. All of that and more on episode 257 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0The Freedom Lifestyle\nArman Assadi grew up in California, born to immigrant parents from Iran. His parents were incredibly supportive of anything he wanted to do and encouraged him to pursue his passions. Eventually those passions took him to Google. He loved the time he spent there and says it really is everything you'd expect it to be. He always felt cared for and supported.\n\nIn fact after he left, he missed having ice cream with his lunch and playing ping pong when the mood struck him! But he left because he knew he had greater things to do with his life, his own pursuits and he wanted to be the one calling the shots in his life. He knew he could create something meaningful in his work while still living a freedom lifestyle.\n\nThe first thing he did after leaving was to go to Cuba with friends. He didn't really know what was next for him but while there he came up with an idea. With that idea in mind he started blogging and then created his first course. The course did well but he soon understood he needed a brand and a brand promise through which to filter his ideas.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat is the confluence model and why should you care?\n\tWhat should be your first big goal with your business?\n\tHow does he deal with askholes?\n\tAre you falling into the \"when I...\" happiness trap?\n\tWhat did his childhood smell like?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nAnd that's one of the common themes he sees among successful people: they have a brand and they filter everything through it. If the new thing is in alignment with the brand then it's a yes. If it isn't then it's a no. He says unsuccessful people, people who are struggling are trying to do too much and often doing things not in alignment with their brand.\n\nAnother commonality among the successful is they have figured out the confluence model. The confluence model is the intersection between your passions, what the world needs and wants plus your unique genius as an entrepreneur or\u00a0creative artist. When you find that sweet spot and identify your market and your niche, then back it with something you're passionate about you have a recipe for success.\n\nIf you've identified all of that and worked through your confluence model, how do you make the transition from your day job to your solopreneur life? Arman recommends simply getting something out there, testing it and finding out if you have a good business idea or just a hobby. You'll know by testing a minimum viable product, making a few sales and getting feedback from your buyers. If they're clamoring for more from you then you're on to something!\n\nAnd if they aren't, don't worry about it. Part of succeeding in the online arena or any other marketplace is failing. The online business world is all about failure: fail faster, fail forward, etc.\n\nAs an extra bonus people love to hear what you learned from your failures, it makes you human and someone they can relate to because all of us have failed. Plus they get to learn from your mistakes. So get out there with your idea, test it out and see what happens!\n\nArman and I also talk about what it was like to work at Nordstrom's, his morning ritual and apps that make his life easier and supports his freedom lifestyle. Have a listen for that and more on this episode.

We'll dive into all of that and more on the\u00a0256th episode of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About How To Become\u00a0a Professional Speaker\nThom Singer didn't always dream of becoming a speaker. At a young age he dreamt of being an actor. Even though he grew up within mere miles of Hollywood he never pursued that dream. Instead he followed his parents' wishes and did well in school in hopes of going to college after graduation.\n\nWhen he was in high school\u00a0his mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. Naturally\u00a0his mother's illness significantly impacted his day to day life. So much so that\u00a0he chose\u00a0nearby San Diego State for college so he could be close enough to return if she really needed him.\n\nIt was a decision he was grateful for later on. His mom became very ill during the first days of his freshman year of college\u00a0and he went home to visit as much as possible. She died not long after, but he always felt he had been there for her as much as possible and he was grateful for the time he had with her.\n\nNot long after graduating SDSU he was offered a job in Austin, Texas running an event photography office. His then-girlfriend-now-wife was also offered a job in Austin. They moved together and said they'd stay for 3 years. 24 years later they still call Austin home as do their two daughters. Through a series of jobs and opportunities in Austin Thom became a paid speaker about 10 years ago, full-time 6 years ago.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWho is the highest paid speaker in the world?\n\tIs there a specific number of speeches you must give before you're good?\n\tWhat's the most arrogant thing a speaker can do and how can you avoid it?\n\tThe two tricks to reeling in your audience.\n\tPeople die from exposure: Thom explains how this relates to speaking.\n\tAnd much, much more!\n\tHow to become a professional speaker\n\nThom's initial brush with speaking came when he was hired to be the marketing director at a local law firm. From there he gained more experiences as a speaker and trainer, which only fueled his desire for paid public speaking gigs. So he created a business plan for himself and on today's episode he shares the three components of that plan.\n\nHe also shares the three different business areas of speaking. The first is the celebrity or famous speaker. This is someone who is famous and gets paid to speak simply because of the name recognition. They may or may be trained speakers and may or may not be good!\n\nThe second group is the industry speakers. These are people who are known for a particular topic or area of expertise and they are asked to speak on it. They can be CEOs of famous companies or from any other walk of life.\n\nThe third group is the group Thom falls into. These are the paid professional speakers. These are the folks who make their living giving speeches. And to be a part of this group you've got to practice. The majority of your business is going to come from referrals and the only way you're going to get referrals is to become good. So join your local chapter of NSA, get some professional speakers as your friends, read Speaker magazine and begin to develop your chops. That is how to become a professional speaker!\n\nWe dive fully into how to become a better speaker and how to transition from free gigs to paid gigs. Thom provides some salient advice like building your reputation, setting yourself apart from others by the way you name your topics and developing your own signature story so you standalone and become memorable.\n\nThere's much more where that came from so listen in to glean it ...", "duration": "1:18:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/256.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Thom Singer", "How to Become A Professional Speaker", "Speaker"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1429247408, "title": "255: Your Weekly Solopreneur Coaching Session", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to our Weekly Solopreneur Coaching Session!\nHey everybody welcome to the 255th edition of The Solopreneur Hour. We're gathered here today for our weekly Solopreneur Coaching Q&amp;A show. This show is special, because I recorded it LIVE with the Periscope App on Thursday, and took questions right from the viewers.\n\nIf you haven't listened to one of these episodes before this is YOUR chance to ask questions and get my answers.

We cover all of that and then jump into your questions. Here goes!\n\nJill Guarino Brown\u00a0\nQ: I've been filming outdoor videos of garden tips for mylandscapecoach.com.\u00a0Is there a way to process out some of the background noise in the audio?\nA: It's harder to undo it once it's recorded into the audio. There are some filters you can use in GarageBand or Audacity. Try those and try\u00a0compression. Or outsource it on Fiverr to find someone who can do it for you. For future recordings get the audio-technica ATR3350.\n\nEntrearchitect\nQ: What are your next steps for Studio 86, what are your plans for equipment upgrades?\nA: One upgrade I'll be doing is my mixer, one with more channels and/or one that will let me use my iPad for sliders. I wouldn't mind trying the Electro-Voice RE20 microphone.\n\nBecca Jorgensen\u00a0\nQ: My question is how important is it to have a domain that matches the podcast name, or can the podcast be within a domain of a different name?\nA: If it's related it's okay to have a different podcast name than the domain name. Plus if it's not your main focus it isn't as crucial. You can use something that explains what you do like I've got your love.com. Especially if it contains an action item it'll work well. The vocal stylings matter more than the written word so yes you can have a domain that's different as long as your listener comprehends it easily.\n\nJace Jacobs\u00a0\nQ: Wazzzzzzzupppp! As a newbie podcast host I'm feeling good about my interview/conversation skills, however, I know I will continue to grow and improve with experience. Was there a point in your pod journey where you wondered I wish I knew then what I know now? I get the feeling that based on your social media training the conversation based pod interview just came natural to you.\nA: Yes is the answer. What I've been doing in the last few months is trying to bridge the gap between my off-mic conversations and my podcasting interviews. The main asset you have is your ears: how well you listen. They can really feel when you listen and hear them, which leads them to be more open.\n\nLara Loest\nQ: \u2028This was my question last week that didn't get answered: I just submitted my proposal to speak at Podcast Movement. If accepted as a speaker this will the largest group I've spoken in front of. Do you have a few quick tips for me?\u2028\u2028 \u2028\u2028I just listened to Monday's show so my next question is if you have anything you'd add that wasn't covered in that epi?\nA: Preparation, visualization like Rich Franklin does and get the content/presentation down pat. Use one bullet per slide for major points so you can talk for 5 minutes from that point.\n\nPeriscope User Route 33Inc\nQ: Should you use a vanity URL if the .com is not available?\nA: I probably wouldn't get vanity URL. I'd try some other modifiers: add a \"the\", an \"i\" or something like that. Or if you have a related action item like I would get \"I am unemployable.com\".\n\nMark\nQ: Who has been your favorite guest on the show so far?\nA: I've had so many! Mike Johnston has been one of my favorites. I really liked Jack Canfield, he's so nice and he was such a pro. Anna Vocino is always terrific! Vasavi Kumar was fantastic as well as Jordan and Jonathan Fields.", "duration": "1:09:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/255.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Musicians", "Network Marketing", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Real Estate", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "Facebook Q&A", "Solohour", "Solopreneur Coaching"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1429049563, "title": "254: People Over Profit, with Dale Partridge", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "People over profit\u00a0may sound like a new concept for some solopreneurs but it really isn't. Familiar phrases like\u00a0\"the customer is always right\" or \"take care of your employees and they'll take care of your customers\" are rooted in this same concept.\n\nHowever people over profit\u00a0takes it a step further and applies it to everyone in the company from owners to customers to contractors to employees.\u00a0The\u00a0savviest, most long-standing and profitable companies in the world put ALL\u00a0of these people over profit.\n\nAt first blush that may sound like a tall order but here to guide us on the how to and implementation of people over profit is Dale Partridge.\u00a0Dale is the author of a book with that same title: People Over Profit. We'll dive into all of that and more on the\u00a0254th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About\u00a0People Over Profit\nDale Partridge is young, especially for someone who has experienced and lived through so much. At 18, he had a full scholarship to play baseball for Cal State Fullerton which is one of the premiere colleges for baseball in the US.\n\nThe summer before he was to begin as a student at Cal State however, he broke a bone in his elbow and within a few days he knew his playing days were done.\u00a0But rather than let a dashed dream slow him down, he took the experience and grew from it. He wanted to know why this had happened and if he could've done something differently to prevent it.\n\nWith that in mind he started a fitness company called Fit Image. He grew that business for a few years until he realized he was simply a therapist for other people and he was miserable in that role!\n\nHe took his money from the sale of that company, invested in the stock market, got out with some profits and\u00a0reinvested in a new company: a rock climbing gym. He got outside backing as well and again, built that company into a thriving enterprise. But within a few years he was fired (rightly so he admits now) and started over, yet again.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tHow did they fire people at Sevenly and what can it teach you about life?\n\tWhat was so hard about the book writing process for him?\n\tWhy was he such a bad leader at the age of 21?\n\tAre there bad companies or just bad leaders?\n\tAnd, of course, what his childhood smelled like.\n\nHe dabbled in a few other ventures over the next year or so, and then started a branding agency. He loved it! He was a designer at heart and had a real eye for it. As with every other company he started this one grew as well. And one day while chatting with his business partner they had an idea for a new side gig, a company that would later be called Sevenly.\n\nSevenly took off like a rocket! The concept was simple: partner with a different charity every week and give $7 (hence the name) of every item sold to that charity. They would sell shirts, hats, etc. The first week they sold over 800 items, and gave nearly $7k to a charity. They realized this business model, if it continued to work, could do double the revenue of the branding agency.\n\nSo they killed the agency, took whichever employees with them that wanted to go and grew Sevenly. Within its first 2.5 years it grew to 50 employees, nearly $10 million in revenue and in its first 3.5 years gave around $4.2 million to charities. In short, the company was growing faster than he could keep up with.\n\nThat intense level of growth in such a short period of time actually became an incredible challenge for him and his wife. They both began to suffer from insomnia, depression, anxiety and panic attacks. He knew it was time for him to leave, and so he did in October of 2013.\n\nRather than retiring and fading away, Dale wanted to write about the idea and the concept that would become his book People Over Profit. He was very interested in why and how companies like North Face, Whole Foods, and REI could retain employees with high satisfaction rates, provide great customer experiences and still make a profit.", "duration": "1:06:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/254.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Dale Partridge", "Fitness & Health", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "People Over Profit"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1428901484, "title": "253: How to Build Your YouTube Channel, with Amy Schmittauer", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "More About\u00a0How To Build Your YouTube Channel\nAmy's graced us with her presence before, check out her backstory here and her CES visit here. If you don't know her you should! She's created an incredible brand with Savvy Sexy Social and has a major following on YouTube. Her background is all things video and she's been rockin' that niche for awhile!\n\nOn today's show we're chatting content strategy, what your goals should be for your videos and some basic rules to follow when creating and marketing your videos.\n\nAnd if you aren't a video person never fear this episode is still for you. Take what we share and apply it to your particular platform, this is the type of information that can be applied across the board. I know you'll find value in Amy's knowledge.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat's the connection between refrigerators and Periscope?\n\tWhere I envision The Solopreneur Hour going in the future.\n\tHow can you find the top searches in Google and YouTube?\n\tShould you repurpose your youtube videos as video podcasts?\n\tHow long should your videos be and what retention rate should you aim for?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nSo the first thing you need to know about creating a YouTube channel is that it's pretty straightforward. Do you have a Google account? Then you can create a YouTube channel of your own. Go to YouTube, click the sign in\u00a0button, and go.\n\nIf you need advice on equipment you can check out the Resources section on Amy's web site. She shares exactly what you need to get started and says this: don't let equipment be your excuse to not start! If you have a smart phone you can make a video right now.\n\nNow when you're actually creating your video keep in mind who your audience is and what their interests are. Videos on YouTube or other platforms fall under the same umbrella as other content material: it isn't a pitchfest for you and your products or services. Whatever you're sharing it should be about your audience. What do they need? What can you offer them right now to solve a pain, discomfort of theirs? THAT is what you need to be creating a video about.\n\nInvariably this leads to the next step: where are you going to share your videos? YouTube is the obvious platform but Facebook also has a video feature. Do you need to be on both? Do you need to be on Twitter, Snapchat and Periscope too?\n\nAmy's advice: stick to one or maybe two places and knock it out of the park there before moving on to other spaces. Choose your medium (video or otherwise), choose your one or two social media outlets and rule there, then expand. You definitely don't and shouldn't be everywhere at once. Think about it: would you rather be exceptional at one or two spaces or mediocre at six? Choose exceptional.\n\nAlso on today's show we also discuss her first content strategy, how she evolved and when she really hit her groove with Savvy Sexy Social. Listen in for some golden nuggets! Then\u00a0join me in thanking her for being here and thank yourselves for tuning in\u00a0as well. See you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: What is your content strategy and does YouTube fit your audience? If it does, what did you discover from Amy on today's show?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast? If so, could you please leave a review here.

Ask whatever you want, any topic you want: bring it on!\n\nSit back, relax and enjoy today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nOn today's episode we cover a\u00a0slew\u00a0of topics: my upcoming trip to SE Asia, how to get organized, a few details on how to use Periscope and much more.\n\nIf you'd like your question answered on a future episode join the mailing list (look for the link that says The Top 10 Must Use Resources for\u00a0Every Solopreneur), click on the Contact page of this site or join our Proudly Unemployable Facebook group right here.\n\nAnd now since I think\u00a0you've waited long enough, let's jump in and see what you had to ask this week on The Solopreneur Hour!\n\nThom Singer\nQ: How can a solopreneur get more money fast?\nA: Teach something you already know! Get a steady group of clients, really nail what it is you're doing, create\u00a0a course based on what you've taught those clients and then put it out in the world.\n\nRico Sutton\nQ: To license your business for royalties or not?\nA: Depends on the business and whether or not you think the idea has mass appeal and if you want to handle the infrastructure of your product.\n\nShana Edgecombe\nQ: The process of getting organized and handling everything as a solopreneur.\nA: Getting Solopreneur Coaching can be tough.! I'm doing it myself and it's easy to fall into superhero syndrome. While you can do it yourself, initially try the apps workflowy and trello. I like Mint, CapitolOne 360 and Evernote. Check out Chris Ducker's Virtual Freedom book to help you choose what to outsource and the best way to do it.\n\nShariff Abdallah\nQ: How does leadership effect ones decision to leave a Direct Selling company and start another? What have you experienced in the past when switching? Thanks! - I appreciate ya\nA: I have a lot of experience with this. I've left a company and gone to another one, and the backlash was immense. I then spent the next 1.5 working with various companies helping them with their social media marketing. Depending on where you're at you'll have different scenarios you'll face.\n\nTravis Royboy Scanlan\nQ: What track do you most want to take the Porsche to?\nA: Laguna Seca in Monterey and Brands Hatch in London.\n\nTravis Royboy Scanlan\nQ: Okay, business question from me: I'm having a perception problem with my photography/videography business. I give away so much content that it's my opinion that most of the social media following I've amassed just thinks of me as a free content source.\n\nI have trouble getting prospects to contact me to book shoots, I spend money on fb advertising with no return, but when I do get a customer they love the final product.I must face the hard fact that I'm either not good enough, I have a perception problem or I'm just marketing my paid services incorrectly.\n\nA: It's the balance between what do you give away and what do you charge? Is it your goal to book more shoots or teach people on how to shoot better? The people you are attracting are people who may want to shoot like you, so teach them. And you need to do a lot of local hustle: know everyone in your area who you can connect with. Dig in with the people you've worked with and ask for referrals. And also consider setting up a referral program for them.\n\nDavid Aaron Johnson\nQ: Have you read the May issue of European Car with Magnus and Sharkwerks on the cover?\nA: I had Magnus on the show and also listened to him on Joe Rogan so I feel like I have a good grasp on what they have to say!", "duration": "1:05:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/252.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "Friday Q&A", "Solopreneur Coaching"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1428478015, "title": "251: Tim Paige of Leadpages on Email Marketing and The Power of The List", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Solopreneurs know that online marketing and email lists have long\u00a0been touted as the #1 way to build your empire. But\u00a0we also know there are\u00a0countless people telling us how to do it the \"right way\", and many of those people contradict each other.\n\nHere to tell us the tried and proven ways to use email marketing is Tim Paige of Lead Pages. Today we talk about the power of the list, where email marketing is today and much more on\u00a0episode 251 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nTim Paige is a man of many talents: he's an integral part of Lead Pages, a musician, and a voiceover artist. If you'd like to know more about his background check out his first episode with the show right here.\n\nOn today's show we spend a lot of time talking about the link between health, well-being and your business. Tim shares some recent nutritional and physical transformations he's experienced and how he's noticed the impact his food and exercise choices have on his energy level and his ability to perform at work.\n\nSegueing\u00a0from\u00a0health into work we discuss some very\u00a0relevant information from LeadPages, where Tim works. Although there are plenty of options in the marketplace for solopreneurs looking for landing page options, Tim shares what sets LeadPages apart from their competitors: conversions.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat's one of Tim's favorite voiceover intros he's done?\n\tWhat is the best lead magnet, according to Tim?\n\tWhy speed of implementation is so critical.\n\tWhat should you be split-testing?\n\tHow do you know if your opt-in rate is good, average or abysmal?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nAccording to Tim everything LeadPages offers to you has been tested and has been proven to convert. Any landing page they make available for the public they already know will convert at a high rate, and that is why it's there for you to use it. If something didn't convert it didn't make the cut. He explains in detail the other differentiating factors that make LeadPages so powerful - including their new mobile offer called Lead Digits!\n\nWe also discuss why the key to everything in marketing is testing. What works for one person and converts well won't necessarily work and convert for you. Everyone's audiences are different and the only way you're going to know what is best for yours is to test it.\n\nSome general best practices Tim shares today are to have multiple lead magnets and use them in various places on your web site. Another best practice is to use resource guides, he says resource guides have proven to be the best lead magnets of all.\n\nAnd finally he wants you to always be thinking of your audience, ask yourself\u00a0what they need, what are their biggest pain points and how can you solve them? When you have the answer you have your idea for a lead magnet.\n\nTim and I also chat about the long form sales letter, what a good conversion rate is for your web site (and what's a bad average) as well as his new home! Please join me in thanking him for being here and big thanks to you as well. See you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: What are you using right now for your lead magnet(s)?

As solopreneurs, if we\u00a0want to leverage our knowledge, raise our expertise and position ourselves as an authority in the marketplace, a book is a phenomenal way to do so.\n\nAnd three-time bestselling New York Times author Tucker Max is here to share a simplified process of creating and publishing yours.\n\nMr. Tucker Max is the creator of Book in a Box, a service designed to create and publish your book with as little as 12 hours of your time.\u00a0Listen in as he shares the details - and a whole lot more! - \u00a0on the\u00a0250th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nTucker's first book, I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell, started out as emails he sent to friends about his sexual exploits. Eventually he put the emails together in a coherent form, then added more stories and content to create a book. After sending it to every agent and publisher he could find in the US he got it published.\n\nThe book became a New York Times bestseller and later,\u00a0a movie. Several more books have followed, and at one point Tucker joined the privileged ranks of Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis as as the only authors in history having three non-fiction books on the New York Times bestseller list at the same time.\n\nToday he shares what that level of fame has been like for him, how his childhood impacted him\u00a0and how his current endeavor, Book in a Box, was born on Lewis Howes' podcast.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhy did he get into MMA?\n\tWhat are the 7 ways to launch a brand today?\n\tHow many hours of spoken word does it take to create a book?\n\tDoes everyone have a book in them? Tucker weighs in.\n\tWhy following your passion is terrible advice.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nTucker has acquired many admirers and fans throughout his writing career and one of those fans once challenged him to find a solution to her problem. She wanted very much to write a book, she had the idea but she had no time to overcome all the hoops, hurdles and hinderances of the publishing world. In fact, she barely had enough time to write the book.\n\nAlthough he didn't see the opportunity immediately, he came around to the idea and created a process for her to go through. They set up a process for her to go through that would create and publish her book using only about 12 hours of her time in total. Tucker and his team would handle the details; all she had to do was answer questions to establish the idea and the\u00a0parameters of the book as well as answer more questions during\u00a0in-depth interviews with his team.\n\nThe book was transcribed from those interviews, then edited into actual prose and then edited\u00a0again by her and Tucker's team. Once the manuscript was edited, Tucker's people handled the design, layout and marketing. The finished, published book only required 12 hours of her time!\n\nNot long after Tucker was on Lewis Howes' podcast and mentioned this experience. Lewis' editor wanted in on the same process\u00a0and soon orders were pouring in...before Tucker had even created the product!\n\nEven if you don't have a book you want to publish, this is a great lesson in how to build a product. Do a litmus test of your audience when you have an idea. Create a web site, ask your audience if they're willing to buy what you're offering and then build it after the orders come in. It's the easiest way to succeed: build something your audience has said they want.\n\nTucker shares that valuable lesson and many others on today's show. Please join me in thanking him for being here and big thanks to you as well!\u00a0See you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY: Have you ever written a book or do you have an idea for one?

With a long history of working 9-5, I'm used to receiving a weekly paycheck and trading hours for dollars.\n\nBut now it's time for a mind shift. I've read the sexy six and have a pretty solid understanding for how I want to price things. However, I have some strange mental block that is giving me a fear to charge what I need to. Actually, I have a fear of charging anybody.\n\nI'm also afraid of selling myself short and selling to people in general. How do I get past this mental block and feel comfortable with bringing in income at a solopreneur level?\n\nA: Have a web site, connect it to a PayPal account. Follow my example: I offered a 30 minute consultation for $47 and walk you through everything you needed to do to update your social media accounts. The first thing you want to do is get clients and get your reps in.\n\nTo do so you can charge a low rate or do it for free and use the anchor client strategy. Anchor clients are big name clients you offer to do some work for free. Then you deliver for them and they become advocates of your work. You can leverage their name and their experiences with you to garner more clients at a higher rate, they become the anchors of your new business.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2028\u2028\u2028Mark R. LePage\u00a0\nQ: I want to know about you and where you come from. What were your greatest influences as a kid? Tell us a bit about your mom and dad (if you're comfortable doing so.)\n\nA: I'm from Toledo, Ohio and played every sport known to man. My dad was a CEO of a canned company (like the cans that are used for Pringles). My mom was in advertising and marketing, then became a stay at home mom. She played piano, my brother played guitar and I played drums. Many other family members were musically-inclined too.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChris Davis\u00a0\nQ: What are 2 or 3 of your favorite jazz recordings and why?\n\nA: Take Five, Don't Get Around Much Anymore and Boots Randolph.

Complicatory and the c word plus y.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDemetrio Flores\u00a0\nQ: Do you see yourself in the future with a little solopreneur jr.?!\n\nA: The short answer is yes!\n\n\u00a0\n\nBruce Irving\nQ: Hi Micheal,\nI think that getting traction and building momentum is the biggest challenge I face, Having the faith to stick with it and knowing it will work out in the end.\n\nP.S.

Technology changes faster than we can snap our fingers, industries\u00a0become obsolete overnight and the landscape of the Internet shifts in a heartbeat. We can keep up with these changes by learning and growing continuously.\n\nOur guest on today's show, Jonathan Levi, has uncovered the key to learning and in fact knows how to become superhuman learners! Listen in as he shares the details on the\u00a0248th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nJonathan was nearly unemployable from birth. His parents are both entrepreneurs and he grew up with the belief that if you needed money you simply created something and sold it. So he and his friends tinkered making various products and selling them.\n\nIn junior high and high school he designed web sites for his dad's friends' businesses, he DJed various gigs and, in his words, failed his way into success. He kept at it because he knew one of his ideas would hit!\n\nAnd he was right. At the age of 16 he started JLevi StreetWerks, a $3 million high end auto parts company that was named one of Inc's 5,000 fastest growing companies. Jonathan had a lot of fun with the business in its first few years but once he saw what emerging tech was doing in the marketplace, he wanted to change gears. So in his early 20s he sold the auto parts company and decided to create an impactful business.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat two companies did he interview with for jobs?\n\tShould we learn guerrilla-style or a little bit every day?\n\tWhat's the best way to read: book, Kindle/iPad or audio?\n\tHow many terrabytes of information does the human brain have capacity for?\n\tWhat did Jonathan's childhood smell like?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nNot long after he met\u00a0Professor Anna and Dr. Lev Goldentouch, two \"superhumans\".\u00a0Dr. Lev and Jonathan shared interests in sleep, psychology and emerging tech. It didn't take long for\u00a0Jonathan to discover\u00a0Dr. Lev's incredible reading comprehension and speed reading abilities. He hired Professor Anna to teach him and spent hours working with her, fine-tuning his skills and basically unlearning so much of how he had been taught to read in school.\n\nSoon Jonathan was speedreading his way through B school tests at INSEAD (the Harvard of Europe) and coursework, far faster and with greater comprehension than his fellow students. People took notice and asked him how he was doing it. He sent many referrals to Anna but she was a new mom and didn't have time to help everyone. So he finally he grew tired of answering their questions\u00a0and created a course they could buy instead.\n\nIt's been an incredible success; he's had over 26,000 students since its inception and that number continues to grow! He has partnered with Udemy and generally hustled in every possible way he could to market it. In keeping with that approach Jonathan has offered his course to you dear listener at a fraction of its original cost, you can find it here.\n\nOn today's show we talk about his experiences at SINEAD, what led him to live in Israeli which he now calls home, and some suggestions he has for helping you read faster and remember more right now.\n\nOne key takeaway he wants everyone to remember is that anything we want to remember should be turned into an image. As humans we have evolved to remember visual cues more so than any other. Visual is stronger than audio so by turning a word or phrase into an image we can remember it more clearly and far longer than we can a sound.\n\nTo discover more secrets to becoming superhuman find his course here! Pick it up and then thank Jonathan for his generous gift and the time he gave us today.\u00a0And thank you for being here and for being a supporter of The Solopreneur Hour. See you next time!\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY:\u00a0Have you ever taken a speedreading course? Have you used visual cues to remember important things?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast?

I had the privilege of hosting 7 sessions called Speaker Spotlight\u00a0during Social Media Marketing World and talking with 7 different speakers from the event. Chris Brogan was one of them and he was incredible!\n\nListen in while Chris and I chat about his love of Batman, his passion for creating human connections in business and his candid sharing about failure and success. All of that and more on this episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nIf you're not familiar with Chris he loves to explore how people use content and community to build marketplaces around areas of belonging. He is CEO of\u00a0Owner Media Group, a highly sought after\u00a0professional speaker\u00a0and The New York Times best-selling author of eight books and counting, including his forth coming book,\u00a0Belong: A Framework for Embracing Community, Driving the Economy and Building the Future.\n\nDuring this conversation we sat one on one, with a live studio audience. \u00a0When you listen to the show you'll hear how warm, transparent, and genuine he was during our chat. \u00a0I\u2019d have him on every week if I could because he has so much wisdom to share; he truly creates value in every interaction.\n\nToday we talk about his love of Batman (find out who his favorite Batman is!), and also the reason for\u00a0his recent physical transformation. Two other topics we cover are how he overcame very recent failure and what CREATE stands for.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhy does he love the concept, the idea behind Batman so much?\n\tWhat is his most recent deadlift goal?\n\tHow many years did it take him to get 100 readers on his blog?\n\tWhat's the story behind his sign-off phrase \"good night moon\"?\n\tWhy failure is so important to success.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nWhen Chris talks about his most recent failures he means pretty recently. In 2010 he says he was doing very well (he bought a Camaro with cash) but by 2013 he wasn't able to pay one of the three people he needed to pay. Since he was one of those three people, he didn't get paid and the other two did. It was a humbling experience, made even more so by the following year (2014) not being a whole lot better.\n\nOne of the questions you'll hear on the show from an audience member was what led him to that place, and how he got himself out of it. Chris admits resting on his laurels and not taking enough shots.\n\nHe says if we want to be successful we're always going to be moving to the next level, and we're going to fail in the process. But the key to overcoming that failure is to look for more options, more angles and take more shots. We've got to fail, fail and fail to succeed. The only reason we stay stuck in failure is because we aren't looking for more options, every problem can be solved if we look at enough angles and options.\n\nA great success equation he also gives to the audience (and now to you) is the acronym CREATE. Take each component of CREATE, find which you are good at and which you can amp up. Doing so will lead you and your business to bigger, better things.\n\nHere's what CREATE stands for:\nC is for contrast. \u00a0Don't try to be someone else or use someone else's message. Make yourself stand out.\nR is for reach.\u00a0\u00a0How far is your reach and how can you increase it?\nE is for exposure. \u00a0How many times can you expose your message to your audience?\nA is for articulate. \u00a0Simplify your message. How simply can you state it?\nT is for trust. \u00a0Does your audience trust you?\nE is for echo. \u00a0Does your audience see themselves in you? Can they relate to you?\nChris truly is a wise man. Listen in to hear what other great stories and lessons he gives in this episode, like the time he ran his bike into his house when he was 5! You'll laugh, you'll learn and you'll enjoy this chat with him, I am certain of it.\n\nPlease reach out to him on Twitter and thank him for this conversation, and thank yourselves for being.

Born in Philly, he's an Eagles fan but grew up in Houston, Texas. As a kid he played every sport possible from baseball to soccer to football; if it was an activity and he could compete at it, he played it.\n\nIn high school he fell in with a not-so-great crowd and was flunking out, even though he knew he was bright and so did his parents. He was shipped off to Montana to get his act together, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. While there, Brian understood a concept it takes many of us decades to learn (and some never learn): we are each responsible for our lives, 100%. No one else is to blame for anything, just us.\n\nHe was only 17 at the time but that realization changed his trajectory. He went on to college at Pepperdine, even though he knew in his heart he was going to be an entrepreneur. While at Pepperdine he was involved in several business ventures from a talent agency to a clothing line. Neither worked out but stored the lessons learned for the future.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat NFL\u00a0players did he play against in high school?\n\tHow did\u00a0getting kicked out of high school steer him towards entrepreneurship?\n\tHow did he almost have Lindsay Lohan as a client?\n\tWhat's the most important lesson he learned from previous business ventures?\n\tHow many cities will buddyTruk be in by 2016?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nBrian earned his chops over the next few years in a few other enterprises before coming up with the idea for buddyTruk. Like many great things, buddyTruk was born accidentally (literally). He owned a small car so when he was moving Brian rented a moving truck. While parking it at his new digs the truck caught the bumper of the car behind him and completely demolished the front of the car.\u00a0To add to insult to injury, the car he demolished belonged to his future roommate!\n\nBrian had spent the previous week in New York and had used Uber to get everywhere. He suddenly realized if he had only had something like Uber to help him move none of this would've happened. The light bulb went off and he set to work.\n\nThe first thing he did was secure the name, secure the web site and the social media handles. Next he decided to approach buddyTruk like Uber had approached their creation: he was going to treat it like a full-grown corporation. He drew up the legal papers, stock options, etc. He brought on a team to help him, shared stock where appropriate and went to work on getting the app up and running.\n\nWith the help of his team, the wireframe for the app was soon built and submitted to iTunes. The day it went live his team celebrated, they even had their first user! It took another 8 days before anyone signed up, and then another week before their third but they consoled themselves with the fact that Uber started slowly too.\n\nToday they are on the verge of going live in Austin, TX after steadily growing their presence in Los Angeles. They plan to be in 9 other cities by the end of 2015 and 50 in 2016. And the only reason they've grown to that degree is because they've listened to their customers' requests.\n\nTune in to get the deets on how buddyTruk evolved from an app to help UCLA students move to a soon-to-be worldwide phenomenon. Then join me in thanking Brian for being here with us, sharing\u00a0the\u00a0origins of his success with us.\n\nThank you for being here and for being a supporter of The Solopreneur Hour.", "duration": "1:08:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/245.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Brian Foley", "Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "BuddyTruk", "Entrepreneur", "Solopreneur", "Startup"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1427084099, "title": "244: Nick Unsworth on Balancing Work and Life", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "One of our returning champions and a great friend of the show is joining us today! Co-hosting The Solopreneur Hour is the one and only Nick Unsworth of Life on Fire.\n\nNick is here to chat about how he's creating a better work-life balance, what his daily routine is and why it's had such a profound impact in every area of his life.\n\nWe're talking about all of that plus some autocross racing and audio equipment (aka the new money pit hobbies I've gotten him into) on today's 244th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nIf you haven't heard Nick on the show before check him out here. He's got a great story about victories, overcoming obstacles and using focus and determination to create a life on fire. He's been an entrepreneur throughout his career and has seen some incredible highs and some significant lows.\n\nAs he shares with us on this show, today he's enjoying his life like never before. He's engaged to love of his life and his business is booming. One of the reasons everything is hitting on all cylinders like never before is because he is truly in alignment with and is living his purpose. He gets out of bed with joy and rocks his day. He's got a set routine to his day and a structure to his schedule.\n\nEvery morning he gets up early and he reads the letter he's written to himself for that month. His letter outlines all the great things that are happening and have happened that month. That letter is based on the goals he has set for himself on the first of each month. Nick puts those goals out on social media but the letter he keeps for himself and he reads it every morning.\n\nYou'll also hear:\n\n\tWhat does the term \"earn out\" mean?\n\tWhy it's so important to stop and ask yourself if you're having fun.\n\tWhy did Nick want a hobby?\n\tWhen to do a live event, and when to do a webinar: Nick explains.\n\tWhy in-person events are so powerful, and what you can learn from his success.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nYou can certainly write your own letter and read it to yourself every morning like Nick does.\u00a0One of the tips he has for you if you do so\u00a0is to use \"I am\" statements. Using these helps your subconscious is being reprogrammed by your letter. He also says to get into the emotion of what you've written, let yourself feel it!\n\nNick has used the letter strategy for years. In fact, it helped him get out of $50,000 of debt and eventually sell his business. Although that was a goal he worked incredibly hard for when the time came and his business was sold (and he made several hundred thousand dollars in the process, even after wiping out his debt), it still felt hollow and empty.\n\nHe had invested his 20s building the business and then moved to San Diego. He didn't have many friends in the city yet and didn't have a significant other to share it with, so it didn't feel like it really mattered.\n\nBut he took that experience and decided to turn things around. He got a business coach and chose to create a life that he would enjoy along the way, rather than being solely focused on the end results. From there Life on Fire was born and he hasn't looked back since!\n\nIn the last year or so he's really honed the focus of Life on Fire; he's simplified what the business offers in terms of coaching and has uncovered his absolute love for hosting live events. He held his own 3-day workshop last December (2014) and will be holding another one in June of 2015 in San Diego. He's also helping his clients do the same. Today he shares how he helped one client, Karen Fagan, generate an extra $15k by creating a live event while fulfilling her heart's passion.\n\nWe also talk about his latest hobbies of cars and audio! He asked me to get into some new hobbies, and I did. He's now enjoying the world of fine audio equipment and exploring what type of car he wants to start racing!\n\nFinally we wrap up with a chat about Nick's upcoming event in June.

Welcome to episode 243 of The Solopreneur Hour. Good to have you back for a Friday Q&amp;A show.\n\nToday's show takes a different tack...instead of just grabbing questions from our Facebook Group, I decided to (God forbid) actually WRITE all of you and ask you directly. \u00a0Well, I'm happy to say it was a resounding success! \u00a0A lot of interesting questions today, summarized below.\n\nTune in to get the nitty gritty of each answer!\nMore About This Show\nAndre from Quebec\nQ: Hi Michael. In your edition about adaptation you asked to\u00a0contact\u00a0you to tell you what is our skills. I am currently working for a big corporation with golden handcuffs I'm stuck here... blah blah blah you know the drill.\u00a0My skills involve pretty much Excel spreadsheets, any kinds of table pivot tables etc... I see a gazillion people with better skills than me on eLance... So I feel innadequate for solopreneuring.\n\nI'm involved with USANA which is probably your MLM company's competitor. Didn't do much with that because I don't know how to develop it nor where to start.\u00a0Get this! I don't even have the money to pay for your training on that! Yup! talk about the poor middle class chasing paycheck to paycheck... I'm the embodiement of that. Anyways keep on the good work you give me hope. :-)\n\nA: In your case I love the idea of plugging into the group that is doing well. I think USANA is a good company in terms of products. By joining you've given yourself more options than most. There's amazing sales training, community and leadership training available by being in network marketing, whether you build a business or not. So double down on it.\n\nIf you want I will gift you one. Write to me and I will give you the course, but I require that you do the entire course and you implement it. I want to see you have the fire! I love seeing people following the advice I give, it isn't easy but it's worth it.\u00a0Bottom line: you have to put the work and the effort in. I think plugging into training that\u00a0USANA offers is your best bet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDustin Ellard\u00a0\nQ: Q&amp;A - What is your current audio gear setup for the podcast?\u00a0Thanks!\nA: A Heil PR40 microphone with the HB1 microphone boom (shock mount) which is connected to an Analysis Plus yellow mic cable. All of that is plugged into a DBX 286S microphone pre-processor that gives you the radio voice sound which goes into a Q1202 USB mixer. I always record with the Zoom and don't go the software route, always hardware with an analog connection. See the Resources section below for the link to buy all of this (no commission, just links).\n\n\u00a0\n\nMike\nQ: I have been a Solopreneur for 10 years, making money using Google Adwords to generate 'leads' (eg a life insurance application) which I then sell to businesses. I have done this from home since 2005 and spent over $1 million of my own money doing this very successfully.\n\nWith a new baby I now want to take the business to the next level and cement my family's future. I feel like the next logical growth step is probably to teach, but what is my target market:\n\na) real small businesses who are struggling with Adwords\u00a0or\u00a0b) people who want to learn how to do what I do & make money from home with Adwords.\u00a0Which of these distinct groups should I target?\n\nSecondly what is the best way to package and deliver this decade's worth of knowledge I have?\n\nBy the way, 10 yrs online & I have never built any kind of 'list' up until 2 weeks ago! So I don't really have any kind of 'tribe' - only about 50 people so far have downloaded the Adwords secrets guide at\u00a0intelligentppc.com.\u00a0Thanks for your time, great show by the way.\nA: 1. You want to choose B, people who want to work from home and do what you've done. Use your skills to a T: make a live webinar (do a number of them), drive people to a training course of some sort from the webinar. Use your own techniques to get people to the webinar.

I\u2019m doing a version of this show at Social Media Marketing World - live on stage with these guys in front of a substantial audience. It\u2019s a big step outside of my comfort zone but I said yes and figured out how AFTER.\n\nBut before I do any of that I\u2019m talking to you about the 6 mistakes I made while developing The Solopreneur Hour. Let\u2019s get to those!\nMore About This Show\nHere are the places I could have improved upon:\n\n1. I didn\u2019t focus on building my mailing list.\nI could\u2019ve done better with this from an email marketing standpoint; I didn\u2019t spend much time or effort building this list, but it is something I will be focusing on going forward.\n\n2. I didn\u2019t systematize the social media production of the show soon enough.\nEventually I did but it could\u2019ve been done sooner. I think we need to get our hands dirty in the beginning and know how to do everything - then we can outsource it.\n\nDo it for a short period of time, record yourself doing the task and then outsource it.\n\n3. I didn\u2019t create mailing list content soon enough, and reach out to my core audience more often.\nOf the list that I have created I haven\u2019t reached out very much. I\u2019m leaving some engagement on the table so I need to focus on regularly connecting with all of you.\n\nI\u2019m going to focus on diving in and getting this nailed down, then perhaps I\u2019ll bring on a community manager to handle it. But first and foremost I have to do a better job of connecting with. If you have suggestions for this or any of these six reach out to me! I\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\n4. I could do a better job of reaching out to past guests to send them links to share the show.\nThis is SO important for show growth! The best time to get someone to share your content is when you hit \u201cstop\u201d on the recording. So you interview them - do a great job - and hit stop.\n\nThen ask them if they could do you a favor by sharing your show with their audience when it goes live. Be gracious no matter what they say. When they say yes, thank them and make a note and follow up.\n\nYou have to do it on the spot, they may not remember if you follow up a month later via email.\n\n5. The Solopreneur Hour\u00a0website redesign is long overdue.\nIt\u2019s been too long! I have friends who have redesigned their site twice in the time I\u2019ve had the same design up for TSH. I have a lot of info to share with everyone and I need to update that here for all of you.\n\nI\u2019ve got some ideas cookin\u2019 and it\u2019s in the works. This site has to reflect the movement of being a solopreneur. It can\u2019t just be about me but it needs to be about the bigger story.\n\n6. I\u2019ve had Superhero Syndrome.\nI\u2019ve wanted to do it all myself. It\u2019s easier for me to do the things in my wheelhouse then it is to walk someone else through doing it, make the video and go through that learning curve.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the long play and I know that. I am hiring VAs now and am working on handing off more tasks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd those are the six things I could've done better when building and expanding the show. Like I said none of them are mission critical and I've committed to making progress on each and every one of them. Be on the lookout, you'll see some changes soon!

Today we're revisiting an interview with Adam Carolla.\n\nAdam is one of the greatest solopreneur examples I can think of in today's acting and comedy world.\u00a0Everything he's done he's done on his own, from his comedy shows to his podcasts to movies.\n\nWe talk about his love of vintage cars, how he made movies because no one was going to cast him as a leading role and his philosophy on success. Listen in to hear what new nuggets you unearth on episode 241.\nMore About This Show\nAt first glance, Adam Carolla (spelled C-A-R, not C-O-R) is another funny comedian and broadcaster. \u00a0But, dig a little deeper, and you\u2019ll see a complex character wrapped in a brilliant mind.\n\nBeyond having one of the biggest, most successful podcasts in the world, he\u2019s also a world-class boxing instructor, a championship-winning race car driver, and a master carpenter. \u00a0His shrewd business-savvy has proven Adam to be one of the most successful modern-age Solopreneurs of our time. \u00a0Listen in as we break all the barriers and give you a great template to follow for success.\n\nFrom working on The Man Show to Crank Yankers to his independent film The Hammer \u00a0to his wine line named Mangria, Adam has always had to create his own success. \u00a0As an early pioneer to the podcasting space, his show has broken down huge barriers of entry for the rest of us. \u00a0In essence\u2026he\u2019s shown us how it\u2019s done!\n\nListen to hear Adam's words of wisdom on:\n\n\tThe correlation between team sports and\u00a0entrepreneurial life.\n\tWhen to work for free, and how to make it pay off.\n\tThe origins of The Man Show.\n\tWhere his love of vintage cars comes from.\n\tHow to create your own economy.\n\tAnd much, much more.\n\nOn this episode, Adam tells us how's he been so successful at so many different ventures and we get a look into his philosophy on how to hustle for success.\n\nOne of the main reasons he's created multiple thriving endeavors is his willingness to go for it. He knew early on his career that no one was going to cast him as a leading man in any film, but that's what he wanted to do. So rather than give up, he found another way to make his goal happen: he wrote a film and cast himself in the lead role, he found founding for the movie and got it made. He took what other people would see as a defeat and he created a victory.\n\nAs he says on this show, almost every facet of his career has been created this way. He's known for a long time that whatever he was going to get from Hollywood he'd have to get his own way. He's not a yes man, which is what La-La-Land loves. Rather than giving up, he chose to find a workaround.\n\nThink about the parallels to his experiences and to yours as a solopreneur. Where are you facing what seems to be a defeat? And how can you take that apparent failure and tweak it or create a workaround? One of the greatest things Adam has done has been to fail, adjust, fail again and continue to do so until he nails it.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we must do as solopreneurs: do something, fail at, get feedback, adjust and refine until it works well. Don't wait until it's perfect, even race cars aren't perfect and they still win! Get out there, do whatever it is you want to do - even if no one believes you can, like no one has believed in Adam - and learn from your experiences. Keep at it until you're victorious. Then start the process over again.\nQUESTIONS OF THE DAY:\u00a0Where have people told you you wouldn't succeed and you've proven them wrong? Where in your life could you take a risk right now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast? If so, could you please leave a review here.

Where to look at for off premise meet-ups? Do u plan on attending this year? If so, lets link up. Thanks!\n\nA: I'll definitely be there. I unconferenced last time and went to parties, hung out and connected with people. It's the best conference I've been to: the people there are some of the coolest, smartest, most forward-thinking people I've met at any conference. So yes I will be there!\n\nGiovanna Rossi Pressley\nQ: I would love to hear you address s2member and tips for creating a great membership option. Should I offer a freebie when people sign up? When to create closed/secret fb groups? Thanks!\n\nA: You need a platform, I don't know if freebies do much. But setting up a secret Facebook group is an absolute yes! My SoloLab Facebook group is rockin', I have an S2Member site but I'm building it out as a resource guide but not a dedicated hangout spot. I'm keeping the Facebook group for that.\n\nSean Gilgore\nQ: I am getting my tax return and want to start my platform. I have a budget of $1,000. Where is my money best spent for a digital product in the niche of guitar lessons?\n\nA:\u00a0Three options: build a podcast. Identify your niche, who is in that niche and what you're going to leave them with every time they interact with you. Second: build a blog. Three: build an Instagram audience. You could do YouTube or build out a Facebook group as your platform.\n\nBrand it properly, get that dialed in and then create content. Get 1-1.5 months' worse of content. Buy LeadPages, figure out what your audience's pain point is, schedule a free webinar. Then drive Facebook ads to the webinar. Do a training course, get people from the webinar into your S2Member site and you're set!\n\u2028\u2028Shanda Hereth Escoto\nQ: I would love some insight on creating a release form to have signed prior to doing an interview. I would like to own the rights to the content to use however I like.\n\nA: That is inherent if you're doing podcast interviews. People know if they are doing a public interview on a podcast the content is available for the podcaster to use. You can take it a step further and go to Legal Zoom\u00a0or Doc Stoc\u00a0and draw up legal documents.\n\nThomas Allison\nQ: Hi Michael - What new books have you read this year and what have you implemented into your life? All my best - Tommy @ The Cruise Dudes\n\nA: I've started quite a few and have only finished one of them! It's one of the things on my list is to read 10x faster, check out Tim Ferris' post on how to do so. I'd love to consume more great content and I know it'll just make me smarter, more successful.\n\nDennis Shelly\nQ: Dear\u00a0Michael O'Neal,\nI have a question that maybe you can answer and help me with...why are pants called pants?\u00a0Why not call them something more descriptive, like, I don't know,", "duration": "45:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/240.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1426048695, "title": "239: 10 Things I Did Right When I launched The Solopreneur Hour", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Solopreneurs! Don't let the title fool you. This isn't about \"hey, check me out, look what I did!\". It's essentially a primer on how to launch a business and brand from scratch.\n\nI take you through the steps I took (sort of, in no particular order) to launch the podcast and brand. This is one of those things where we hear the same things over and over, but we really have to just DO it and watch the amazing results that happen.\n\nThat's what we've got cookin' on episode 239 of The Solopreneur Hour, check it out!\nMore About This Show\nBelow\u00a0are the 10 steps, in a nutshell. \u00a0On the episode, I expand on each one so you can get the full scope of what went into every step. Listen closely to hear how each step applies to your business, and see if you don't just come away with some new insights and ideas!\n\nHere they are...\n\n10 Things I Did Right:\n\n1. I was patient, and let the brand come to me.\nYou can't rush this step, it needs to be organic. Do your research, make sure it's a great niche AND that it's also something that's unique to you and something you\u00a0know about. Don't pick a niche because it's hot and other people are making money in that area, choose the thing that is YOU. This takes time so be patient and let it evolve.\n\n2. I made real connections with people that were critical to the launch of the show.\nPat Flynn and Mike Johnson were critical to this show, I had built relationships with these guys prior to the launch of this show. As you heard in step one they were both critical to The Solopreneur Hour's existence. So build relationships, real relationships, and it will pay off.\n\n3. I studied the craft of broadcasting, including interview techniques, live ad reads, etc.\nThis is important for anything you do: study, study, study. A great example of this is Howard Stern and his interviewing techniques. Regardless of how you feel about him as a person Howard is one of the greatest interviewers of our generation. Even if you aren't a podcaster you can learn from him.\n\nCheck out Howard's interview of Dan Bilzerian, it's linked below. Study how he does what he does, especially when he gets Dan to open up. And be sure to research your topic, unless you're presenting it as your opinion. It's your responsibility as a podcaster, a blogger, a video content creator, etc. Any time you are sharing knowledge with the general public in some capacity you need to know why what you're sharing is both relevant and accurate. So study and research.\n\n4. I didn\u2019t let adversity get in the way. \u00a0No excuses.\nAs you may or may not know about 3 weeks before this show was set to launch I was hit by a car while I was biking. It was a brutal month of recovery with a broken collarbone and road rash in 19 places on my body. I could've easily said I was going to postpone it, but I didn't. I dug in and put it out there because I had made a public commitment to do so. So go for it, no matter what.\n\n5. I nailed the identity, using psychological triggers, important ownable keywords, and good design sensibility.\nI had a headstart in this area as a designer, but don't let that stop you! You can get help here, and you should if you don't have a design background or marketing knowledge or SEO knowledge. While you're in this process make sure you zag where everyone else zigs. There are tons of resources available so get after it.\n\n6. I went to conferences and got to know the players.\nThis is mission critical! I know you have lots of things to overcome to get there (kids, time, money, etc), but this is beyond vital for your business and your success. All the connections you need are made here: in the hallway, after hours at the bar, this is where business gets done. It's the new golf course!\n\n7. I got the right gear for the job.\nYou don't have to get the high-end, super expensive gear to get started, just make sure you're getting quality. Especially if you are a podcaster you absolutely must have amazing audio quality.", "duration": "58:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/239.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Branding", "Hour", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1425888523, "title": "238: Pat Flynn, Revisited.

Our guest on today's show is one of those people for me.\n\nOur co-host for today, Mr. Pat Flynn is the founder of SmartPassiveIncome.com. To boot he's a super-dad, and an all around good dude.\n\nHe's also one of the men who inspired this show so I am extremely happy to have\u00a0Pat Flynn on this episode\u00a0of The Solopreneur Hour Podcast. Enjoy!\nMore About This Show\nYou\u2019ve heard about Pat on a million other shows, so if you want to learn more about Pat, go here for his story.\u00a0 Instead of covering that same information over, we dug into some different areas, like how you can re-purpose your content, how to fight the fear of changing careers or leaving the one you\u2019ve been trained in, the beauty of mastermind groups, how to make a killer eBook, and loads of other nuggets.\n\nWe also talk about men\u2019s fashion and how a lot of men aren\u2019t paying attention to it like they should, and a KILLER way to stay focused throughout the work day.\n\nA topic we talk about on this show is mastermind groups. If you aren't in one you need to find one. Can't find one you want to join? Create your own. Pat talks about his mastermind groups, he's in three of them, and how they were critical to his early success. When he was just starting out he had no knowledge of or background in internet marketing and online business. But he had a great product, he had traffic coming to his blog and he knew there was something there.\n\nSo he joined a mastermind group and learned from people who had more experience and knowledge than he did. They showed him how to capitalize on his existing structure and product and turn it into a successful business model. He gives the full skinny on just how he did that on today's show and how you can find a mastermind that's right for you (or create your own!).\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow much did he receive for his first sale?\n\tAdversity breeds _______. We fill in the blank.\n\tWhy are negative comments useful?\n\tWhen and why feeling nervous is important.\n\tWhy did he record the first episode of his SPI podcast three times?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHe also shares some fashion tips during our chat, another subject we've covered a few times on The Solopreneur Hour. If you're tempted to skip over that part or ignore fashion all together, consider this: people are going to judge you based on how you present yourself.\n\nAnd your clothes are part of your presentation and part of how people are going to judge you.\u00a0T-shirts and jeans are fine at home, but what about events and networking? If you want to be taken seriously you need to dress the part. Take note of successful solopreneurs like Pat and follow in his footsteps: dress up and dress sharp when you're meeting others. Pat and I talk specifically about how to do this and how to do it right.\n\nWe also talk about his typical day, and the freedom and flexibility his solopreneur journey allows him. He generally wakes up early with his two kids and makes breakfast with them, plays with them and watches some educational TV with them. He spends the first half of his day with his kids and his wife.\n\nAfter he cooks lunch for them - he loves to cook - his wife takes over and he goes to work for a few hours. This is typically when he records episodes of his show. He wraps up in the late afternoon and then has family time again til the kids go to bed. Then it's back to work writing blog posts, working on various projects, etc. All of which he does in the late evening til around 1am while everyone else is fast asleep.\n\nHow does he manage to stay on track while he's working? He used to set an alarm to go off every 30 minutes. That alarm was his reminder to stay on task, and stay off of social media! Eventually he didn't need to have the alarm go off because it became routine for him to notice whether or not he was actually working,", "duration": "1:23:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/238.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Men's Style", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Pat Flynn", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "Inspiration", "Passive Income", "Smart Passive Income"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1425635033, "title": "237: Solopreneur Mistakes, The Porsche Panamera, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Here we are again, with another fantastico episode of The Solopreneur Hour, Q&amp;A style. \u00a0This is my favorite show: just you, me and your questions.\n\nWant to get in on the action?

Now we'll get down to the nitty-gritty, let's see what you had to ask and what I had to answer.\nMore About This Show\nLara Loest\u00a0\nQ: If you could be any active NFL player today who would you be and why?\n\nA: Of course I'd chose a Steelers player. James Harrison and his one-handed shoulder presses. I like his story: he came back from retirement and he rocked it.\n\nThom Singer\u00a0\nQ: What is the biggest mistake you see solopreneurs make in running their businesses?\n\nA: First: Outsource too quickly. Second: Don't outsource quickly enough.\nHere's the formula: be sure you know how to do something, find some private clients you can work with who will pay you. Take note of their questions and compile it. When you've got a successful business then you can scale it. Create a video course based on those questions and your experiences.\n\nThomas Coccagna\u00a0\nQ: How do you feel about putting a \"DONATE\" plugin on your website? And do they work?\n\nA: They do work, but results vary based on the audience and audience size. I've heard of some shows like Vinnie Tortorich and Abel James have them. If you're going to use them reinforce it on every show. So give it a shot, see what happens and expand to other products if it works!\n\nJohn Gregory\u00a0\nQ: In just the last couple of months I've figured out how to get myself out of my own way and my network marketing team has exploded. But there's a problem. It's been almost exclusively my own efforts and eventually will become unsustainable. So on to the next level of personal development: duplication. How do I build belief in others and help them get out of their own way?\n\nA: It's all about follow up and duplication. Make sure people are plugged into social media, the Facebook groups and the training calls. There is tons of training and coaching, so plug your team into a regular system.\n\n \u2028\u2028Jessica Shaanan\u00a0\nQ: Besides active listening, what are the top skills you are constantly refining, that make you a great coach and get your clients the results they're looking for?\n\nA: Keep it real. I don't pussyfoot around the truth. I believe if people want actual coaching then you should coach them. And I never take advice from broke, unhappy people. Finally, I connect the dots for people by knowing a lot about what is happening in the world and\u00a0being empathetic, understanding where the person I'm coaching is at on their timeline.\n\n\u2028\u2028Joel Cerda\u00a0\nQ: If you had to choose, The Cayenne or the Panamera?\n\nA: I wouldn't drive a Cayenne if you paid me, I'm not an SUV guy. I love the Panamera, it's a Learjet on wheels to me.\n\nBrad Brown\u00a0\nQ: Hey Michael, have had my head down in the trenches so to speak for the last 2 years. Finally feel like we've managed to get some traction. Our podcast numbers are growing nicely and we have a few products that are selling really well. The last 3 months has seen us make more money on the side than from my full time job. When should I consider going full time into my business?\n\nA: If you can bring in equal to or more money than your job over the course of 3 months, it's time to go. Explain to your boss what you've built and ask for what you want next. If you want out, give your notice and train the next person before you go. If you don't like it, clock out.\n\nCallum Rankine\u00a0\nQ: Could you give another plug please for a UK Mastermind group Michael? We need more people to make it happen. Thanking you!\n\nA: We've talked about coming out to London and doing a one-day show. I'm talking with John Lee Dumas, and other folks and will tell you how we end up.

Those who make it the top and stay there, from those who simply dream of achievement?\nJoining us to answer those questions is Dr. Jeff Spencer, a man who has coached thousands to greatness.\nToday he shares the 8 steps every prolific performer goes through to become and stay great and what he learned from being Lance Armstrong's chiropractor during 7 Tour de France appearances.\nGet ready for all of that and more on episode 236 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This Show\nAt an early age Dr. Jeff Spencer knew he wanted to compete in the Olympics and showed a natural inclination for sprint\u00a0cycling. With the help and support from members of a local cycling club he worked his way up from the junior level to the senior level and then to a spot on the 1972 Olympic team.\nIf you're too young to have seen those Games or you don't recall their significance, there was a terrorist kidnapping and later the murder of eleven Israeli Olympians by a Palestinian group called Black September. Dr. Jeff was there and he shares what that event meant to him personally, and the impact it made on his heart, and\u00a0his life.\nThat tragedy showed him how frail life is and put life into a different perspective for him. It showed him what really matters in life, and what doesn't. It isn't an understatement to say it irrevocably shifted his view of all things from that day forward.\n\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhat did Charlie Chaplin's film Modern Times\u00a0teach him?\n\tThere are two parts to human nature: what are they?\n\tWhy trying hard and thinking good thoughts doesn't create a champion.\n\tCan heart be learned?\n\tWhy and how fear is your friend.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nAfter that experience in Munich Dr. Jeff went on to train and coach thousands of achievers to reaching their full potential for greatness. He even spent 9 years with the Tour de France, during 7 of which he was Lance Armstrong's chiropractor for the grueling cycling competition.\nHe was also named International Sports Chiropractor of the Year and has had his personal art exhibited in New York galleries. In other words, he practices what he preaches: achieving and extending greatness in any area of life.\nToday he and I talk about several other subjects but\u00a0we'll focus on his 8 steps to reaching greatness and staying there.\n1. Legacy\nCreate a legacy at the start of your journey so you can judge your decisions against it. If you don't like where you're going you can change it to fall in line with your legacy. Legacy also gives you an integrity check: is what you're doing going to create or advance your legacy? If so, then do it. If not, rethink your choice.\n\n2. Vision\nVision is\u00a0not a goal. Vision is what life looks like when we've achieved our goal. What credibility does our vision give us? Does it call others to a higher game as well? How do others see us as a result of having achieved our vision? Vision is what gives us a reason to get up in the morning. Feel your vision, that gives you an emotive force like nothing else can.\n\n3. Mindset\nDo you have the mindset and courage and conviction to do all the steps to get to where you want to go? This is where you figure that out and fortify yourself with whatever you don't have, or scrap your plan all together.\n\n4. Inventory\nTake inventory. Do you have the personal skill, mentality and knowledge to make this happen? Get that first before you start. Do you have the confidence to get started? Yes? Then push forward.\n\n5. The Climb\nThis Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours. The climb is where you put skin in the game: you start a new business and you develop perseverance. Your challenge and purpose with the climb is to have a breakout performance like you've never had before.\n\n6. Elevation\nElevation is where you need to own the technical process of your discipline.

Their ability to decide. That's according to our returning co-host, Jim Palmer.\nJim knows a few things about success. During his visit to The Solopreneur Hour he shared how pulled himself out of some deep trenches of debt, illness and unemployment to create a six-figure a year business writing snail mail newsletters.\nOn today's show we discuss his latest book, Decide: The Ultimate Success Trigger, how he structures his time and how he stays innovative. All of that and more and episode 235 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This Show\nIf you missed Jim's previous appearance on the show you can dig all the way back to episode 22, or you can just click here to listen. You'll hear in great detail about Jim's journey from unemployment and recovering from cancer to building an empire with newsletters (the actual physical kind you get in the mail - yes people still do send them).\nSince we've covered his background during his first chat, today we dive into juicy bits on what makes some solopreneurs successful but not others. Jim says the defining difference is their ability to decide, hence he chose that word as the title of his latest book. Successful business builders have and cultivate the ability to see opportunities, assess whether or not they are viable and solid for their business and then they go for it. They don't take a lot of time to make up their minds, and when they decide they go after it.\nSome of the greatest pain points he has witnessed over the last year as a coach for other entrepreneurs are people not being willing to pull the trigger (another way of saying they don't want to decide) and not being willing to invest in the future they want to have. He says if you're playing it safe and feel comfortable with your choices, you need to get uncomfortable because that's where the growth is.\n\nIn This Episode, You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tHow has he written six books in six years?\n\tWhat's \"squishyville\" and why do you want to avoid it?\n\tWhat mindset does he create when writing his books?\n\tWhy do we avoid advice that we know will make us more successful?\n\tWhat is the biggest crippler of businesses in Jim's opinion?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nJim candidly shares how he was in that same position just a few years ago. He admits to wanting the success of his counterparts, but he wasn't willing to do the uncomfortable things to get there like hiring a coach, hosting live events, and speaking in public, etc. Today he also tells us what he did to get past those fears, and how you can too.\nAnother great lesson he gives us is straight from his book, Decide: The Ultimate Success Trigger. In Chapter 1, which is called Decide to Take Out The Trash, Jim explains why we need to empty out the trash in our minds. We all have programming we've absorbed throughout the years, and that head trash is what holds our fears, our apprehensions and our anxieties.\nWe've got to get that stuff out of our minds to truly be successful. After we do that, we have to\u00a0refill our minds with the positive (like affirmations and actions that move us closer to our goals). Just like we need to empty our garbage in our homes, we also need to empty the garbage in our minds.\nAlthough we talk about many others topics (like Jim's daily and yearly schedule), one last bit we'll cover here is how Jim stays innovative. He is a voracious reader, everything from books to articles to emails from other successful people. One of the best and fastest ways to learn is to ask\u00a0someone who's done it before how they did it, and then follow in their footsteps.

All of that and more on the 233rd edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nAs of the airing of this episode Jack Canfield's Chicken Soup For The Soul series has been printed in 47 different languages and is on its way to selling a billion copies! After\u00a0CSFTS became a global phenomenon, he\u00a0asked himself if people wanted to be successful, what would be the one book they would read?\nFrom asking that question he set the foundation for The Success Principles. Today that book is celebrating its 10th anniversary and has been updated to include three new chapters reflecting our digital era. The book lays out 67 principles to follow to create success in your life, and it lays them out in order.\nThe book also includes real-life stories from people who read the first printing of the book, acted on the principles and created success. These are stories from all walks of life: homeless men and women to people who had just lost their jobs and had sold their\u00a0belongings to get by. People who were not successful in an area (or many areas) of their lives, but created success through implementing the contents of Jack's book.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tWhat's always been his biggest challenge?\n\tHow many books does he read per week?\n\tWhat's one of the weirdest experiences he's had while speaking?\n\tWhat is\u00a0the rule of 5?\n\tWhat does E + O = R mean?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJack shares these stories in greater detail on the show, and we also talk about why we have such a hard time getting out of our own way.\u00a0And he has an answer for us: because no one has ever taught us otherwise. We've all grown up with limiting beliefs that have been given to us by the world around us (from parents to clergy to school teachers), but no one has told us how to release those beliefs.\nBy nature we are creatures of habit so until we unlearn those limiting beliefs and create new habits, we'll continue to get in our own way. But there is a solution: simply create a new habit and cement it faster by pairing it with an existing habit.\nIf you are committed to doing your age in push-ups every morning, then pair the new push-up habit with brushing your teeth. Every time you brush your teeth, do your age in push-ups after. And you'll want to give yourself a solid 66 days to make that new habit a lasting one, Jack says the latest research out of London has found we need 66 days (not 30).\nAnother way to create success in your life is to take 100% responsibility. Jack says the happiest, most successful people he knows take full responsibility for everything in their lives.\nAnd by doing so when something goes wrong you can ask yourself what you did to contribute to the result you got. When you examine a result from that perspective you aren't defensive. When you're not defensive you can take steps to learn from the experience and apply it to the next situation, and grow in the process,\nWe talk about SO much more on this show, like why a no is a good thing and his legendary joke-telling, but one final piece to leave you with is the number one thing all successful readers of his book\u00a0have in common: they all want success and believe it's possible. Jack has seen this in everyone who has read his book, applied the principles and taken action. They all wanted something and they went for it.\nBe sure to download the show to hear the full details on those topics, including Jack telling a joke!\u00a0Let's give\u00a0an extra special thanks to him for his jokes, his time and his wisdom.", "duration": "56:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/233.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Jack Canfield", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Author", "Chicken Soup for the Soul", "Inspiration", "Success Principles"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1424635441, "title": "232: Buy Low, and Sell High, with Jock Purtle", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Serially-successful solopreneurs are great at one thing in particular: spotting a need in the marketplace and filling it. That is certainly true of our guest for today's show, Jock Purtle.\n\nJock is the owner of Digital Exits and has been an entrepreneur/solopreneur most of his life.\n\nHe stopped by Studio 86 for a chat on the\u00a0success he's created at the ripe old\u00a0of 25 (!), what he thinks has fueled that success and what's next for him. All of that and more on episode 232 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nJock Purtle is originally from Sydney, Australia who currently lives\u00a0in Austin, Texas. Growing up he spent a lot of time working in his family's various companies. He was 9 when he began helping his parents with their auction business and he caught on to the concept of buy low and sell high from that experience.\nBeing a solopreneur at heart, he didn't just work for his parents. He created any number of side hustles for himself at boarding school; he bought bags of candy and resold them to the kids who missed dinner and sold the candies at a markup to make a profit, he bought garden plants at a low price and resold them. He took the idea of\u00a0flipping to heart and applied it to everything he did.\nWhen he was 18 he started a personal training business and then moved into the world of\u00a0SEO, Wordpress and the like for small businesses.\u00a0Using what he calls knowledge arbitrage he found the advancements that were working in the US and brought them elsewhere.\u00a0With that foresight he was soon rockin' the world of SEO.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tWhat is knowledge arbitrage and why is it relevant?\n\tIs entrepreneurship a muscle you can build?\n\tWhen do opportunities appear?\n\tWhat is luck a combination of?\n\tIs there a litmus test for when a certain topic will plateau?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\nOn today's in-studio episode with Jock we talk about SEO and whether it's still relevant, what Digital Exits does and what's next for the company.\nFor those of you who may not know SEO stands for search engine optimization and it's a term that refers to how to make your online content land higher in Google's search engines.\u00a0Jock says SEO does still work and is relevant, but the competition may be more fierce today especially in certain categories. He generously walks us through a real-life example with The Solopreneur Hour. Be sure to take notes and apply it to your business!\nWe also discuss one of his current companies, Digital Exits. Digital Exits sells online businesses to prospective buyers.\u00a0Jock says they are like realtors for online businesses. They never acquire the company, they simply assess what it is worth and then sell it to any of their prospective buyers. After the sale is complete, they take a fee for their efforts. Digital Exits has an existing buyers' network they tap into; their biggest deal to date has been in the million dollar range.\nWhen you look at Digital Exits from a 10,000 foot view it's easy to see how\u00a0his \"buy low, sell high\" method from childhood applies to what he does today!\nAnd that big picture\u00a0view is one of his greatest assets as a leader and a businessman. Even at the young age of 25 he is able to see 10 steps ahead of what's happening right now and anticipate future opportunities. With that visionary view he is moving to Los Angeles soon to expand Digital Exits and\u00a0carve out new territories in SoCal.\nJock also gives all of the listeners his thoughts on their solopreneurial and entrepreneurial projects. His experiences have shown him that whatever you are doing you can expect to work at it for a good year before you see any real progress; there is often a slow evolution before you see any measure of success.\nWe also discuss how to know when a market is tapped out, how to infiltrate a saturated market and create a presence for yourself...and much more.

But how do we turn those hobbies into healthy, profitable businesses?\u00a0A man who has done just that is here to share his story and his secrets on today's edition\u00a0of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nNick Gray, founder of Museum Hack, is on the show to talk about his entrepreneurial background and where the idea for his latest creation came from. All of that and more on the 230th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nNick Gray inherited his father's \"entrepreneur\" gene and has always been a hustler. He used to hustle baseball cards as a kid and spent father-son bonding time selling BluBlockers at the state fair. His first business was a web design company that became a web hosting company. It morphed into a hosting company because his clients all needed a host. He saw the opportunity and seized it, and it paid his way through college.\nBecause he moved around a lot as a child, Nick didn't have a lot of close friends and became very interested in computers. He even chose his college based on the fact that they gave laptops to all their students. This was in the year 2000, when not every college was handing them out.\nBeing his usual solopreneurial self, Nick noticed the college-issued laptops didn't have great speakers and yet all the students really needed them. He bought a bulk order from China and resold them to the incoming freshmen the next year for a tidy profit. He attributes his ability to see opportunities as simply being someone who understands where there's a need and also someone who takes the initiative to fill that need.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tWhere did Nick's entrepreneurial fire come from?\n\tWhat type of restaurant was their family business?\n\tHis parents served in the Armed Forces - what branch?\n\tWhat was his favorite part of living in India?\n\tHow has he dealt with expanding and growing his business?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter graduation, Nick had another entrepreneurial inspiration: he was going to run a software development company based out of India. He thought he could find solid, reliable and talented developers there for a fraction of what he'd pay elsewhere. He pursued that vision for a few months until it became clear the landscape of India wasn't ready for start-ups. Though it didn't pan out for his business, he loved the cultural experience of living there.\nHe moved\u00a0back home to help his parents and to give his dad support while he developed another business in the private aviation world. But one day a young woman took him on a romantic date at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, otherwise known as The Met.\nNick had never liked museums or art before that tour, but after he was smitten. He went back every weekend for the next year! He learned everything he could about the museum and its pieces and their history. He poured over article on Wikipedia, did as many audio and guided tours as he could and immersed himself in all things The Met. With that knowledge he started giving his friends free, guided tours.\nAnd when a blog wrote about his tours it was the start of a new chapter in his life. He received a thousand emails asking him to give personal, guided tours! With the help of his executive coach, Nick realized he loved being at museums and would spend his free time at the best museums in the world if he could. He then realized he was on to something and from there Museum Hack was born.\nOn today's show Nick shares with us the mistakes and stumbles he made while taking Museum Hack from a fun hobby to a profitable enterprise. He talks about being terrified of charging for something that he once gave away for free, how his friends helped him along the way and the importance of feedback as he grew and continues to grow the business.\nHe is\u00a0also is giving any listener who emails him a friends and family discount - listen in for the details on how to get yours!", "duration": "1:04:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/230.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Nick Gray", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Museum Hack", "NIck Gray"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1423872192, "title": "229: Spartan Race Founder Joe De Sena", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Solopreneurs are naturally competitive, we have to be. We also have to be mentally tough to endure the ever-changing landscape of running a successful business.\u00a0One terrific way to sharpen our mental endurance is through physical activity.\n\nNo one knows this better than our guest for today's show, Joe De Sena. Joe is the founder and visionary of Spartan Race. His company was doing it before anyone else and he shares with us where the idea came from, what is background is in the fitness world and how he stays ahead of the pack\u00a0on the 229th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nJoe De Sena grew up a hustler thanks to his entrepreneurial father and his neighborhood. His dad had great success when Joe was a kid, and he also lost it all. Joe had gotten a taste of what it's like to have it all so when his family lost it, he worked his tail off to get it back. For over a decade he worked 20 hours a day running a pool servicing business.\nHis clients were numerous, around 750, but they weren't your average neighbors. Joe grew up in the organized crime capitol of the world. The\u00a0kids in Joe's neck of the woods cheered for armored car thieves and bank robbers - not sports teams. They didn't know any better, it's just how their neighborhood was.\nThe upside to his neighborhood was the hustler environment: everyone was a hustler, whatever their industry.\u00a0Joe used those skills and eventually went to work on Wall Street. Soon he found himself with a strong need to relieve stress and get fit again. So he decided to run an ultra marathon! He wanted to test his physical body as well as his mental capacity. That was just the beginning of his journey to creating Spartan Race.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tIs there a correlation between succeeding in athletics and succeeding in life?\n\tWhat did he learn from quitting a race?\n\tHow does he know if he's got a good idea?\n\tHis kids have run the New York and the Boston marathons: true or false?\n\tWhat's the cookie/marshmallow test and how does it apply to solopreneurs?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn today's episode we talk about where the idea for the Spartan Race came from and how Joe evolved it into a business as well as a podcast. We also chat about how he's raising his children and creating a strong mental mindset for all four of them, whatever they choose to do with their lives.\nThe Spartan Race is something Joe had been doing for 15 years before he ever created the official version of the race. It was brand when he brought it to the marketplace. Today it's been cloned by countless others but Joe believes his company has been the most successful because they have a mission and a why that fuels everything they do. And it certainly is working: this year alone they will have 1 million participants in their races\u00a0everywhere!\nAnd the Spartan Up podcast is also popular. It's an idea Joe had when he was promoting the Spartan Up book. He did multiple interviews on various podcasts to spread the word about his book and his company. Soon people were telling him they loved hearing him on those shows and a light bulb went off for Joe! He knew they had to do their own podcast.\nHe knew nothing about podcasts but he knew they had to go for it so, in true Joe fashion, they went full force. They recorded on location over the course of three months. And they did 150 episodes in those three months! No half measures for Joe and his crew, it was full speed ahead.\nAnd that's just one of the many lessons you'll hear on his episode today. Be sure to tune in and grab 'em all - including instructions on how to be entered to win a spot on a cruise with Joe in the Bahamas in March!

But even if money isn't what gets your blood pumping, it is still a necessity and still\u00a0plays a significant role in your life.\n\nHere to talk with us about how best to manage your finances as a solopreneur and how to live rich even when you're not is the one and only Farnoosh Torabi.\n\nFarnoosh is an exceptionally talented financial diva, author and podcaster. Join us as we dive into her background and her strategies for financial success on episode 227 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nFarnoosh Torabi has brought together two of her passions: journalism and finances. Growing up the daughter of Iranian parents in the blue collar township of Worcester, MA\u00a0she wasn't born into money and privilege. But her parents both educated her on various aspects of money and never underestimated her ability to understand financial concepts.\nWhile in college she entered the finance program and pursued a major in Finance. But because she had long been interested in journalism and broadcasting, she looked for ways to expand her knowledge in that area as well. After completing her finance degree she applied to graduate school for journalism and was accepted at Columbia.\nFrom there she earned a Masters degree and went on to work for Money magazine, later expanding into the digital world. But living in New York was expensive and she knew she needed extra income sources. So she wrote two columns for a daily paper and later turned those columns into her first book, You're So Money - How to Live Rich Even When You're Not.\nAnd so began her brand, You're So Money. Today she has a podcast by that same name, she's written several more books, is a contributor for Money magazine,\u00a0The Today Show and\u00a0Yahoo, among many others.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tHow\u00a0did she\u00a0get her first book published?\n\tHave incomes been stagnant for a decade?\n\tHow to expand your income in today's marketplace.\n\tIs it easier to make more money or save more money?\n\tWhy did she decide to go into podcasting?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\nOn today's show Farnoosh shares with us some specific strategies for managing our money, wherever we're at. If you're not yet a full-time solopreneur but you're wanting to make the leap, she recommends having 3-6 months of income saved. And by income she means your necessities like rent or mortgage, food, and insurance...whatever it takes to keep you warm, clothed, fed and housed!\nShe also gives us suggestions on how much she believes is prudent to spend on rent and car payments. Housing shouldn't be more than 30% of your net income. So if you make $10k a month spending $3k a month on rent is on target. And if you're in the market for a car and are getting a car payment it should only be 15% of your take-home pay.\nWhen you're looking to invest, Farnoosh also has guidelines for saving and investing. Of the wealthiest people she's spoken to on this subject, they are investing 20% into their savings. The usual recommendation is 10% but she says once you're earning $5k a month start putting $1k into savings. For your retirement open up a SEP IRA which is like a 401(k) for self-employed people. Whatever you put away is tax-deductible and it stays invested until you're ready to retire.\nIn terms of choosing where to invest your SEP she recommends index funds that are not actively managed. You want to spend as little as possible on management fees so you'll be looking for an index fund that is not actively managed. Any broker can help you set this up.\nFarnoosh and I also talk about debt management resources (the reliable ones), and why she opted to start her own podcast on finances. She's a goldmine of solopreneurial financial wisdom, be sure to dig out all her nuggets on this episode.\nBig thanks to Farnoosh for being here and thanks to all of you for listening in!\u00a0See you next time on The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nResources Mentioned on Today's Show", "duration": "1:14:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/227.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Farnoosh Torabi", "Finance & Money", "Great Books", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Woman", "Finance", "Money", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1423464265, "title": "226: Upleveling Your Solopreneur Game, with Mike Johnston", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "If you're a regular listener of The Solopreneur Hour\u00a0you'll recognize our guest for today, Mike Johnston. Mike has visited us as a co-host on several other occasions and he always brings the knowledge! He is the consummate solopreneur\u00a0who has hustled his way from a one on one drumming instructor to an internationally in-demand business owner and giant of the drumming world.\n\nOn this episode we chat about that evolution and the speaker/entrepreneurial world he is stepping into today.\u00a0All of that and more on the 226th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nWhen most of us think of drumming instructors a few images come to mind, most likely none of which are role models for a successful solopreneur career. But Mike Johnston has defied that stereotype from the very beginning of his instructional career days. On his previous visits to the show we dive into exactly how and why he did so, you can find those episodes here if you missed them.\nOn today's show we devote our time to talking about where he's at today and where he's going in the near future. He recently spoke at an entrepreneurial conference on the subject of making a profitable business from teaching people how to play the drums.\nIt was one of the first times he had been asked to speak, not on the subject of drumming itself, but on how he went from being a one on one instructor to scaling his business into a monthly six-figure income stream.\u00a0Mike shares with us what it was like to give that speech, including some snafus along the way and a lesson on the importance of over-delivering.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tBe a do-ist: what does that mean?\n\tWhat's the michael jordan principle and how does it apply to you?\n\tTrue or false: he thought powerpoint was a professional speech?\n\tWhat's the #1 sampled drum lick in the world and how does it relate to Mike's app?\n\tHow does he\u00a0handle haters today versus in the past?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also chat about his clinic in Ireland and garner some valuable branding insights from him. One of the nuggets he drops is on brand strength. According to\u00a0Mike, your brand's strength\u00a0can't increase if you aren't willing to do new things and that's the approach he takes with his business day in and day out.\u00a0He also goes on to explain why he chose to partner with other instructors, rather than brand the clinic as his own and how that relates to overall brand image and experience.\nThere are loads of other subjects we touch on in this episode but one in particular stands out: what he learned from creating his app, Groove Freedom. For years Mike has rejected app ideas from developers because they didn't fit with his business model and with the experience he wanted to give his audience (again a branding lesson).\nBut after he wrote Groove Freedom, he saw an opportunity for an app based on the book. The book is based on teaching people to play drums but to have freedom in the grooves they're playing.\nVery often a drummer will be asked to play a particular groove that sounds just like a groove from another song, but the band won't want it to be that exact groove but something that sounds like it.\u00a0So the drummer has to learn how to have freedom within that groove - not an easy thing to do.\u00a0His book is based on his experiences and lessons he's learned on how to do that, how to find freedom in the groove.\nBut Mike, being the solopreneur he is, thought an app would be a handy accompaniment to the book. It seemed far easier to take a chapter and turn it into a portable app. So he set out on quest to do so and eventually came up with the Groove Freedom app which led to the Groove Freedom community.\nMike and I share the down and dirty details on ALL of this, and so much on today's show. Be sure to check it out and then pat yourselves on the back for being here. I appreciate each and every one of you for listening, thank you.

Our returning co-host, Anna Vocino, fills us in on what it's like to navigate the ups and downs of this world.\n\nToday Anna and I discuss what it's like to face failure over and over til you succeed, what it was like in her first pitch session (and what that is) and how all of those experiences relate to being a solopreneur. All of that and more on the 224th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nI was delighted to have Anna back on the show, she's always a terrific guest! No matter what we talk about there are always parallels to be drawn to the solopreneur's journey. As someone who has made a living as a voiceover artist, actress and writer, Anna knows what it's like to be in the trenches creating her own career like solopreneurs do.\nIf you've missed any of her previous visits to the show and want more of her backstory, you can find those shows here.\nOn today's show Anna tells us what it was like to be involved in her first ever pitch session. In the movie and acting world, when someone (or multiple someones) have an idea for a new show or movie, they eventually have to pitch it to a network to get it made (or opt to fund it themselves).\nEven though Anna's worked in the biz for well over a decade, she hadn't been in a pitch session before. But when her husband's first pilot presentation was shot and she was part of the creative team, she went in for her first-ever pitch session. She has done countless auditions (literally thousands) so it was a similar vibe in that you always have to be prepared for a no but be focused on getting a yes.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tHow did a joke land her on Spike TV?\n\tWhy relationships and connections are so important.\n\tYou're not in the convincing business: when to cut your losses and move on.\n\tAn insider tip on how to make the most of Evernote.\n\tWhat is packaging in Hollywood?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\nAnd that's one of the key similarities between Hollywood and solopreneurship: you can't let a no stop you. If you let a few no's get you down and you don't get back up, you'll never make it. You have to stay positive and believe in yourself, despite whatever exterior circumstances might be telling you.\nAnother similarity is that you must always hustle and stay relevant. Even though the most famous people in Hollywood are hustling every day. It's a grind; keep working at it and staying current with the trends.\nTo stay relevant, you must always be improving.\u00a0If you're always improving and honing your craft by getting feedback from the best and brightest, you'll naturally stay on top of your game. Remember when you start out you won't be great, and that's ok. Do the best you can, improve and refine what you're putting out the world and you can only get better.\nAs long as you stick with it, which is another key to success in Hollywood and solopreneurship. You have to be consistent. That alone is enough to set you apart from the crowd. Not many people are willing to do something day in and day out until they reach success. Whether you're an actor or a comedian or an online marketer, or any other solopreneur, you must consistently improve and build upon your success.\nAnna and I dive into all of those subjects and more on today's show.

We have to adapt to new technology, new trends, our environment and what our audiences want from us.\u00a0This is a special solo episode: it's just you and me going deep into this subject.\n\nWhether you're still planning your escape from the 9 to 5 or you're already running a successful business, you'll want to hear why adaptation is so important. Listen in for that and more on episode 223 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nAs solopreneurs one of our goals is to have location freedom. To that end I'm fully recording and publishing this episode remotely from San Francisco! I share with you the gear I'm using and how it all works together to make this possible. It's something I've been working on for awhile and I'm excited to give you all the details.\n\nOne of the things I'm committed to doing this year is to spend a month out of the country. Adaptation is key to that. I want to be as portable as possible and as adaptable as possible. I had to put in a lot of time and energy to make this happen, but it was all possible because I was willing and open to adapting.\n\nSo think about that for your life: what skills do you have that you can adapt to the trends around you? It doesn't relate to just travel or podcasting, it relates to every aspect of your life. Instead of letting obligations get in the way - like family, money, vacation, etc - simply adapt as needed. Adaptation is the heart and soul of what we do as solopreneurs. I walk you through a real life example of how I did this with my Social Media Ninja Tactics.\n\nContinuing with the podcasting theme, I came up to Apple headquarters this past week and get to know what they've got going on.\u00a0The meeting didn't have an agenda, it was about establishing relationships. Podcasting is what I do for a living so I knew I had to get to know the people pulling the strings. If you're in blogging, know the Wordpress folks! Same goes for LeadPages, OptimizePress. They appreciate everyone who provides eyeballs for them and you do that, no matter what kind of money you're generating in the process. It's about connecting: you with them and them with you.\n\nAnd while you're developing those relationships in your industry of choice, remember you're going to fail along the way. Whatever you are doing in the world and wherever you're at on your timeline, keep at it. The people you look up to and admire the most are the ones who have failed the most.

And with today's technology it's simpler, faster and easier than ever. But there are tricks to it, trade secrets known by the best and brightest of the bestselling book world.\n\nAnd one of those best and brightest is with us for today's show. Returning co-host Chandler Bolt joins us to chat about how he became a bestseller using Kindle on Amazon, and he answers your questions. All of that and more on the 222nd episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nIf you missed Chandler Bolt's first visit to the show have a listen to it here. We dive into his background and how he got into the wide world of book-selling on Amazon's Kindle.\nOn today's show we talk about his move and my move to San Diego and what solopreneurial lessons you can learn from that. We also discuss the lessons he learned while helping others follow in his Kindle footsteps, his 3-step strategy that he and his brother used to write their first book in a week as well as your questions on becoming a bestseller.\nThe biggest lesson he learned while coaching others to use Kindle the way he did were these three: sell it, validate it and then create it. You read that correctly, those words aren't written backwards! Sell first, validate it next and then create it.\nFirst you sell your concept/idea/project, then you validate it by getting feedback and opinions from your audience to find out exactly what they want from you and then you create the actual product. It sounds counter to the way most of us would create and sell anything, but that's the foolproof system for creating a rockstar book (or any other product).\nThe reason it's foolproof is simple: before you invest time, money and other forms of energy into your project, you make sure there's an audience that wants it and is willing to pay for it. Once you've got that lined up, you find out exactly what they want and then give it to them. It's a far simpler and easier way to create a winning product, service or launch of any kind.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tHow do you comfortably pre-sell anything? Chandler explains.\n\tShould you write from experience or write for a particular niche?\n\tWhy kindle readers don't actually care about how sexy your design is.\n\tIndependent publishers vs amazon: what are his thoughts?\n\tWhy negative reviews are a good thing, and how to handle to them.\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also discuss how he and his brother wrote a book (a bestselling one!) in just a week. They used a three step process, this is what it looks like:\n1. Write out a mindmap. Get out a blank piece of paper and write your idea in the middle of it. Then take the next 15-30 minutes and write down every single\u00a0story and experience you have about this topic. Each of these should branch off from your idea to create a tree.\n2. Now make an outline, put each branch you created into groups and then break those groups down into chapters. You have the starting point for your book! Which leads to step 3...\n3. Get to writing. The easiest and fastest way to write? Take that outline's first chapter and repeat these steps for it. Then do the same for chapter two, chapter three, and so on until you are done. You can also record yourself speaking each of your chapters and have them transcribed, if you're not much of a writer.\nChandler was also gracious enough to answer your personal questions from the Proudly Unemployable Facebook group (which you can join here). He shares his thoughts on how to run a successful promotion for your book launch, whether or not to use independent publishers like Smashmouth or stick with the big boy Amazon and\nWe dive headlong into the answers to those and plenty of other questions, plus he guides us through creating the infrastructure of a Kindle book (what to do and what NOT to do) and so much more on this show.", "duration": "1:09:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/222.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Chandler Bolt", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Amazon", "Bestseller", "Kindle", "self-publishing"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1422427402, "title": "221: Louis CK and Entrepreneurship, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to today's edition of The Solopreneur Hour!

Here to share the neuroscience secrets to doing so is Ryan Levesque.\n\nRyan is a former\u00a0neuroscience instructor at Brown University, and has used his innate knowledge of psychology not only to help us improve our memory (which I desperately need), but also to help us dial in our sales funnels.\n\nHe has also graciously offered 100 listeners a FREE book.\u00a0Click here\u00a0to get yours, use the referral code: SOLOHOUR2015.\n\nAnd then enjoy episode 220 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nHailing from\u00a0the blue collar town Goffstown NH, Ryan Levesque was both a smart aleck and a smart kid. He got into heaps of trouble but always excelled at school. He was the valedictorian of his class and went on to Brown University, the first of his family to go on to college and earn a degree from an Ivy League university.\n\nAt Brown he studied Chinese and neuroscience. He was fascinated with the brain, how it worked and the effects Chinese medicine had on the mind. After graduation he opted to go to China and work, rather than pursue medical school. He didn't have the \"mental chops\" for it and instead became a corporate executive in China working in the Asian financial markets.\n\nIt didn't take longer than a few years for Ryan to realize this path wasn't it either. So one day he wrote a letter, addressed to his mom but it was really written to himself, detailing what he felt and why. He concluded he had to leave his job while he still had a spark within to do so. And that's what he did.\n\nHe moved to Hong Kong where his wife was earning her PhD and moved into a tiny apartment with her. He sold all of his belongings, except for whatever would fit into two suitcases. He bought a laptop for $450 and was on his way.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tDo we really only use 20% of our brain?\n\tWhat can Breaking Bad teach you about marketing?\n\tWhat's the vodka Red Bull neurococktail and why do you want to use it?\n\tWhy asking the right questions is so important.\n\tWhat his medical scare a few years ago taught him about life and business.\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\nBefore he had quit his job, Ryan had been studying online marketing so he dove fully into that world. He tried a few different angles and opportunities but nothing clicked. Not until he found Dr. Glenn Livingston that is.\n\nDr. Glenn had a system that he had applied and successfully used with Fortune 100 companies to grow their bottom line. It was a system that was much different than what others were teaching and Ryan took to it quickly, and soon found success using it as well.\n\nThat system is detailed in Ryan's book Ask and he gives us a preview of it on this show. One specific example he provides is something called micro-commitments. Micro-commitments are a tool you use to build a rapport and make your audience feel safe giving you information. It offers an alternative to the usual route of\u00a0asking for their contact information immediately, which Ryan says is akin to meeting someone in person and, after they ask you for advice, holding a gun to their head in exchange for your knowledge.\n\nRather than the gun-to-their-head approach so many solopreneurs and entrepreneurs take in their online presence, micro-commitments means you ask your audience a series of easy-to-answer, multiple choice questions. All the while letting them know their answers are helping you better direct them to their solution. This builds up momentum in terms of their action-taking abilities and also shows them you are there to solve their problems and offer solutions for their pain points.\n\nOn today's show Ryan goes on to explain how to use another type of question to get to those pain points. He says by asking deep, open-ended questions you can understand your audience better than they understand their own needs. And when you do that they will see you as the person who can help them,", "duration": "1:02:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/220.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Ryan Levesque", "Social Media", "Email Marketing", "Sales Funnel"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1421975938, "title": "219: How to Crush Webinars with Omar Zenhom", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As solopreneurs we have to take the lessons we learn from every experience, whether a success or not, and apply them to our next venture. Our guest for today, returning co-host Omar Zenhom, did just that when creating his latest podcast, The $100 MBA Show, and a soon-to-be-launched webinar platform called Webinar Ninja.\n\nTune in to hear what Omar learned from the failure of his first podcast, how that led to success with The $100 MBA Show, and where he got the inspiration from for Webinar Ninja.\u00a0All of that and more on the 219th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nOmar's first visit to the show fills you in on his background and you can find it here. In fact, that episode aired around the time he launched his second podcast, The $100 MBA Show. He and his fiance Nicole had already built The $100 MBA and had established it as a brand that offered all the knowledge you get while earning your MBA for a hundred bucks (instead of hundreds of thousands for an MBA).\nTheir first foray into podcasting was a show called People Who Know Their S**t. They both love podcasts and saw the boom in the industry and wanted to contribute. But the show's format wasn't conducive to their strengths. Neither Omar nor Nicole enjoyed interviewing so when they created PWKTS as an interview-styled show it didn't work well.\nBeing the smart solopreneurs they are they reassessed and saw a new opportunity with their current brand, The $100 MBA. Instead of trying to be something they weren't, they opted to make this second podcast a show that taught a specific aspect of business in around 10 minutes. No interviews, just pure content that Omar presents and Nicole edits and produces.\nAnd it worked. The show was named one of iTunes Best in 2014 and today it's going strong, they're on the 174th episode as of this recording. And importantly: they're relying on their strengths to provide value and they love what they are doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn today's episode Omar and I discuss how his perspective on failure and his approach to it helped them make the transition from the first podcast to the second, more successful one.\nOne specific aspect you'll want to listen in to hear is how they launched the second show. Omar made sure they had coverage in a variety of mediums all aimed at their target audience.\nHe planned well in advance and had blog posts in several major publications, all of which posted his content the day of the launch. He was also on many podcasts giving away his insights and knowledge in the weeks leading up to and during their podcast's launch. The planning was timed, effective and thoughtful and gives a great example of how you can do the same for your next product.\nWe also discuss something he's very excited about in 2015: Webinar Ninja. Webinar Ninja is their webinar solution\u00a0they've created over the last 14 months. Omar and Nicole began learning about the world of webinars and saw a tremendous need in the marketplace.\nThough webinars are very popular, not everyone has success using them.\u00a0Some people have tremendous success, and others do not. They put out a few products they thought would address the market's pain points\u00a0but they saw an even greater need. With a lot of research and interviews under his belt, Omar found out many people are intimidated by webinar technology, some people are put off by the cost of it and often those who do use the technology as a sales platform don't get the results they were hoping for.\nThey created Webinar Ninja to address all of this and more. It is intuitive and user-friendly; it helps people prepare for their webinars as though they were giving a live speech in public, Omar says that's what webinars are: speeches. He also gives us specific ways to prepare for webinars, whether or not we're using Webinar Ninja.\nYou'll have to listen in to hear all the details, tips and tools he gives on this episode.

Listen in as we discuss all of that and more on episode 218 of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nJohn was grew up\u00a0in the DC area, but wasn't born into a family of connections or influencers. Nor did he attend an Ivy League school where he could network with other well-leveraged people. So how did he land a position as a White House aide at the age of 23? How did he get an internship at DreamWorks, or a gig as a speechwriter for the governor of California? And how has he built two successful businesses: his Silicon Valley law practice and his Smart Business Revolution blog and podcast?\n\nOne word: relationships. Over the years he's uncovered how to connect, engage and build relationships with people. He's learned how to build trust and grow the relationship, before asking for a sale, or anything else.\n\nToday we talk about many topics including what Bill Clinton can teach us as solopreneurs (all politics aside), the critical role copywriting plays in any online business and how he sets goals and achieves them.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tWhere is the birthplace of mountain biking?\n\tHow did he meet Aaron Sorkin?\n\tThe Thanksgiving Proclamation Joh \u00a0wrote as a White House aide was the source of an episode of The West Wing: true or false?\n\tHow he accomplishes his goals on a weekly basis, John explains.\n\tWhere did the concept of a mastermind group come from?\n\tAnd so, so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhatever your political leanings, Bill Clinton has long been known and will continue to be known for his ability to connect with people in a meaningful way. John says he experienced this many times while in the White House during the former President's term. President Clinton did this by being present with the person he was talking to, noticing something personal about them and making that connection. He got to know them on a personal level, on an even playing field so to speak.\n\nAnd that's a lesson we can all implement in our lives: the next time you're chatting with someone, put your phone down and actually engage with them fully. Don't look around the room for who else is there, but make eye contact and find something about them that is personal and matters to them. You could notice something they are wearing, or a book they're carrying or you can simply ask them what they are most excited about right now in their lives.\n\nJohn says when you do those things you're connecting and starting to build rapport, you're beginning a relationship with them. And\u00a0what you do next is critical: continue to grow trust with them before you ask for anything.\n\nIn fact, offer to help them in some way or do something that shows you care about them from sending them an article that may be of interest to them to offering to make an introduction to someone you think they'd like to get to know. All of those acts show you value them as a person and you value having them in your network, all before you ever think of asking for a favor or a sale.\n\nThese are all examples of building a relationship in person, but what about building relationships with an online audience? The same principles apply: connect, get to know them as a person and then add value to their lives.\n\nIf you are a podcaster you want to think about simply connecting to one person and getting them to download your show.

Once you've lasered in on the culture and how to inform yourself about it, now you'll actually inform yourself with this step and become wise on your industry. Find out whatever you can and go wherever you have to go to learn EVERYTHING about your topic. This is what the greats do to become great, so do it too!\n\n4: Make the decision to TAKE (imperfect) ACTION!!!\n\nNothing gets done without action. You\u2019re a hustler, now show it. Take your knowledge from the previous three steps and put it into action.\u00a0 You\u2019ve gotta pull the trigger at some point or you won't get anywhere further along your timeline. So commit to take action, even if it isn't perfect just go for it and you'll learn as you go along. Again, this is what the leaders of the world do so you can too.\n\n5: Surround yourself with leaders.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking of leaders! Now it's time to build those relationships with them. Relationships: this is the only thing that matters in business and in life. Build relationships, especially with the leaders of your industry, and you'll see your life shift like never before. \u00a0You are the product of the 5 people you spend the most time with so make those 5 people GREAT.\n\n6: Take MORE action.\n\nAction begets more action so take some now and commit to continually doing so. Make your actions based on your knowledge and what you've learned so far, and GO.\n\nIf you're taking action on a daily basis you're going to produce more results and see more changes than someone who just starts, then stops. So be one of those people who takes action, and then more action, and then more action. Pretty soon you won't have to tell yourself to take action because it'll just be your daily life!\n\n7. Show gratitude.\u00a0\n\nFind something to be grateful for on a daily basis: this one simple act can shift your life in ways you can\u2019t begin to imagine. \u00a0Try this exercise: Everytime you sit down to a meal with a friend or family, have everyone say (out loud) 2 things you were grateful...", "duration": "1:14:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/217.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Dawn Marrs", "Guests", "Podcast", "Woman", "8 Steps", "Solopreneur", "Training"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1421375889, "title": "216: How Naming My Dog Dexter Helped My Dating Life, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Greetings from Palm Springs!

They are a network marketing power couple that has made over a million dollars over the last couple of years in their company.\n\nI brought them on to talk about their background and how adversity has been such a key to their success.\n\nLori faced adversity early on. Believe it or not, she was a chubby kid. She says her family bonded over food and they also all believed being overweight was simply in their DNA, it was just part of who they are.\n\nBut Lori has always had a fighting spirit and she refused to believe she was stuck.\u00a0The pivotal point\u00a0for her came when she was 11 and her crush teased her in front of everyone. She was at the pool with a group of friends and was about to jump off the diving board. He yelled at her not to jump because if she did there would be no water left. Lori was mortified and determined to change her weight.\n\nShe did what all great solopreneurs do when they are venturing into new territory: she immersed herself in her new passion, fitness. She read everything she could, she borrowed her sister's fitness tapes and made her mom buy all the fitness magazines at the grocery store for her.\n\nThough the change didn't happen overnight, it did happen. Lori soon saw fitness as a way to cope with the stress and anxiety of life; her family went through some difficult times and exercise helped her stay calm and focused.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tHow was Chris \"fake employable\" and are you?\n\tWhat was Lori's nickname as a child?\n\tHow many times has Lori been featured on the cover of Oxygen magazine?\n\tSuccessful people recognize ___ in others - what is it?\n\tWhy doing the scary stuff is so important to being successful.\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\nAs she became more fit and healthy, she decided to enter fitness competitions. She was not someone who finished things, but she wanted to change that. She knew by signing up for a fitness competition and working with her trainer, she would make herself fulfill on a commitment. It was also the scariest, biggest thing she could and she wanted to go for it; it would be her way of proving she do something with her life.\u00a0And so she did; after that first competition came many more.\n\nAlong the way she met Chris, while working out at the gym, and they\u00a0dated and eventually married. Initially they moved around for Chris' work and Lori took odd jobs as they did, working at a myriad of positions that she was not passionate about. Chris called her out on it and challenged her to find something she loved and be great at it.\n\nLori chose personal training and that led to online training and workouts for her clients and their referrals. They built a web site, a Facebook group and eventually videos.\u00a0Lori's brand was taking shape.\n\nWhen one of Lori's clients, a woman named Holly, suggested Lori try a nutritional system Holly was using Lori said no thanks. Having been in the fitness world for so long and having been so successful in it, Lori was inundated with new companies and products to try. And her experience was never good; the products always made her feel terrible.\n\nBut as she saw Holly's transformation over the next 10 or 11 months, Lori reconsidered and gave the products a chance. Soon she was a believer; she had more energy and felt great. And she loved how much time they saved her. Instead of being a slave to food from shopping at the store to prepping it to cooking it several ...", "duration": "1:11:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/215.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Fitness & Health", "Great Books", "Guests", "Health", "Life Coaching", "Lori Harder", "Love & Relationships", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Woman", "Chris Harder", "Isagenix", "Millionaire"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1421093268, "title": "214: How to CRUSH Events, and The Solopreneur Gear Guide, Part 1", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to our post-CES edition of The Solopreneur Hour! Fresh back from CES (the Consumer Electronics Show) in fabulous Las Vegas,\u00a0I spend today\u2019s show talking about how to prepare and crush events, what's going on in 2015, and share some killer gear every solopreneur needs.\n\nTune in to hear all of that and more on the 214th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nBefore we get into how to get the most out of attending events I\u2019ve got a quick rundown of events I\u2019ll be speaking at and attending in 2015. If you\u2019re going to be at any of them (and I hope you will) let me know so we can connect.\nThis coming weekend, Jan 17-19 I\u2019ll be at New Year\u2019s Kick-Off (NYKO) which is the annual Isagenix event to start each new year. If you\u2019re interested in network marketing and want to know more about Isagenix and NYKO reach out to me here.\nLater in January I\u2019ll be at NAMM which is the National Association of Music Merchants and will be in Anaheim, California.\nAnd in March I have the honor of doing live, in-depth interviews with some of the key speakers at Social Media Marketing World right here in San Diego. Michael Stelzner of Social Media Examiner puts on this incredible event every year and this year I have the honor of being on stage.\nIf you\u2019re going to be in town for this event - and you should - let me know. I\u2019m organizing a meetup for all listeners who will be in attendance and I\u2019d love for you to join us.\nThere are a few other events I\u2019ve got on my calendar, you\u2019ll have to download the show to hear what they are and where they are!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow if you\u2019re attending any of these or any other events, I\u2019m going to tell you what you need to know before you go on this episode. These lessons are based on my belief that events are where it\u2019s at for all solopreneurs and wannabe solopreneurs everywhere. Events are so critical they are one of the 8 steps to becoming a successful solopreneur (the other 7 are here).\nThe first step of preparation for me was to know my outcome. I went in with the intention of creating relationships with certain companies I\u2019d like to have as sponsors of the show.\u00a0 You should create a goal like that for every event you attend. Whether it\u2019s a local meet up or a week-long conference, determine an outcome you will achieve as a result of being there.\nSecondly I had a pitch. I knew who I was talking to and I knew why I wanted to talk to them, all before I went to the show. Do your research before your event and find out who will be in attendance, then know why you want to connect with them and that will help you develop your pitch.\nAnd you\u2019ll refine that pitch as the event goes on and after it is over. You\u2019ll learn new things as you meet new people, all of which will help you refine what you\u2019re saying and who you\u2019re saying it to.\nFinally there\u2019s the follow up. Whoever said the fortune is in the follow up was certainly talking about events. Come home with a stack of info whether it\u2019s business cards, phone numbers or names of people in companies you met with and then contact them. Remind them who you are, where you met and something about your conversation so they remember you.\nPart of my pitch and follow up steps was to get samples of what everyone was showcasing at CES. Some I\u2019ll need to give back but many things I\u2019m able to keep and will be giving away to all of you!\nI did all of those things during my time at CES and brought home some phenomenal contacts, resources and giveaways for all of you.

Computers, cameras, lenses, etc. I'm a photographer and I just made the difficult decision to return an expensive computer that I had been looking forward to.\n\nRobert Bone\nHey Andrew, I'm sure Michael will cover this properly, but I suggest putting together a simple business plan and look at projected turnover and costs, and from there work out your budgets (ie equipment, marketing, etc). Then STICK TO THE BUDGETS!\n\nThe\u00a0biggest killer of small businesses is cash-flow, and as a business every penny you spend comes off your bottom line, and as a solopreneur, your company profit exactly equals how much you personally earn.\n\nIt's easy to think of non-essential tools (toys???) as a tax write-off, but although it gets off-set against your tax, you're not getting 100% of it back in tax. Don't fall into this trap of wantonly spending big bucks in order to reduce your tax liability by a small amount.\n\nTo put it another. Imagine you fall, break a wrist and can't hold a camera for a couple of weeks. Would you rather have cash in the bank to pay some bills, or a fancy computer to play solitaire on whilst the credit card bills are gaining compound interest?\n\nMartin Hollands\nIn any area of branding, what or who impressed you in 2014?

She is THE go-to legal eagle for the internet marketing A-listers of the world.\nAnd she joins us to answer all of your solopreneur-related legal questions, and give you the lowdown on what you should do and what you shouldn\u2019t do on your own to protect your business, Ms. Jo-na Williams.\nOn the 212th episode of The Solopreneur Hour Jo-na shares her background as a vocal artist, how it led her to become today\u2019s most in-demand internet marketing attorney and so much more.\nMore About This Show\nJo-na\u2019s foray into entertainment law actually began when was a studio singer in Detroit. Her mom was a music promoter in their hometown of Detroit during the Motown days of the 70s and 80s. Jo-na was bitten by the singing bug and was eventually introduced to a producer and engineers. They loved her voice and brought her in to sing and sing various songs, all the while promising her credit.\nAs happens to many vocalists, she never got credit for her work. Her voice was stolen and used for songs she never agreed to and she wasn\u2019t given credit for her other work. She explains what a mess it was for her.\nThe silver lining was she found her niche: she loved the entertainment industry and tried on various hats in that field, until she found the law. She was looking for the common thread in that world of entertainment that would uniformly help any and all artists trying to make it. And the law was that common thread, so she went to law school and fell in love with business law.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tHow has her art evolved?\n\tWhat are some of the commonalities between solopreneurs and musicians?\n\tDoes she recommend having an online company set up your business for you?\n\tWhat is ASCAP and why should you care?\n\tWhat's the difference between the TM and the copyright R?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nHer next big \u201cah-ha\u201d moment came when she took Marie Forleo\u2019s B School. Taking this course opened up the world of internet marketing for her and she was hooked. She began giving away legal advice to her fellow B Schoolers and she stood out for it. There were only a few other lawyers participating, but she set herself apart by helping as many others as she could.\nAnd people took notice, one of her first big serial entrepreneur clients loved her work so much that she wrote a piece about how great Jo-na\u2019s legal help had been. That piece had a snowball effect on Jo-na\u2019s client list, and she\u2019s been growing ever since.\nOn today\u2019s episode Jo-na also shares how to pick a lawyer (no matter your budget), some of the common solopreneur pitfalls she sees and how to avoid them and simple steps we can all take right now to cover your business bases.\nYou\u2019ll have to listen to hear the details on all of these topics, but one glimpse you can have now are her simple steps to take to cover your business\u2019 bases.\nFirst get a consultation with a lawyer (a business lawyer, preferably an online business savvy one) and an accountant. Tell them where you are at with your business and where you want to go. They can recommend the proper business entity for you.\nIf you\u2019re mainly looking for a lifestyle of time, location and financial freedom Jo-na says you\u2019re okay to start with a sole proprietorship until you\u2019re generating higher revenue and you have a larger reach, your lawyer and accountant will help you figure out what entity is right for you when you do reach that next level.\nAfter that you\u2019ll want to create a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). This will protect you and all of your ideas when you\u2019re building your company and your teams. Everyone who works for you, with you or creates something for your business should sign this (like graphic designers, web developers, etc).

How do make the leap?\n\nToday on episode 211 we're talking about how to make that leap, what you're afraid of and how to get past it with super successful entrepreneur, Dr. Paul Anderson and budding entrepreneur Jessica Shanaan. Join us for all of that and more on today's live in-studio edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nThis is a really special, and really insightful episode. \u00a0One one hand, we have Jessica Shaanan,\u00a0who's been completely bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. \u00a0On the other hand, we've got the ultra-entrepreneur, Dr. Paul Anderson.\n\nJessica is where many of you are right now and where every solopreneur has been: she's getting started. She knows what she loves to do and what she's good at. Now she's in the process of narrowing that down and finding her swing. On this episode Dr. Paul and I talk about how to apply her talents and skills to make the leap from a day job to being unemployable.\n\nFor those of you who haven't heard Dr. Paul's previous visits to the show, find them here. He's an extremely successful and innovative man who creates natural products for the health and wellness world. He's also very knowledgable on what it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur.\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tWhat's the ultimate secret?\n\tDo we really only use 10% of our brain?\n\tDr. Paul shares the two things we need for entrepreneurial success.\n\tWhat percentage of information in the health and wellness world is accurate?\n\tThe reward system to use when working at home.\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two things Dr. Paul says we all need for solopreneur success are true knowledge and proper marketing/packaging. True and accurate knowledge is rare, most people are wrong about most things (especially in the health industry). Know the basics of what you're doing and what you are offering to the world and you'll be miles ahead in your industry.\n\nHe also has discovered\u00a0that finding your mission is of utmost importance. Those who makes the greatest impact in the world, in whatever field they are in, are those who have found their mission. The vehicle they use to share that mission is secondary to the actual mission itself. So if you want to make the world a healthier place, like Jessica does, that is your mission. How that mission reaches the world becomes your vehicle, but it isn't as important as the actual mission is.\n\nIf you're still finding your mission and finding your way you can also take what you know and start a business. We touched on this in episode 205 with Jill and Josh Stanton, and we revisit it on today's episode. If you actually like what you do and there's a need for it in the world take your talents and skills and become a consultant. Find a way to offer your services on your own terms with your own business.\n\nAnother important point made in this episode is you'll never know everything and you'll never be completely prepared to make the solopreneur leap. At a certain point you simply have to know it isn't perfect but jump anyway. Be open, ask questions and go for it. You're going to learn so much along the way so just get started.\n\nWe go into greater detail on all of these topics, and much more on this episode. This was a terrific show for all of the beginning solopreneurs,\u00a0I'm so happy to share it with all of you! Please join me in thanking Dr. Paul and Jessica for being here.

Returning to the show is our friend, the super successful solopreneur, tech pundit and online master craftsman, Joel Comm.\n\nOn this episode Joel and I talk about a variety of topics, including why timing is so important in success, what the greatest trends of 2014 were and what they will be in 2015. All of that and more on the 209th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nIf you missed Joel's previous visit to the show you can have a listen here. To quickly recap: Joel is a multiple best-selling author (New York Times\u00a0of course), online marketer and humorous creator of the highly-lucrative iPhone app iFart.\nHe returns to the show to talk about some of the highlights of 2014 and what we both see as emerging themes for next year, 2015. For him 2014 was his first year fully out of hibernation and back in the saddle. He launched a few info products, did a lot of speaking and traveling as well as some book projects.\nLooking ahead for 2015 we talk about events and how important they are for all solopreneurs. As we've reiterated on this show many times relationships are key to your success (or failure) in your business. And the best way to create lasting connections with people is by meeting and mingling at events. Joel and I are in complete agreement on this one and we discuss a few of the events we will both be speaking at and attending in 2015.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tHow does he handle the responsibility of 80k Twitter followers?\n\tTo be great is to be ______. Joel fills in the blank.\n\tWho does he put on a pedestal?\n\tWhat I'll be doing at Social Media\u00a0Marketing World in 2015: we let the cat out of the bag!\n\tWhat gives him the greatest joy?\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDovetailing with that topic is our discussion of an emerging trend for 2015 that we both see on the horizon: writing books. Joel says writing and publishing physical books has been the most powerful leverage he's ever created for his business. It's given him access to more speaking engagements, more successful connections, a wider audience, and a ton of credibility.\n\nJoel believes in the power of becoming an author so much that he's hosting and facilitating an event on the topic in 2015. In the spring his first ever Book Camp will be happening in Los Angeles, and he'll be teaching people not only how to create a book and market it, leverage it but also why it's so important to do so. He's keeping the attendance on the smaller side and is screening all attendees. If you want to go just message him on Facebook and he'll get back to you with more details on how to apply.\n\nWe get into some of the nitty-gritty on actually writing a book in this episode. Joel shares one great tidbit for first-time authors: because you can't be a New York Times best-selling author as a first-time author find one who will write your foreword. That way it'll say \"New York Times best-selling author\" on the cover of your book, even though you aren't one (yet).\n\nA few more pieces of advise from Joel are to pick a topic you're knowledgable and passionate about. The days of finding a hot niche and tapping into it are over, choose to write about what you know about and can give a lot of information about and you'll have a far better book when you're done.\n\nOnce you've picked your topic, you'll have chapters to create. And to write those chapters\u00a0Joel gives us the one question to ask yourself: what are the top 10 questions someone would ask you about your topic? When you have those 10 questions, you have your chapters.\n\nOn today's show we also talk about where podcasting is going, why Joel pushed pause on his show and if we can expect to see his podcast again in 2015 and why he sometimes has to filter what he says! Plus we throw in a lot of fun to boot, including our favorite silly accents and the reason Joel believ...", "duration": "1:12:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/209.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Joel Comm", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "2015", "Goal Setting", "iFart", "Tech Pundit"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1419699505, "title": "208: How to Build Relationships with Powerful Influencers, with Selena Soo", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "When you're first getting started as a solopreneur one of the most powerful things you can do is cultivate relationships with powerful people. In fact, it's one of the most important things you can do at any point during the life of your business. Relationships are everything.\n\nHere to share with us how to build those relationships in a genuine way is Selena Soo of S2 Groupe. She gives us practical advice on what to do, and what not to do to, to build relationships with powerful influencers. All of that and more on the 208th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nOne of the things Selena has always loved to do is to connect and help people. Today she's translated those traits into a thriving business; she calls people like Ramit Sethi, Derek Halpern and others her friends. And because she loves to help others build their own powerful networks like she has done she's found a way to coach people on how to do this through\u00a0her mastermind groups and one on one private coaching.\nBut Selena didn't always see herself as an entrepreneur or solopreneur. While in business school she organized a conference to empower women and she made lots of great connections in the media by doing so. After she graduated and went into the workforce, she stayed in touch with those contacts and continued to do what she did naturally: bring people together who could help each other.\nAs her discontent with her career options grew and her social connections did too, she realized she could run her own public relations and publicity firm. At first she tried the traditional route of having clients on retainer, but that wasn't a natural fit for the way she did business. She felt she was having to put pressure on her media contacts to make things happen for her clients, and she had never done business that way before and didn't want to start.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tWhat is\u00a0re-negotiation and how does it apply to your business?\n\tWhen did she begin seeing herself as an entrepreneur?\n\tThe one thing you must do before making an introduction.\n\tHow to identify the key figures at major publications: Selena explains.\n\tWhy the shotgun approach is dead.\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo she invested a significant amount of money and hired a coach. Her coach helped her create the coaching practice she has today, and to develop and build her mastermind groups. She also hosts events where her clients mingle and create connections with people of influence.\n\nOn today's show she shares with us some of the tips she gives her clients on how to make those initial connections and build on them until they become thriving relationships that help both parties.\n\nOne of the most powerful actions you can take according to Selena is to be at events where your contacts are going to be. So get to the conferences, the meet ups, the one-day masterminds and meet the people you admire and want to learn from and be like.\n\nThe first step in doing so is to identify your key influences. Just pick a handful of people you most want to get to know. These are generally people who fall into two categories: the first group is people you consider mentors and you want to learn from, and the second category is the super connectors (the people who know everyone and can introduce you to others).\n\nYour next step is to do research on this small list of people you want to meet and build relationships with. Get to know them, both personally and professionally. Find out what's most important to them so you can add value when you connect with them.\n\nAnd that's the third step: connect. This is where you go to the meetup, the mastermind event, the conference and you create a connection. Selena says there are some key questions you can ask to find out how you can contribute to them, ask them what are they most excited about right now or what's their main focus for the year/the next quarter. When you know those answers you can find ways to bring value to their lives.", "duration": "1:09:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/208.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Selena Soo", "Social Media", "Woman", "Business", "Influencers", "Relationships"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1419563647, "title": "207: 2015 Goal Setting, How To Pick A Coach, and your Q&A, w/ Dr. Mark Costes", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome solopreneurs!

How would you recommend overcoming that.\n\nDave @ Fresh Rag\n@solohour that's my question for the next show. What are your updated thoughts on this new territory we are entering?\n\nJackie Smith\nI have a question Michael O'Neal. So many people online get into coaching. I hired a coach years ago over ten, and after 3 phone calls I realized bad investment. I feel that too many online people get into coaching for the money and truly are not qualified to do so?

What platform would you use? What about for the private group you have for Sololab?\n\nIt seems every other community-building platform on the market, except perhaps Google+, which the masses still haven't adopted, is of the membership-site variety, which requires signups, usernames, passwords, and the like, none of which are rocket science, but are still participation deterrents for many.\n\nThe best thing about FB groups is since this is the one platform everyone is on, you can build great public and private communities without making people sign up and remember extra login credentials. It would be a shame if something happened to wipe out all the communities you and other entrepreneurs/coaches have built ...", "duration": "1:08:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/207.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mark Costes", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Business", "Coaching", "Facebook", "Q&A", "Questions"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1419357378, "title": "206: The Top 3 Female Fitness Bloggers in Studio, with Amy Clover, Krista Stryker and Jenny Sansouci", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Whether we solopreneurs realize it or not health is our greatest asset.

Returning for her second visit is Amy Clover of Strong Inside Out, Krista Stryker of 12 Minute Athlete and Jenny Sansousci of Healthy Crush.\n\nListen in as we talk about how they evolved into their current business models and what it was like along the way. All of that and more on the 206th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nOne of my favorite things\u00a0to do for this show is to have people live in the studio. And I was grateful to have these three talented and savvy women join me to talk about how they came up with their respective brands, what it was like getting started in the internet marketing world and where they're at today.\nFor those of you who are long-time listeners of the show you may remember Amy Clover visiting us in the past. If you don't know Amy she's the force behind Strong Inside Out, a brand that has evolved out of Amy's struggles with depression and anxiety. We dive into details on her very personal story in previous episodes (which you can find here). And as she joins us today Amy is coming off of a country-wide tour promoting her brand and spreading the word that we can fight depression and anxiety through fitness.\nSince her last visit to the show she has created a track-based program that allows people to choose based on where they're at in terms of physical and mental health fitness. Strong Inside Out now provides this track-based program as well as support through coaching, Facebook groups, accountability, work out programs and much more. One of her favorite aspects of her work is seeing people grow through their work with her brand.\nOur second in-studio visitor is Krista Stryker. Krista is the amazing woman behind 12 Minute Athlete. She's a former copywriter who also wanted to be a journalist. She channeled her experience in writing copy and her love for sharing news into her present day blog at 12 Minute Athlete.\nAbout two years ago she decided to start a blog and in true solopreneur fashion she actually started 5 blogs! She had lots of ideas and interests so the blogs were in various industries from fitness to personal development to travel. If she liked it she wanted to write about it! But soon she realized she had to narrow her focus to find success and create a thriving online platform. So she chose one industry and taught herself how to make a go of running a fitness blog.\nShe admits to doing something most of us have done: learning way too much before taking action! She created tons of videos for her blog before getting the word out about, but once she put the pedal to the metal it was on.\nKrista wanted to get out of the copywriting world, but she went to a copywriting conference where she met Brian Clark of Copyblogger.

But did you ever consider taking what you do in your day job and creating an online business from it? And what about working with your spouse, is that something you've wanted but haven't pulled the trigger on yet?\n\nOur guests for today have done both. Jill and Josh Stanton of Screw The 9 to 5 join us to talk about what it takes to make it as a solopreneur team and couple, and how to transition from your 9 to 5 day job, to your own business. All of that and more on episode 205 of\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nJosh and Jill Stanton have been together as a couple and as a working team for a few years now, and they've learned a lot of valuable and applicable lessons along the way. When they met Josh was already an internet marketer and Jill was dreaming of the day she'd be working for herself. She was tired of the service industry and was ready to make a change, but to what she didn't know.\nOne day they had an idea to create an affiliate page together and so began their solopreneurial journey together. It took a few more years for it to take shape and form, but eventually they were building successful affiliate pages together. Josh's first ebook was about how to take better care of your goldfish (really!) and Jill created products based on what she knew: how to make more money in the service industry. They were taking simple things they already knew and making products out of them.\nAccording to Josh and Jill that's one of the keys to being a successful solopreneur. If you aren't sure what to start with, start with what you know! If you have a burning idea for a business then give that a go, but otherwise take your existing knowledge and create a digital product, offer consulting services or build a membership site. It's how they built successfully in their early days, and it still helps them today.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tWhat are the three main ways to create an online business?\n\tJill's definition of luck: what is it and how does it apply to being a solopreneur?\n\tWho has earned the affectionate nickname \"SEO ho\"?\n\tWhy being emotionally fit is so vital to solopreneurship.\n\tThe failure that led them to create Screw The 9 to 5.\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\nAnother approach that helps them today is their ability to work as a team. Although it's difficult at times, they have learned how to be in a relationship and be business partners. They make time for themselves in the morning and at night. They call it their \"wake up and break up\" ritual! In the morning each of them will go off for an hour alone, either to work out or do something by themselves. And at night they spend time just being a couple, like having a glass of wine and talking.\nThey also chose who they surround themselves with. They moved to Thailand to be around other entrepreneurs, online marketers and various solopreneurs. They love that their dinner conversations consistent of Facebook KPIs, conversion rates and lead gen ideas. Following one of the cardinal rules of being a solopreneur they have chosen friends who are on the same path they are, people who understand why they do what they do and support them in their efforts.\nOn that same vein we also discuss how to chose a coach or a new program. Because there are SO many options available to someone wanting to start or grow their business, it's easy to get led astray. Just like choosing your friends, you need to choose a program or a coach based on who they are and what they are up to. If you're signing up for someone's coaching program have they gotten the results you want? What proof do they show you?\nThe simple rule is this: if the person you're going to buy from has what you want to have then go for it. If you want to make $10,000 a month writing ebooks then find someone who's done that and do what they did. But if you can't see the proof or the results you're looking for ...", "duration": "1:16:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/205.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Affiliate Marketing", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Guests", "Jill Stanton", "Josh Stanton", "Podcast", "Josh & Jill Stanton", "Screw The 9 to 5", "SEO", "Thailand"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1418973398, "title": "204: Christmas Wishlist, Censorship, Serial, and Your Questions Answered", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Here we are again! \u00a0Solopreneurs welcome to another Friday and another Q&amp;A show! \u00a0After a week off, I decided to bring my great friend (and awesome photographer) Jenna Bienenfeld in studio for our weekly question and answer session.\u00a0Because we always have a blast together, I thought she'd be a perfect person to banter with on today's episode.\n\nIf you've missed these previously I take questions in our Proudly Unemployable group on Facebook (find it here) on Thursday.

Publicity? News coverage and magazine articles?\u00a0As solopreneurs we focus on growing our audience and providing valuable content for them, but an overlooked tool in our arsenal is public relations (PR).\n\nHaddy Folivi, founder of Clarity Media, is here to give us practical and actionable tips for getting more press coverage for our businesses, and she also helps us see the value in doing so. She even walks us through the steps of creating a pitch! Listen in for all of that and more on the 203rd episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nOne of the things that makes Haddy so great at what she does is her roots. Haddy got her first taste of the PR world when she was on the other side of the coin: she was a journalist. In college her main journalistic focus was music. She interviewed and wrote about such stars as Usher, Destiny's Child (and even the long-since-forgotten Sisqo and his Thong Song).\nLike so many university students she worked tirelessly. She went to class all day, came home for a quick bite to eat and then ran off to the next concert she was covering that night. Then she'd get up at 4 or 5am to write about that same concert, before going off to a full day of class.\nHer tenacity paid off when she landed a job in a large PR firm after finishing her degree. She quickly worked her way up from entry-level tea-fetcher to a valuable, contributing member of the firm. But by the time they figured out what a catch she was, Haddy had her exit strategy in place and off she went. She freelanced for a bit and then took a job with a non-media company for the next 5 years. And that time cemented what she already knew: she was unemployable.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tHow she knew she was unemployable.\n\tShould you outsource your public relations tasks?\n\tWhat's the fastest success story she's ever helped create for a client?\n\tHow long should you wait after emailing your pitch before following up?\n\tThe hashtag to use to find out what journalists are in need of right now.\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\nAfter her last gig, she went out on her own. She knew she could offer the same level of expertise and success that other, larger and more impersonal firms were offering and she could it with a human touch. That was the origin of Clarity Media and she hasn't looked back since!\nOn today's show she applies the wisdom she's gained over the last 17 years to help us understand the value in public relations and how simple it is to send out a pitch, and how to effectively craft and follow-up your pitch for successful media coverage. It's a whole lot simpler than you might think and she walks us through the basic steps., which we'll get to in a minute.\nIn terms of the value PR provides for you, there is plenty.\u00a0It lends credibility and also expands your audience, without having to spend money on advertising. You're reaching a targeted audience and being positioned as an authority on the subject. It's a win-win all around.\nAnd it's also what you do after you get the coverage that really matters. Be sure to add it to your Bio page or your About page on your website, that page should be a living and breathing document that you are always expanding and adding to. The more coverage you get, the more coverage you'll be able to secure in the future. It builds on itself until eventually the press is coming to YOU rather than you hunting them!\nNow that you understand the value PR adds for your business, let's look at the steps to crafting and submitting a successful pitch. The first thing to do is to find your contact information. Whatever publication you are contacting just go to their web site and look under Contact Us or the editorial section. You should find a few sentences that talk about where to submit story ideas. That is the email address you want.\nWith that info in hand, you can now write your pitch. It will be short: 3-4 lines tops. The first sentence or two will introduce you,", "duration": "1:07:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/203.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Haddy Folivi", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Woman", "Marketing", "PR", "Press Release"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1418412061, "title": "202: A Branding Case Study with David Roth and Rick Bacher of GetStirredUp.com and Ryan Pence of BrewVenTix", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "So often solopreneurs think of branding as simply a logo and a company name. But if you're a regular listener you know branding goes much deeper than that and you know how important it is to nail your brand, and how much easier it makes everything when you do. To highlight the importance of the process, and the process itself, today's episode is a case study in branding.\n\nDavid Roth and Rick Bacher of Get Stirred Up join us to talk about one company they recently worked with and what that experience was like. Ryan Pence is one of the founders of the company they rebranded and we walk through that process together on the 202nd episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nOur long-time listeners will recognize David's name and remember him from his previous visits to the show, which you can find here. David is the head of Get Stirred Up, a company that specializes in branding. Up until recently, David and his team had solely worked with large corporations to do branding and rebrands.\nBut David was interested in shifting gears a bit and wanting the challenge of helping smaller start-ups. This meant they'd have to condense the timeframe of their branding process because they'd also be lowering their fees, but it also meant they could branch out and work with exciting newcomers in new marketplaces.\nWhen I met Ryan at a recent Reddit event in San Diego, he told me he was starting a new company that provides event information and tickets for craft brewing events around the country. They were in the branding stage of things and I thought they might be a good fit for David's new endeavors. I introduced them and connected them and let them take it from there. A few months later they had developed a new brand for Ryan and his company and they were ready to talk about the process that led them there.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tWhy rapport is so critical when working with a team like David's.\n\tThe connection between the grocery store and your brand: how to make the link.\n\tHow Brewventix came to be.\n\tWhy Brewventix chose the tagline they did, and what that has to do with you.\n\tTrue or false: Get Stirred Up revised their focus as a result of working on this project?\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically when Get Stirred Up is hired to work with a company that company is earning revenues of $20 million or more. Obviously that wasn't the case for Ryan and his business partner. So the timeframe was scaled back from months to weeks, and the deliverables were condensed as well. And when Ryan and Matt (his partner) showed up ready to do the work, David and Rick were ready for them.\n\nOne of the first things they did after agreeing to work together was to find out what Ryan and Matt liked and didn't like in terms of companies, logos and customer service. A few of the questions they had to answer were questions like: If you were a grocery store, either a chain or a one-off, what store would you be? If you were an automobile what would you be?\n\nRyan and Matt also had to list companies who had great customer service and share logos, brands they really liked. David and Rick wanted to know where Ryan and Matt spent their time, the companies they were loyal to, companies that had a \"stickiness\" factor in their minds and to explain why they liked the visuals they liked. It was an intense part of the process and one that usually takes awhile, but Ryan and Matt were so committed and so gung-ho for the opportunity that they answered all of those questions far faster than expected.\n\nSo the process moved along quickly and generally smoothly. Matt and Ryan already had a name picked out, but they were open to changing it if that's what Get Stirred Up suggested. Because Matt and Ryan were willing to put aside their egos and their pride, they made the branding process a lot less difficult than it has been in the past for David and Rick.\n\nIn fact they did change the company name to Brewventix.", "duration": "1:13:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/202.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "David Roth", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Podcast", "Rick Bacher", "Ryan Pence", "Beer", "Branding", "Brewventix", "Cereality", "GET STIRRED UP"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1418367229, "title": "201: Make Thousands With One Simple Idea with Stephen Key", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Do you think inventors are born or can any\u00a0solopreneur come up with a new idea? Our guest on today's show says anyone can do it. And he would know, his name is Stephen Key and he's been the force behind such smash hits as Teddy Ruxpin and Laser-tag, among many other inventions and creations you probably use every day.\n\nStephen is also a best-selling author and a regular columnist with Inc. Magazine and Entrepreneur. Today we talk about his background, how to patent your idea and whether or not companies really will steal your concept. All of that and much more on episode 201 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nStephen Key first got into his line of work when he left college early. He believed he wasn't hirable and no company would want him so he started making things and selling them on street corners and fairs. It took a little while before he had any success at it, but that didn't matter nearly as much to him as the fun he had in the process.\nHe pursued that path until the age of 27. At that time he was living out of his car, until he met a woman who took him in in exchange for childcare for her daughter. She saw Stephen's talent for making things and asked him to make her daughter a teddy bear. With some cajoling, he did. She was so impressed by his creation she encouraged him to go to San Francisco and work with a company called Dakin Toys.\nHe found them, discovered their stuffed animal maker had left so he asked to take her spot. They gave him material and said come back with a golden retriever stuffed animal prototype. Two weeks later he did and they paid him for it, then said they wanted 25 more. Stephen countered, agreeing to take on the project but only at double their original agreement. They agreed and he was in business!\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tHow many Teddy Ruxpins were sold?\n\tDid he lie to get his first job?\n\tWhat is the Mix and Match game, and how does it apply to your business?\n\tWhat is a PPA and why should you care?\n\tHis most profitable idea wasn't even his idea: true or false?\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot long after he saw a prototype for Teddy Ruxpin in the newspaper and saw what a disaster it was. He found the company, and told them they needed to hire him to fix it. They agreed and offered him a full-time job. Though he debated about working for someone else on a full-time basis, he eventually agreed and became\u00a0a part of Worlds of Wonder. He went on to be a part of the team that brought the world Teddy Ruxpin and Laser-tag.\nHe also met his wife while working there. Eventually they left the company and moved to a small town in California. She took a job as the Vice-President of Marketing for Gallo Wines, and he wasn't working. She encouraged him to start his company. Soon one of his ideas was a hit, and he was off to the races!\nToday Stephen holds over 30 patents and has learned a tremendous amount in his time both working with Worlds of Wonder and on his own. With Worlds of Wonder he discovered you don't have to play by anyone's rules, you can make your own as long as you want something bad enough.\nAnd he has certainly wanted many things badly enough along the way. For all of those patents and successes he's had, he's also had ample rejections. He says he can wallpaper his home office with rejection letters!\nBut that doesn't deter him. In fact, it spurs him on. He admits to taking them all personally, but each rejection drives him to find out why his idea wasn't accepted, and to start again. He knows he's only as good as the products he's got out there and he wants to continue to prove himself.\nAll of those are valuable lessons for us as solopreneurs: make your own rules, pursue your desired outcome and only let rejection spur you on to greater things!\nIn this episode we talk about much more with Stephen including how to patent your ideas for around a hundred bucks, and what it was like to know Tim Ferriss before he was Tim Ferriss.", "duration": "1:08:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/201.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Stephen Key", "Entrepreneur", "Invention", "Products"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1418214242, "title": "200: A VERY Special Episode 200, Starring\u2026YOU.", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "The Solopreneur Hour has been the best thing I've ever done.

On the first question about favorite episodes there were some consistent favorites like the Q&amp;A shows we do on Fridays, and all of the John Lee Dumas episodes, and all of Michael Johnston's appearances. A number of you also loved the Michael Gerber episode and hearing our very own David Ralph go from listener to guest of the show.\n\nAbout the advice you've picked up and held onto from this show, there was also a variety of answers. For some of you it was about finding the impetus to take action and being okay with imperfect action, for others it was about honing in on and really nailing your brand. For others you discovered the path to a healthier body and bank account, and others of you have finally gotten what that failure is part of being successful.\n\nI also asked you what your ideal solopreneur lifestyle looks like, and the resounding answer was freedom. We all want time freedom to do what we want when we want and to be beholden to no one but ourselves. Naturally we want the financial freedom to go along with that, but for many of us it's not about building skyscrapers and huge businesses.\n\nRather it's about taking care of those we love and having enough leftover to travel and live wherever we chose. And that location freedom was another piece of the puzzle for some of you, being able to travel and live anywhere in the world for however long we chose is a vital part of being solopreneurs.\n\nThere are several other questions you'll hear the answers to on this episode, but the one I'll leave you with is your response to how you're now helping others as a result of listening to this show. Many of you are leading by example, becoming podcasters, speakers, and authors in your own right. Others of you are helping the world through your own online products and programs.\n\nIt's incredible to know\u00a0the trickle-down effect the show has had for you and to know you've been inspired, changed and emboldened by what we're doing here.\u00a0Whether you sent in a recording or not, thank you all for making episode 200 happen.\n\nWithout you there is no such thing a The Solopreneur Hour, no show and no me!

But have you ever set such a lofty goal that nearly everyone - including professionals in the field you've set your goal within - have told you you're crazy?\n\nOur guest for episode 199 did. John Richardson is a serial entrepreneur, business coach and author who decided he would golf below par in one year. Professional golfers told him he was mad, but he did it anyway. Join us as we talk about that experience, as well as his early failures and subsequent successes and more on this edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nJohn hails from Northern Ireland and today splits his time between London and there. Growing up in Northern Ireland he experienced firsthand The Troubles of the 1970s and 80s that region of the world went through. His father was a business man with a company on the eastern side of the city. He moved John and the rest of John's family out after his lorries (large trucks) were blown up one too many times.\nAfter that John spent most of his days in a nearby seaside town that felt like an entirely different world. He went to school, then on to university in England where he earned a business degree. After university he returned to Belfast and set up a sandwich shoppe.\nIt was perfect timing: he was providing a great product, Northern Ireland was hungry (pun intended) for new food offerings and so his shoppe took off. It grew from one location to many, employing 60 people in its heyday. John enjoyed the fruits of his labors, he was only in his 20s but business and life were good.\nUntil the bottom dropped out. John's business had grown so quickly they brought on a business partner to help them keep up with the demands. The partner turned out to be a shady character who stole from them and racked up debts. John had to sell his shoppes to pay the debts, and avoid bankruptcy (which they did by \"the skin of their teeth\", according to John).\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tDo we need an ass-kicking to truly be successful?\n\tWhat is the GOYA principle?\n\tThe importance of belief in yourself, and what you're doing.\n\tThe site AskTheBuilder.com and what it has to do with solopreneurship.\n\tWhy having your story is the best ammunition you can have.\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\nBy age 29 he was back where he had started: all his shoppes had been sold and it was time to build another business from the ground up. But this time John had his first hard knocks learning lesson to guide him, and he did some things differently. Being a self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur, he and his partners ran a restaurant, a bar, a property management company and even a domain name registration company.\nTruly he was and is a hustler, one of the keys to making it as a solopreneur. And the same is true for his daughter, who we discuss in this episode too. His daughter is Aimee Richardson, a young actress who played Princess Marcella on the first three seasons of Game of Thrones. Aimee inherited or simply emulated her dad's \"hustleness\" and has taken on acting as her passion.\nWhen she was not recast in her princess role on HBO's hit, she made a clip for Vine that went viral. She knows the importance of hustle, social media and perseverance already, and is committed to making the most of every opportunity that comes her way.\nAs does her father. John's ambitious goal to break par in 12 months or less that when he pulled it off, it made for such an engaging and successful story a movie deal was struck. Just a few weeks into the original filming of it one of the major backers pulled out and they had to stop shooting. They've since found additional funding, but John says if he hadn't experienced his earlier failures he wouldn't have been able to handle it the way he did.\nWe also get into John's story of how and why he set his golfing goal in the first place.", "duration": "1:12:49", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/199.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Breaking Par", "Golf", "John Richardson"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1417768864, "title": "198: Podcasting in 2015, Network Marketing Tactics, and Your FB Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to episode 198 of The Solopreneur Hour, glad to have you here!

There's been a few things that are buzzing around my head about podcasts recently that maybe you guys have figured out and can enlighten me.\n\n\tSo, I used to listen to podcasts on my iPod before the iPhone came about. Mr Dumas mentioned on I think Michael's podcast how Apple shared with him some awesome stats about podcast adoption. Michael has also mentioned we're heading into a podcast 3.0 phase. Is there any resource/figures/numbers I can get a hold of that show this?\n\tIf you're doing a podcast, why? Is it a method to get yourself setup as the expert in a particular field? What's the end game? Or can you run a business just with a podcast?\n\tWhat other formats are around that are not interviewing people? Do interviews give a particular edge over other formats?\nJust my thoughts so far. I want to understand podcasts, but I don't think it's \"clicked\" for me yet.\n\nBrad Brown\u00a0\nI'm thinking of closing my personal Facebook profile and starting a joint one with my wife, do you think this is a great idea?

If that's the case you're aware of the avalanche of entrepreneurial-based inspirational shows that have launched in the last 6 months of 2014.\n\nOne of the most notable is Hack the Entrepreneur with John \"call me Jonny\" Nastor. His show has been ranked consistently at #1 in Marketing and Management, and he's here to share how he did it.\n\nJoin us as we talk about his failures leading up to his current podcast, why he never focused on being #1 in New & Noteworthy,\u00a0and more on the 197th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nJonny's first show was not Hack the Entrepreneur. He got his feet wet in blogging and later had the idea for a podcast. As he says, he likes talking about internet marketing and business, and he wanted to do more of it. He came up with an idea and gave himself a three month runway to get it going, and if that idea didn't work then he'd try something else.\nWell he got knocked down more than once along the way, as will any good solopreneur, but he got himself back up again and persevered. He tried a few different podcasts before nailing it with Hack the Entrepreneur. One thing he understood during that process of getting knocked down and getting back up again is that no one goes from the mailroom to the CEO's corner office overnight, not one of us does.\nKnowing that made it easier for him to take his licks, learn some more and get back out there. Which is exactly what he recommends to budding solopreneurs and entrepreneurs. He says there's a time and a place for learning, but we also have to take action because that's where the real learning happens: in the doing.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tHow boxing and product launches\u00a0are alike.\n\tIs there a difference between simple and easy?\n\tJonny's take on outsourcing: when and how to do it right.\n\tWhy there really are such things as dumb questions (and how not to ask them).\n\tHow\u00a0his daughter got him a proper microphone.\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Hack the Entrepreneur Jonny says there's no way he could be doing what he's doing if he hadn't gotten knocked down previously. All of those previous lessons have taught him what he has needed to make his current podcast such a success. And one of those keys to success has been his utter lack of focus on his New & Noteworthy stats.\nSound contradictory? At first blush it might, but Jonny wasn't interested in being at the top of New & Noteworthy because it's so fleeting.\u00a0Instead he wanted to be at the top of iTunes in his category. And that's exactly what he did. He got there by being sure he had great interviews with great guests and that those guests were happy with how they sounded and how they interview went overall.\nHe says if his guests are happy with their appearance they'll promote it to their audience. It's far easier to leverage other people's audiences this way.\u00a0And Jonny also promotes his show to his own people on Twitter and Facebook, with much of his traction coming from Twitter.\nHe's also been slow to advertise and slow to outsource. It's a downfall of many podcasters and other solopreneurs to be fully focused on outsourcing as much as possible, as quickly as possible. Jonny believes that leads to poor business decisions, a position he didn't want to put himself in. In fact, it wasn't until recently that he brought on his first sponsor of the show and he began hiring a small team to help with the production of the podcast.\nContinuing to build on the momentum he's found in 2014, Jonny will be lasered in on expanding Hack the Entrepreneur beyond a podcast and into a full-on media empire brand next year. Under that umbrella is his VelocityPage, a project he's partnering with Mark Jaquith on, which will be his other pet project for the upcoming year.\nOn that same note we discuss how VelocityPage came to be, including a simple strategy you can use to become an authority in any industry with\u00a0any product launch.", "duration": "1:03:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/197.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Internet Marketing", "Jon Nastor", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Musicians", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Drumming", "Entrepreneur", "Hack The Entrepreneur", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1417422630, "title": "196: Sustaining Success As A Solopreneur with Anna Vocino", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As solopreneurs we\u00a0all\u00a0dream about that day when we \"make it\" in our business and our definition of \"making it\" is varied as our business ideas. But do you think you'll simply stop dreaming, stop creating and stop evolving on that day?\n\nProbably not, not if you're really going to pursue the true solopeneur path. Here to talk about her personal experience of \"making it\" and sustaining a solopreneur career is our lovely and talented voiceover and podcaster friend Anna Vocino.\n\nJoin us as we talk about all of that and more on the 196th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nIn case you've missed any of Anna's previous visits to the show, there have been three, you can have a listen here. We don't cover too much of her backstory on today's episode because we've done that previously, but here's a quick recap: Anna is a performer and actress who has been a successful voiceover artist for nearly 20 years. She's also a gluten-free guru who co-hosts a podcast with another friend of the show, Vinnie Tortorich.\nBeing the consummate solopreneur you must be to succeed in her world, Anna is working on numerous projects right now including a gluten-free cookbook. We chat about her cookbook, what life has been like since she appeared as Siri on Jimmy Kimmel Live (you can see the video here) and how she stays fresh, and relevant.\nIn Hollywood, like other industries, themes and topics are cyclical. If you look at the podcasting world in comparison, it holds true. How many variations of \"inspirational\" entrepreneur-related podcasts are out there? A ton, and these shows wanted to follow in the successful footsteps of a previous few.\nHollywood is similar: one actor becomes hot, everyone wants him or her and if they can't get that person they want the next version of him or her. Then someone else successful blooms and everyone wants him/her or the next possible version, it's a cycle.\nI wondered if Anna had this experience after being on Jimmy Kimmel as Siri. She says it wasn't quite like that after the Siri video went viral, but she has experienced that in the past. So how does she stay fresh and relevant in a world that's so heavily geared towards the next new flavor? Recently she's found that by being confident in herself and her own abilities, she's able to bring in more opportunities for satisfying, fulfilling work.\n\nMore About This Show:\n\n\tWas there ever a dream gig Anna wanted, but didn't get that she ever regretted?\n\tWhat does a car with no engine have to do with your solopreneurial dreams?\n\tThe funny story behind why she quit a receptionist job.\n\tWho is the Mr. X in her life?\n\tHow you can reach Yoda.\n\tAnd SO much more!\n\nShe used to believe that if she landed a certain project it would lead to bigger and better. While it's still important to allow ourselves to dream like that, it's our nature as humans to do so, she also understands now that she is the one who determines the \"bigger and better\", it's not about landing certain projects to get that. Anna gives a great personal story that highlights this, listen and then consider where this is relevant for you.\nWe talk about a number of other topics, including the impact of entrepreneurship on a relationship and the plethora of work in Hollywood right now, but one subject we'll highlight right now is her cookbook. Anna has been gluten-free for 12 years, and it was this shift in eating that paved the way for her co-hosting of The Angriest Trainer podcast with Vinnie.\nAlthough she never thought she'd be in the health industry, today she's in the process of writing and self-publishing a cookbook. She wants to share her recipes with others to help them explore healthier eating options. She's tired of the fear and the shame that surrounds diet and fitness, and believes the industry is largely based on a sham.\nShe says we don't need the latest diet fad or pill, we need to eat more whole foods, stop eating processed stuff and get active. It's that simple.", "duration": "1:13:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/196.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Anna Vocino", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Comedian", "Fitness & Health", "Great Books", "Health", "Love & Relationships", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Woman", "Acting", "Comedy", "Gluten Free Anna", "Hollywood", "Solopreneur", "Voiceover"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1417158391, "title": "195: Gratitude, Executing on Your Plan, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Gobble Gobble! \u00a0Happy Thanksgiving everyone! \u00a0Today's edition of The Solopreneur Hour is packed full of great questions, and gratitude.

Rosie proves the latter to be true. She never dreamt of going into stand-up until a former boyfriend dragged her to comedy open mic nights because he wanted to be a comedian. At first she grudgingly went along to support him, but when he encouraged her to write material for him, a new path was forged.\n\nEleven years later she has since opened for well-known comedians such as Lisa Lampanelli, Gilbert Gottfried and Russell Peters. She recently created her own podcast, Out of the Box, (http://outoftheboxpodcast.com) where she interviews everyone who thinks \"outside of the box\" and bucks the mainstream way of living.\n\nDuring those eleven years she learned invaluable lessons, lessons which solopreneurs can take to heart and remember along their path. Nuggets like:\n\n\tTake the feedback you get, tweak it and gather more feedback. Eventually you'll hit your mark.\n\tIf you haven't eaten **it, you're not a real comedian (nor are you a real a solopreneur).

For the 193rd edition of The Solopreneur Hour we're revisiting my conversation with David Roth of Get Stirred Up. I'm bringing this one back because it is such a powerful hour-long chat about branding. If you're new to the show just know branding is the thing I stress so strongly to any solopreneur's business. If you nail your brand, the rest just flows.\n\nDavid is one of the world's premier experts on brand and brand positioning, so get your notepads or your Evernote out and get ready for this one! Even if you've heard it before, listen in again and see what new info you can apply to where you are today. Enjoy today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nToday's show focuses on branding and how to position your brand while maintaining its integrity in the marketplace at every level of growth. You know the big names like Nike, Apple, Twitter and the like, and how powerful their brands are. All you have to do is see their logo and you know the company and what it provides.\n\nThe same can be true, and should be true, for your company. If you really want to succeed and make a name for your solopreneur enterprise, then you have to brand properly.\n\nTo help us along in that process is David Roth. If you don't know David or his background check out Episode 8 of the show, we fill you in on who he is and what he's done. A quick recap is David holds a Master's degree in psychology from Harvard and has worked for several decades in the branding space. He is considered THE authority on branding, and positioning. He's the big time.\n\nDavid shares his personal experiences with branding his own companies and then later helping other big name companies brand or rebrand theirs. He is a self-proclaimed innovation activist, a serial entrepreneur and a cereal entrepreneur! He started the company Cereality, a cereal breakfast bar designed to make you feel like you're a ten year old on a Saturday morning. Their slogan? Eat Cereal.\nOn This Show You'll Also Hear:\n\n\tWhy Trader Joe's is a stellar example of branding, according to David.\n\tThe REAL purpose of your business cards.\n\tThe myth of job security for everyone, not just solopreneurs.\n\tPIP: what it stands for and how it relates to Bob Marley, David explains.\n\tHow to know you've chosen the right designer for your brand.\n\tAnd much, much more...\n\nCereality was eventually bought out by a franchising company and David owned a few businesses after that. Today he works with the most successful\u00a0companies in the world to make sure their branding hits the mark and stays on track as they grow and expand their markets. He also helps people take their \"ah ha!\" ideas, cement them in reality and bring them to life. He calls himself an innovation activist when he's leading others in that role.\n\nWe go into significant detail on the hows and the whys of branding, so we'll cover a few of those key points right now. To start with, David emphasizes a point I've made on this show many times: branding is not about your logo, your logo is only a small piece of the branding puzzle. At its core, branding is about how your company makes a person feel when he or she experiences your product or service.\n\nYour brand serves as an outline for the top and the bottom line of your business, everything you do, everything someone thinks of and associates with your company needs to fall within your brand as you've defined it...that's when you know you're brand is on point. Your brand is your promise to the world about how they will feel, what they will get, what they will experience and what they will be left with after interacting with your company.\n\nOne last point, and very important piece, is the four key pieces of branding that David and I talk about.\n\n\tThe\u00a0BRAND\u00a0Serves as the Outline\n\tThe\u00a0EXPERIENCE\u00a0Delivers the Results\n\tThe\u00a0CONVERSATION\u00a0Sustains the Promise\n\tThe\u00a0IDEA\u00a0STEWARDS\u00a0are Visible and Vigilant", "duration": "1:18:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/193.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "David Roth", "Guests", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Brand Experience", "Branding", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1416551422, "title": "192: Real Estate Ninja Tactics, A Touching Letter, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to the 192nd episode of The Solopreneur Hour.

Never heard of him? Don't worry you won't forget him after listening to this show.\n\nHe's spent his entire career zagging when everyone else was zigging, and is completely unapologetic for it. \u00a0Why should he be? He's built a tidy little empire, owns a dream loft, is deeply in love with his partner Karen, and has one of the most enviable Porsche collections in the world.\n\nHis career path has been forged in \"yes\", and \"let's try that\", never thinking of the repercussions. \u00a0This is a fascinating hour with fashion designer, movie set mogul, Porsche collector, and Tedx Speaker Magnus Walker. \u00a0Listen in and enjoy today's edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\n\nMagnus Walker has led one heck of an interesting life. He was born and raised just north of Sheffield, England, an area that has brought us musicians such as Def Leppard, Human League and Arctic Monkeys (among others). Although it was and still is a musical hotbed, it is an economically depressed town. Magnus saw very little opportunity for himself there and quit school at the age of 15.\nHaving grown up on American television and other American influences he moved to the States in 1986 and has made it his home. At the time he was living in Los Angeles and started selling clothing on the boardwalk in Venice, a fairly common and lucrative practice back then. He made patchwork jeans and sold them to the hippie-wannabes, he made Dr. Seuss Cat In The Hat-style hats for the ravers and sold glam rock style pants to the Melrose Boulevard rockers.\n\nAll of those experiences led to Serious Clothing, a rebellion masquerading as a clothing company. The company reflected Magnus' personality and values, and because it was an authentic reflection of him people responded. The clothing company became a hit, being sold everywhere from Six Flags and other amusement parks to Melrose fashion boutiques. Serious' success cemented the foundation for his future endeavors.\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\tWhat's Magnus' favorite question to ask about an opportunity?\n\tAmerica's Next Top Model was shot at his home: true or false?\n\tHow big is the loft we recorded in?\n\tWhat put him on the Porsche map?\n\tWho did he flip his first clothing buy to and how much was it?\n\tAnd much, much more...\n\nAnd one of those future endeavors is the loft we recorded at today. In 2000 he and his wife Karen bought an enormous warehouse where they could live and work. Before they bought the loft they were renting in two separate places and were tired of it, it simply made sense to invest this loft and make it their home. So they did, a year later they had finished the remodel on it and moved in.\n\nWithin a few months of doing so they were featured in an LA Times article about downtown loft spaces and the revival of that area. They were given a prominent focus in the article, and their phone soon began ringing with requests to rent the place for filming. Doing what he has always done, Magnus said yes and they were in business. Their first experience of doing so was a little rough, but the cash they made showed he and Karen the opportunity and possibilities in being a filming location. So they altered some things in their next agreement and were in business!\n\nWithin the next year they made so much money it became a serious financial pillar for them, and with their interest in the clothing industry waning they stopped Serious Clothing and focused on being a movie/TV/commercial filming spot; it was a leap of faith but that's been Magnus nature all along. They moved into a loft nearby to live, keeping their first loft as their business space.\n\nThe location biz took off for them and they were happy to have made the leap. Not long after Magnus started a thread on a web site called Pelican Parts, a site that dubs itself the largest source for Porsche and BMW parts.", "duration": "1:11:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/191.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Magnus Walker", "Man", "Men's Style", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Brand", "Collector", "Hollywood", "Icon", "LA Auto Show", "Porsche", "Solopreneur", "Urban Outlaw", "Vintage"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1416246844, "title": "190: Repurposing Your Evergreen Content, with Derek Halpern (BEST OF SOLOHOUR)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "See what I did there?! This show is the next iteration of my \"BEST OF\" series for The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nEvery once in a while, there's an episode that really sticks out for me. \u00a0I like to earmark that for a future \"Best Of\" episode and today fits that description. \u00a0This\u00a0show with Derek Halpern was so critical to the growth of the show, that I had to run it again.\n\nI hope you find as much value in it as I do, listen in and enjoy the 190th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nDerek Halpern of Socialtriggers\u00a0is bridging the gap between what science knows, and what business does. \u00a0At the heart of this is psychology, the universal key to every relationship, every yes or no you receive and pretty much everything that happens in the world!\n\nOn today's episode Derek and I talk about his passion for psychology and how it led him to develop Social Triggers. In college, as an English major, Derek read a blog written by a guy about stupid things he was doing while in college. Derek accidentally clicked on an advertising link\u00a0and found out the blogger was making some good money with his site. And the light bulb went off for him: he was a guy in college doing dumb stuff, he could create a blog doing the same thing! So he did. And for four months he wrote. And for four months no one read it.\n\nNot one to be deterred, Derek stumbled upon yet another popular blog: a celebrity blog site. That site was making even more money than the dumb-stuff-in-college guy so Derek followed in the footsteps of the celebrity blog site. That site was started in March of 2006, and by February of 2007 Derek was getting 2 million hits a month. 2 million hits a month translated into $20k in advertising revenue.\n\nBy the time he finished school he was only working a handful of hours every week and earning in 2.5 months what most of his friends were earning in a YEAR. He bought a place for himself and spent the next year traveling. But he was depressed; while most of his friends were earning paychecks and working full-time, he was trying to decide what to do with all of his time. So Derek decided to get a job; he took a sales analysis position with a Fortune 500 company. Instead of running TO entrepreneurship Derek ran away from it!\n\nThe next two years he tried to fit into corporate culture, only to realize he wasn't meant to fit in there. So at the end of those two years he jumped back into the entrepreneurship world and began building businesses again. Coming out of that was Social Triggers, a blog that's become a business. But its origins lie in psychology. As a poker player in college, Derek was fascinated by what made people tick. If you could \"read\" people, get to know them, you had a better chance of understanding their behaviors at the poker table.\n\nWhen he understood psychology wasn't just for the poker table, but for every aspect of life, Derek immersed himself in it. He read every book, every blog, every leader in the field and absorbed as much as he could. And then he took that knowledge and began Social Triggers. His entire strategy to building ST boils down to this: he built his audience, then launched a product. Then he went back to focus on building his audience, next relaunched his product. Repeat, repeat, repeat.\n\nWithin a year of following that formula he had over 27,000 subscribers on his blog. And he says you can apply it for your business to get the same results. The key to doing it so quickly?\u00a0Repurposing content you already have and promoting it. Derek explains in more detail on this show.\n\nHe also explains what he calls the \"drafting technique\", it's how you can leverage other people's audiences to grow your own audience. There's a link to his video in the Resources section below. The video explains how to find people who are bloggers, podcasters, journalists on your topic, how to connect with them and\u00a0then draft behind the fact that they write about your topic and get them to promote you to their audience....", "duration": "1:12:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/190.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Derek Halpern", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Video Marketing", "Best Of", "Zippy Courses"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1415955436, "title": "189: Customer Service Fails, and a Plethora of Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Why, hello Solopreneurs!

Matt spends his days helping others with that company, Isagenix, and does what he does because he believes in sowing the seeds of tomorrow.\n\nAt this point in his career Matt doesn't need to work for money, instead he works to help other people make a living. He understands, as he explains it, that every dollar he has ever made has come from someone else. Money is never created, nor destroyed it simply moves from Point A to Point B. He helps people make themselves Point B!\n\nBut what prepared him to be where he is today were his past experiences, including his time in the Navy. On today's show Matt talks about his 12 years in service. We discuss boot camp and what it's really like, it's not what you'd expect based on movies. And how the psychological testing his instructors used helped prepare him for his time on a naval carrier. He was stationed on the JFK and did three tours on the carrier, that's three tours of being out at sea on a boat in the middle of the ocean!\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\n\tWhat's different about how we treat our veterans today?\n\tHow much truth is there to the depiction of war in movies?\n\tJob security is where, according to Matt?\n\tWhat's the\u00a0definition of rich?\n\tThe difference between a philanthropist and an activist.\n\tAnd loads\u00a0more!\n\nAccording to Matt doing so was a lot like being a solopreneur. When you're on a boat in the middle of nowhere you can't call FedEx to have something delivered to help you, you have to figure it out and make it happen with whatever resources you have at your disposal.\n\nMany of us have had the same experience during our solopreneur journeys: if we don't have unlimited time or money (an unlikely event for anyone), we have to figure things out with what we've got, do our best and pray it works.\u00a0It's that kind of fortitude and ingenuity that helped Matt become so successful later in the corporate world and then eventually with his present day Isagenix business.\n\nAnother trait Matt acquired while in the Navy is perspective. He learned how to view circumstances as simply part of the experience, and not the defining characteristic of an event. He discovered how to see the trees within the forest and vice versa. That's a long-winded way of explaining the Navy taught him to not let anything get in his way! Everything is figure-out-able, especially when you take on that perspective in a situation. Clearly that's also an incredibly valuable trait to have as a solopreneur.\n\nMatt and I go into greater detail on his time with the Navy, including some Top Gun and Tom Cruise talk, before switching gears to the wide world of audio. Matt is a true audiophile as you'll hear on today's show as well as previous episodes.\n\nWe spend a good amount of time talking about which brands are best if you're just getting into audio, including some of the basics you'll need for a great sound system on a smaller budget. Matt gives us the low-down on what company to buy what gear from, as well as numerous resources to use on the web.\n\nWhether you're talking audio equipment,", "duration": "1:31:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/188.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Matt Rockwell", "Musicians", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Audiophile", "Navy", "Veterans Day"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1415424544, "title": "187: Becoming More Productive with The Productivityist, Mike Vardy", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As solopreneurs it's up to us to choose\u00a0how and when we work on our business or our side projects. This\u00a0can be a blessing and a curse because\u00a0some of us can organize ourselves and our time\u00a0while others of us need help. But no matter how organized we are (or not), we can always be better. And we can always be more productive with our time.\n\nHere to share his expertise on the subject is Mr. Productive himself Mike Vardy. Mike is the proud owner of Productivityist, the company as well as author of the book The Productivityist Workbook, Beyond Trying and The Now Year. He also just wrapped up co-hosting a podcast called Work Flowing.\n\nJoin us to hear what he has to say on productivity, comedy and how both of those topics relate to being a successful solopreneur on the 187th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This Show\nWhen Mike first explored productivity he was working at Costco, for any of you not in the US Costco is a giant warehouse where you buy things in bulk at a discount. In his job there he was running two departments. And since that wasn't nearly enough for him, he got back into sketch and improv comedy when a friend suggested Mike join him. Mike had been in comedy earlier in his life and the bug bit him again that night.\n\nAt that point Mike was juggling two departments at Costco,\u00a0and when he wasn't working he was practicing or performing comedy of some variety. That's when he began to explore the concept of productivity, it soon emerged as yet a third ball he was juggling. When his daughter was born not long after, Mike realized he didn't want to be on the road. He wanted to be at home with his baby girl. Traveling for comedy had to go, and it was quickly replaced by productivity.\n\nUsing his performance skills honed in the comedy world, he began writing about and discussing something he called eventualism. Eventualism was the idea that if you do what Mike was sharing eventually you'll get around to finishing your task/project/goal. It was all tongue-in-cheek ala Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Show and it worked. He was able to interview people like David Allen and Seth Godin.\n\nIn fact it worked so well that David asked Mike to write for his site and Mike did. From there their relationship continued to grow and David eventually hired Mike to be a part of his team. Although he enjoyed what he was doing for them Mike realized he had become what he had been parodying with eventualism, and so he went back to his roots of productivity.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\n\tCan you schedule productivity?\n\tAre productivity and efficiency the same thing according to Mike?\n\tWhy Evernote is not enough.\n\tWhat is The Bullet in comedy and how does it relate to solopreneurship?\n\tHow systems actually help you do more, with less.\n\tAnd loads\u00a0more!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMike shares that journey with us on today's show as well as some tips he has for making the most of your time and becoming the most productive you can be. One of the tips he has is to chunk your time. Set aside blocks of time to work on particular tasks and schedule this at least a few days in advance so when that time block arrives you've already made an agreement with yourself to do, and you can't get out of it.\n\nHe suggests creating themes for your days, if possible. Make Monday your administrative day where you handle all the administrative tasks that you need to do for your business. There's nothing else allowed to happen on that day, only admin-related tasks and projects. Doing so will keep you fresh and energized because it won't feel like you're doing the same thing day in and day out.\n\nRelated to creating themes and chunking your time is the question of whether or not you can actually schedule productivity for yourself. Mike's view is that if you approach your work with a task-based mindset versus a time-based mindset you'll be far more productive.\n\nSo scheduling a day for tasks like administrative work works better than sch...", "duration": "1:07:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/187.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Comedian", "Man", "Mike Vardy", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Author", "podcast", "Productivity", "Small Business"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1415385113, "title": "186: Finishing 2014 Strong, How To Start Racing, And Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to the 186th edition of The Solopreneur Hour!

We chat about how he became unemployable, why Jeff says failure is part of the process (including his own experience with failing) as well as his suggestions for making that leap into solopreneurship.\n\nYou'll find some killer nuggets on this one, enjoy the show!\n\nMore About This Show\nJeff's leap into Unemployable Land came in April of 2012. He left his corporate job in technology when he realized he didn't want the life his boss had.\u00a0Jeff saw how miserable his boss was and realized all he was doing was working his way towards the life his boss had.\n\nNot wanting to be miserable, Jeff saw entrepreneurship as the way out. It had always been something he tinkered with on the side throughout his career but he finally walked away from Corporate America that spring. For the next 5-6 weeks he was riding high! He threw himself into launching a program online, he had been studying Jeff Walker, and was stoked to get his product out into the world.\n\nHis launch date came and he released his program...to the sound of crickets. His launch had failed. Looking back it was clear to Jeff why it hadn't worked: he had created his program while in a bubble. He hadn't reached out to the people he was supposed to be serving with his product so he had no idea if his idea would really work. He had worked on it and launched it while in a vacuum, and his results were a direct reflection of that vacuum.\n\nNot one to be deterred, not even after he and his business partner and friend parted ways in the fall of that same year, Jeff rethought his strategy the next time around. He now understood he needed to talk with the people he wanted to serve and find out what their needs are and how he could best serve them. So that's what he did: he found the people he had intended to serve with his first product and actually talked with them. He discovered who they were, what they were dealing with and listened for their pain points so he could offer better solutions this time around.\n\nThe Finer Details of This Show Include:\n\n\n\tWhy you don't have to be a millionaire to be successful.\n\tThe shifts Jeff made to be more disciplined, and how you can apply them.\n\tWhy he didn't give up after he failed out of the gate.\n\tWhat's the cardinal mistake most people make when launching their first program?\n\tIs everyone capable of being a solopreneur? Jeff weighs in...\n\tAnd loads\u00a0more!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn December of 2012 he started giving away content to that same group, sharing knowledge with them that would help them grow and achieve their goals. And if they wanted more of that same content he set up a 6-week coaching program they could participate in. In January he enrolled a handful of people in that program and he was on his way.\n\nSome of the lessons he and I both want you to take away from his experience are to know failure is part of your process and progress (if you're failing, you're on your path) and that things rarely work well the first time. Jeff says failure should be viewed like a scientist views his or her hypothesis: create an idea and call it a hypothesis, then test out your hypothesis. If it doesn't work (ie it fails), then create another hypothesis. When you approach your business idea like a hypothesis you'll stop seeing failure as a bad thing, and see it as an experiment that didn't quite work out.\n\nWe discuss several other topics today but one we'll touch on here is how to stop working, when you're ready. Jeff gives us a couple of keystone steps to take and they are:\n\n1.

During a 3 day car tour (called a \"Targa\") in Mexico, I had a chance to sit down with \u00a0Steve Foster of SWB Studios, Radu Muntean of Tesla, and Dave Bouzaglou of TRE Motorsports,\u00a0\u00a0one of the premier Porsche tuning and restoration shops in America.\n\nThe theme of episode 184 is \"passion\". \u00a0Oh...and going 150 mph in front of the Federales! Have a listen for all of that and more on today's show.\nMore About This Show\nOne of the greatest things about being a solopreneur is doing what you want, when you want and with whomever you want. And I had that chance yet again this weekend at Targa California.\nOn other episodes I've talked about the restoration process and the man hours that went into preparing my Porsche 911 for this trip, and I give you an additional update today. But in essence I crammed what should have been a 6-month project into 3 weeks; I burned the midnight oil more than a few times!\n\nMy Porsche definitely was and is a passion of mine, and cars are a passion for the three men you're about to hear. First we talk with Steve Foster of SWB Studios. For his entire life, Steve has been an artist. But it wasn't until\u00a0his mid-20s that he started earning a living as one. He had always doodled as a child but in his mid-20s a friend asked him to create a rendering of his Ducati (a high end motorcycle). \u00a0His friend paid him and Steve saw a viable business opportunity.\nOver the next few years people began to come back to him for additional renderings and they also referred their friends to him. Steve knew he was doing something right when that happened! By the age of 30 SWB Studios was born and has continued to thrive. Today Steve makes gorgeous renderings for people primarily using watercolors. His renderings are so detailed and life-like you have to study them to see that they aren't photographs! They're incredible.\nOur second guest on today's show is Radu Muntean, a car designer for Tesla Motors. Radu is a Romanian native who immigrated to Los Angeles. And like Steve, he has been an artist his entire life. In fact he says he's been drawing so long he can't remember when he began! And he's been fascinated by cars almost the same length of time. Growing up in Romania there weren't any new, flashy cars; they were a Communist country at the time so all they had were old cars from the US and Russian cars. But Romania did have one automotive publication and Radu collected as many copies of it has he could.\n\nAnd he studied the cars; in fact, he studied anything he could get his hands on about cars. Almost intuitively\u00a0he combined both of his passions and started drawing cars. Naturally\u00a0he went to school for automotive design - he says he wasn't good enough at anything else! But clearly when you hear him speak on today's episode you'll hear that automotive design was and is a passion of his. Today he's one of a few thousand people in the world who work in his field and he's fortunate enough to work for Tesla Motors.\n\nThe Finer Details of The Show Include:\n\n\tWhat were everyone's favorite parts of the trip?\n\tWhat are Steve's two sources for retirement investments?\n\tRadu shares how long it takes to actually design a car.\n\tThe Porsche Singer 911: Radu discusses designing it.\n\tWhen did Dave hold the first Targa California?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nFor our third and final chat I talk with Dave Bouzaglou. Dave is the owner and proprietor of TRE Motorsports in Los Angeles, CA. Keeping with the theme of today's show Dave is a passionate auto enthusiast. He grew up racing cars with his friends in the twisty hills of Mulholland Drive. And one day one of his friends suggested they get a resale number and start buying parts wholesale. Dave say an opportunity: he knew if he could buy parts wholesale, he could sell them to his friends with a slight upgrade and make some cash. So that's what he did.", "duration": "1:26:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/184.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Artist", "Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Porsche", "TRE Motorsports"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1414739142, "title": "183: Targa Baja California, Dogs Named O\u2019Neill, and Your Questions Answered", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Here we are again with another installment of The Solopreneur Hour!

He is back on the show to talk about the process, from start to finish, he went through to create his new vitamin line, Pure Vitamin Club.\n\nThis show is a perfect example of how a solopreneur can create an entire brand and product based in an industry they know so well. \u00a0He's done a fantastic job with it, and he modeled Trader Joe's and Dollar Shave Club in process. \u00a0Listen in to find out how.\nMore About This Show\nFor those of you who may be new to the show or have missed Vinnie's previous visits, find out more about him here.\u00a0To quickly recap who Vinnie is (and why we love him at TSH so much) you need to know he's the co-host of The World's Angriest podcast with our other friend of the show Anna Vocino. And when he's not putting out top quality episodes, he's training celebrities to get fit and stay healthy.\n\nFor over 20 years Vinnie has worked as a personal trainer and he's well known in the Hollywood circuit for his ability to dramatically impact people's health and well-being. Vinnie is the co-author of Fitness Confidential, a book he wrote with the talented Dean Lowery who has also been on the show. While accomplishing all of that, Vinnie has also survived cancer and is an avid cyclist (bicycle, not motorcycle). It's clear his commitment to health is a thread throughout every area of his life.\n\nThroughout the last few decades he's wanted to create the ultimate multivitamin for people, something that didn't cost an arm and a leg but still provided everything the human body needs and nothing it doesn't. So he's been studying minerals, vitamins and what we need versus what we don't in the vitamins previously available. He's never been able to find the ideal vitamin so 15 months ago he decided to make his own line.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tWhat is Vinnie's percentage of failures vs. successes?\n\tFitness Confidential has been optioned to become a TV show: true or false?\n\tWhat has always been Vinnie's \"religion\"?\n\tWho makes a guest appearance on this episode?\n\tInitially how many bottles of vitamins did he have to order?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nAnd in case you hadn't copped on to his solopreneurial perspective, this is where you'll really see it: he leveraged the proceeds from Fitness Confidential to launch his vitamin line. One of the rules of thumb we've talked about on the show is to take a percentage of your profits and put them back into your business. In Vinnie's case he went all in, because he has income from other sources. You may not be able to do exactly that, but you should always be leveraging some of your business' profits to expand and advance your offerings.\n\nOnce Vinnie had decided he was going to create his vitamin line and he had the funding, his next step was to find the best form available for all of his ingredients. He figured out how to source it all and then how to create the ideal formula with those ingredients. From there he set about creating a pricing structure that would be affordable for everyone, not just the wealthiest among us.\n\nHere's where he used another solopreneurial tactic: he looked at other companies who are doing it right, doing business the way he wants to and he modeled his vitamin line after them. He looked at Trader Joe's, a company that makes quality food and wines available for everyone. He looked at The Dollar Shave Club, a company that took an expensive product (quality razors) and made them affordable for all. Using those two companies as his inspiration, Vinnie made his vitamins affordable and available for anyone who wants them.\n\nOnce all the pieces of the puzzle were in place and the vitamins were ready to be released, he and Dean did a soft launch for the company. Vinnie had talked about his vitamins a few times on his podcast previously and he let his listeners know as soon as the vitamins could be purchased.", "duration": "1:21:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/182.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Guests", "Health", "Man", "Podcast", "Vinnie Tortorich", "Beauty", "Dean Lorey", "Fitness", "Product Launch", "Small Business", "Vitamins"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1414387854, "title": "181: How To Become a Solopreneur, Step-by-Step, with Jessica Shaanan", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "On episode 10 of The Solopreneur Hour, we talked about the 8 Steps to Becoming a Solopreneur. \u00a0I thought it would be good for you guys to see what it was like for someone to be going through the process, live, and see what we can learn.\n\nThe subject at hand is Jessica Shaanan, who currently works for her father's design firm, but is quickly becoming unemployable. \u00a0We chat about her career, and where she is on the timeline with the 8 Steps to becoming a Solopreneur.\nMore About This Show\nLet's walk through each of the eight steps, how Jessica is using each and how you can too.\n\n1. Find your passion.\nEveryone has a passion, something they want to do to leave their mark on the world. For Jessica it's health and wellness, from healthy eating to personal well-being.\n\nHealthy eating is something she's studying right now at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition; she'll be a certified coach when she's finished. She's also building an Isagenix business through IsaLab. Well-being is a far broader spectrum, but for her it includes having a daily spiritual/grounding practice as well as being a certified yogini. She's exploring how her varied interests in this area will become a part of her brand.\n\n2. Immerse yourself in the culture.\nFor Jessica this has meant going to various conferences, both for her current work and for her future business. From Yoga Journal conferences to medical conferences, attending events like these expose her to new ideas, new people and new ways of being.\n\nFor other solopreneurs immersing yourself in a culture will\u00a0also means going to events and learning everything you can both in the online and the offline world about your interest and your focus.\n\n3. Seek knowledge.\nThis one goes hand in hand with number 2. By immersing yourself in a culture you will be gaining tons and tons of knowledge. Jessica has done this by reading the Sexy Six, earning her coaching certification and learning from people around her. This is also where something called \"proof of concept\" comes into play. Look\u00a0for others who are doing what you are doing: how have they been successful? What do they bring to the world that you can learn from?\n\n4. Make a decision and take action.\u00a0\nYou'll never have all the knowledge, you'll never have everything perfectly mapped out so jump in and make a decision to take action once you've worked through the previous three steps. Jessica has done this by joining IsaLab and taking coaching courses. She realized she has a lot of various passions and interests, but by taking action she'll put the pieces together along the way.\n\nHow you decide to do this will look different based on your business idea, but at the end of the day the bottom line\u00a0remains the same: make a decision and take action.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. Surround yourself with leaders.\nFind people who are doing what you want to do and connect with them, both online and in person. Take their courses, read their books, follow them on Twitter, join their Facebook groups, etc. And when possible, attend events and get to know them in the flesh. If you have more time than money, offer your time to someone you want to learn from and make yourself available to them. Soon you will be invaluable to that person.\n\nJessica has surrounded herself with leaders, even from other field, but people who\u00a0are still leaders in other areas. She's listened to them and is applying their strategies to her own path.\n\n6. Take more action.\nThis is where many of us stop. We think by joining groups, going to events and taking classes we're doing enough. But there is always more action to take.\n\nJessica has started the branding process and is creating her avatar, a vital step for any solopreneur. If you want to find your avatar you need to think of and create one specific person you will be serving with your business. Mentally create this person for yourself, they are your ideal client.

We may start out in one field and find success in another area, an industry we hadn't previously worked in. Our guest for today's show is the perfect example of this.\n\nJoining us today is the man\u00a0who created the first ever Go Daddy commercial, Paul Cappelli. Paul cut his teeth in the advertising world for several decades, including operating the international Ad Store. Today operates an olive oil-producing villa in Italy.\n\nOn the\u00a0179th episode of The Solopreneur Hour we talk about his time in the ad world and how he found himself renovating a 20,000 square foot villa in Italy that is today called Villa Cappelli.\nMore About This Show\nWhen Paul first started in advertising it was\u00a0near the end of the Mad Men-era, the late 1970s. In those early days he began as a copywriter and quickly worked his way up to Executive Creative Director for\u00a0Coca-Cola. His talent spoke for him and he eventually found himself with notable career stops at places like BBDO and Saachi &\u00a0Saachi (two of the biggest agencies in the world).\nHe spent 18 months with Saachi & Saachi before moving on to create his own advertising company, Ad Store. He teamed up with a former client from Coca-Cola because he wanted to get back to the basics; he wanted to focus on the work and nothing else.\n\nTogether they created what is now an internationally-linked group of ad shops. Though not a franchise, the shops are all under license and work together to create advertising for clients around the globe.\n\nIt was with the Ad Store that Paul was first linked up with Go Daddy. Bob Parsons, their CEO at the time, came to Paul and his team and wanted them to create a Super Bowl ad for his company. A few weeks later Paul's team pitched Bob several ideas, none of which he liked. They went back to the drawing board and Bob later opened up the field to another advertising agency. Paul's team now had competition to land the campaign.\n\nThey got it the second time around and ran with the concept. As often happens in the world of advertising and breakthrough branding, Go Daddy got cold feet about running the suggestive ad (it played off the previous year's Janet Jackson nipple incident). It was only after hearing some TV commentators who had previewed the ads, including Go Daddy's, that Bob felt comfortable going ahead with it. But little did everyone know, the controversy was just beginning.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tWhy did the Go Daddy commercial only run once?\n\tHow Absolut vodka became famous.\n\tGreat commercials come around every decade or so: true or false?\n\tHow 9/11 led to his purchase of the villa.\n\tWhat's a procedural?\n\t\u00a0How to buy quality olive oil: Paul's tips.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe ad aired at halftime of the Super Bowl and it created a massive response. So many flocked to Go Daddy's web site that their servers crashed! But the ad was supposed to be shown twice: during halftime and at the two-minute warning. Go Daddy had paid big bucks for that air time and yet they were left out at the two-minute warning.\nEventually they were told that the NFL pulled the commercial, the other big advertisers (like Budweiser, Ford, etc) were angry that Go Daddy's concept made it in and theirs didn't. Go Daddy was given their money back plus the cost of production. And it was still a win for them, they went from having no presence in the public's mind to being talked about by nearly everyone.\n\nAccording to Paul that's the power of advertising. And the only way advertising sticks in people's minds is if the brand itself is solid. Today we talk about branding and why it's so vital. In fact, branding has become such a part of who Paul is that the first time he stepped inside what is now Villa Cappelli\u00a0his first thought was \"This isn't a home, it's a brand\". He didn't know what that brand was, but he knew that villa could become one and he was the one to deve...", "duration": "1:12:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/179.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Health", "Man", "Paul Cappelli", "Podcast", "Social Media", "1984 Apple Commercial", "Godaddy", "Healthy Food", "Olive Oil", "Superbowl Ad", "Villa Cappelli"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1413785524, "title": "178: Modeling iTunes and Scaling Yourself with Professional Drummer Mike Johnston (encore)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey everyone, welcome to the 178th episode of The Solopreneur Hour! I was listening to a few of the older episodes of the show and realized that many of you haven't heard some of the early epis. This is one of my favorites, and a MUST LISTEN if you have a business that you'd like to scale.\n\nOne of the great things about doing this show is getting to talk to incredible, successful, cool and innovative Solopreneurs. \u00a0Today is no exception. Mike Johnston of Mike's Lessons\u00a0has taken one of the most common service jobs (a music teacher) and turned it into a 6-figure per month business. He may be the only true \"Drummerpreneur\" I know and I was stoked to have him on the show.\u00a0I hope you enjoy this encore performance!\nMore About This Show\nIn this episode with Mike Johnston we discuss his background, his love of teaching (and how it's greater than his love of drumming) and how he took his drumming lessons business from a typical trading-time-for-dollars gig and turned it into a full-on scalable business. Mike shares with us his lifelong passion for learning, helping others and making an impact in the world.\nOnce we catch up a bit, this chat really digs into the nuts and bolts of creating your business and scaling yourself. \u00a0When he was still a teenager, his dad had a heart-to-heart chat with him about his future. Mike told his dad he wanted to be a drummer and his dad supported him, so long as Mike promised he would make a career out of it and create a real life for himself. Mike agreed and he took his first drum job as an instructor in a local drumming store.\n\nHe continued on that path improving his technique and his skills hour after hour on a daily basis. He also discovered the tremendous joy and satisfaction he got from seeing his students grow in their abilities.\u00a0He was also drumming with a band and looking for that musician's dream of landing\u00a0a record deal. When that wish came true for his band, he wrote albums with them and toured around the world.\n\nBut something was missing for him. He didn't get the same joy and fulfillment from touring that his bandmates did, he missed teaching. With one album remaining on their recording contract, Mike made the seemingly risky decision to leave and go back to being a drumming instructor. He promised his bandmates he would find someone to replace him, someone of his caliber who shared their dream of creating music and touring. And that's what he did; he walked away from a good chunk of change to pursue his passion of being a teacher.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tWhat's the biggest audience he ever played for?\n\tWhy did he once play at an NA meeting?\n\tWhat is his Plan B?\n\tHow a Cubs game shifted his business.\n\tThe best business decisions he ever made were influenced by what?\n\tAnd SO much more...\n\nHe was giving\u00a0private teaching lessons again when the solopreneurial bug bit him by accident. He was doing weekend gigs on occasion and when he did, he often had to miss his Friday drum lessons. So he created videos for his students and posted them on YouTube. This was back in 2009 when YouTube was in its infancy stages. He had to direct the students' parents to the site, explain to them that it was a file sharing web site and was completely safe.\n\nHis \"ah-ha\" moment came when he began to see his viewing stats grow exponentially. At first his videos, which was given to\u00a04 or 5 students, \u00a0would be watched by 5,000 people in the first week he released them. Then that number grew to 10,000 then 50,000 and\u00a0eventually he had a few videos that had several million views. Mike saw those numbers and realized he was providing value, that's why so many people were viewing his videos.\n\nInstead of going for the kill right there, he continued to add value to his audience. He produced video after video until he had around 20,000 subscribers. He thought if he could get 10% of those subscribers to follow him he'd be on to something. Mike began selling additional videos for $1.", "duration": "1:24:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/178.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Guests", "Man", "Mike Johnston", "Musicians", "Podcast", "Drum Lesson", "Drum Magazine", "Drummer", "Interview", "modern drummer"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1413529947, "title": "177: Dealing with Haters, Creative Live Unveiled, New Podcasting Kits, and Your Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hi all!

To a certain extinct I think we (myself included) use interviewing as a crutch when our audience wants to hear us. It's like when your favorite artist release a new LP and over half of the songs have features \"I DIDNT BUY YOUR ALBUM TO HEAR EVERYONE ELSE, I BOUGHT IT TO HEAR YOU!!!\" Am I off base with this thinking? Thanks man and I can definitely vouch for you with picking up tabs, you did SoloLab right in Dallas.\n\n\u2028\u2028Rey Brown\u00a0\nI copied and pasted that ? From last week.

Not only am I joined by three friends and veterans of the show but all four of us are coming to you via Creative Live. John, Greg, Nick and myself are talking podcasting and giving our individual input on how to podcast, how to monetize podcasting and how to make a legitimate living doing so.\n\nIt is an honor and a privilege to have these guys on the show and to be side by side with them for Creative Live. To find out exactly what Creative Live is and to listen in on our pre-Creative Live dinner conversation and a whole lot more, join us for\u00a0the 176th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nOriginally our friend of the show Mr. John Lee Dumas was invited to join Alex Blumberg (formerly of NPR) to Creative Live. Alex was doing two days of material on podcasting, and he invited John to spend the first day opening for him. And John, being the generous and savvy man he is, invited the three of us to\u00a0take a segment of that first day.\u00a0And that's how Nick, Greg and myself came to be on Creative Live.\nWe each will do a 90-minute session on a different aspect of podcasting and are all stoked for it! Greg will speak on the topic of using mobile technology in the podcasting world. He's also preparing to launch a product in early November and is going full speed ahead after taking time off for his honeymoon. Today he shares what he gets excited about in his working life and how he unplugs.\nOur other guest, John Lee Dumas, will be talking about starting a podcast and monetizing it on his segment of Creative Live. And on this show he discusses his approach to work/life balance: he says he's either all in or all out! There's no medium range with him during the workday.\nAnd our \u00a0third guest, Nick Unsworth, is talking about video podcasting for Creative Live. He'll dive into the differences between video and regular podcasting. He's spent 9 months learning the good, the bad and the ugly. He'll talk about the massive mistakes he made and how you can avoid them!\nFor example, video podcasts are much bigger than audio podcasts so if you host them via Libsyn it's going to take a lot more bandwidth...and it will cost a LOT more. The other snag he ran into was getting fast downloads for people; the video files were too big in the beginning and it would take forever to download! He learned some great \"not to dos\" and tells us what they are.\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tHow do we step away from business, when there's still work to do?\n\tWho have I only recorded in person with, never on Skype?\n\tThe advantages of video podcasting, and how much more work it is.\n\tWhy you need to celebrate and reward yourself.\n\tWhat's the \"you know how\" approach and how can you use it?\n\tWhich of the four of us was on the Price Is Right?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\n\nWe also talk about how to master your calendar. Each of us have different strategies. Nick and I give ourselves extra time to explore and take some down time when we travel for business. John is adopting this strategy with Entrepreneur on Fire in the upcoming months and he shares with us a breakdown of what he does each day of the week too.\nOn a related note, Greg asks John how he chooses which event he speaks at it. John says if it's not a \"Hell yes!\" then it's a no. But that's where he is at with his business right now, when he was starting out he did anything and everything to drive his business forward. You need to say yes and build momentum, but once you have it then you use the \"hell yes\" approach to qualify each event.\nJohn goes on to give the example of Derek Halpern who did 100 presentations in 2013! He did it because he figured he'd get a ton of benefit out of it. But looking back, he saw he didn't get anything substantial out of it and completely reconfigured his 2014. Now he only does things that are scalable and can be leveraged, which is the same approach John is taking for events in 2015.", "duration": "1:10:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/176.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Greg Hickman", "Internet Marketing", "John Lee Dumas", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Nick Unsworth", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Video Marketing", "Creative Live", "Training"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1413222067, "title": "175: Jimmy Kimmel LIVE with Anna Vocino", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Returning for episode 175 of The Solopreneur Hour is our friend and co-host, the fantastically talented voiceover artist Ms. Anna Vocino.\n\nWhile I always love having co-hosts return, today's episode with Anna is extra special. Last week, Jimmy Kimmel LIVE did a funny skit: \"If SIRI Was a Waitress\". \u00a0A friend of mine sent it to me, and the first thing I said was \"Holy Sh*t, that's Anna Vocino as Siri!\". \u00a0I had to dig into how that happened, and how one gets a gig on live TV with Jimmy Kimmel. \u00a0Tune in to check it out on the 175th edition of The Solopreneur Hour!\nMore About This Show\nFor those of you who haven't heard Anna on the show before, listen to her previous episodes here. Anna is a professional voiceover artist and actress living in Los Angeles. We met through our mutual friend Abel James at NMX in 2014. Anna co-hosts a podcast with another friend of the show Mr. Vinnie Tortorich. Vinnie was also there the night I met Anna.\nSince then we've been on each other's shows and become friends. She joins us today to talk about how she got involved with the Jimmy Kimmel Show and the now-viral Siri as a waitress skit. We also chat about her experience becoming the voice for ABC's TGIT (Thank God It's Thursday) promotions, her take on the gender disparity in the voiceover world and the parallels between rebuilding my Porsche and being a solopreneur.\nOn the subject of her skit on Jimmy Kimmel, Anna says she originally turned down the part! And she did so strictly out of fear. She was terrified to do the skit live; shortly after she said no the show contacted her again and said she was the only one who could do it and they needed her. She agreed and the project was a go. She called her husband (who was a writer on the show until May of 2014) and he walked her through the process and calmed her nerves a bit.\nBut she didn't tell anyone else after she talked to her husband; years of experience in the industry have taught her that projects don't always work out the way you think. Sometimes things get shelved, they get cut, they go horribly wrong or they're awesome and go viral; but you never know what the results are until the project is actually out in the public domain. But this skit did go viral and Anna's been all over the Interwebs as Siri!\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tHow does she keep her spirits up despite rejection?\n\tWhy she wants to be under contract.\n\tShe's been the vocal stand-in for Sarah Jessica Parker: true or false?\n\tThe nitty-gritty on how a TV show pilot gets made.\n\tWhat's a procedural?\n\tWho Don LaFontaine was and Anna's experience working with him.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShe says the Siri viral experience hasn't changed things much for her though; it's still business as usual in her household. And one of those business as usual pieces is her voiceover work for ABC. This is a gig she had worked on the previous summer and continues to work on, she does anywhere from 1-4 voiceovers for ABC and their promotions for their Thursday night TV shows.\nBut not only is it a household TV network that she's on, by landing this gig she has become one of the first female voiceovers for a network. Pay attention the next time you're watching TV and an ad comes on for upcoming episodes of a show, you'll most likely hear a man doing the voiceover work.\n\nGender disparity is just one of the difficult aspects of being a voiceover artist, she says you can also be aged-out. As you age, so does your voice and you can be told you're too old for parts. On top of being rejected for those reasons, voiceover artists also face just regular old rejection. To make it in the voiceover world you must consistently hustle for work. It is definitely a solopreneurial world: you need to grind it out day after day despite rejection, you need a real passion for what you're doing in order to be successful and it takes a different mindset.\n\nAnother topic we discuss is the correlation between being a solopreneur and the...", "duration": "1:09:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/175.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Anna Vocino", "Car Racing", "Guests", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "ABC", "Grey's Anatomy", "Hollywood", "Jimmy Kimmel", "SIRI", "Voiceover"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1412921119, "title": "174: The Future of Solopreneur Hour, My Favorite Birthday Present Ever, and Your Questions Answered.", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Once again, we're at the Friday Q&amp;A weekly episode of The Solopreneur Hour! \u00a0Every Wednesday or Thursday, I request your questions on the Proudly Unemployable group, then read 'em on today's show!\n\nOn this show, I recap the Denver trip, including #planecast with John Lee Dumas and lesson after lesson about why you must say YES.

Her passion has truly become her solopreneurial venture. \u00a0Ms. Allie Lochiatto!\n\nA fun aspect of being a solopreneur and working from wherever you want is being able to dress down or dress up, as it suits you. No need for ties and suits every day for the gents or stockings and heels for the ladies - unless you choose! On episode 24 with JJ Collier we talked about how to be a fashion forward guy, whether you're still rockin' the cubicle world or working from the beach.\n\nToday we've got the female equivalent joining us\u00a0to give fashion tips for females and to talk about what it's like to run one of the most successful fashion blogs on the Internet today: fashion blogger and model Ms. Allie Lochiatto\u00a0of AllieWears.com. Specifically in the 173rd episode of The Solopreneur Hour we talk about basic fashion do's and don'ts for the ladies, how Allie's blog got started and where she plans to go with it and what it's like to be a fashion model...and plenty more!\nMore About This Show\nToday Allie is a top fashion blogger, burgeoning model and fashion consultant.\u00a0Although she's had an interest in fashion her entire life, she toiled away in the corporate world until 2012 when\u00a0she started blogging on the topic. And the success and popularity of her blog led to her current modeling and consulting opportunities.\nShe hails from Boston, home of the Red Sox, Good Will Hunting and, according to GQ magazine,\u00a0the city with the worst fashion in all of the United States. The child of two artists, Allie has always had an interest in fashion. As a child she dressed to express herself but lost sight of that in high school. In college, Allie found her stride again and recalls wearing pencil skirts and heels to keg parties. Often, she was the best-dressed person at the party.\n\nGraduating with a degree in math (yes really), she had difficulty finding work after college. Not finding any job in her field after a few months, Allie and a friend traveled around the West Coast for six months. Returning to Boston, she soon landed a gig as a business analyst at a consulting firm. She toiled in those trenches until just a few years ago when she began her fashion blog, Allie Wears.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tWhat Boston-based movie did she just recently watch?\n\tWould she ever be a full-time blogger?\n\tWhy and when she's learning to say no.\n\tThe secrets to grooming like a model\n\tAllie's favorite inspirational quote: what is it?\n\tWhy it's okay to be vulnerable as a blogger.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nFinally following her spirit and her passion of fashion, Allie began her blog as a place to talk about fashion, post pics of her favorite fashion wears and generally express her sentiments about her favorite hobby: fashion. On the blog, Allie takes shots of her own outfits, as well as other people's (with their permission of course). She's learned some of the basics of modeling by doing so; she's learned how to stand, how to angle herself, where to position her feet, etc.\n\nShe's also grown a tremendous following in the process. In March of 2014 she had 10,000 unique visitors per month, and as of October 2014 she's up to 50,000. That kind of exposure brought her to the attention of Maggie, Inc., one of Boston's top modeling agencies. Allie has been diligently working with them and landing new gigs and finding her footing in the modeling world. A rare occurrence for a woman of 27, Allie is taking full advantage of the opportunity and rockin' her new solopreneurial journey!\n\nOn this show,", "duration": "1:02:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/173.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Allie Lochiatto", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Fitness & Health", "Man", "Men's Style", "Podcast", "Woman", "Blogger", "Entrepreneur", "Fashion", "Model", "Modeling", "Solopreneur", "Women"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1412568589, "title": "172: Planecast with John Lee Dumas", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "This episode is a first for The Solopreneur Hour: \u00a0we're coming to you live from 30,000 feet in the air! And my co-host for today is another first, he's our first five-time guest, Mr. John Lee Dumas of Entrepreneur on Fire and Podcasters' Paradise. \u00a0John and I are heading to Greg Hickman's wedding (Greg of Mobile Mixed) in Denver, Colorado and we decided to record in the air.\n\nOn this episode we'll talk about the importance of keeping your mind and your body sharp as a solopreneur, what John's four months in India gave him and our upcoming appearance on Creative Live. \u00a0Buckle up and join us for all of that and more!\nMore About This Show\nIf you haven't heard John on the show before you can catch his first visit here, and all three of his previous appearances are linked in the resources section below. And if for some reason you have no idea who John is, he's the mastermind behind Entrepreneur on Fire, a daily podcast where entrepreneurs spent 30 minutes with John answering questions and helping John's audience \"prepare to ignite\". (You'll have to listen to one of his shows if you don't get that reference).\nOne of the things that allows John to do a daily podcast is his commitment. He will out-hustle, out-market and out-work anyone else on the planet. His military background plays a role in this as does his upbringing; his parents expected him to become a lawyer like his dad or a doctor. And when he chose neither path, it was a significant turning point for him. It was after a semester of law school that he knew law was not for him; and that meant he had to face one of the hardest moments of his life: he had to tell his parents he wasn't going back. \u00a0And after he talked with them, he decided to go to India for four months and figure some things out.\n\nSo off he went and those next four months changed him. That trip changed his perspective on life and he came back a different man. He no longer carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, and it also recharged his spirit. He was more confident and yet still humble, he understood how insignificant he was in the grand scheme of things. That understanding enabled him to embrace failure and see it as a pathway to success, not a stopping point.\n\nOver the next few years he took a few more corporate-type jobs, crushing it at all of them but hating the work itself. Eventually he came up with the idea for Entrepreneur on Fire and even though no one said it could be done (including his coach Jaime Tardy and a few other notable podcasters), he did it.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tZone of genius: what is it?\n\tHe was in a Bollywood movie: true or false?\n\tWhat\u00a0percentage of John's podcast success comes from his format?\n\tWho instilled the reading bug in John and at what age did he\u00a0pick up the habit?\n\tHow many people are expected to tune in for our Creative Live show?\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nAnd for the next several years John poured everything he had into Entrepreneur on Fire and then Podcasters' Paradise. So much so that his health took a backseat for the most part, until he recently decided to change that. After getting some biometric testing done and changing his diet, he's revived his energy levels and he's ready to take on even more kick-ass projects, including an entire day-long segment on Creative Live.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, John received a call from Alex Blumberg asking him to be on his Creative Live presentation on podcasting. For those of you not familiar with Alex he is the man behind such NPR greats as This American Life and Planet Money.

First off the Outlier Conference has been cancelled, they had a major logistics issue and it's off. While I'm disappointed not to be their keynote speaker, I'm excited that I can go to Pittsburgh and watch my Steelers that weekend for my birthday.\n\nThat's the weekend of October 25th and 26th.

And one of the biggest zags any of us can make is to walk away from a lucrative job or job offer, simply because we know we are unemployable and can't work for anyone else.\n\nOur guest for episode 170 did just that. About a year ago, he turned down an extremely well-paying job offer because he knew in his gut it wasn't right. He didn't know what was next, but he knew that job offer wasn't it. Here to discuss what that experience was like and how he became a professional podcaster as a result is our friend, Chris Cerrone of The Chris Cerrone Show. \u00a0A fitting chat for National Podcast Day.\nMore About This Show\nWhen Chris said no to that position, he had no idea what he was going to do next. Not a clue! He had already had success running a cafe and in real estate so he knew he could go back to that, but something inside of him said there was something else out there for him. And then a light bulb clicked: he loved talk radio, he listened to podcasts and he was an avid fan of Howard Stern's show. So why not podcast? And why not do it the way it was meant to be done? That was it for him: he was going to be a professional podcaster.\nAnd so began his journey into podcasting. Today Chris's The Chris Cerrone Show is quickly becoming one of the top-rated shows out there. On this episode, we talk about how he's grown and how the show has grown, what he thinks about the state of podcasting in general and advice he has for people getting into the medium. Although much of this show is about podcasting (after all, it was National Podcasting Day when we recorded this), the same rules apply to whatever medium you're using to spread your message and build your empire.\n\nAt the beginning of his podcasting experience, Chris readily admits he had to learn the art of being on the microphone. As we both agree, most people (prior to the recent popularity of podcasts) who were on a microphone were professionally trained. When you turned on your car radio, you heard someone who had gone to broadcasting school and had learned the art and the craft of radio broadcasting.\u00a0Not so today. Today many people simply pick up a mic, a few other bits of gear\u00a0and think they're on their way to becoming a podcaster.\n\nHaving grown up on talk radio and Howard Stern, Chris was not among those people. He knew the value of being a great interviewer, including how to make a proper introduction of your guest. And on this topic again, Chris and I both agree: you don't simply ask your guest to tell your audience a little about themselves. Instead, you take every piece of information you can get about them, boil it down for your audience and then craft your introduction around that. It's like the scene in 8 Mile when Eminem takes the mic: he takes everything his fellow rapper can use against him and uses it first, leaving his opponent with no ammunition.\n\nObviously your guest isn't your opponent but the concept is the same: if you want to get something fresh, new and invigorating out of your guest then you need to take their bio, read and listen to their answers to questions they've been asked before and give that to your audience in the opening moments of your show. They're left with only new stories, and new experiences to share; they can't rehash the same topics and coast through your show. Instead you'll get them to talk about things they've never talked about before, and your audience will get an interview like nothing else out there.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tWho has the most shows in the Top 10 of podcasts on iTunes?\n\tWhat signature accessory\u00a0is now part of Chris' brand?\n\tWhat was Howard Stern's first show?\n\tWhat's your goal as a speaker?

We have the freedom to do with our time as we choose and we have the freedom to create the income we desire, we have no boss who caps how much we can make. And we also have the freedom to live where we choose.\n\nOur guest for episode 169 recently went on her own location freedom voyage and she's here to tell us about it and what it was like to change gears from a successful life coach to being a culinary student. Vasavi Kumer, formerly of episode 43 of The Solopreneur Hour, joins us to talk about all of that...and so much more!\nMore About This Show\nIf you missed her first appearance on the show, you can listen to it here. In that episode, we covered her life as a female child growing up in an Indian family, her bipolar disorder and depression, her rise above to be an amazing life coach featured on the small screen.\nWhen we left Vasavi at the end of that episode, she was about to embark on a new journey in her life. She and her husband, and their dog, were moving to Austin so she could pursue her dream of attending the Culinary School at The Natural Epicurean Academy of Culinary Arts! Also since her first appearance, she was featured in a short documentary called Good Food, Good Mood. \u00a0She just spent 2 months in India, and now has\u00a0a new show coming up on the Food Network, Food Truck Face Off.\n\nDiscussing her move to Austin, Vasavi gives us a great example of what it means to set a goal without knowing the \"how\". Don't worry about how you're going to make something happen, just choose\u00a0it and things will begin to fall into place. She didn't know how she and her husband would move, but she\u00a0went for it anyway.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tDid she have first day jitters at culinary school?\n\tWhat did she do about\u00a0her \"day job\"?\n\tFood can be\u00a0one of three things, what are they?\n\tThe life lessons she learned from the kitchen.\n\tWhy your education doesn't have to be your vocation.\n\tAnd so much more!\n\nOnce she worked out the logistics and they settled into life in Austin, she threw herself whole-heartedly into her culinary education. It was something she was doing for herself, and that gave her the motivation to be in school all day and experience the grueling life of a restaurant cook and kitchen worker. Despite what her friends and family believed, she didn't have any interest in taking her culinary education to the commercial food world. She was content to be there to learn, educate herself and nourish her soul (pun intended).\n\nIn 2014, she had committed to herself that was going to do things that were just for her and not do things simply out of obligation or social constructions. And the six months she was in class were completely fulfilling and helped her reconnect to herself. So much so that she began a daily practice of loving herself as a result. She now finds ways to nurture herself every day and she has a new relationship with food; she doesn't have guilt when she eats certain things, she's removed the stigma she used to attach and foods have stopped being \"bad\" and it is once again simply food.\n\nAfter her experience at culinary school, she and her mom went to India to live in ashram for a few months. Vasavi wanted to continue to develop and build her loving relationship with herself, and a visit to India seemed the perfect way to do so. Though the ashram wasn't a fit for them, they continued their stay in India and Vasavi took an Ayurvedic course. She learned about the Ayurvedic model of healing in the Eastern world.\n\nIf you don't know what Ayurveda is it is the 5,000-year old healing system used in the Eastern part of the globe. Ayurvedic practitioners take a holistic approach to the human body. If you have a health issue, they don't simply hand you a prescription. They ask about your lifestyle: what are you eating? Who are you spending your time with? What is your environment at home and at work like?", "duration": "1:09:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/169.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Health", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Vasavi Kumar", "Woman", "Eating", "Life coaching", "Vegan", "Vegetarian"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1411708335, "title": "168: Selling Out, Facebook Groups FTW, and A Bevy of Other Listener Questions Answered", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today's Friday Q & A on The Solopreneur Hour is brought to you by Godaddy, and by my buddy Nick Unsworth. \u00a0I'm grateful they sponsored the show and I'm grateful to all of you for sending in your questions.

This is relating to building your online brand and presence. You've mentioned doing FB ads and such. Plus you've done a great job with helping us understand the value of clarifying your \"brand\" before investing too much in logo design such. However you and other entrepreneurs have mentioned how an initial brand morphs and changes quite often in the early stages as you build the audience and learn more. So in summary, I'm just looking for your best practices when you are helping people envision the average first 3 steps for tight budget investment.\n\tBrian Lofrumento\nI'm launching my podcast on 12/1 about successful and inspiring entrepreneurs' journeys and more importantly how they overcame the fears and pseudo-barriers that the other 99% let stand in their way.

How does being in it help solopreneurs like us?\u00a0Over the last year or so, I've heard the phrase \"in the flow\" over and over again...but always wondered how to GET in the flow.\n\nWith this show, we dig into exactly how to reach that elevated level of focus and consciousness. \u00a0Our friend and previous co-host Andy Murphy is back to tell us how to get into the flow, what it actually means to be in the flow and why we want to be there..and a whole lot more on episode 167 of The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nFor those of you new to the show or if you simply missed Andy's first episode, check it out here. I loved talking with him the first time and couldn't wait to have him back. He's a defacto neuropsychological expert who admits to \"nerding out\" on the science side of how and why we do what we do. It's always a fascinating conversation when talking with him on any topic, but especially on neuro-related topics.\n\nOur conversation for today's show runs the gamut from car racing and sugar addiction to brain wave patterns to our main focus: the aforementioned flow state. He shares with us some of the background and connection between being in the flow and being productive. He has rituals and habits he has created to get himself into the flow easier and to get more done as efficiently as possible.\n\nBut before sharing that ritual with you, Andy tells us what exactly is the flow state. He says being in the flow is being present and laser-focused on what you're doing, without what you're doing being forced. And he says there's a trick to getting there, it doesn't happen all at once but in steps and stages. The key to moving through those steps and stages into the state of flow is being aware of yourself: your body, your mind and your surroundings.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tHow to build unconscious repetoire: an example.\n\tOpen loop: what is it and how do you use it?\n\tThe primal urge behind our need to feel the need connected at all times.\n\tWhere to put your phone the next time you need to focus: Andy's trick.\n\tHow Andy breaks down his day for maximum productivity.\n\tOne trick to creating amazing experiences in nearly every day of your life.\n\nOnce you have that awareness, there are a few things to keep in mind so you can stay fully focused when you're there. Turn off notifications on your computer and your phone. In fact, put your phone where you can't see it and you won't be tempted to check it. Andy puts his in another room and he says he gets more done because of this. He also organizes everything via his calendar; he schedules his down time, his work time, and he gives us a full breakdown on what he does each day including his morning routine.\n\nNow that your distractions are minimized, Andy gives us these steps to getting into and out of the flow state. Your objective with this set of steps is to go in and out as needed. The more often you practice doing this, the faster and easier it will be to get in and out of the flow.\n\n\tGet an app to get your brain into the beta waves.\nBeta waves are the frequency where you are most productive. There's a link to the app Andy uses in the show notes. If you choose a different app, you'll want something with binaurial beats so you can set your brain to the proper beta brainwaves patterns.\n\tMeditate for a bit with your app.\nAndy does this for about 5 minutes so you don't need a ton of time, just a few minutes to get into beta wave territory and then move on to the next step.\n\tHave a to-do list.\nHave your list ready to go with items you need to do in that period of time you're going into your flow state. Create weekly goals, monthly goals and 90 day goals to work towards, then write down the things you need to do to make those goals happen. Once you have your tasks ready, move on to the next step.\n\tGet rid of all distractions and notifications.\nAs we mentioned earlier,", "duration": "1:10:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/167.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Andy Murphy", "Authors", "Car Racing", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Focus", "Neuroscience", "Productivity"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1411367265, "title": "166: A True Millionaire Mindset At The Age of 24, with Heyo.com Founder and CEO, Nathan Latka", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today\u2019s co-host is an architecture major turned \u201csudden entrepreneur\u201d. \u00a0From his time teaching tennis, to running a t-shirt company, to working his way through the Facebook marketing ranks with various companies, he has always felt the entrepreneurial bug. \u00a0Building a successful Facebook fan page business from his dorm room, he did over 70k in revenue\u2026while his friends were doing keg stands, he was watching his Paypal account skyrocket.\n\nA voracious reader who distills 3 books a week into his brain, he founded heyo.com in 2010. \u00a0Heyo isn't just a cool-sounding name, it's a platform to create mobile-optimized contests and marketing campaigns for Facebook. \u00a0He is certainly living the proudly unemployable lifestyle!

He took a job as a tennis coach because he wanted the money, but most importantly, he wanted the connections. The job was at one of the most elite tennis clubs in his area and he knew he could build relationships by being there and being a great coach to his students.\n\nThat same forward-thinking led him to create Heyo when he was just a college lad. Being a financially-conscious guy, when Nathan overheard 5th year architecture students say they were having a hard time getting a job he got spooked. Despite being in the top architecture school in the country, Nathan understood in that moment all he wanted was to be in control of his financial future. He didn't want to be dependent on anyone else, so he created Heyo.\n\nOut of the confines of his dorm room, his new company was born and it was off to a great start. He generated $70,000 in revenue and today he has taken Heyo to its current corporate offices in southwest Virginia. They employ between 20 and 25 people and are aiming to\u00a0have 500,000 businesses or more as clients by 2017, setting them up to be a $15 million a year company.\n\nThe finer details of the show include:\n\n\tWho did he recently have dinner with?\n\tKnowledge is most powerful when?\n\tWhat are his flow states and how can you use this same strategy?\n\tHow many Facebook pages did he initially sell at the start of Heyo?\n\t3 ways people learn and how to leverage those to connect with your target audience.\n\tThe night of the week Facebook's changes are implemented - do you know when it is?\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd if all of that wasn't enough, Nathan is a mere 24 years old! It's simply a matter of time until he has a Ted Talk, a book and does the rounds on the speaking circuit. He's truly a man with a vision and a thought leader not only of his generation but for all solopreneurs everywhere of any age.\n\nOne of the habits that has gotten him to that thought leader status is his habit of reading. Nathan reads three books a week - three! Most people don't read three in a year, let alone in one week. And he doesn't just read them, he studies and commits them to his knowledge bank. When he reads, he does a few things that ordinary readers do not. First, he\u00a0underline notes that he deems important. Second, he circles any interesting names or concepts to keep in mind for potential reading topics in the future. Third, he puts\u00a0quotes around any articles or books mentioned so he can read those in the future as well.\n\nHe doesn't stop there: when he finishes a book, he writes a summary of it on an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper and then reads that summary every morning, then every week, then every quarter. If you want to know for how many days, weeks and quarters - or any other info about his process check out the Resources section for a link to his blog post that details his reading strategy.\n\nHe started implementing this practice\u00a0after hearing Warren Buffett's speech at Harvard. Warren said\u00a0reading is compound interest for your brain and Nathan took that to heart. He read what Tim Ferriss had to say about how to read and retain information quickly so h...", "duration": "1:02:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/166.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Nathan Latka", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1411103842, "title": "165: How To Work Out While Podcasting, Join Me for A Killer Conference in Zion, and Your Questions Answered", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to our weekly Q&amp;A on The Solopreneur Hour! This is our traditional Friday show where I answer the questions you send in via our Facebook groups. You submit your question on Wednesday or Thursday and I answer it for the Friday show; ask about business, relationships, comedy, cars, music, whatever you want to know about and I'll do my best to answer.\n\nToday we cover your questions/my answers, an upcoming speaking engagement I have with Outlier, the latest and greatest on IsaLab and our burgeoning Isagenix Solopreneur Hour family and a new piece of equipment I got that I love. Join us for all of that and so much more on episode number 165.\nMore About This Show\nBefore we get to your questions, I also update you on the Outlier conference I'll be speaking at October 22-24 of this year. It's being held in beautiful Zion National Park in Utah. Check out the Resources section for links and more info.\n\nSpeaking of events, I recently applied for a press pass to a local racing event and I thought I should remind all of you with podcasts and blogs to do the same. If\u00a0you have a good-sized audience, find out how to apply for a pass. Submit the info they ask for and see what happens, it's worth looking into.\n\nOn a semi-related note, if you spend a lot of time at your desk like I do when I'm recording shows and being interviewed by other people, I found a cool way to get in a bit of a workout. I've got some new\u00a0heavy resistance\u00a0bands from Amazon (the red ones are about the equivalent of 25 pound dumbbells) and I use them while chatting.\n\nStaying on the topic of health, you may have heard me talk about Isagenix in the past and I'm ramping up my business again with IsaLab. If you want to use the products or start a network marketing business and do it the right way, contact me to get in on the action.\n\nAnd lastly, before we get to your questions, I picked up a new mixer at the suggestion of some professional broadcasters. It works great for podcasting, especially if you record in a noisy room. It's the DBX 286S, it's a fantastic device. If you listen to a few previous shows and then this one, you'll hear how my sound quality went from good to great. It's worth investing in if you're a podcaster.\n\nWith that, let's get to your questions!\n\nSteve Bader\u00a0\nHi Michael, I have a podcast called NowIsAGift at\u00a0NowIsAGift.com. I am working on a relaunch of the interview/conversation style show to be published weekly or bi weekly.\n\nBut my question is about a short 3-5 min daily podcast that I am launching called\u00a0NowIsAGift Daily. Is there a way to add a new podcast to the same website & still take advantage of the new and noteworthy time period for that new show?\nThanks for everything you do!\u00a0#GoBrowns\n\nOzeal DeBastos\u00a0\nWhat's up Michael!

But how many solopreneurs out there are really nailing it as podcasters, doing it the way it is meant to be done? In my opinion none can top\u00a0our guest for episode 164, Mr. David Ralph.\n\nDavid is a long-time listener who took the bull by the horns and began his own show called Join Up Dots. Seven days a week he publishes top-notch conversational interviews with fascinating guests. Join us as we talk about his consummate British D.J. voice, how and why he got into podcasting, what our thoughts are on the components of a great interview and how all of this relates to being a solopreneur in any industry.\nMore About This Show\nWhen I first connected with David it was through this show. He first left a comment on the show notes page of one of the very first shows.\u00a0It was the type of comment every podcaster wants on their show notes page; it was insightful, witty and thoughtful. In one brief paragraph David summed up the show, its content and his takeaways.\n\nDavid continued to listen and to leave comments like his original one, and one day he even left a message using the SpeakPipe app. I was blown away by his presence, his vocal tonality and how professional he sounded. And I told him so on our 8 Steps to Becoming a Successful Solopreneur episode with Dawn Marrs.com. David was chuffed (as the English say) by the positive feedback, enough so that his idea to create his own podcast took root.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tWho are the only two people to do Yoda impressions on this show?\n\tHow many shows has David done in one day?\n\tWhy you can't fail forward at podcasting.\n\tDavid still works a 9 to 5: true or false?\n\tThe last two words of an intro are what?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce that idea took hold, it was never far from David's mind and he set out to make that idea a reality. Always one who believed in taking action, he came up with the show's concept, and the branding message he wanted to convey. With a little trial and error, he had the logo made and secured the proper, professional audio equipment to create a great-sounding show.\n\nBut David, like the great podcaster he is, didn't stop there. Since his first episode he has always been focused on creating an entertaining and valuable show. On today's episode we talk at length about what it takes to make a great conversational podcast and why I think he's so brilliant at it...and not everyone else is.\n\nDavid has really honed in on his preparation techniques for any show he does. He does massive amounts of research on his guest and then he spends at least 30 minutes writing the intro before recording the show. And his intros are possibly the best I've ever heard from anyone.\n\nHe says these are the key to his conversations; his introductions are so in-depth that they cover nearly everything that guest has ever talked about on another show. He does that so he and his guest get all the bare bones out of the way in the beginning, and they can dive into an actual conversation.\n\nHe doesn't give his guests wiggle room to simply regurgitate their About page from their web site or to retell the same old stories they've told on every other show. He keeps his interviews lively, fresh and engaging, because he cares about his audience and giving them a show unlike all the others out there.\n\nDavid does this because he knows he has one chance to nail it; if someone is brand new to his show and they hear the same story they've already heard on another show they won't tune in again. But if they hear a guest who shares something they've never said anywhere else, odds are good they'll be back! \u00a0And that's been pivotal in the success of Join Up Dots.\n\nOn this show, David and I talk about the mental shifts that got him to\u00a0where he is today as well as the influences and experiences that impacted him.

And today marks the anniversary of the loss of my mom. It's a weird, bittersweet day for me because it's also Dexter's birthday.\n\nSo today I celebrate the loyalty and love of Dexter, who has been through every up and down with me over the last 8 years and I also remember my mom who passed away 7 years ago today.\n\nIn this episode, I also give you an update on IsaLab. You've probably heard me talk about Isagenix and network marketing. Isagenix is a company I belong to, and in general, I'm a big proponent of direct sales. I think it's a great industry, especially for anyone\u00a0who wants to\u00a0be a solopreneur but doesn't have the business idea of their own.\n\nWhether you have an interest in the biz side of things or just the products (Isagenix is a whole food nutrition company),\u00a0I'm launching Isalab soon and\u00a0I fill you in on the latest in this episode. Reach out and let me know you're interested here.\n\nAnd last, but certainly NOT least, I answer your questions! We had some wonky issues with iTunes last week so we moved Friday's Q&amp;A to Monday.

I've decided that I need to change my logo but I also need to update my website (I'm a celebrity makeup artist and founder of a bridal makeup agency).\n\nThe websites are obviously very important and I would have to invest in the designs as well as in the production of new images. In your opinion, does it make more sense to allocate funds towards the logo and branding first? It seems as though this will take a while if I am looking for someone to create something that can really grow and evolve with me. Both of these projects seem like huge undertakings...where do I start?\n\nSean Ackerman\u00a0\nMichael, what is the best \"go ahead\" way that you've \"um\" found to \"go ahead\" get rid of habitual or repetitious comfort phrases?

She never teaches anything she hasn't done herself, still a rarity in the online marketing world and one of the things I admire most about her.\n\nJoin us for episode 162 as we talk launches: from conception to strategy to execution.\u00a0We talk about tons more, but you'll have to tune in. \u00a0Join us for this decidedly\u00a0non-flirtatious episode of The Solopreneur Hour. (You'll get that if you listen to the first episode.)\nMore About This Show\nOne of my favorite things about the format of this show is having repeat co-hosts. Natalie graciously joined us for episode 12, which you can listen to here.\n\nDon't be swayed by Natalie's \"easy on the eyes\" presence, she's a badass business woman who\u00a0has refined her skill set to a razor sharp edge over the last 4 1/2 years of traveling the world as The Suitcase Entrepreneur.\n\nAfter a bit of catching up, we talk through the entire anatomy of her current launch, The Freedom Plan which is set to open it's doors on September 15, 2014. \u00a0(Click this link to register for the free webinar). We discuss what she's learned from past experiences and launches, what she outsources, when she pulls the trigger and how she makes sure her content is what her audience wants and takes action on.\n\nNatalie understands what it takes to launch a product, especially when you're brand new to the online arena. With her first launch she did everything herself. She had to bootstrap it and she understands as a solopreneur, sometimes that's where you have to start.\n\nBut as she's grown her business and her income, she's outsourced more and more of it. She\u00a0often uses referrals to find top people to get the job done for her; she also uses content that already exists so she's not reinventing the wheel. That doesn't mean she uses anyone else's content, she asks her audience what their most pressing needs are and then she addresses those.\n\nShe\u00a0also creates connections with her audience by asking them to email her about themselves when they sign up for her newsletter. She's gotten to know them in a more personal way by doing so, it's a tactic she highly recommends using to create a lasting relationship with your readers/listeners.\n\nBecause it's something I still struggle with, we dive into\u00a0product launch-related topics:\n\n\tWhat's the best way to drink Adam Carolla's wine/drink, Mangria?\n\tWhat are the first steps?\n\tHow to repurpose your existing content.\n\tDo we do it live, or pre-recorded videos?\n\tDo we do it ourselves, or outsource some of the heavy lifting?\n\tWhat do we give away on the webinar?\n\tWhat comes first, the pre-recorded videos, or the live webinar training?\n\tAm I going to New Zealand in December?\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNatalie also shares her strategy for coming up with ideas. We both agree people are creatively stimulated in different ways, but she gets the most results from unplugging for a few days and being offline. She reads and swims and relaxes on the beach; her brain is overflowing with ideas soon after!\n\nWhile you may need a different type of stimulus to get your creative juices flowing, once you do have an idea it's time to get to work. Get\u00a0feedback from your audience before creating your product; if you don't have an audience, rely on your mastermind group or coach - both tools you should have as a solopreneur.\n\nNow that your idea is in motion, you'll have to choose what training platform you're going to offer. Natalie is using a few for The Freedom Plan: she will have Go2Meeting's for all of her participants where she'll summarize the previous week's module and\u00a0answer questions from everyone to keep them engaged and accountable.

But when it comes to incorporating your business, how do you know what needs to be done? How do you properly cross your \"t\"s and dot your \"i\"s? There are lots of avenues to explore and options to consider when choosing your business entity. Here to fill us in on all the necessary details\u00a0is Nellie Akalp, the mastermind behind Corpnet.\n\nListen to this episode and hear\u00a0Nellie and I discuss what it was like to grow up in an entrepreneurial family, how she manages her own family of a husband and four kids, and the six steps to starting and the six steps to starting a business from your home.\nMore About This Show\nNellie's first exposure to business began at an early age. After her parents emigrated from the Middle East, they opened an antique gallery in Studio City, California where they settled. After that business, they opened a kabob restaurant and then an ice cream franchise. Nellie became acquainted with a variety of businesses as a child.\n\nIt's not a surprise then that she considers herself an unemployable solopreneur. She did work in some retail settings, but she always knew she wasn't meant to work for anyone else. And she believed in herself enough to strike out on her own, which is exactly what she did.\n\nToday she is a small business advocate and a busy mother of four who has found the time to write for Mashable, Forbes, Entrepreneur and many other notable publications. When she's not doing that, she's building out her flourishing company, Corpnet. Corpnet is a business filing service that handles as much of the business incorporation process as you want. If you simply want someone to trademark your business name, they will do that. If you want someone to handle every step of the filing process for you, Corpnet will. It's up to you.\n\nIt's that flexibility and attention to customer service that has allowed Corpnet to become so successful under Nellie's watch. Another key\u00a0to her success in both Corpnet and her other endeavors is her willingness and openness to grow. She believes in the power of change and the necessity of being uncomfortable. If you want anything in your life to change, YOU must change according to Nellie. And she has changed and evolved with Corpnet, with her family and with the other businesses she runs.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tThe\u00a0necessity of believing in yourself.\n\tWhy being uncomfortable is GOOD!\n\tWhen to say yes and when to say no.\n\tThe low-down on incorporating: when and why you should or shouldn't.\n\tNellie is a lawyer: true or false?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nOn today's show, Nellie and I also discuss her six steps to starting a business of your own at home. These six steps are based on a popular article she wrote for Mashable.com and you can find the full story in Resources section. Here's a quick rundown:\n\n\tSelect your business name.\nChoose your name, this is how you're going to move on to the next five steps. If you don't have a name, you don't have a business!\n\tRegister your name.\nAfter you choose your name, you'll want to register it. Do this so your business is separate from you. The main reason? To protect and separate your personal property from \u00a0your business holdings in the event of a lawsuit.\n\tGet an EIN.\nThis is like your business' social security number. Corpnet can help you get this number or you can do so on the IRS web site.

Do you think about the things you want to check off your bucket list?

For Kenyon Salo, thriller seeker extraordinaire and our co-host for episode 160, \u00a0it is his brand. Kenyon is a former pro snowboarder, professional BASE jumper, skydiver and father of two.\n\nJoin us as we talk about what the\u00a0the bucket list life means to him, how he arrived at the concept, the importance of branding in creating it, the five pillars we can all implement to lead our own bucket list lives and oh so much more!\nMore About This Show\nKenyon and I originally met through our mutual friend, JJ Collier who has previously been on the show. (Check the resources section for the link to his episode). Kenyon was a professional snowboarder when he and JJ became friends, but it wasn't until JJ was leaving for France and had a going away party that we were introduced.\n\nFast forward a a few more years down the road: when I had returned from Europe and just read The E-Myth Revisited, I wanted to get involved in network marketing so I reached out to Kenyon. I knew he was doing something with an MLM company in the health industry. We chatted about it and\u00a0Kenyon invited me to the company's annual convention in Anaheim. That one event turned everything on its head for me, I got on board with Isagenix and Kenyon and I became not only business partners, but fast friends.\n\nFor the next three years, we built our Isagenix businesses together. But as life sometimes does, we went our separate ways. We were both searching for something and over time, we found it. I created The Solopreneur Hour and he created The Bucket List Life. Because nothing trumps relationships, we've since reconnected and today we share what it's been like for both of us to find our way to our respective brands.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tThe science behind why one person is a thrill seeker, and another is not.\n\tWhat was Kenyon's first branding attempt and how did it lead him to where he is today?\n\tHis 80/20 rule for social media.\n\tWhen to boost Facebook posts and why: Kenyon shares.\n\tThe five pillars of The Bucket List Life: what are they and how can you implement them?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn this episode, Kenyon tells us the story of how his brand came to be. It's an important lesson for all solopreneurs because when you hear it, you'll understand how to know when you find your \"it\". Kenyon knew he'd found his \"it\" on Christmas Day at 3am of 2013. He was home alone, having dropped his two children off at their mom's and his then-girlfriend was off with her family. There were no holiday decorations up, no Christmas tree, not even a holiday card. Really questioning what he was doing and where he was going, Kenyon went to sleep for the night.\n\nAt 2am he sat bolt upright in bed and asked himself: What am I doing? He still didn't have an answer, so he started writing. He wrote down all the things he loved and the words \"bucket list\" kept popping up for him because of his adventure background. And he thought the concept wasn't quite there because it was too focused on him, he wanted something that impacted others. And then inspiration struck: the bucket list life! It could be a brand devoted to inspire others to pursue their own bucket lists and help others check items\u00a0off their bucket lists; it would be a brand about adventure and inspiration for others, whatever that looked like for them.\n\nKenyon had found his \"it\". He created a Facebook page for the group and that was his way of telling the world he was in business. He has since built a page that presently has over 40,000 likes and a ton of engagement.", "duration": "1:07:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/160.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Health", "Internet Marketing", "Kenyon Salo", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "BASE Jumping", "Bucket List", "Facebook", "Living Life", "Marketing", "Skydiving"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1409893393, "title": "159: What Did Your Childhood Smell Like?", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "It's that time of the week again!

On this show we always talk about the three pillars of freedom for solopreneurs: time freedom, location freedom and financial freedom. In today's episode of The Solopreneur Hour, our co-host Gary Arndt talks about location freedom. Gary is a world traveler and photographer who simply decided one day he was going to travel around the globe!\n\nOn show 158, Gary and I chat\u00a0about what he was doing before he made travel his career, how he makes a living as a\u00a0globetrotter and what it's been like to spend 7 years without a home.\nMore About This Show\nSo often as solopreneurs one of the side benefits we enjoy is being able to work wherever we want. If you're wanting to fully explore the possibilities of location freedom, heed what Gary talks about on this show. One of the reasons I wanted to have him on was because he's been able to travel for the last 7 years, with no home base. He's gone to over 140 countries and has seen things most of us have on our bucket list.\n\nBut Gary didn't always have the travel bug. He was a typical entrepreneur/solopreneur before traveling became a way of life for him. His former college roommate was one of the originators of Adobe Cold Fusion (the web application development platform) and Gary became one of the first Cold Fusion developers. Before long, Gary had more business than he could handle and he began building a team. Eventually he had 50 people working for him.\n\nIn 1998, he sold the company and was fortunate to do so before the market tanked. He next bought a network of video game sites that was going under. Within a few years, Gary had turned it into a highly profitable business making multiple six figures a month in revenue. Unfortunately, he wasn't so lucky this time and the market crashed.\n\nNot sure what to do next, he considered going back to school and eventually did. He spent two years in Minnesota studying geology and geophysics. Studying that would come in handy shortly after when Gary decided he was going to travel the world.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tGary is part owner of what NFL franchise?\n\tWhat's a 5 bagger and is it a good thing?\n\tWhere did\u00a0his business name come from?\n\tWhat\u00a0business is his 13-year old son running and how did he start it?\n\tWhy it's never going to be the right time...and you should go for it anyway.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNever being one to avoid risk, he went full force into planning mode and prepared his life to become completely location-independent. Gary sold his house, he kept his car in his mom's garage and basically got his belongings and lifestyle down to a minimalist level. Within 1.5 years, he was off on his adventures.\n\nThat was 7 years ago! Since then,\u00a0he's been to the Cook Islands, Easter Island, all over Southeast Asia, Trinidad/Tobago, Europe, Scandinavia; nearly anywhere you can think of, Gary's been there and many points you've never heard of. And in those 7 years and countless destinations, Gary took up photography. He's taught himself how to take great photographs (check out his Instagram feed, it's linked below) and how to run a successful web site while on the road.\n\nIt hasn't been easy. In fact, it took awhile before Gary's site was seeing the kind of traffic that would generate income. The deciding factor that grew his site? Gary's decision it would be so. After about 9 months, he made the choice to hunker down and find out how to create a well-trafficked web site. No one was doing it at the time so he looked to the success of travel magazines for inspiration and found it!\n\nAs Gary points out on this show, social media is highly visual and he's been able to capitalize on the incredible photographs he takes; in fact, he he has published a photograph every day since November of 2007! His primary way to provide content is through his photographs.\n\nToday\u00a0Gary continues to explore the world and extrapolate lessons\u00a0for all of us,", "duration": "1:18:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/158.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Gary Arndt", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Entrepreneur", "Internet Marketing", "Photographer", "podcast", "Saying yes", "Travel", "world travel"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1409553023, "title": "157: Sticking Your Way To Success with Jason Weisenthal", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "As solopreneurs and entrepreneurs, we often have ideas pop up for all kinds of businesses even ideas for businesses we know nothing about. So was the case for our guest on episode 157. Jason Weisenthal is the CEO and head of Wall Monkeys, a wall decal company that produces images you can stick to any surface, with no damage and no marks left when you remove it.\n\nIn this edition, we talk about how Jason created Wall Monkeys even though he had never worked in the print industry, where his solopreneur roots lie and where he sees his company going in the future...plus so much more!\nMore About This Show\nJason's solopreneur streak runs back a few generations. His grandfather ran a shoe store which was passed on to Jason's father. Growing up, his dad enlisted Jason in the business. He learned the good, the bad and the ugly from watching his father, working in the store and then later from business classes in college.\n\nAfter completing his degree, Jason continued working with his father. The shoe store had grown and had two locations, one of which wasn't doing as well as the other. Jason took that store over, bought it from his father and made it an incredibly successful shop. He did so by honing in on a niche: kids shoes, especially shoes for teens. It became the destination for the coolest shoes in his town; Jason had his ear to the ground and was immersed in that target market so he knew what his customers wanted.\n\nHe supplied the teens with their shoe needs but also gave them remarkable customer service. The necessity of customer service was something he had learned from his father, a man who took pride in knowing customer's names, their children's names, etc. Jason's dad could make anyone feel at home and cared for within minutes of meeting them and that translated into loyal customers for his store.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tHis shoe business made for an easy transition into e-commerce: yes or no?\n\tWhat's a 5 bagger and is it a good thing?\n\tWhere did\u00a0his business name come from?\n\tWhat\u00a0business is his 13-year old son running and how did he start it?\n\tWhy it's never going to be the right time...and you should go for it anyway.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nWith the shop practically running itself, Jason's mind was always thinking of creative pursuits. He looked into franchising a business to business printing company, but it didn't feel right to him. He didn't like the guys he'd be buying the franchise from and would be in business with, but he did like the printers a lot.\n\nSo on the flight home, he had an idea: there was a company that was creating life-sized wall decals of professional athletes for fans to stick on their walls. Kids loved these, the company was knocking it out of the park. And Jason thought: what if I could do the same but for stock\u00a0images? He tossed around the concept and the strategy with his wife when he got home. They decided to run with it.\n\nJason bought two printers, a back up in case the other one stopped working, and set about getting the rights from stock image companies like Corbis, Getty, National Geographic, etc. He caught his first real break when Fotolia said yes - he was stoked and knew they were on the right path.\n\nAbout that same time, the stock market plummeted. People were losing jobs left and right, North Jersey where he was located was no exception. And then another crippling loss hit Jason's company: his right-hand man died unexpectedly. It was devastating for the business and soon after, Jason had to close its doors.\n\nAlways being an optimist, Jason knew something big was around the corner for him. He poured all his time and energy into making Wall Monkeys a success. Within just a few weeks of opening the business, he got a call from Darren Rovell (then of CNBC, now on ESPN and ABC Sports) asking him if he'd like to have his company featured on their Christmas edition. Jason naturally said yes and Wall Monkeys became a huge hit from the national TV exposure.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/157.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Car Racing", "Jason Weisenthal", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Entrepreneur", "Wall Monkeys"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1409296840, "title": "156: Isagenix Celebration Download, and Your Questions Answered", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "One of the most important parts of growing your business as a solopreneur is going to events.

We\u2019ll chat about Isagenix, my network marketing company\u2019s annual event and how being involved in that company led to this show. And, as per our usual Friday, we answer your questions in the 156th episode of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nOne last note before we dive into the show: if you haven't already, please pop on over to https://solopreneurhour.com/itunes, click the Blue \"view in itunes\" button, and then click \"Subscribe\".\n\nAnd now on to the show....\nMore About This Show\nIt\u2019s fascinating how one event can shift things for you, it did for me. A few years ago, after reading The E-Myth Revisited, I knew network marketing was worth looking at. Isagenix was a company several of my friends had had great results with so I explored it.\n\nI made it to their annual conference, and loved the business model but even more so, I felt I had found a new family. For the next few years I built a solid business and amazing relationships within the company and because of the company.\n\nSpecifically, my friendship with Pat Flynn started because I was creating Social Media Ninja Tactics and asked him a question then sent him an iTunes gift card. Social Media Ninja Tactics is a social media training course which I developed as a result of building my Isagenix business on social media and then touring to help other network marketers do the same and do it the right way.\n\nAnother pivotal connection and experience I had as a result of Isagenix, was being the producer for The Kick-Ass Life. David Wood approached me about social media and I suggested he do a podcast ... and so it began!\n\nWithout those two experiences, this show would never have been born. So not only is it important to attend events - as many as you can - but it\u2019s also important to pivot, grow and continue where the road takes you on your solopreneur journey.\n\nSpeaking of pivoting, the second half of the show is when I answer your questions.

Throughout his corporate journey his work played a role in the creation of many systems and structures, including the HMO system (HMO stands for health maintenance organization).\n\nHe made a\u00a0success of his corporate life and reached a point where he was set financially. Not being one to sit around idly, Matt worked as a consult which meant long hours of travel and always being \"on\". The stress level was fairly high, but it was something he had grown accustomed to.\n\nWhen his wife was diagnosed with a terminal illness after nearly 30 years of marriage, all of that changed. He chose to be a care provider for her, which was completely incompatible with traveling for his consulting work. He poured all of his heart, his time and his energy into being there for his wife. In a short period of time, he put on a lot of weight and added a tremendous amount of stress.\n\nHis health was in the pits, until a friend brought him a box of something and told him he was going to eat it. Trusting his friend, Matt ate the products in the box and saw amazing results. He lost 60 pounds, decreased the impact of stress on his body and felt great. Because the products had proven themselves, Matt was intrigued to better understand the business model behind the company. He knew it was network marketing and as he researched, his eyes were opened to the business model. Being the engineer he is, he dove further into research mode until he ultimately decided to start his own business with Isagenix.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tHistory is written by ________. Matt fills in the blank for us.\n\tHow meditation can speed up your success journey.\n\tWhat \"ah ha\" moments are really about.\n\tWealth gives you options. Who said it and does Matt agree?\n\tWhat really moves the needle in direct selling.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nThat was nearly 12 years ago and Matt has been and continues to be a leader with the company. As he's grown his business, he's discovered quite a lot\u00a0along the way. We discuss a few of those nuggets in this episode, including what it really takes to move the needle in the direct selling industry.\n\nWe start off talking about the role of meditation and Buddhism in his life and his success. Matt has been a practicing Buddhist and a meditator for 25 years. He typically meditates for 30-60 minutes (or more) twice a day and he goes off to month-long retreats once a year. If you're interested in meditation, he suggests finding a beginner group to join and learning together. There's power in learning something new with a group in the same boat you are in. Much like a mastermind, you're learning things and growing together.\n\nAlong that same line, Matt believes in self development, but not as the key to success in network marketing. He says the simple truth in the direct sales industry is this: \u00a0your paycheck boils down to the newest additions in your business. It's the opposite of the corporate world but the lesson applies to solopreneurs. For example, if you have a podcast and you want to boost its ratings in iTunes, you need subscriptions from new people.", "duration": "1:18:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/155.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Matt Rockwell", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Buddhism", "Coaching", "Direct Sales", "Isagenix", "Meditation", "Millionaire", "Network Marketing", "Training"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1408832278, "title": "154: Instagram Marketing Ninja Tactics, with Sue B.

Whether or not Instagram is one of those businesses, you're going to learn plenty from our guest for episode 154! Sue B. Zimmerman is affectionately known as the Queen of Instagram, a fairly recent title bequeathed to her.\n\nIn this episode you'll hear the story of how she began using Instagram and then how she focused on teaching it before finally declaring it was to be her niche. She also shares a ton of knowledge in the manufacturing, licensing and the importance of creating an experience for your clients.\nMore About This Show\nSue has been in the business world for over 30 years. She started as an enterprising young girl on the Cape Cod coast, always with her eyes open for opportunities to sell her wares. Her father also taught her a great deal about business, relationships and the value of connection. He was a successful businessman running an auto parts store who supported her as she started and expanded her businesses.\n\nThe first business she created was a custom screen printing boxer shorts company. Sue was a recent college grad whose post-graduation job had fallen through, so she opted to start her own company. Her dad helped her with the collateral so she could buy what they needed to be up and running. She had clearly learned a great deal from her dad and her experiences on the coast as a young girl because she did over $1 million in sales in her first year!\n\nOver the next few decades, Sue ran\u00a0a variety of businesses that provided her with tons of opportunities; she even had a spot on QVC! In the last six years or so, she had been teaching social media in the Boston area. Instagram became part of her repertoire when she noticed her teenage daughters scrolling on their phones. They warned her not to start using Instagram because then she would start teaching it!\n\nThough they didn't know it at the time, her daughters had planted a seed. Sue started using Instagram for her summer boutique in Cape Cod and saw some astronomical numbers early on!\n\nThat seed was given its full chance to grown\u00a0when she attended Brendan Burchard's Expert Academy; it was there that\u00a0Instagram became \"the thing\" for her. She got home from the conference, after teaching Instagram to everyone she came in contact with, and literally put a stake in the ground to signify her commitment to becoming the Instagram Queen.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tHow much did her boutique's sales increase when she started using Instagram?\n\tWhat's the most rewarding thing for her?\n\tWhat people should get immediately upon viewing you on Instagram.\n\tWhy you should NEVER buy followers, according to Sue.\n\tHow and when to track your Instagram stats.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSince that definitive stake-in-the-ground moment, Sue has gone on to become an expert in the world of all things Instagram. In this episode, she hands out some serious knowledge she's learned along the way! She explains what to do once you have 500 followers and why that's such a powerful number. She also helps us share links with people and how to create a funnel to get your followers from Instagram to your mailing list. It's pretty simple and she dials it all in during this show.\n\nShe also offers some feedback on the best ways to promote a podcast on Instagram like shooting a quick 15 second video to promote an upcoming show or remind people about a show that's already gone live. Even if you don't have a podcast, you can still use this technique to promote any piece of content to your followers.\n\nSue also tells us the best way to use hashtags on Instagram and how to keep those tags fresh, and how to best share your Instagram content with the other social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter. One pro tip she gives: have your five sets of hashtags saved in a document somewhere so you don't have to retype them with every post.", "duration": "1:09:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/154.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Affiliate Marketing", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Sue Zimmerman", "Woman", "Instagram", "Marketing", "Training"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1408731986, "title": "153: A Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Selfie, and Happy Birthday to Us!", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Today we're celebrating the one year anniversary of The Solopreneur Hour! What a year it's been. Thank you all for participating, whether you're a long-time listener or this is your first time tuning in.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Podcast Movement, what it was like to meet SoloLab members in person, my thoughts on branding and rebranding and finally we answer your questions in our usual Friday Q&amp;A session.\u00a0If you want to submit a question for the next solo episode, join us in\u00a0SoloLab\u00a0or in our Facebook group,\u00a0Proudly Unemployable.\n\nThanks again for being here, I'm excited to share this show with you!\nMore About This Show\nFor the one year anniversary of the show we're doing a live broadcast from Studio 86! Myself and Lara talk in the studio about Podcast Movement, our trip to the Dallas Cowboys stadium, how to boost your podcast rankings and finally, we get to your questions.\n\nPodcast Movement was an incredible event, we were all so happy to be a part of it! I presented twice and was able to prep for my Life After 8 Weeks program by doing a session on that very topic. Many of you\u00a0SoloLabbers were in attendance and it was awesome to spend the weekend with all of you. For many of us, it was our first chance to meet in person and we hit it off - tons of camaraderie, laughs and bonding all around.\n\nWe kept it going on Monday after the conference and gathered for a personal VIP tour of the Dallas Cowboys stadium. Most of you know I am a diehard Steelers fan but even I was impressed. We talk about\u00a0the story behind this episode's photo and how I got a selfie with the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.\n\nAnother topic you'll want to listen for is the importance of subscriptions in boosting your podcast's rankings and how to rebrand once you've established a presence in your marketplace. In terms of podcast rankings, I did a little experiment you can see in the Proudly Unemployable group. In essence, I focused on getting new subscriptions just to see what would happen. And it made a HUGE difference! We jumped up into the top 10 of business - something that never happened before! And the show was ranked 85 overall out of EVERY show on iTunes.\n\nOn the tail of that, I also discuss the importance of branding and rebranding. When you're first starting out, you can use your name in the brand but don't make it the primary focus. Most of us don't have the name recognition necessary to carry a show with just our names. But once you've established a presence in the industry, then you can rebrand and that's what I'm in the process of doing.\n\nAnd finally we dive into your questions! Thank you all for sending them in, keep 'em coming. In the mean time, have a listen to the questions you all asked this week.\n\nTony Manzo\nYour thoughts on including the host's name in the logo for branding purposes. Thanks!\nTimothy Dwight Moser\u00a0\nDo you like to cook?\nLara Loest\u00a0\nIf you had the top pick in SoloLab's fantasy football draft, who would you choose and why?\nDanielle K. Lambert\nI have a website - SnoutSchool.com - where I teach social media for veterinary hospitals via blogs, short videos & membership courses. It's pretty established - 700 hospitals get my email tips. However, I'm interested in starting a podcast that focuses on social media/marketing topics for veterinarians. Problem is that I can't decide if I should brand the podcast to the same Snout School name or have it be it's own separate entity. I guess I'm worried that without the word \"veterinary\" in it, no one will stumble upon it in iTunes. Thoughts, Mr. Branding Wizard? Thanks in advance!\nDave McGuire\nGive me the details of what your latest subscribe request did for your rankings in iTunes. Seems like they go by subscribes and not downloads or listens. Thoughts?\nBrian Lofrumento\nI'm considering starting a mastermind group of my own.

But with the advent of LeadPages, that problem was solved. One of those happily satisfied online marketer solopreneurs\u00a0was one Tim Paige.\n\nToday he sits down with us for a live conversation from Podcast Movement 2014 and we chat about going from customer to co-leader...and how being a musician paved the way for his present day success.\n\nJoin us for episode 152 of The Solopreneur Hour to hear all of that and so much more.\nMore About This Show\nTim Paige is known in many circles of solopreneurs, entrepreneurs, online marketers, affiliate marketers and the like. Everyone in that world knows him as one of the kick-ass dudes bringing us LeadPages and their podcast, ConversionCast. And when you hear him talk about opt-in pages, conversions, and email tips & tricks, you'll instantly hear the passion in his voice. He loves his work because it helps people like you do what they love most.\n\nBut before he joined the team at LeadPages, Tim was a musician, an affiliate marketer and a voiceover artist. A man of many talents, he shares with us some of the lessons he's learned from all of those endeavors. In particular, we dive into what his days as a touring musician were like and what it was like for him to be on TRL on MTV and the Warped Tour.\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with TRL, MTV or Warped Tour, let's explain. TRL stood for Total Request Live and it was a show on MTV where the biggest bands and musical artists came to perform their music live in the MTV studio in New York City. So being on it was kind of a big deal! Tim says the experience of TRL prepared him for being a solopreneur in many respects; he learned the value in saying yes and going after something you want, whether you think you'll get it or not.\n\nHis TRL experience came on the heels of Van's Warped Tour. In fact, they appeared on TRL just four days after coming off their performance at Warped Tour! Warped Tour is an international outdoor music festival. Though it began by featuring punk rock bands,\u00a0today it showcases alternative rock and bands from other genres. Again, it was a pretty big deal when his band got to perform on\u00a0the tour!\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tHow Tim's band landed their spot on Van's Warped Tour.\n\tWhy you should be a \"yes\" person.\n\tHow Tim has taken the ConversionCast list to 95,000 subscribers.\n\tHis microphone tip for all podcasters.\n\tWhat happens when you give someone too many choices?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nTim explains his visit to Warped Tour was the kind of experience that shaped his perception and his belief system. If he could get his band on that tour and then perform in front of hundreds of thousands of people, what else could he do? Anything, so long as he said yes and he went for it.\n\nHe's taken those lessons with him into all of his projects and endeavors since then. As we mentioned earlier, he does voiceovers for podcasters and was an affiliate marketer before joining the gang at LeadPages. He got to know Clay from LeadPages and he later told Tim he wanted him to run a podcast for their brand. Tim was thrilled; he and Clay mapped out a plan together and Tim got it off the ground. It started as a daily show but eventually Tim discovered a weekly show best suited their content and their audience. In fact, he kept his loyal listeners when he made the shift AND his opt-in rates went up significantly! His audience let him know they loved once-a-week episode style.\n\nOver time, Tim really honed in on what works and what doesn't work in both podcasting and conversion rates; I made sure he gave us a few golden nuggets on this show! One of the biggest takeaways for me was how he grew their list to 95,000 subscribers: their\u00a0detailed show notes for each episode\u00a0are only available to people who join their list.", "duration": "1:06:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/152.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Affiliate Marketing", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Musicians", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Tim Paige", "Autoresponder", "Email Forms", "Email Marketing", "Emailing List", "Leadpages"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1408332937, "title": "151: Live From Podcast Movement w/ Natalie Sisson, Jaime Tardy, Greg Hickman, Molly Richardson, Chris Cerrone, Kirsty Bartholomew,  John Lee Dumas and Kate Erickson", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "The Solopreneur Hour brings you a special edition for show 151.

Both have been guests on the show (see the resources section for links) previously and it is a pleasure to have them back with us. These lovely ladies you may recognize: Natalie's brand is The Suitcase Entrepreneur and Jaime Tardy is the woman behind the scenes at The Eventual Millionaire.\n\nJaime is well on her way to being an eventual billionaire and Natalie has been on the road living out of her suitcase for four years now! She's slowing down a bit and spending four months in New Zealand soon.\u00a0We talk about where Jaime was living when she got her start, what Natalie and Jaime both use for their set up. Natalie shares how she lands her guests (she tells us if getting\u00a0a slinky dress helps her cause at all) and how far in advance they both record their shows.\n\nNext up Greg and Molly take the stage. Greg has been with us on The Solopreneur Hour before (again check the resources section) and Molly is a new addition. Greg is the man at the helm of the Mixed Media, a brand all about the advantages of mobile media.

Kirsty shares what it was like to take her branding experience from \"rubbish\" to nailing it, it was NOT easy! And Chris tells us how his show has evolved from a one-man show to a dynamic, co-hosting interview session.\nAnd we wrap up with the one and only Entrepreneur on Fire team of John Lee Dumas and Kate Erickson. John has visited the show three times in the past making this his fourth appearance and Kate joins us a second time. Kate chats with us about how her podcast came to be, what fears she faced and how she's made the transition from being the queen behind EOF to having her own voice out in the world. John's newest addition to the podcasting world, what he had to do to get to Podcast Movement and why he's wearing sunglasses during the entire conference.\n\nWith John and Kate, we talk about John's hustle and where his genius lies. He's not afraid to fail, he simply goes for it and makes adjustments as needed. He does everything he can to provide value to their audience and the world at large.\n\nKate shares the long-term view for her podcast: she says you can't determine what something will be in a year.

Mark has been playing in touring bands for\u00a0Cher, Pink, Foreigner, Billy Idol, Destiny's Child...the list goes on and on! Not only is he amazing on the drums, he's also a sought-after speaker and author on the topic of stage fright and human\u00a0performance.\n\nToday we're talking about lessons from drumming (of course), and also how to overcome stage fright/performance anxiety when speaking, presenting or performing in front of a crowd.\u00a0Please join me in welcoming Mark to the show for episode 149.\nMore About This Show\nMark has long been someone I wanted to have on the show, not just because he's a fantastic drummer but also because he's taken his knowledge to other venues: speaking engagements and authorship. He's also a volunteer who generously gives to charities; he's an all-around great guy and I was thrilled when we lined up a chat.\n\nOn today's show, we first talk about Mark's experiences in the drumming world. He's been touring the world with bands for quite awhile and has an impressive resume to show for it.\u00a0As this show airs, he's about to tour again with Cher. He was also part of Pink's 2013 tour which grossed nearly $171 million dollars and sold out 111 out of 114 shows.\n\nI also asked him what some of his favorite moments were, those \"pinch me\" kind of moments. He named a few: the Staples Center (he grew up in Los Angeles), the uber-famous Wembley Stadium and the Ed Sullivan Theatre, where the Beatles played.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tWhat was his nickname while touring with Pink?\n\tThe Van Halen M&amp;M legend: true or false?\n\tWhat are road map charts?\n\tWhy it's actually good to be nervous before going on stage.\n\tHow drumming prepared both of us for supporting and leading roles.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIncluding those highlights and all the other times he's graced the stage, Mark\u00a0has played for over a billion people! Naturally he's learned a few things along the way, especially about\u00a0stage performance, stage fright and overcoming anxiety.\u00a0And that's what led him to write his book, currently called Nerve Breakers: Conquering Life's Stage Fright.\n\nHe knew he had a message in him and he wanted to share it. But it's not about \"his message\", there's no ego involved in anything he does. For him anything he creates and brings into the world simply comes through him.\n\nThe foundation for his book comes from the three Cs: clarity, capability and confidence. He wanted the book to explain how these three concepts applied to performance. His wife Lisa suggested he interview top performers in every industry and create a book around the 3 C's and the interviews. And that's what he did.\n\nMark spoke with people from all walks of life including Tony Hseih from Zappos, Jeremy Piven the actor (who also happens to be a drummer), Guy Fieri the chef, Alan Bean from Apollo 12 (also the fourth man to walk on the moon) and about 46 other people. Fifty people were interviewed by Mark and their stories, lessons and insights were shared in this book. He says what they gave him in their interviews was simple, yet effective in allowing them to become the best performers in the world.\n\nWhen Mark isn't drumming, writing or interviewing inspirational performers, he's spending time with his family or speaking. If that sounds like a full schedule, it is.\u00a0Mark admits to having the entrepreneurial bug and rarely having a dull moment in his life!\u00a0And he loves every bit of it.\n\nPlease join me in giving thanks to Mark for spending an hour of his valuable time with us and giving us an inside look at what it's like to have been in front of over a billion people as a professional touring musician, a speaker, and author.

Is it cookies? If not, it soon will be!\n\nMeet our guest for show number 148, Mrs. Bridget Throneberry. Bridget is the lovely and talented Chief Cookie Officer at Badunkachunk, a cookie company about to take over the world. Ok I just made up her title, but her cookie company is rocking and rolling. They are based in San Diego, but ship around the globe.\n\nAnd Bridget is here to share with us the secrets in her recipe to success.\u00a0On this episode of\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour we talk about Bridget's background, how it influenced her cookie business, and the mindset that has brought her success in all she does.\nMore About This Show\nBridget grew up in the South with fond memories of her German grandmother's cookies, cakes and candies during the holiday season. Her love affair with food wasn't the only thing she inherited from her grandmother. Always decked out in matching red lipstick and nails, Bridget's grandmother also showed\u00a0Bridget\u00a0importance of presenting yourself in the world and the impact it can make on others.\n\nThat lesson was further driven home when Bridget went the traditional Southern route of pageantry. Coming from a family without a lot of money, Bridget was determined to pay for her college education herself and pageants provided a means to do so. Through pageant participation, Bridget learned how to articulate herself, communicate and interact with others (she is an only child), and how to present herself appropriately. She never won, but she consistently finished in the top five which gave her enough money to pay for college.\n\nHaving earned enough money to attend and having been accepted into college, Bridget chose the path of marketing with an emphasis on management. Always one to stay ahead of her competition, Bridget wanted to do whatever she could to get a leg up on her classmates.\n\nSo she decided to find a job in her chosen field, while still in school. She landed a telemarketing job in a corporate office selling fixed loans to people with adjustable rate loans. It certainly was a product she believed in, and that helped her persevere through all the \"no\"s. She never let a rejection stop her, like any good solopreneur worth their salt, she kept on til she got another yes.\n\nShe became so good at this work that she was promoted to warm leads after a year then after a year with warm leads she was promoted to management. Her management position was during her senior year of college, she was well ahead of the curve exactly as she had planned.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tWhere did she get the name of her company?\n\tHow important branding is to her success.\n\tHow to tell if someone is right-brained or left-brained with one question.\n\tWhat makes a sales letter great?\n\tTrue or false: she was an aerobics instructor while in high school.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\nAfter college, her first gig was an outside sales job. It was pretty cushy: paid car, paid phone, paid laptop and she could work from home according to her own schedule.\nBut she faced a hurdle that first year: she had to learn to sell face to face, not something she had done before. And she struggled, she didn't grow her territory one iota that first year. It was uncharacteristic of Bridget not to reach her goals and she knew she had to do something to create a shift. So she began learning micro expressions, reading books like Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People.\u00a0With the help of her new tools and her expanded understanding of people, Bridget\u00a0was now able to succeed in her role.\n\n\n\nBy the time she had taken on her fourth sales position, she was excelling at what she did. She truly was an exceptional sales person, and she was miserable. It was time for something new.\n\nThrough a stroke of good fortune and savvy business acumen, Bridget found a niche in the cookie business.

It becomes a book that transcends what it means to be a book and takes on an impactful life of its own.\u00a0One of those books is The E-Myth Revisited by Mr. Michael Gerber, who joins us\u00a0for episode 146 of The Solopreneur Hour. During\u00a0this show, Michael talks to us about the origins of the book, why it is such evergreen content, and what's coming up next for him.\nMore About This Show\nAs one of the Sexy Six books I recommend for all of you Soloists out there, I hope by now you've read Michael's The E-Myth Revisited. If you haven't, you can get it on Amazon (the physical book) or Audible (audio version). Considered one of the most influential business books of its time (perhaps of all time), Michael says the origins of this book are quite simple: he\u00a0was looking for a way to transform the state of small business worldwide.\n\nConsumed by the pursuit of this transformation, he soon uncovered the concepts and the fundamental truth of which this book is based on. With that foundation in place, The E-Myth Revisited was born. At its core, this book is about why most small businesses fail - and how to avoid that failure.\n\nMichael says the majority of businesses fail because they are started by people who simply want to get rid of their bosses, rather than people who have a dream or a vision of something greater than their own needs and desires. Instead of creating for ourselves another job where we are the boss, we should find what that dream, vision, purpose and mission is within us and then create a business around that. He has uncovered the process by which we do that, a process\u00a0he calls\u00a0The Dreaming Room. It's what he's at work on now and what he is currently bringing into the world.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tWhat does it mean to him to be a creator?\n\tWhy the status quo kills off the creative, compelling instinct we are all born with.\n\tWho the dreaming room is specifically designed for.\n\tWhat was the business landscape like when he wrote the book?\n\tHis answer to the question: what would your last meal be?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\nVisit Today's Sponsors:\nFreshbooks - Easy Invoicing For Solopreneurs\u00a0\nEvoice - Phone Numbers For Small Businesses\u00a0enter promo code \"solo\" for a free trial\n\n\n\nMichael also explains what he means by epic entrepreneur and how we can go from\u00a0The Dreaming Room at the base level up to being an epic entrepreneur, which is the pinnacle of our potential. Most of us won't get to that epic place because we're stuck. We're stuck financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually and we must become unstuck to have a chance at achieving that epic level. The first step to getting unstuck is his dreaming room.\n\nAnother interesting topic we discuss is the education system. Because Michael believes we are all created in the image and likeness of God, he believes are all creators just as God is a creator. It isn't until we enter the public school system that that creativity gets sucked out of us. We all have a natural, compelling instinct to create but it's taken from us by the public school system and the status quo. He goes on to say he would not educate his child in the public school system, but instead would send him/her to a parochial school or a charter school.\n\nAnd definitely not to a higher education system where only false promises are made and never realized. He believes in having people educate themselves and discover for themselves who they are and what they are meant to be doing on this planet, something he doesn't think people can find in a public classroom today.\n\nOn a related note, he also admits\u00a0to not reading business books. He finds inspiration and creation from within himself. He feels his ideas and concepts would be too influenced by outside sources if he were to read other books in his genre. The last thing he wants to do is to create\u00a0something as a pattern fr...", "duration": "1:04:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/146.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Guests", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael Gerber", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "E-Myth Revisited", "Entrepreneurship"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1407109737, "title": "145: A $135,000 Business Education for just $100, with Omar Zenhom", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "In studio today is former teacher and basketball player turned internet business instructor and solopreneur, Omar Zenhom.\n\nWe talk hoops, how messed\u00a0up iTunes is for Podcasters, how get got a bunch of haters by giving away a free webinar on Podcasting, why the teaching profession is screwed up, and how to get the equivalent of a $135,000 education for just $100!\n\nOmar and his fiance Nicole have a great podcast called \"People Who Know Their Sh*t\", and they are about to launch the $100 MBA Show.\nMore About This Show\nLike so many great solopreneurs and entrepreneurs, Omar has taken lessons from the different areas of his life and applied them to his business pursuits. As a young man, he was a track and basketball athlete both of which taught him the value in perseverance and to focus on your own improvement, not how you stack up against others.\n\nOmar has taken that attitude of perseverance and personal betterment into his work life, from his previous career was as a teacher to his online endeavors.\n\nPreviously, he taught at both the high school level and at the university level.\u00a0Though he thoroughly enjoyed teaching and the students in his classroom, and was quite successful at it, he became disillusioned by the education system. He believes it strips teachers of their creative license at the door and everyone\u00a0suffers for it. He taught for over 10 years until one day he discovered the possibilities of the Internet and new path was opened!\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\t\u00a0What did he learn when his first podcast was removed from iTunes?\n\tWhy you need to be YOU in the marketplace.\n\tHow his company's name, Business Republic, was born.\n\tThe #1 misconception he hears from his audience - Omar debunks it.\n\tWhy a great idea is worthless.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Omar began playing around in the online world. He explored eBay and making money there as well as creating web sites for other people. It took him about 8 months before he resigned his teaching position to pursue his online endeavors full-time.\n\nStill feeling insecure as an entrepreneur, Omar applied for the Wharton School of Business and was accepted. During his first semester, his marketing professor pulled him aside and asked him why he was there. Omar told him - he wanted to be\u00a0a great entrepreneur and his MBA schooling would provide that. His professor responded by saying an MBA was not the way to become a great entrepreneur. Instead he offered Omar a list of 40 books to read that would help him on his way and told Omar to drop out.\n\nOmar did leave after his first semester because he understood he was at Wharton simply to bolster his confidence. He felt insecure about being in the online marketplace without the letters behind his name, not because he needed the schooling to be a great entrepreneur.\n\nSeeing the opportunity in his experience, Omar and his fiance Nicole created their $100 MBA program. It's a course designed to give entrepreneurs an MBA education, without the time and monetary investment of an actual MBA. With Nicole's New York Film Institute education under her belt, they designed a series of eight core courses laid out\u00a0in video format and complemented with written notes and checklists as well as an online forum for their participants to meet other like-minds.\n\nBuilding off the success of their course, Omar and Nicole are soon launching their $100 MBA podcast. The format will be a short podcast aired 5 days a week with all content, no fluff. It's designed for the listeners to tune in, learn something and then go apply it. The topics discussed will be covered in chunks, meaning marketing will be the topic\u00a0for podcast number 5-20, sales from 21-35, etc. So when someone wants to learn about a specific fundamental of business, they can find that topic covered over a succession of days and not have to hunt around through all the episodes to find it.\n\nAs a special bonus for The Solopreneur Hour listeners,", "duration": "1:13:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/145.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Omar Zenhom", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Entrepreneurship", "Finance", "MBA"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1406872297, "title": "144: Messages From The Oracle (Your Facebook Questions Answered)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome to another addition of The Solopreneur Hour. Today we're doing another installment of answering your Facebook questions. I love doing these shows, so keep those questions coming!\n\nHere's what you'll discover on this show:\n\n\tIf Google Plus is on the way out...or about to explode.\n\tShould you hire a copywriting pro or trust your own instincts?\n\tHow to make the most of your brand with a blog.\n\tWhat mile marker did the show reach in July?\n\tWhat do you when someone buys your product, but does nothing with it?\n\tA whole bunch more!\n\nSo without further adieu, let's get to your questions...\n\nSteve G: Steve wants to know if I've updated my vision board.\n And the answer is if I haven't updated it, but I have an idea where I want the show to go next and where I want to go next.\n\nI capped off my five year growth period with the purchase of my watch but I haven't updated my vision board with the next item.\n\nHowever, I am focused on where I am committed to taking the show next. I want it to become a legitimate A-list show with the top actors, real estate agents, trainers, etc. The best of the best. That's my long-term vision for the show.\n\nFor me personally, I want to buy a crappy old warehouse somewhere here in San Diego. I'll fix it up so I can drive my cars right into the warehouse and build out my living quarters with modern, industrial-type design. That'll be the back end and the front end will be a space with working stations, super high-speed Internet and conference rooms. It'll be a free co-working space and I'll have a local coffee cart sponsored by a local coffee shop and food trucks. Friday, Saturday and Sunday there'll be live jazz playing during happy hours.\n\nSteve G: His second question is about\u00a0Google Plus: is it about to die or is it the next big thing?\n\nIf you had asked me two weeks ago, I would've said it's about to die. But after having Michael Stelzner of The Social Media Examiner on the show (Episode 138), I'm inclined to say it has possibilities.\n\nRight now Facebook is all about monetizing, yet the engagement is so low. Couple that with the fact that everyone has a Gmail account and business accounts plus Google's search engine ranking capabilities makes it seem like Google Plus is a place worth exploring.\n\nTimothy Dwight M:\u00a0What's the best way to get good sales copy written for your audience? Hire a pro or trust your own instincts for your followers?\n\nI was writing a bio for people who interview me for their podcasts and when I was done, I sent it to David Roth (Episode 25 and Episode 8) for his input and expertise. So I say - hire a pro. Find someone who is a masterful copywriter on Fiverr or Odesk and have them do it for you.\n\nBob N:\u00a0How good should I feel about wrapping a podcast in a blog?\n\nYou should feel great about that Bob. The way I do The Solopreneur Hour is to upload the show to Libsyn, which then goes to The Solopreneur Hour.com blog which then goes to iTunes. What happens because of that is TONS of organic traffic and audience growth that reinforces the brand.\n\nThis show is 11 months old and yet I feel completely confident I own the word solopreneur. So has that word grows in the world at large, this show's audience will only continue to grow. So you should feel\u00a0great about wrapping your podcast within a blog!\n\nRey B:\u00a0Talk about monetizing when starting a business. I know for the first 90 days we should focus purely on audience-building. Once I do that should I come out with a low-price introductory product, massively over-deliver to build trust and then ease my way into a a higher-priced ticket item/training/coaching?\n\nMany ways to skin this cat. When I built the audience for\u00a0The Solopreneur Hour,\u00a0the first thing I did was to come out with affiliate products. I had Bluehost, Audible, things like that which I offered to the audience.

Our guest for episode 143 is a great example of that.\n\nChandler Bolt is a best-selling author and marketer who trains others how to write and sell their ebooks successfully on Amazon. But his earliest inclinations were not of the writing persuasion and the path to his current endeavor is an interesting one.\u00a0Today he joins us to talk about his early days as an athlete, musician and the path that led him to his present solopreneurial success.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nJust a few years ago if you would have told Chandler Bolt he'd be a best-selling author and someone who teaches people how to write great books, he would not have believed you! Chandler was not an A+ English student and didn't enjoy writing in school. It didn't seem like a likely path for him to pursue.\n\nBut one of the earliest influences that impacted where\u00a0he is\u00a0today was growing\u00a0up in an entrepreneurial household; his dad ran his own construction business and his mom was a real estate agent. The time flexibility he saw his parents' businesses afforded them appealed to him in many ways, from the after-school competitions they always attended to the family vacations they all took together.\u00a0\u00a0Even at an early age, Chandler knew\u00a0he wanted that for himself.\n\nHe didn't need much of a push beyond that. As a youngster, he began selling snacks to other kids and then ran a lawn care business that helped him pay for college.\n\nWhile\u00a0in college in Charleston, South Carolina, Chandler went to work with the company called \"School Painters\". He learned the ins and outs of running a successful enterprise\u00a0with them, from hiring and firing to marketing to selling to customer service. He learned it all in his first year and did over $100,000 in business.\n\nThe next year he returned and helped three other solopreneurs do what he did in his first year: run a successful painting business. Again, he caught on quickly and did a tremendous job with his trainees. They all did over $55k in sales and were awarded spots on the company cruise.\n\nChandler\u00a0was well on his way.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n \tWhat does MVP stand for and how can you apply it in your business?\n \tWhat are the\u00a03 pillars of being a solopreneur?\n \tEntrepreneurs don't make excuses, they make ___ ____. Chandler fills in the blank.\n \tWhat are the benefits of having an accountability partner?\n \tWhat is a weekly action doc and how can you use it?\n \tAnd lots more!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHis most recent successes are\u00a0his\u00a0ebooks, The Productive Person, The Productive Person Action Guide\u00a0and Breaking Out of a Broken System.\nHe was an Amazon best-seller with those books and did what any wise and savvy business owner would do: he created a course to show others how to have the same success he had with self-publishing ebooks.\nToday he has a 3 month program, Best-Selling Book System, that takes you from your book idea to an Amazon best-seller in 3 months. This program accelerates you through the writing and editing processes, and walks you step by step from idea to ebook launch. The great thing about this program, aside from the information it provides, is how it was created. Chandler didn't have it all locked down when he started, he knew what he wanted to cover but he hadn't created the content.\n\nInstead, he let his participants show him what they needed and they would customize based on their needs. And that's exactly what they did with their initial 41 group members, all of whom have been pleased with their experience. It's a real-life example of solopreneurship: you don't have to know everything in order to get started. Just get going and work it out as you go!\n\nAnother great takeaway from Chandler's visit to the show is how they marketed and structured the actual content. At first they advertised with Facebook ads and affiliate marketing.\n\nOnce people were interested,", "duration": "1:07:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/143.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Affiliate Marketing", "Authors", "Career Advice", "Chandler Bolt", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Amazon", "Author", "Book", "Kindle", "Marketing", "Training"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1406560110, "title": "142: 9 Lessons Comic-Con Can Teach A Solopreneur", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Comic Con started\u00a0in 1970 as a place where people who collected comic books would gather. That first year there were 300 people. \u00a0Forty four years later in 2014, there were 150,000 people who attended! And all of those 150,000 people cram into one little section of San Diego called the Gaslamp District.\n\nIt's a pretty crazy experience, so much so\u00a0I thought I'd take this show to share the nine lessons I learned from attending. Let's dive in:\n\n1. Niche down. \n\nDon't be afraid to niche down deep and find exactly what you're passionate about, then go after it. The fans in attendance are hugely passionate about their favorite TV show, movie, character or actor. You can find something you love as much, you'll have no trouble creating a strong business around.\n\n2. Over-deliver in value.\u00a0\n\nComic Con itself provides so much you can't possibly take it all in at once. You'd need an all-access pass and John Lee Dumas to prepare and execute your itinerary for you to see everything available in the four days of Comic Con. And Comic Con continues to up their game and offer more every year, because they know their fans will appreciate them for it.\n\n3. Strength in numbers.\n\nRemember the statistic about how many people came to the first Comic Con vs. 2014? You don't need those kinds of numbers to succeed but pay attention to the lesson at hand: when you have a rabid following, you can do anything. And the way you grow these numbers and get the muscle they provide is by doing the previous two steps. On a practical level, you grow your numbers by offering them something in exchange for their email address. Grow your mailing list by offering a giveaway, you're well on your way.\n\n4. Building a strong brand trumps all.\n\nThink about brands like Star Wars, Bugs Bunny, etc. These aren't just movie or animated characters, these are brands that have stood the test of time. More than likely you could quote something from either of these two brands and they've been around for decades. It's worth investing time and energy into creating a strong, memorable brand that represents what you're doing. Make sure it's absolutely clear what you are promising from your branding.\n\n5. The power of community is unmatched.\n\nComic Con is a community in and of itself, as are all the subdivisions. I overheard so many people talking about how they met their new friend the day before and they've been inseparable ever since. Community happens when people connect based on their common interests. When that connection happens, it can last a lifetime.\n\n6. Let your business morph and evolve.\n\nStart out with an idea of what you'll be doing and then let your audience tell you what they want, then morph and adjust what you're doing.\n\nFor example, when I started SoloLab I did 40 Skype calls with people about what they would want from a mastermind group. I had an idea of what I would offer going into those calls, and it was completely changed by the time I finished talking to those 40 people.\n\nAnother great example is TV vs music. Look at how TV has kept up with evolving media, technology and the way people want to view their shows. How many times have you watched your favorite show on your iPad or your phone - or some device that was not your television set? Music hasn't changed and they've been buried as a result.\n\nKeep up with evolutionary changes and keep your business growing.\n\n7. Leverage celebrity!\n\nEveryone knows someone so if you can somehow attach a celebrity to your services, do it.\u00a0And always ask for referrals - remember the power of community? This is a great way to leverage your people's people (and perhaps their people's people).\n\nWho are the reachable celebrities in your niche? Find them, connect and eventually you'll land someone. Once you get one, others will follow.\n\n8. Hustle.\n\nThe people who made Comic Con happen probably didn't sleep for a week. It didn't matter to them, they knew what had to be done,", "duration": "1:05:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/142.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Comic-Con", "Comicon", "San Diego", "SDCC"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1406226964, "title": "141:  Building a Brand Within a Brand?

Would that concept intrigue you? It captured my attention, enough to bring my friend Bryon Jaymes on to this edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nThere are a number of lessons we solopreneurs can glean\u00a0from the network marketing field, whether we\u00a0are in it or not. And Bryon is bringing those lessons to episode 141. He's been a leader in several companies and is here to talk about what the social entrepreneurship concept behind his newest company,\u00a0what he's learned in the trenches and how that applies to your business, whatever your industry.\nMore About This Show\nWhen I first met him, Bryon was involved in his second network marketing and was doing very well for himself. He had figured out that people buy from people, not from companies. So he had created a brand for himself and his team, West Coast Movement.\nWest Coast Movement had actually been started by Bryon when he was in his first company: Amway. Bryon got involved with Amway the old-fashioned way: someone he knew and respected introduced him. Bryon has always been committed to health and fitness so when his friend\u00a0told him about the nutritional product options at Amway, Bryon was immediately interested for himself and for his personal training clients.\n\nBryon spent five years building and growing his West Coast Movement team at Amway; he was making from $5k-$6k a month by that time and also earning yearly bonus checks of $20k or more. Despite his success, Bryon felt it was time to move on to a new company. There were a number of things that weren't in line with his own integrity and commitments, so after careful consideration he decided to find a new home for himself and his West Coast Movement team.\n\nHe went through a fairly length selection process, he settled on a new network marketing company in the health and wellness field. He saw a real opportunity to influence where the company was going and he wanted to be a part of that. Again he built his team, bringing with him about 400-500 people from his previous organization.\n\nAnd for the next three years, that was where he hung his network marketing cap. It was also during that time that we met and became friends.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tWho was one of the first partners in EM squared?\n\tWhat's the greatest thing about being a solopreneur?\n\tWhat's the worst thing about being a solopreneur?\n\tWhy did Bryon build West Coast Movement and why does it matter to your business?\n\tWhich group is the most malnourished today and why?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nAs fate would have it, that company was then acquired by another company. Bryon saw the writing on the wall and decided to pack up his West Coast Movement people and go elsewhere.\nEventually he settled with his present company, EM Squared. The concept behind the company is like Tom's Shoes but applied to healthy food bars. When someone buys a box of bars from EM Squared, one box is donated to children in need. Right now they are only in Mexico and Central America but they have a vision to expand and help malnourished kids around the globe.\nThe compensation side works like other network marketing companies: when you enroll someone, you get paid. When they enroll someone, you get paid and so on down the line. But with EM Squared, you can choose to donate what you earn to charities or to cash it out. It's up to you!\n\nAnd you can also take that box of healthy bars you bought and donate it to a local charity, homeless people you see, etc. Again, the choice is yours.\nIt's social entrepreneurship at work and it's been working well for EM Squared. In their first 3 weeks, they fed over 10,000 kids! Imagine what they're going to do in their first three months.\nWhether you're interested in feeding kids or not, there are definite options a network marketing company like EM Squared offers.", "duration": "1:20:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/141.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Fitness & Health", "Great Books", "Guests", "Health", "Internet Marketing", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Network Marketing", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Branding", "Fitness", "Hustle", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1406146639, "title": "140: Michael Answers YOUR Solopreneur Questions", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hey all!\n\nI posted to the Proudly Unemployable Group to see if anyone had questions for today's show.

If you've got a blog, definitely launch, grow and expand as you go along. If you're doing a podcast, there are two foundational elements you must have and they are 1. It must sound good and must be dialed in from the beginning. I give podcasts one chance and if it sounds terrible, I don't listen in again. 2. Your brand must be nailed and locked down.\n\nUltimately we are selling ourselves, when people are buying our products and services they are buying us. Be where you are on the timeline and learn as you go. It doesn't matter that you're not the world's best at what you do, you just need to get started.\n\nAlan C asks: talk about your journey from the pile of equipment to where you are now.\nYou all have been along for the ride! Part of the point of this show from the beginning was to take you with me on this journey. I did follow a pretty certain path and had a strategy in mind; I listened to people who gave me advice and it's been very successful. Between the podcast itself, my coaching and mastermind groups, The Solopreneur Hour has generated or will $250,000 in 10 months.\n\nI never thought I would get so much joy and energy from the coaching I do; I love to hear how people get motivated and what they accomplish from working together.\n\nThe next piece is upleveling from here. I'm asking how can I raise the bar, make this show totally professional and get insane guests - that is where I am focused. I think as a show this is just getting started, as is the industry of podcasting itself.\n\nMichelle C: Live, Laugh and Love, talk about this phrase and why it is used so much in speech. What meaning is it given and to what extent?\nFor me it means every day we\u00a0focus on asking: How can I live this moment to the extent that I am capable. How can I maximize this moment? Why shouldn't I be the first one to the dance floor? Why shouldn't I be the first one to raise their hand and ask a question?\n\nEveryone's waiting for someone to go first, why do you have to wait? And why must you choose between this or that - why not BOTH? How can you live and maximize it?\n\nHow can you laugh in ANY situation no matter how tense, and no matter how much adversity you're facing?\n\nAnd how do we choose to love the things we already have? Our girlfriend/boyfriend, our house/apartment/living situation, etc. How can we love things as they already are?\n\nLove is what you surround yourself with and what makes you feel good inside.\n\nDavid Michael G: He wants an update on my racquetball game. I've been on the DL, I tore something in my forearm. I can't squeeze enough to give a proper handshake - that's why if we met at WDS, my handshake felt like you were holding a fish.

He says as a TV writer you always know it\u2019s a possibility your show won\u2019t get continued and it\u2019s something you learn to live with\u2026and, like any good solopreneur, you go for it anyway.\nAnd when he\u2019s not working on a TV set, he\u2019s writing novels. His latest is the hilarious satire called Romance For Men. The premise is a story told from the perspective of a mountain man in wilds of Alaska named Jack IceFloe Jackson. Jack is pissed off that romance novels are written for women so he decides to pen his own version based on his experiences.\nKeep\u00a0in mind, Jack is a short, fat, balding man with a 6-incher (according to Dean and Jack\u2019s Twitter profile). Hilarity ensues when Jack retells his tales of saving the world through his lovemaking exploits; every woman in the world wants him and, through some twist of fate (aka fiction), the Earth continues to be put in perilous scenarios that can only be salvaged by Jack\u2019s sexual conquests.\nAs you might imagine, the book is uproariously funny and ridiculously\u00a0filthy. In fact, Dean says it\u2019s the filthiest thing he\u2019s ever written and perhaps that has ever been written!\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tNetflix: how they became a major player in\u00a0the world of television\n\tWhat shows would he have loved to have written for?\n\tWho orgasms at the end of the audio version of his book?\n\tHow to find a good publicist for your next launch of anything.\n\tThe necessity of marketing your book and how it applies to your business.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nThe origins of the book and its rise to self-publication are a tale in and of themselves. Dean originally began writing a book within a book: he cast himself as a fiction character who finds Jack\u2019s book in a secondhand book store. This fictional Dean chases Jack all around trying to get the rights to the book so he can make a TV show about it. The original version of the book chronicled those exploits.\nWhen Dean showed people what he had written, they all wanted to read the book that fictional Dean finds in the secondhand bookstore. There was such demand for that book that Dean decided to sit down and write it.\nBut it wasn\u2019t written with any intention to publish it. It wasn\u2019t until he again showed more people this second distillation of the book that he saw the potential for self-publishing.\nIn fact, one of the people he gave it to was Adam Reed who created Archer for FX. Adam loved it and convinced Dean to make an animated series pilot for FX, which is now in the works.\nDean says writing the book wasn\u2019t the hardest part, as many people think. The hardest part is to make people aware of it. As a writer, you have to be thinking of how you\u2019re going to write it but also how you\u2019ll get the word out. The same goes for other solopreneur ventures: when you\u2019re creating something, think about how you\u2019ll create it but also how you\u2019ll spread the word about it.\nFor Dean and Romance For Men, that meant contacting web sites he thought might be interested in the book, hiring a publicist and also sharing his book with his friends. Though you may not hire a publicist,", "duration": "1:16:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/139.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Dean Lorey", "Great Books", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Love & Relationships", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Outsourcing", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Author", "Business", "Entrepreneur", "Hustle", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1405653252, "title": "138: Michael Stelzner | Launch Successfully by Leveraging Relationships", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Did you know that before Social Media Examiner was launched, Michael Stelzner was known as THE white paper guy?\u00a0What's a white paper you ask? In the 138th edition of The Solopreneur Hour, Michael joins us to explain what a white paper is and what it does, and he shares how that white paper industry expertise led to his interest in social media and the eventual launch and success of Social Media Examiner.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the necessity of building relationships, how to do it with people you admire and fledgling talent you come across, and how he runs a thriving enterprise with a dedicated staff, many of whom are volunteers.\n\nMore About This Show\nSince his early days, Michael Stelzner has been an entrepreneur. Growing up as a young boy in the Midwest, he and his brother would dig up nightcrawlers and sell them to fishermen the next morning. For those of you non-fishing folk, nightcrawlers are big worms fishermen used as bait.\nBeing just a kid, his nightcrawler interested wained so he picked up a paper route. When he grew tired of that, he got into video games and created a video game that was actually bought by a large gaming company. One week after they sent him the contract, they went bankrupt.\nNot one to be deterred by a setback, Michael persevered. Though he was the only solopreneur-spirit in his family, his father was always encouraging him to follow his passions. Michael wasn't clear on exactly what those passions were but he also knew he was artistic. He was one of the rare birds who was a good artist and a good writer, his \"secret sauce\" if you will.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tWhat's the biggest content tool in 2014?\n\tWhat is unconferencing and should you do it?\n\tWho was once his assistant and is now an online powerhouse in her own right?\n\tHow many millions of people visit Social Media Examiner now?\n\tWhat's the number one thing 68% of marketers plan to do in 2014?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEventually Michael did find a home for his writing and artistic talents: he became the director of artists at an agency in the 1990s.\nFrom there, he found his way into the world of white papers and positioned himself as an expert. If you're wondering what a white paper is, Michael explains it as a combination of an article and a brochure cross-designed to sell.\nTo solidify his expertise in the white paper industry, he published a book on the subject called Writing White Papers, created a big portal where people came to learn how to write and create white papers. He segued that into teaching marketers about white papers and training tens of thousands of out-of-work journalists how to write white papers and generate a living for themselves.\nAnd from those experiences he understood the value in teaching and\u00a0created deep relationships with the marketers and writers he came into contact with. From those close connections, Michael saw trends. He noticed they were all getting on Twitter,\u00a0so he started interviewing people for his newsletter, which were very big back then in the late 2008/early 2009. With those interviews, he introduced marketers to social media combined with white papers.\u00a0\nHe saw another trend emerging: people were going crazy over anything related to social media so he started hosting online events around the topic. Those events were\u00a0the most popular and a light bulb went off in Michael's mind: social media was the next big thing and he was going to be a part of it.\nMichael had no idea how he was going to get into social media but he knew he was going down that path. The first thing he did? He built relationships. He got to know the people who were movers and shakers - the ones who were hosting events like BlogWorld and MarketingProfs.\nHis earlier connections paid off; one of his fans from his white paper days was Jason Falls and Jason was the man in charge of the speakers at BlogWorld that year. So when Michael heard Jason was going to be in San Diego where Michael lives,", "duration": "1:07:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/138.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Great Books", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Michael Stelzner", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Woman", "Business", "Entrepreneur", "Hustle", "Social Media Examiner", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1405487043, "title": "137: Creating Your Business The Right Way, with Jonathan Fields", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "If you combined a hedge fund lawyer, a fitness/wellness entrepreneur, a best-selling author and the creator of The Good Life Project, what would you get? You\u2019d get our guest Jonathan Fields, he\u2019s successfully been all of these in his lifetime!\nIn episode 137 we talk about his past projects and careers, his 10 business commandments and what he\u2019s learned that has made him who he is today.\nMore About This Show\nEven as a kid, Jonathan was an entrepreneur. A self-professed \u201clemonade stand kid\u201d, Jonathan was always interested in entrepreneurship and new creations.\nAfter law school, he got a job in a hedge fund firm and did very well for himself. He did so well he was offered a senior partnership, but he turned it down. He knew in his gut that he didn\u2019t want that role and he didn\u2019t want that life. He loved the people he worked with but he didn\u2019t love the hedge fund world enough to make the necessary sacrifices to be a partner.\nSo he began looking at his other options and saw he had a love of health/wellness, entrepreneurship and fitness. He had saved up a fair bit of change because he knew he was leaving, and that enabled him to take a job as a personal trainer after completing a certification process.\nBut he did something not everyone else does: he had a building strategy going into the personal training world. He knew he wanted to build a brick and mortar business eventually and so he took the $12/hour job to learn as much as he could about the industry and how to properly serve those in it.\nWithin twelve months of taking that job, he had his own private practice. After that, he launched his own facility and soon his company was generating revenue in one month that the big box fitness companies were doing in a year.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tThe moment he knew he had to leave his hedge fund position.\n\tHow he created his first yoga video and why the story pertains to your business.\n\tThe two reasons most people tell you you can\u2019t do something.\n\tCreative recoil: what is it and how can you avoid it?\n\tThe single worst business idea anyone can buy into it.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nHe grew his fitness business for about 2.5 years and then sold it. He found himself drawn into the world of yoga and leased a space near his home in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, a part of New York City. He signed the lease the day before September 11.\nFaced with a city in chaos and rubble, he wondered if he had made the right choice or if he should leave it all and forget his dream. Jonathan decided the city needed what he and his team were going to offer so he opened his doors, gave a free pass to all the relief workers and marketed his programs to the average middle-aged person who had never done yoga.\nAnd they flourished. They opened a teacher training certification division, a media division and Jonathan\u2019s knack for publicity and marketing helped them shine.\nHe continued his work with the studio for seven years and then his interest shifted to online marketing and writing, which led to a book deal. His publicity background helped him land a contract with Random House Publishing.\nFrom there, he developed The Good Life Project which continues to hold his focus today.\nOne other interesting piece of material he\u2019s created is his 10 Business Commandments. They seem to sum up who he is, what he\u2019s learned along the way and what he\u2019s committed to in business.\n\n\n\tThou shalt have a strategy but be open to serendipity.\n\tThou shalt magnify results with delight marketing.\n\tThou shalt train thy mind in the alchemy of fear.\n\tThou shalt find or purchase a sense of humor.\n\tThou shalt embrace the power of mentoring.\u00a0\n\tThou shalt do epic shit that actually matters.\n\tThou shalt align thy actions with thy heart.\n\tThou shalt treat people with compassion.\n\tThou shalt exalt love as a business ideal.\n\tThou shalt lead with service and soul.\n\nAfter you listen to our breakdown of those ten commandments and all the other knowledge-bombs Jonathan dropped,", "duration": "1:14:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/137.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Fitness & Health", "Great Books", "Guests", "Health", "Internet Marketing", "Jonathan Fields", "Life Coaching", "Love & Relationships", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Author", "Business", "Entrepreneur", "Good Life Project", "Hustle", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1405326412, "title": "136: Vlogging the Savvy, Sexy, Social Way with Amy Schmittauer", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Did you know YouTube is the second largest search engine on the Internet today? That is reason enough to pay attention to our guest for show 136, Amy Schmittauer, the lovely and vivacious woman behind the vlog Savvy, Sexy Social.\nOn this show, Amy shares her thoughts and suggestions on how to create a great video without spending a lot of money, who should be creating content and for what industries and why. Join us to hear all of that and so very much more on the 136th episode The Solopreneur Hour.\nMore About This Show\nLong before Amy became savvy sexy social, she was a youngster in Ohio. And believe it or not, she was NOT a ham! Amy says her mom doesn\u2019t have any photos of her as a child because she threw them all away\u2026Amy was not a fan of the camera growing up.\nTo hear how that changed, we discuss Amy\u2019s previous life prior to Savvy Sexy Social. While earning her degree in political science at Ohio State University, Amy went to work for a law firm to see if she really wanted to be a lawyer \u201cwhen she grew up\u201d.\nFor the first 1.5 years at the firm, she was a receptionist (which she hated). But when the newly-elected governor of the state took office, she convinced the law firm to let her work on his fundraising campaign. And for the next 4 years, that\u2019s what she did and she learned a tremendous amount about working with people and in her words, common sense.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tWhat is veda?\n\tThe proper mindset to create before writing an email or shooting a video.\n\tWhat\u2019s the sexy in savvy, sexy social?\n\tWhat is B roll and when do you use it?\n\tWho should be vlogging today?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAbout three years into that position, Amy found the wonderful world of marketing and something inside of her was lit.\nLike so many solopreneurs face on their journey, Amy was at a critical juncture. She could either continue her work, she had a great job with good money and she really enjoyed it; or, she could follow her heart and her gut and go on her own. She knew she had to make the leap into this industry and she had to do it with her own business.\nAmy had come to that all-important moment: she was about to become unemployable.\nHer next step was to take a portfolio-building gig at Bath and Body Works as a copywriter. She says it was great for about a month and then it was a catastrophe.\nSo she created her vlog and began sharing herself with the world via video. She had become an ardent fan of YouTube and had watched enough videos to know what made one good and the other not as good.\nShe also knew she wanted to position herself as a thought leader and she needed to let the world know who she was and what she was about. Amy knew the key was offering her audience an inside look that showed people why she was different, a powerful story-telling technique. She knew she\u2019d find her tribe this way.\nAnd so began her vlogging journey, a journey that has given her tremendous knowledge about the video world, who should be creating videos and why, what works and what doesn\u2019t - all of which she shares in this episode.\nHowever one of the greatest lessons she gives is to just get started. And as long as you\u2019re committed to creating great videos, you\u2019ll figure it out along the way. Just do it, put it out there and learn as you go. Whether creating videos or not, that\u2019s a critical lesson we can all come back to at every juncture in our businesses.\nAmy was such a fun guest, I really loved having her on the show.

He is the best-selling author of numerous books, and a top-ranked speaker who takes\u00a0complex subjects like marketing and sales promotion and distills them down into easy-to-use information.\n\nBefore today's guest was a boat-loving, best-selling author and speaker, he landed acting gigs on shows and movies you've probably watched like \"Law and Order\", \"Sex and The City\", \"Third Watch\" and \"The Pelican Brief\" among others. Why he left acting, how he became unemployable and how he's used adverse situations like his own dyslexia to propel his success are all topics we touch on - and much more of course - on this edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nDespite his early guest roles on numerous famous TV shows and movies, Michael was unhappy with how long it was taking him to \"make it\" as an actor. So he moved into the corporate world with a job in business management in the fitness industry.\n\nAfter five years in that role\u00a0and doing quite well,\u00a0he\u00a0ventured back into the entertainment industry with a film company. But the moment he stepped foot in the studio, he was planning his exit strategy. The environment was simply unpleasant and he wasn't willing to subject himself to that.\u00a0It was\u00a0while working at this company that he realized he was \"unemployable\".\n\nFor his next gig, he knew\u00a0he would need\u00a0a position where he was in control, and the most obvious answer was to be his own boss. That was the point when he started his 1 on 1 coaching business.\u00a0Even though he had no idea what it meant to have a coaching business, he jumped in. For the first few years he treated it like a \"job\" before he realized he could\u00a0create any life he dreamt of.\nTo break out of that mold,\u00a0he took\u00a0the knowledge he had gained\u00a0in his various roles and how he \"tweaked\" things a bit along the way,\u00a0and he chose to share those lessons with the public through speaking gigs. His\u00a0professional training as an actor allowed him to make the transition with ease.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tThe strategy to use for travel write-offs.\n\tWhat is The Red Velvet Rope Strategy and how does it apply to your business?\n\tDoes marketing get you clients? Michael weighs in.\n\tWhy it's a mistake to look too far ahead.\n\tHow to avoid your customers having buyers' remorse.\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\nBut, as he had done so often in the past, he\u00a0\"tweaked\" one aspect of his public speaking gig. He knew he didn't want to be on the road all the time so he used public speaking as a promotional tool, not as the sole foundation of his business. In fact, now when he does his annual projections he doesn't include revenue from speaking. Anything he generates from that area is simply a bonus; he doesn't have to rely on it and he created his business that way from the start. That's a great lesson all of us can use: you can take a strategy and tweak it to fit your needs and desires.\nIn his role as business owner and solopreneur, he had to learn to switch his mindset to creating life on his own terms and avoiding a lot of travel while speaking was one of his first steps.\nAnother topic we touch on is\u00a0the concept of maximizers vs. satisfyers.\u00a0Barry Schwartz's book The Paradox of Choice: Why Less Is More talks about this idea in depth.\nBut as it relates to successful solopreneurship, a satisfyer is who you want to become.\u00a0Here's an example that illustrates the differences between the two: a maximizer will spend 2 hours picking out a pair of sunglasses while a satisfyer will be fine with a pair of glasses that fit properly and look good. They'll spend as little time as possible on everyday choices and decisions. It's a concept worth exploring as solopreneurs.\n\nAnother similar thread Michael and I discuss is\u00a0your time vs money conversation: how much is your time worth?\u00a0Spending three hours doing your laundry isn't the best u...", "duration": "1:05:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/135.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Great Books", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael Port", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Outsourcing", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Author", "Book Yourself Solid", "Business", "Entrepreneur", "Hustle", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1404934375, "title": "134: Find Your Swing with DawnMarrs.com", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Welcome back to our most frequent and beloved co-hosts, DawnMarrs.com! Dawn joins us live in the studio to answer listeners' questions in this episode of Find Your Swing. This is the tenth edition of Find Your Swing and we're excited to share insights, suggestions and guidance with those of you who asked questions about your personal solopreneur journey.\nMore About This Show\nSince it's been a minute (more like 3 months!) since we chatted with Dawn, we had a quick catch up to start the show. She filled us in on what's been going on in her life,\u00a0including how the California wildfires impacted her and her family. Almost everything they owned was ruined either by fire, smoke or soot. We're so grateful she and her loved ones are safe and sound. And to officially thank her and welcome her back, we brought her to Studio 86 today to answer your questions.\nSo let's jump right in and hear what's going on with all of you!\nOur first question came from Dave Tooney, a member of SoloLab. Dave wanted to know how to connect with and network with folks using online methods. He lives in a not-so-entrepreneurial region and needed some ideas on how to find people, build relationships and grow his business in an online way. And we told him the Gary V approach works great in his situation: find Facebook groups and become the go-to person in them by providing value in that group. You can build a reputation and a true, trusting connection with your audience this way.\nThe next question was from Taylor and he wants to know how to scratch his solopreneur itch. He's got a great job with a marketing firm that pays him well and he enjoys it but he's always wanted to build his own thing. He has many interests so we suggest two things: Choose the interest that you can imagine talking about, thinking about and being involved in for the next 5 years. Once you've picked that thing, remember you are good enough and you do know enough! Then listen to episode 133 for the 8 steps and follow them...you'll be on your way.\nOur third write-in is from Dreama. She is a registered nurse who has an interest in alternative health for chronic conditions. She wants to start a podcast but thinks she needs to narrow down a topic. Both Dawn and I agree, she needs to niche down into a specific focus. Once she's done that, she can play up her nursing background to show her expertise and work on building a community of followers. She - and every solopreneur - really only needs about 100 people to make a six-figure income and we explain how.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tCan podcasts and other subject material be considered \"one of the five people you surround yourself with\"?\n\tHow\u00a0to create a connection by courting your mentors.\n\tWhy you only need 100 people in your tribe to make a six-figure income.\n\tHow to connect and engage an audience that isn't\u00a0on social media.\n\tWhy creating a repeat customer is easier than acquiring a new one: Dawn explains.\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe fourth question comes from\u00a0Michael. He has created a passive income from a previous endeavor and is now building \u00a0a business based on helping large companies with their AdWords campaigns. But he is often approached by smaller companies; he cannot work with them because his fee structure is based on a percentage of the ad spend. Smaller companies don't spend enough to make it feasible for him but he wants to offer a course or something to help those companies and to create an additional income source for himself.

Are you in that just getting started phase? Or are you in a place where you\u2019re focused on specific growth for your solo journey? Or do you even know what your solo venture is going to be?\nWherever you are, it\u2019s perfect. And you\u2019ll hear how I went through all of these stages with this podcast to garner the success it has today.\u00a0These stages are laid out in detail through the 8 steps it takes to becoming a successful solopreneur.\n\nThe 8 Steps To Becoming A Successful Solopreneur:\n\n\tFind your passion. What's that thing that you can talk me off my stool about it? What did you do as a kid? Find it and figure out how to connect it to something that will make you money.\n\tImmerse yourself in the culture: Facebook groups, forums, message boards, conventions, read blogs, magazines, events. Get there!\n\tSeek knowledge. Take online courses, join a mastermind like SoloLab. Also write very specific questions to your mentors.\n\tMake a decision to take action. There will always be reasons not to - do it anyway!\n\tSurround yourself with the leaders. You need to be at ALL the events - get there and get connected with the people doing what you want to do!\n\tTake more action.\n\tShow gratitude.\n\tGive back. Pay it forward. Whether it\u2019s sharing your knowledge with others or simply buying a coffee for the person behind you at Starbucks, pay it forward.\n\nPodcasting is a medium I\u2019ve always been a fan of and I learned the ropes by producing a show called \u201cThe Kick-Ass Life\u201d with David Wood. And one day, while connecting with one of our favorite podcasting leaders Mr. Pat Flynn and seeking knowledge from him, I had the idea for The Solopreneur Hour.\nAnd then I took action (number 4); I created this podcast and decided I would have 12 in the can (so to speak) before I launched. Shortly after I had recorded four episodes, I was on my bike and was side-swiped by a car. My injuries were pretty extensive: broken collarbone, concussion and severe road rash over much of my body.\nBut my launch date was looming and even though I could barely sit up straight because I was in so much pain, I pulled the trigger and the show went live.\nAnd that was just the beginning. From there, it was a series of download milestones that I used as a barometer. From my experience with David Wood, I knew I wanted to monetize the show so getting a certain amount of downloads was critical to that.\nFirst it was the 100 download day. Then it was 1,000. Then it was 10,000.\nThose numbers progressed because I was following steps\u00a05, 6 and 7 of successful solopreneurship. I went to more events like NMX. I took more action through leveraging my social media outlets. And I was - and still AM - incredibly grateful for every download, every listener and every person who shares this show.\nAnd I\u2019m always looking for and finding ways to pay it forward.\nTo that end, I\u2019d like to share the shout outs from a few listeners and SoloLab members now. These guys all left messages about what this show has meant for them, both personally and professionally.\nMatt\nMatt called in to say thanks for helping him double his income, and start two new solo ventures.

And Mike Michalowicz, author of Profit First and co-host part deux, tells us why this is a pipe dream for 99% of all businesses and how we should pay ourselves today so we can profit first.\n\nMore About This Show\nA lot of people building small businesses and start-ups dream of the day when they\u2019ll be bought out by the Googles and Apples of the world. And they often sacrifice everything til that magical day arrives.\u00a0The reality is less than 1% of start-ups actualize this fantasy. So what do you do if you\u2019re not in that 1%? How do make sure you\u2019re paid properly and you run a healthy, thriving business?\nThere is the old-fashioned route of sales minus expenses = profits? Or do go the new path and pay ourselves first before doing anything else with our money?\nMike says to pay ourselves first, then take out expenses and set aside those profits to pay ourselves later! He believes solopreneurs should be only spending about 10-20% on operating expenses (staff, advertising, other overhead). And we should be taking up to 60% for income and for profits!\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tMnemonics: what is it and how does he use it?\n\tThe Porsche branding lesson and how to be memorable.\n\tWhat does he do to compete against his internal Imposter?\n\t\u00a0What will make his new book a success in his eyes?\n\tThe audiobook double dip lesson: what it will teach you about your business.\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\nMike\u2019s reasoning for doing it this way is two-fold: 1. You are an employee of your business so you need to be paid as such. 2. You are an owner and a shareholder in your business, therefore you deserve to receive profits.\nMike says we need to focus on making profit a DAILY habit! We should create small successes daily as well as making small sacrifices (instead of not paying ourselves for 10 years while we wait for Google to notice us). And when we do that, we\u2019ll string together a very healthy lifestyle, financially and personally.\nAnd his newest book, Profit First, is all about how to do this.\nBut why is he someone we should listen to? As we discussed on his first visit to the show, he has successfully built and sold previous businesses. And then he lost it all. As Mike will tell you, he has seen both sides of the coin: the highs of financial highs and the lowest of financial lows.\nWe chat about the content of his book, of course, but also what it\u2019s like for him to write and market it. This is his third book and he\u2019s got the rhythm down! He says it takes him about 2 years to write a book and then he leans heavily on the influencers in his network to help him promote it, including speaking publicly which is another of his passions.\nMike was a terrific second-time visitor to the show; he\u2019s always so much fun and full of awesome knowledge.

And money is the tool that gives us that freedom.\nSo says Andrew Fiebert of the Money Matters podcast and he joins us for episode 131 to talk about how to be smart about our money and the basics of finance for solopreneurs.\n\nMore About This Show\nAs is so often the case, Andrew didn\u2019t start out in his current industry. Back in 2008, he was working for an investment brokerage firm called Lehman\u00a0Brothers. Some of you may know what happened to that firm, but for those of you, the firm made some bad investment decisions and eventually went out of business. Naturally, all of their employees lost their jobs and Andrew was one of them.\nEven though he was completely removed from the numbers/investment side of the company as a tech person, he was still impacted. He realized that unless he was personally in control of his income, his livelihood would always be at risk.\nHe set out to educate himself and one day while ranting online about the lack of financial education in our society, he realized he could do something about the very thing he was ranting about and so his podcast was born.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tWhat's the monetary\u00a0amount proven to provide\u00a0peak happiness?\n\tThe difference between being rich and being wealthy.\n\tThe myth of \"passive income\u201d, according to Andrew.\n\tTo LLC or not LLC? He shares his personal strategy.\n\tWhat\u2019s the 4% rule and why should you use it?\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\nAndrew\u2019s financial interest seems to pre-date his time on Wall Street though. His father opted to go into the finance industry when Andrew was born and his parents lived quite frugally, even after they had a comfortable income.\nWhen his financial interest resurfaced after being released from Lehman\u00a0Brothers, he began researching and finding useful tools like Mint.com and Betterment.com. In this show, he tells us why he uses each and what they do for his bottom line.\nWe also discuss money-saving tips for you at home like dropping that expensive cable package and opting for things like Apple TV or Googlecast. You can also replace your light bulbs through your local energy company, many of whom will sell you energy-efficient bulbs at a steep discount.\nAnd what about car payments? Did you know the average American spends over $400 a month on their car payment alone? If you\u2019re looking for a way to lower your overhead, that would be a good place to start.\nThere are a few main points Andrew wants to get across to you in terms of your finances: you have to know where you are spending your money (Mint.com is perfect for this), how much you are investing (Betterment.com can help) and what your process & strategy are for getting that money out (this is where you apply the 4% rule).\nIf you want to be well on your way to financial independence, Andrew and I have your back. This show gives you tips and techniques to take control of your money and better manage it, both of which are incredibly important to live the life of freedom you are aiming for!\nAs an added bonus, Andrew gives us some really awesome schwag here!\nVisit our sponsors:\nSwiftly\nFresh Books -\u00a0Enter \"Solopreneur\" in the \"How Did You Find Us\" Section\n\n\u00a0\nResources from this episode:\nAndrew\u2019s web site\nAndrew on Twitter\nMint.com\nBetterment\nThe Sexy Six\nRahmit Sehti and Tim Ferriss on finances\nFidelity Cash Management Account\nWorld Domination Summit\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\u00a0I\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\u00a0If you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.

We gathered to talk about his latest book, Virtual Freedom, as well as the topic he\u2019s known around the globe for: outsourcing.\nChris has built an empire based on his knowledge and experience of working with virtual assistants. Not so long ago, he was a micro-managing boss working 15+ hours a day. As you can imagine, he was nearly burnt out. So he decided it was time to replace himself and become a virtual CEO.\nIt was through that experience of replacing himself that he became an expert and built three thriving companies focused on outsourcing. Today he travels the globe helping others do the same through speaking engagements, live mastermind events and his latest book.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tThe pros and cons of traditional publishing and self-publishing\n\tWhy did Chris choose not to read his book for the audio version?\n\tHow fast did his first in-person mastermind event sell out?\n\t3 lists to freedom: what are the three?\n\tWhen do you know it's time to outsource?\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\nChris and I chat about his book, what it was like to write it, edit it and now market it. He has some terrific insights on how the publishing world has changed in recent years and what it takes to actually land a publishing deal today - it\u2019s quite a bit different than it was just a decade ago!\u00a0He also shares what prompted the book and why it was so important to him to get his message out now.\nAnd then we\u00a0talk about the nitty-gritty on outsourcing, we get into the meat and potatoes of it! As a self-professed micromanager, Chris understands it can be difficult to let go and he has some suggestions on how you can choose which tasks to give to someone else, how to find the right person to work with and when to hire them.\u00a0He also says it\u2019s never too early to start thinking of what you can outsource; you will know when it\u2019s the right time to offload some of your work, because your body will tell you!\nAnd since we never stay on just one topic on this show, Chris and I also talk about his love of all things Bruce Lee and martial arts as well as why podcasting is in its infancy and what that means for current and future podcasters.\nWhether you're an up and coming podcaster, a solopreneur suffocating under mounds of tasks and an ever-growing workload you can't do on your own anymore or you're simply intrigued by the idea of being your own virtual CEO, this show with Chris will have loads and loads of information for you.\nI always know Chris will bring the goods and this show was no different!\u00a0As a special bonus, any of our listeners who buy his Virtual Freedom book can get a free companion workbook when they email a copy of their receipt to his VA, Jam (jam @ chrisducker.com).

I'm really excited he could join us to share his secrets.\nMore About This Show\nAs long as he\u2019s been able to hold a crayon to paper, Sean has wanted to be an artist. But there was no great push from his parents to attend 20 art classes by age 8 or anything like that. His mom was given some sage advice early on to just allow him to enjoy art and when he asked for classes, then sign him up but not before.\nAs a result, Sean made art a part of who is he and not just what he does. In school, he was always looking for a way to angle art into whatever he was doing. Eventually through a friend he got into comic books and the art within that genre.\nNever one to be slowed down by his youth, Sean had published his first book by the 10th grade he had published his first book and was doing comic book signings at a local store on Wednesday nights. As we say on The Solopreneur Hour, he was quite \u201csavanty\u201d.\nBut as he made the rounds to comic book conventions, one of the things that struck him was how miserable and underpaid so many comic book artists were. He refused to be one of them and was committed to bucking that trend. And buck it he did!\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tWhat came first for Sean: business savvy or the tour concept?\n\tWhy you should make everything as easy as possible for your customers.\n\tWhy he draws a line when he monetizes his art.\n\tThe Van Halen brown M&amp;Ms story and why it matters to your business.\n\tWhy his artistic collaborations are outselling his original pieces.\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the things that shifted his perspective on the business side of art, was making his art live and in person at various events. He saw too many artists struggling to get into art galleries - and then giving those galleries 50% of their commissions in return for very little from the galleries. He didn't want to go that route.\nInstead he decided to take his art on the road and create it live at different events, in every possible industry!\u00a0And that's when\u00a0Sean\u2019s business really started to take off. One of the reasons this strategy works so well for him is because making art live for people is a performance piece and because of the \"sneak peek\" vibe it creates. Everyone\u00a0wants a beyond-the-scenes look at how art comes into being. Not many of us can create beautiful art so we\u2019re fascinated by how the artist\u00a0produces their pieces.\nSean has used this strategy for the last 15 years and he's worked extensively to build his audience and his name through live events.\u00a0At\u00a0one point in his career, he was creating live art 6 nights a week, at one event or another.\nHappily, he is now at a point where he chooses when and where he takes his art on the road.\nAnd when he\u2019s at his event, he is ON. He knows that he\u2019ll make more sales by being engaged and connected with his audience. And that\u2019s\u00a0a valuable lesson\u00a0every solopreneur needs to know: authentic connection is the key to sales and future sales, whether you're an artist or in any other profession.\nAnother valuable lesson Sean passes on in this episode is how he scaled his business. He often creates a piece of art for people while they watch.\u00a0When he's finished, one person buys the original and others buy the duplicates.

Thinking three days a week. Niche = cosplay. 2 days a week I will interview cosplayers, the other day I want to interview experts in other fields that can help level up a \"cospreneur\". My problem lays that this brings in two different avatars. The fans of the famous cosplayers arent really my target audience. Im trying to reach cosplayers that only have a Facebook presence and no other platform. One who wants to earn an income or other benefit. Is this two different podcasts? If not what would you do\n\nMax Mac Phail Video blogging, how long is too long? What do you think of mixed content, sometimes blog, others a video or a video accompanying a small amount of text.

Mark Costes is an entrepreneur turned dentist turned multi-millionaire and he\u2019s sharing his secrets on this edition of The Solopreneur Hour.\nOne of the real keys to his business (besides the fact that he's pretty much \"The E-Myth Revisited\" in living color, is that he pays SO MUCH ATTENTION to small, minute details that make a HUGE difference for his clients.\nMore About This Show\nThe fact that Mark Costes is an entrepreneur isn\u2019t a big surprise. Just take a look at his family lineage and you\u2019d guess he\u2019d end up working for himself.\nHis dad\u2019s story is similar to many immigrants: he had a great career in his home country of the Phillippines as a professor, which he left to live in the United States. Coming over with not much more than a hundred dollars and a suitcase, Mark\u2019s dad rebuilt his life with a lot of hustle and willpower.\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, Mark\u2019s mother\u2019s side also boasts several successful entrepreneurs. His grandma was a loan shark who sent his mom out to collect payments! She, Mark\u2019s grandma, also had a prawn business (that\u2019s shrimp if you\u2019re from the States), a fleet of rental cars among other businesses.\nTo say entrepreneurism is in his blood might be an understatement; it\u2019s more like his blood IS entrepreneurism.\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that by the age of 23, Mark ran a lucrative food truck business and was also pursuing his MBA.\nBut while he was doing all of that, he was still dreaming of becoming a dentist. So much so that he applied to dentist school 20 times before he was accepted! Clearly Mark was not going to be deterred from his dream, no matter what.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tHow he builds rapport and a connection while seeing 40 patients a day.\n\tThe Yellow Sheet: what is it and how does it pertain to your business?\n\tHow his mindset is different from other dentists, and why it matters.\n\tThe day he became a millionaire - and why he sold 4 of his 6 practices the very next day.\n\tHow he lost almost 7 figures in the process - in one year.\n\tAnd so very much more!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter he completed his dentist school, he did something hardly any other dentists do: for the next year he worked as an associate in a friend\u2019s practice and spent his off-hours learning the ropes of the business. He learned the systems and learned how the office actually made money.\nBeing the solopreneur he is, he took that knowledge and applied it to his own practice; he didn\u2019t build just one, he built six! And one day his accountant told him to check his financial statements. When Mark did, he realized he had earned his first million dollars that year.\nThe only problem? He was working 80 hours a week and had a wife, a child and another child on the way. It was time for a shift.\nAnd shift he did. He began investing in different businesses, none of which took off. But he eventually created a curriculum to train dentistry assistants, he also trains other dentists on how to create passive income in their practices and has a mastermind group.\nMark is truly a shining example of turning a traditional service-based profession into a business with passive income streams. And in this episode, he talks us through the steps he has taken (and the missteps), to be where he is today.\nLeave a comment below for Mark and let him know you learned from him about your business.\n\nPlease Visit Our Sponsors For Today's Episode:\nGodaddy - $1.99 Domain Names\nGodaddy - 28% Off Your Entire Order!\n\nSwiftly - Just $19 For Super Quick Design Work!\n\nEpisode Resources\nMark's web site\nMark\u00a0on Facebook\nAmici Pet Hospital\nBlock Fitness\n\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?

Humans are hard-wired to have first impressions of each other; often, we\u2019re not even conscious of doing so.\nBut we can consciously shift our behaviors to create a positive first impression, which can lead to deeper, more meaningful connections with others.\nJoining us for episode 124 to talk about how is Jordan Harbinger from The Art of Charm.\nMore About This Show\nIf you took two people and compared how they entered a room, you most certainly would make assessments and create your own impression of who that person is, how successful they are and whether or not you\u2019d like to get to know them. \u00a0And Jordan Harbinger says we all do this, it's human nature.\nBecause it's part of who we are, we can also use this to our advantage. We can all learn\u00a0how to create great first impressions, and build on those impressions for\u00a0stronger, more satisfying relationships.\nHelping people make the most of these tendencies is what The\u00a0Art of Charm is all about.\nThe business' origins are a direct result of his interest\u00a0in the self-help arena. He read everything he could get his hands on and then began interviewing the authors behind these books. Sadly, he found many of them to lack authenticity and true personal charm. Many of them were flat out manufactured personalities, drawn up to pitch a concept and sell books. But he continued to read and meet with the authors he liked until he found who was the real deal and the secrets to connection, communication and authentic relationship rapport.\nAnd it was from those conversations, with the authors who walked their talk, that The Art of Charm was born.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tWhy your \"it\" is never \"it\".\n\tJordan\u2019s trick with a pencil to get you out of a bad mood.\n\tHow to shift from \u201csituational confidence\u201d to confidence in every situation.\n\tIs there a Renaissance resurgence for men?\n\tThe ATM Receipt Attraction project.\n\tAnd loads more!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDespite a great job on Wall Street, Jordan continued to grow the podcast\u2019s audience. With his and his business partner\u2019s fair share of hustle, Jordan grew The Art of Charm\u2019s audience so large that Sirius (now Sirius XM Radio) took notice.\nAnd it was a good thing they did. When the real estate bubble burst, Jordan lost his Wall Street gig and poured everything he had into the podcast. There was such a high demand from their podcasting audience that they grew a coaching curriculum and developed a residential program in his Manhattan loft. Today The Art of Charm has multiple coaching programs, books, in-person trainings as well as thrice-weekly podcasts.\nClearly The Art of Charm isn't just another\u00a0smarmy podcast\u00a0teaching guys how to pick up women (ala VH1\u2019s The Pick-Up Artist).\nIn fact, it\u2019s far more than that. It\u2019s about losing your insecurities and establishing habits that build powerful personal beliefs that serve you.\u00a0 At its core, The Power of Charm is about becoming more authentic in all of your relationships, from business to personal.

Even as an employee, he had always had a side hustle.

And who better to learn from than the woman engineering ads for people like John Lee Dumas and Nick Unsworth?\nValerie Shoopman is the go-to woman for Facebook advertising\u00a0campaigns and she joins the show for episode 122. We talk about how to construct a Facebook campaign, how to create a budget for it as well as her plans for her two podcasts.\nMore About This Show\nValerie\u2019s Facebook know-how is rooted in two of her earlier careers: as a teacher and as a technical support customer contact for a surveying company.\nAs a teacher, she discovered everyone relates and learns in different ways; she found how to connect and reach everyone in an audience, by whatever medium worked best for them.\nAnd as a technical support contact, she was constantly seeing the evolvement of the surveying company\u2019s software as it reflected the requests and the needs of the company\u2019s customers. She learned how to see and how to figure things out faster than other people.\nSo when Nick Unsworth urged her to specialize in Facebook marketing, she took his advice, applied her experience and saw her business blossom.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tHow to spend a $1,000 to make $3,500.\n\tThe critical need for tracking.\n\tImages, headlines, copy: in which order does Valerie test these?\n\tWhat it takes to write a great ad.\n\tHer ninja move for advertising to your opt-ins on Facebook.\n\nIn this show, Valerie and I dive deep into what makes a Facebook ad a success and specific advice she has for creating a profitable campaign for your product.\nWe talk about things like choosing the proper demographics for your ad: create a separate ad for people\u2019s different likes. So for example if you are targeting people who have liked Pat Flynn and John Lee Dumas, create two different ads: one for Pat Flynn likers and one for John Lee Dumas fans.\nValerie also gives us the keys to selecting the proper image for your ad: it\u2019s vital to tap into people\u2019s mindsets when they are on Facebook. In other words, don\u2019t use a stock photo or an image of someone in a suit and tie! That\u2019s not going to appeal to Facebook users because they\u2019re there to connect with family and friends.\nI also share with\u00a0Val a few pointers on producing and launching her upcoming podcasts: including my thoughts on audio vs. video, the four key areas to grow a podcast\u2019s downloads after New & Noteworthy and the two trends I see in the industry right now.\nThat gives you a glimpse of how much info is covered in this show - get your Evernote handy because you\u2019re going to need it!

Raj Bhakta, our guest for episode 120.\nRaj is the consummate solopreneur: he has recreated himself and his path several times over in the last decade and we talk about the ups, the downs and the merit it takes to reinvent yourself as he has done.\nMore About This Show\nRaj is a Philadelphia-native whose early career days were in the family business of hotels. On a whim, a friend convinced Raj to apply to be on the second season of The Apprentice. Though he wasn\u2019t interested in reality TV, Raj saw it as an opportunity to gracefully bow out of his family\u2019s line of work and as a chance to learn from Donald Trump.\nAfter spending an interminable day waiting for his casting call, Raj made an impression on the people casting the show and he was brought on.\nThough he was fired during the course of the show, he learned a lot which he carried into the next stage of his career.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tHow WhistlePig Whiskey got its name.\n\tCharacter and smoothness: the lessons from whiskey that apply to people too.\n\tHow quickly did he create WhistlePig after he had the idea?\n\tThe necessity of adversity in business and in life.\n\tWhat did he do with an elephant and a mariachi band?\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nAfter The Apprentice, Raj gave politics a shot and ran for Congress. He was beaten soundly. On the heels of two defeats, he took off for the hills of Vermont and made his home on a large farm where he secluded himself to recover and regroup. With only books to keep him company, Raj had his share of \u201cdark nights of the soul\u201d in which he didn\u2019t know what to do next.\nAnd when the economy tanked and his funds began to dwindle, he knew he had to do something and do it fast. His farmland made him think of grains and what comes from grains that is a solidly profitable product? Alcohol.\nRaj knew beer and wine were both over saturated markets. But whiskey wasn\u2019t. He saw the opportunity to combine his two passions: whiskey and solopreneurship.\nWith the help and guidance of a friend and other confidantes, Raj set about creating the finest rye whiskey possible. And today his efforts have yielded Whistle Pig Whiskey, which was given the highest rating of a whiskey clocking in at 96 by Wine Spectator. For those of you not into wine ratings, that\u2019s phenomenal!\nWith or without his latest success, Raj is a true solopreneur. He has faced adversity, lived through some dark times and reinvented himself time and time again to do what he loves.\nJoin me in thanking Raj for being on the show!

In fact, she\u2019s done it so well she\u2019s turned it into her own brand and message.\nWith a background in journalism, Dorie was hit hard by the economic recession that began in the early part of the 2000\u2019s. The day before 9/11, Dorie lost her job as a newspaper journalist. For the next six months she took whatever freelance gig that came her way and waited on the verbal promises of newspaper publishers that they would hire her just as soon as she could.\nAll of that changed when she was offered a role as the press secretary for Robert Reich\u2019s bid for the governorship of Massachusetts. Her initial response to the offer was to turn it down, but she changed her mind when she realized her original plan was no longer going to work. She took the role and began a stint in politics with Reich and later with Howard Dean.\nYou'll also discover things like: \n\n\tHow to tell the story of your transition.\n\tThe 3 major steps of the reinvention process.\n\tHow to become an expert in your field according to Dorie.\n\tWhat comes first: the brand or the voice?\n\tHer experience giving a Google Talk.\n\tAnd lots more!\n\nDorie later piggybacked off her political experience to teach at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, to blog for Entrepreneur magazine, the Harvard Business Review and Forbes. She\u2019s also authored a book called Reinventing You: Define Your Brand, Imagine Your Future.\nAnd she\u2019s done all of this by reinventing herself, pivoting when needed and creating relationships with the most successful people she could connect with.\nIn this episode, Dorie and I talk about how to add value to those powerful people you want to emulate as well as the power of creating your own voice and your own brand. Dorie has done all of the above and she shares plenty of actionable steps you can take to follow in her successful footsteps.\nIf you got as much out of this show as I did, drop Dorie a message on Twitter and let her know!

He tells this when he speaks and when he interviews people on his podcast: you won\u2019t be good when you start, but keep doing it and you will definitely get better.\nAnd his podcast is meant to serve as a motivator for you when you\u2019re starting out and when you\u2019re practicing to get better. By interviewing different people in a variety of different professions, Grant wants to expose his listeners who feel stuck and unhappy with where they\u2019re at now. He aims to reach people experiencing a \u201cquarter life crisis\u201d and help them through that crisis by showing them what\u2019s out and what they can do with their careers.\nIf you\u2019ve been inspired by Grant and learned something from today\u2019s show, leave a comment below or send a Tweet sharing what you got out of today\u2019s episode!\n\n Episode Resources\nGrant's web site\nGrant's podcast\nGrant\u00a0on Twitter\nSophie Slesinger on Grant's podcast\nTalking Funny\nHilarious by Louis C.K.\nRosie Tran on The Solopreneur Hour\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\n\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/117.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Comedian", "Grant Baldwin", "Guests", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Marketing", "podcast", "Solopreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1401253221, "title": "116: Franco Gonzalez \u2013 Successfully Creating and Serving Your Tribe", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Who actually makes it in network marketing?

As Andy describes it, NLP works by updating your internal software. Much like a computer\u2019s software system, our brains are run by programming. And if that programming isn\u2019t giving us the life we want, we can use NLP to upgrade our software.\nNeuro-linguistic programming can be used to strengthen our neurology, just like we strengthen our body's muscles. We all have about 50,000 thoughts a day and for a significant percentage of the population, most of those 50,000 thoughts are negative.\nBy using NLP, we can retrain those thought patterns and begin producing new outcomes and new results in any (or every) area of our lives.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tWhy you have to learn the basics, no matter what you're doing.\n\tHow he lost everything and why it was one of the best things that ever happened to him.\n\tIf you're stuck, Andy gives you an exercise to do.\n\tWhat is anchoring and why is it relevant to your business?\n\tAndy's morning routine for success!\n\tAnd much, much more.\n\nIn this episode, Andy shares with us background as a solopreneur and offers some practical NLP techniques we can use right now to alter our thoughts and change our behaviors - so we can produce the life we want.\nThough the bulk of our discussion is about NLP, Andy also introduced us to who he is and where he\u2019s been. He shares his own story in a frank and personal way, about his professional and personal life. He talks about anxiety and being in the midst of a nervous breakdown, overcoming all of that to landing where he is today: designing his life and living it the fullest as a true solopreneur.\nHave a listen and then let us know in the comments or on Twitter, what\u00a0 are you going to use NLP to change in your life?\n\n Episode Resources\nAndy's\u00a0web site\nAndy on Twitter\nEpisode 38: You're Probably In Sales, But Don't Realize It\nHow to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less\nSoloLab: A Unique Mastermind\nJon Jones\n\n\u00a0\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\n\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\n\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)", "duration": "1:17:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/113.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Great Books", "Guests", "Health", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Offline Marketing", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Real Estate", "Social Media", "Coaching", "Entrepreneur", "Marketing", "podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1400517366, "title": "112: You can DO This!!!\u00a0(& Listener Facebook Questions)", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "One of the hardest things about launching a solopreneur business is realizing that you possess the knowledge, support, and skillset to be successful. \u00a0We all have this habit of second-guessing ourselves, and then we suffer from \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d, and we don\u2019t end up doing anything.\n\nThe key is learning when \u201cenough is enough\u201d, and you can launch.\n\nIn this solo episode of the Solopreneur Hour, I cover:\n\n\tHow to tell if you\u2019re ready to launch.\n\tHow much \u201crunway\u201d is enough?\n\tThe future of podcasting\n\tHow to market on Social Media\n\tThe impact networking has on success\n\tWhat I use for time management\n\tIn this show I answer a lot of questions from Facebook, tell you how the Mini is doing, and explain the \u201ccough\u201d. :)\n\nPlease, do me a favor and visit our sponsor, Godaddy:\n\n$2.95 Domain Names:\u00a0http://www.godaddy.com/?isc=solo295\n25% off new products:\u00a0http://www.godaddy.com/?isc=solo25\n\nAnd if you wouldn\u2019t mind, please visit PodSurvey and fill this sucker out: \u00a0http://podsurvey.com/solohour\n\nThanks!", "duration": "57:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/112.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Guests", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Network Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Facebook", "Listener", "Mindset", "Questions"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1400208591, "title": "111: The Internal Drive to Succeed, with Danielle Rae", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "One of the largest groups of solopreneurs out there is those who are working\u00a0in the beauty industry: hairdressers, massage therapists, aestheticians, etc. These people know what it\u2019s like to hustle, how to build a client base and grow their business from the ground up.\nBut how can you work in this field and NOT solely trade time for dollars?

Without profits, you really don\u2019t have much of a business. And many of us have little financial education so we don\u2019t know how to generate sustainable profits.\nTo resolve that issue for us is our guest for episode 109, Mike Michalowicz. Having built and sold two multi-million dollar business early in his career, Mike is a man we can all learn from. In this episode we talk comedy, finances and the joys of being a scrappy solopreneur.\nMore About This Show\nThroughout his career, Mike has almost always been an entrepreneur or solopreneur. However, he did hold two jobs in the past. He was so unemployable at that point that even though he stayed on as an employee after Robert Half International bought his company, he was fired from his role one year later!\nFollowing his natural inclinations as a solopreneur, Mike has explored a variety of media outlets. He created a TV show pilot, hosted news segments on MSNBC and also shared the stage as a keynote speaker with such notables as Guy Kawaski and Michael Gerber.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tExploiting your inner savant and how it\u2019ll help you find your niche.\n\tWhy business plans don\u2019t work.\n\tHis thoughts on how to get started in business with little or no money.\n\tWhy your lack of money in the early stages of your business is actually a GOOD thing.\n\tHis technique to becoming more profitable and how to apply it.\n\tWhy he doesn\u2019t mind when people copy him.\n\nOriginally I connected with Mike after I stumbled upon his web site, the copy was so cheeky and funny that I reached out to him; I wanted to know if he had written it himself. Indeed he had and after having him on the show, it was clear the copy merely reflects who Mike is as a person. It\u2019s what we like to call brand consistency and it\u2019s one of the keys to his success.\nIf you enjoyed hearing Mike on this show, send us a Tweet or leave a comment below about your favorite takeaway: maybe you scrapped your business plan or set up your bank accounts.

Is it nothing but red carpets and glitter? Here to shed some light on the real life of a successful writer in Hollywood is the talented Dean Lorey.\nDean has been a writer for such smash TV hits as\u00a0 \u201cArrested Development\u201d (one of my personal favorites), \u201cThe Crazy Ones\u201d and \u201cMy Wife and Kids\u201d. He also penned the script for Major Payne, among other films. In episode 106, Dean joined the show to talk about his early days at NYC, how he co-wrote Fitness Confidential with Vinnie Tortorich and what he has done over the years to thrive as a writer in Hollywood.\nMore About This Show\nHailing from Conyers, Georgia, Dean went straight to NYU to\u00a0follow his passion for writing in its the hallowed halls. Some of his\u00a0fellow classmates included comedian Adam Sandler and Vince Gilligan, one of the writers for the TV show \"Breaking Bad\".\nWhile a film student at NYU, he learned the value of hustling, relationships and self-motivation. After graduation he was offered a gig in Hollywood to work for Sean Cunningham which led to one of his first writing credentials on Friday the 13th VIII.\nThough he went on to have major success with My Wife and Kids, Arrested Development and Major Payne, Dean will be the first to tell you that being a writer (or any other position in Hollywood) is just one step away from unemployment. It\u2019s constant unemployment, followed by short gigs followed by more unemployment.\nAnd that\u2019s where hustle makes or breaks someone. Fortunately for Dean, he has plenty of hustle which has resulted in a healthy, happy living as a writer for TV and movies.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tWhat you can learn about growing your business from Louis CK and Breaking Bad.\n\tThe technical side of creating a screenplay: Dean explains the process.\n\tThe collaborative nature of movies and how it pertains to your business.\n\tHow he worked with Vinnie Tortorich on \"Fitness Confidential\" and how they got it published.\n\tWhy it's best to go for something, and ask permission later.\n\tWhy it doesn't matter if you know the \"how\" of making something happen.\n\nIn addition to talking about his solopreneurial hustle, I also ask him to share who he has loved working with, what his favorite TV shows are currently and how he has kept his passion for writing alive through the typical ups and downs in the live of a Hollywood writer.\nMy chat with Dean was entertaining for me, and I hope for you as well. His story is a great reflection on the vital role hustle and relationships both play in success.

So that's exactly what he did.\nIn this show, you\u2019ll hear how Glen\u2019s failures and successes built on each other to move him up the ladder from struggling solopreneur to thriving soloist/investor. The lessons he learned from every failure and success taught him what he needed to see the next opportunity so he could capitalize on it. And so he did\u2026all of which led him to Mind Movies, his current and most successful endeavor.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\n\tWhat is the actual definition and methodology of sales?\n\tWhy you must fail, fail, fail and fail...before you succeed.\n\tFire and aim: Glenn's investment approach and the lessons he has learned.\n\tThe personal development journey Glen went on and how it contributed to his success.\n\tGlenn shares a high level view of the product creation process, including what he's discovered works best.\n\tThe thing that stops 99% of people\n\nLike almost every episode on this podcast, I get into a variety of topics with my guest and Glen is no exception. From his time in Sydney to his fashion prowess to why he moved to San Diego, we get acquainted with many areas of Glen's life and his thoughts on many topics. \u00a0But one thing I hope you take away from\u00a0Glen\u2019s tales is the true key to success...taking action. Everything else can be worked out and discovered from that point. But nothing happens until you take action.\nAs Glen says \u201c The greatest idea you'll ever have in your life is the one you do.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s right: whatever idea you have, stop sitting on it and go get it. Go make it happen.\u00a0That\u2019s one of the reasons I bring on people like Glen: to encourage you and motivate you to take action on that great new idea you have.\nSo tell us in the comments below and via Twitter: what are you going to DO now?

But there\u2019s one key that\u2019s missing from that process: acting like you already have reached your goals. Feeling, thinking and acting as though your goal or your vision has already come true is that final piece of the puzzle.\nAnd in episode 104, I share with you how I\u2019ve used this piece of the puzzle to create the success of The Solopreneur Hour as well as the tools you can use to do the same in your business and in your life.\nMore About This Show\nGoals: they are important roadmaps for our lives. They show us where we want to go, what it will take to get there and often, they guide us on how to get there. And if you really want to add some firepower to your goals, there are a few things you can do.\nAn important exercise to do is to write out your goals and create deadlines for them. This is actually a crucial piece to making them happen. If you don\u2019t know what your goals are and by when you\u2019re going to achieve them, how can you make them happen?\nA really fun way to do this is to write a letter to your future self. It\u2019s something I did as part of Nick Unsworth\u2019s mastermind group and everything I wrote in that letter has come true.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tThe power of belief: how I found my perfect Mini and the lesson it'll highlight for your business.\n\tHow this podcast has grown to six figures since its inception in August.\n\tCPA and CPM: what are they and why do you need to know?\n\tWhat you can learn about your business from my experience installing my car stereo.\n\tWhy it's so important to\u00a0\"talk the talk\" so you can really \"walk the walk\".\n\tAnd much more!\n\nWhen I wrote my letter to myself, I made sure I included every area of my life and I got specific: I wrote out how many downloads I wanted to have, the success of our SoloLab mastermind group and anything else I could think of.\nAnd then I got to work. I put time, effort and energy into everything I wanted to create.\nSomething else I did was to feel like I already had everything I had written out. For example, I\u00a0felt what it felt like to have a successful mastermind group and what it felt like to have the Mini Cooper I really wanted. I created the mastermind group, I test drove the Mini Coopers I wanted to own.\nAnd a mere eight months later, I had everything in that letter.\nNow my point in sharing this isn\u2019t to brag, but it\u2019s to show you the power of setting your goals and ACTING like you\u2019ve already achieved them. So take some time, write that letter to yourself and have a friend drop it in the mail to you six or eight months from now (or whatever timeframe you set).\nAfter you\u2019ve written the letter, all you have to do is take any and all actions. While you're taking those actions, remember to\u00a0feel like you've already got everything you wanted. Test drive that car you really want, look at homes you want, spend time with people who are doing the things you want to do and really get to know what your world is going to look and feel like when you've made good on those promises to yourself.\nThat's what it takes to make things happen, to make your goals become a reality.\nSo what's your letter to your future self going to say? Write it and if you\u2019re really bold, share it with us in the Proudly Unemployable Facebook group or send me a Tweet! I'd love to hear from you now and when your goals come true.\n \nShow Our Sponsor Some Love!\nGet Yourself a $2.95 domain name from Godaddy with the promo code \u201csolo295\u2033\n\nAND get 25% off new products from GoDaddy when you use promo code \"solo25\"\n\n\n\nEpisode Resources\nGoDaddy: $2.95 Domain Name\nGoDaddy: 25% Off New Products\nThe Proudly Unemployable group on Facebook\nSoloHour on Twitter\nSoloHour on Pinterest\nSoloLab - A Unique Mastermind\nGenerosity Philosophy\nCherished Ideas\nThe Mechanic to Millionaire podcast\nTire Rack\nLift: The Goal-Setting App\nCrutchfield: audio equipment", "duration": "55:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/104.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Guests", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Entrepreneur", "podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1398666829, "title": "103: What a Radio DJ Can Teach Us About the Podcasting Wave, with Tysen Webb", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "We\u2019ve seen video kill the radio star, will podcasting do the same to radio next? What\u2019s podcasting going to look like 5 years from now - is it the next big \u201cthing\u201d?\nJoining us to answer all those questions - and so much more - is radio DJ extraordinaire Tysen Webb.\nMore About This Show\nTysen is a man of radio. He\u2019s been a radio DJ for 22 years and it\u2019s the only full-time gig he\u2019s ever had. It\u2019s not a stretch to say he knows radio inside and out; it\u2019s been his passion since he was a child. In fact, he started working as a radio station producer when he was only 14 -\u00a0 his story about how he landed that gig is reflection of his solopreneurial hustle.\nWhen he joined The Solopreneur Hour for this show, he had much to share about the trajectory of radio, why he has his own podcast and the important role podcasting is playing and will continue to play in our audio lives.\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\n\tHis first on-air experience: how he took advantage of an opportunity.\n\tHis 20,000 foot view on the podcast movement: how to ride the tidal wave\n\tThe biggest challenges he sees in podcasting and we break down how to tackle each.\n\tWhy creating a show based on YOUR personality and your hard-wiring is the first step to success\n\tHow he thinks podcasting will affect radio\n\tAnd how the Mini did at our first car race!\n\nTysen has known since he was a child that he wanted to be on air and he has the voice for it! As a man who has been behind the mic for over 20 years, Tysen is well-qualified to talk about the radio trends he has seen in his history as well as the impact podcasting has made on radio so far. He sees podcasting as a tidal wave that is just beginning to rise, as do I.\nWe chat\u00a0about how to take advantage of that rising tidal wave and how you can lay the groundwork right now, including what equipment to use and some basic fundamentals every podcaster should do know when he or she gets started.\nBut we don't limit ourselves to podcasting! Like every episode, our conversation runs the gamut of numerous topics. In this show, Tysen and I talk\u00a0about our own particular passions: video games, car racing and vision board/bucket list items. Not only does that chat make for interesting conversation, it is also highlights the joy of the solopreneurial lifestyle.\nAnd that's one of the reasons I've created this show: to remind you why you're a solopreneur! Whether it\u2019s car racing, playing a particular sport or making extra time for your family, design your solopreneuer lifestyle to include your passions. I hope this episode reminds you to follow your vision, make time for the things that really feed your soul and stay on your solopreneurial course.\nEpisode Resources\nTysen's podcast\nTysen on Twitter\nSoloLab: A Unique Mastermind\nIHeartRadio\nNatural Selection's Do Anything\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\nFeedback on the Podcast\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)", "duration": "1:07:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/103.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Car Racing", "Guests", "Man", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Tysen Webb", "Audio Tips", "DJ"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1398404613, "title": "102: How to Launch a Business with Simon Knapp of Cherishedideas.com", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Launching a new business.

That there are always opportunities can be said of any industry and certainly can be said of real estate. And in seeing and seizing those opportunities, there are lessons for every solopreneur. From evaluating an opportunity to the art of being detached in negotiations, there are nuggets for you and your business.\n\nAnd joining us in Studio 86 to talk about that - and more - is my friend, fellow podcaster, and serial solopreneur Toby Salgado.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nIn every industry, there are opportunities to be had. In episode 98, I talk with Toby about what it\u2019s been like for him in the real estate investment market: how he has and continues to discover opportunities, seize them and build upon them for greater and greater success.\n\nToby got his solopreneur hustle on at the tender age of 9 and has been unemployable ever since. He found an opportunity in one of his dad's magazines and acted on it. By taking that action, he earned $1200 - remember, he was 9!\n\nThat was just the beginning for Toby. On this show, he shares his personal journey, including how many times he\u2019s failed, how many times he\u2019s won and how he progresses with each experience.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\tS.MA.R.T goals: what the acronym stands for and how to applies to your business.\n\tPeople either think too small or too big: and how to avoid falling into that trap.\n\tWhat Toby says it takes to be successful in any industry, real estate or otherwise.\n\tWhat I learned from my dad's stone crab business: a lesson on being detached.\n\tToby shares the statistic on how many times solopreneurs will fail before they hit a big win.\n\nToby\u2019s a wealth of knowledge, having built many companies and brokered deals worth millions. And in this episode, he drops that knowledge! But even if you aren\u2019t about to drop $400k on an investment, Toby\u2019s lessons will apply to your business.\n\nThe show isn\u2019t all about business though, Toby and I share a love of Porsches and a love of car racing. One particular aspect of vintage cars we discuss - and it\u2019s something that isn\u2019t widely-know - is the art of investing in them. It\u2019s a technique both Adam Carolla and Jay Leno use; some people invest in real estate or stocks, other people buy beautiful vintage cars and watch their value appreciate.\n\nWhatever your investment interest or your solopreneur endeavor, this episode will have something for you\u2026including a little walkie-talkie humor!

Whether it\u2019s being grateful for a win in our business or being grateful for our personal growth and progress, gratitude is fundamental to every aspect of our lives.\n\nIn episode 97, I take time to reflect on the incredible success this podcast has had of late and the keys that have created that success. The keys I talk about are the same ones you can use to fuel your business and your growth.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nWherever you are in your business, whether you\u2019re in the idea stage, the beginning stage or the growth phase, there are always necessary components to move you ahead. The very first component is confidence. You have to believe in yourself and your services or products that you\u2019re brining to market.\n\nAnd part of that confidence comes in standing behind the prices you charge. So many solopreneurs undervalue themselves and what they do; many of us have fallen into that trap and I am no exception. I found when I undervalued myself, I made my path and my journey a lot longer than it needed to be.\n\nOne way to do this is to create an environment that supports you. If you can, move somewhere that you really love. It\u2019s why I moved to San Diego. No matter what happens in my life, I live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.\n\nBut no matter where you live, surround yourself with confident solopreneurs, people who are further along the timeline than you are. Their confidence, ambition and learning lessons will teach you - and you\u2019ll learn faster and easier than you would have on your own.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tHow much should you reinvest back into your business?\n\tThe four steps to creating a business: what they are and how to utilize them.\n\tWhy you should overdeliver.\n\tWhat are the 5 options to build your audience?\n\tThe Integrity Network: what it is, who is in it, why it's a big deal and how the show became a part of it.\n\tThe steps to connecting and landing anchor clients.\n\nOnce you have that confidence and you\u2019ve leveled up who you are surrounding yourself with, you can get into the nitty-gritty of what you want to offer the world.\n\nCreating your business really boils down to four steps: build a brand, create an identity, connect with and build your audience - then monetize. Not until you\u2019ve completed the other three pieces should you monetize. At that point your audience is going to tell you what they want from you. Once you know that, you can deliver and really begin to put your stamp on the world.\n\nIn this episode, I reflect on all of those steps and how I\u2019ve used them to launch this podcast and get to where I am today. I\u2019m sharing them with you so you can use them too.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly grateful for the success we\u2019ve had with The Solopreneur Hour; I say \u201cwe\u201d because without you, none of this would have been possible.

But do you know what it actually means or why it's even important? After this show you will.\n\nJoining us to talk about that very tactic is our guest for episode 96, Mr. Nick Unsworth. Nick is our friend as well as being an outstanding Facebook marketing expert, business coach extraordinaire and new podcaster. He also happens to be a man who knows how to create his visions and make things happen; in this episode, he lets us in on a few of his secrets.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nThere comes a point in every solopreneur\u2019s journey when they have to take the next step. It could be leaving the stifling comfort of a 9-5 and a steady paycheck, hiring a virtual assistant or paying for a coach even when the money\u2019s not there in the moment.\n\nWhatever the scenario, leveling up is the way to make it happen. You have to look at where you want to go and make decisions based on where you are going, NOT where you are.\n\nIn this show, Nick and I talk about times in our lives when we\u2019ve leveled up, what those experiences have meant for us and our businesses. We talk about the significant role leveling up plays in moving your business forward from a one-person self-employed business model to a fully-functioning, self-running operation.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tElevating your expenses can be a good thing.\n\tWhy are the 3 S's so important? Here's a hint: They are story, stance and strategy.\n\tHow to reframe your challenges into your biggest opportunities and triumphs.\n\tThe progression from self-employed solopreneur to business owner and time freedom.\n\tHow action, imperfect and every other type of action, trumps all.\n\tThe importance of anchor clients: how to get them and how to properly use them in your business.\n\nAnd one of the best ways to get to that self-sustaining business model is through coaching. It\u2019s one of the common themes for this show and so many of the episodes in 2014. There isn\u2019t a single person I know who is succeeding in business who does not have a coach. In fact, Nick has two: a business coach and a personal development coach.\n\nHowever and wherever you want to take your business to its next expansion, leveling up is how you get there. And a great coach will guide you and keep you on track through that process.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy Nick and I have both used to hit major milestones and goals we\u2019ve set in our businesses; I hope when you listen to this episode, you\u2019ll hear how to use it for yourself.

I recently attended an event in Arizona hosted by our friend Nick Unsworth, and a few of the people in SoloLab were also in attendance.\n\nIn episode 95, I sat down with them to record this podcast and talk about the power of masterminds, the power of groups and the necessity of attending events.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nIf you\u2019ve been listening to the podcast for awhile, you\u2019ve heard me talk about (even rant about) the importance of coaching, events and mastermind groups. One of the keys to being a successful solopreneur is surrounding yourself with like-minded people and people who are going to support you on your journey. There are enough challenges on the solopreneur road, naysayers don\u2019t need to be another one.\n\nAnd one of the best ways to rectify that is to attend events like mastermind groups, conferences and networking meetings.\n\nOn this show, the four of us talk about why we\u2019ve said yes to our paths, where we are on our paths and just how much we all get out of being around other positive, like-minded people.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tWhat fear is REALLY a signpost for.\n\tThe truth about making the transition from a regular job to time freedom.\n\tWhen to outsource - and WHAT to outsource.\n\tWhat\u2019s at the crux of a successful brand and its message.\n\tHow life conspires to support you when you say \"yes\", even when you don't know how.\n\nAs solopreneurs, we have to be okay with people not \u201cgetting\u201d us and what we\u2019re up to. The quartet on this episode all agreed this is true, and because of that, we all must attend events and connect with each other to create our own support systems.\n\nEach of us has faced different hurdles when we\u2019ve said yes to our personal path, but we\u2019ve also witnessed doors opening when we\u2019ve least expected them to. We\u2019ve all learned the value of taking action, pivoting from wherever you are to wherever you want to go and knowing your vision is going to come true.\n\nAt the core of this show is really the message of following your path, following your passions and being true to yourself, no matter what.\nEpisode Resources\nChris Cerrone's podcast\nSteve de la Torre's podcast\nDr. Christine's podcast\nDr. Christine on Twitter\nConnect with other Unemployables on Facebook\nThe Solopreneur Hour on Twitter\nSoloLab\nEpisode 24 with JJ Collier\nEpisode 76 with Dr. Paul\nBSW USA (15% discount with promo code solohour)\nThe Four Hour Body\n\n\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\n\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\n\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)", "duration": "1:20:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/095.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Fitness & Health", "Guests", "Health", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Live In Studio", "Man", "Men's Style", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Website / Search Engine Optimization", "Woman", "Live Interview", "Mastermind", "Sololab"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1396851818, "title": "94: Joel Comm \u2013  From Gamer to Online Business Pioneer", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "For episode 94, I have the privilege of welcoming the hilarious Joel Comm, \u00a0a true pioneer of the early days of Internet marketing, as well as a New York Times best-selling author, mobile app inventor, solopreneur and podcaster.\n\nI very recently met Joel at a post-SMMW party, and I was thrilled when he agreed to be on the show. His background is in internet marketing and today he\u2019s widely known for his social media expertise as well as being the inventor of the infamous (and highly profitable) iFart app!\n\nIn this episode, Joel shares his sense of humor as well as his personal highs and lows, and how he has successfully steered his career throughout his 18+ years of solopreneurship.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nJoel found early success as a mobile DJ, his first solopreneur endeavor. His success grew when he later turned his love of gaming into a software review magazine, the Dallas/Fort Worth Software Review. That magazine led to even more success in the online world including his book The Adsense Code and other dot com endeavors.\n\nBut like almost everyone from the dot com era, Joel experienced his share of setbacks and disappointments. In this show, he shares how he came back from the dot com bubble burst. One of the key takeaways you\u2019ll hear is how he has pivoted when necessary over the years, a quintessential solopreneur attribute.\n\nYou'll also discover things like:\n\n\n\tBSOS: what is it and do you have it?\n\tJoel's first internet marketing success: hear the details on how it happened.\n\tThe lessons he learned from his stint at Barnes & Noble.\n\tWhat does Joel believe is the most effective social media platform of 2014?\n\tFan pages vs Facebook groups: what's the best avenue to generate community and, ultimately, leads?\n\tOne of Joel's proudest achievements - what is it?\n\nIn this episode, Joel and I talk a lot about his techie love of computers, gaming and the numerous puns you can create about the iFart app.\n\nJoel is a wise and funny man who has been in the same trenches every solopreneur must dig through, and he\u2019s made the most of every experience he\u2019s had in life.\n\nFrom a stint with Barnes & Noble during a personal and professional sabbatical, to producing and hosting the world\u2019s first competitive Internet reality show, Joel has explored his many passions and talents in the solopreneur world.\n\nHe\u2019ll be the first to admit which of those explorations have been successful monetarily and which have not, but at the heart of them all is one thing: a growth opportunity.

Whether you\u2019re on the mic for your podcast or writing a blog entry or sharing a YouTube video, the content you offer and the way you offer has to get people talking about you and sharing it with their circles.\n\nAnd Pat Flynn is a master at being memorable. From his Smart Passive Income blog and podcasts to his speaking gigs, Pat is transparent, funny and gets people thinking in new ways.\n\nIn episode 93, Pat makes his second visit to the show to talk about being memorable and much more.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nAfter meeting at Blogworld in 2013, Pat and I became friends. He\u2019s a fellow podcaster and a fellow San Diego resident; he\u2019s also one of the two influences that led to the creation of TSH.

He puts his audience\u2019s needs first and understands it is only what they think that truly matters. Like any great teacher, Pat learns as much or more from teaching and giving to his audience, as they learn from him.\n\nAs you listen to this show, you\u2019ll hear how he feels a sense of responsibility and commitment to his audience. He is committed to providing value, and not just earning quick cash because of his level of influence. It\u2019s because of that focus and intent, that he has become a mega-watt solopreneur success.\nEpisode Resources\nPat's Smart Passive Income web site\nPat's podcast\nPat on Facebook\nPat on Twitter\nPat's first appearance on the show\nAbout Pat\nPat's Food Truck site\nConversioncast podcast\nSocial Triggers\nAsk Pat\nSpeakpipe\nJaime Tardy on the show\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\n\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\n\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)", "duration": "1:11:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/093.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Career Advice", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Outsourcing", "Pat Flynn", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Evolution", "Integrity", "Online Business", "Smart Passive Income"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1396400624, "title": "92: Music, Mysticism and Solopreneurship with Stuart Davis", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "He\u2019s been described as an \u201cavant-garde pop mastermind\u201d and one of the most unique and endearing live acts in America today. And he\u2019s our guest for episode 92, my friend and one of my favorite fellow musicians, Stuart Davis.\n\nStuart typifies solopreneurship: he\u2019s a musician, a TV host, and a painter. He\u2019s also one of the most learned and yet knowledge-hungry people I\u2019ve met. To describe him fully, you have to be willing to expand your own awareness of labels like \"Buddhist\", \"philosopher\", and \"artist\". There's a reason he's been called the Twisted Mystic.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nBefore he was the Twisted Mystic, Stuart was simply a kid who loved music. From a young age, he would spend 6 or 7 hours a day learning instruments and the fundamentals of music. He was consumed by his love for it.\n\nIn his early 20s his passion came to fruition when he was invited to play at the Guthrie Theatre in his hometown of Minneapolis, which is the equivalent of playing Red Rocks in Colorado. If neither of those examples give you a perspective, just know they are both places musicians would love to play.\n\nFrom his time in Minnesota, Stuart followed his love for music \u00a0to Boulder, Colorado where we met and played together.\u00a0 He is one of the most eclectic, intelligent and musically-inspiring artists I\u2019ve had the privilege to play with. And in episode 92, he shares what has shaped his career and who he is today.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tCan we ever fully realize our true genius?\n\tEmbrace discomfort from early on?\n\tThe X then Y factor: what Stuart has learned from this and how it runs parallel to your journey\n\tOne of the pinnacle moments of his early music career\n\tWhat keeps him saying yes?\n\nStuart\u2019s eclecticism has broadened his life from being a musician to today living in Amsterdam where he raises his daughters on a boat and expresses his artistic side through painting, music, and any other medium that strikes his fancy.\n\nIn this show, you\u2019ll hear what books, teachings and experiences have influenced his desire to expand his creative repertoire as well as the fascinating story behind how he met his wife (who is Ken Wilber\u2019s former wife).\n\nI brought Stuart on the show not only because he\u2019s a brilliant musician, but also because he\u2019s a solopreneur at heart. He says yes to opportunities, even when he\u2019s afraid and he embraces the ups and downs and winding turns of solopreneurship. He tells us what has kept him true to himself along the way.\n\n\nShow Our Sponsor Some Love!\nGet Yourself a $3.49 domain name from Godaddy with the Promo Code \u201csolo349\u2033\n\n\nEpisode Resources\nStuart's web site\nStuart's TV show\nStuart on Facebook\nStuart\u00a0on Twitter\nThe Guthrie Theatre\nGo Daddy\n\n\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\n\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\n\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)", "duration": "1:16:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/092.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Artist", "Authors", "Career Advice", "Great Books", "Man", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Musicians", "Podcast", "Social Media", "Stuart Davis", "Amsterdam", "Boulder", "Colorado", "Music", "Punk Monk", "Twistic Mystic"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1396249781, "title": "91: Creating Your Own Niche with Ailis Garcia", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Ailis (pronounced Eye-lease) Garcia was brought up to understand the importance of hard work and fierce dedication.

If you missed his first appearance or just want to refresh your memory about Wes, you can hear all about him here.\nWes recorded with us in Studio 86 to talk about authenticity, vulnerability and his new endeavor, \"A Human Project\". We even discovered Wes is a Star Trek nerd!\nStar Trek aside, the bulk of our conversation was about how businesses are going to succeed in 2014 by becoming real again. It's time for businesses to get human. We as consumers have evolved beyond the hype, the hoopla and the BS that has permeated marketing messaging over the last decade or two. People are wise and savvy now; the consumer is dictating how businesses are run, not the other way around any longer.\nAs consumers we want vulnerability and authenticity. When we as customers know what's at your core and what fuels your business, then and only then will we make a purchasing decision. It all boils down to being real, being human with your market.\nAnd Wes Chapman is leading the charge with his company, A Human Project.\nWes believes in the power of connection and the importance of highly honed soft skills in communication; how you present yourself and how you interact with actual humans will go a long way to determining the success of your business.\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\nBelieve in what you already know - it's enough to create a GREAT business\nHow does Wes continue to be successful and what does he say for the future of entrepreneurship and solopreneurs?\nDo you need to be super high tech to be successful in 2014?\nWhat's the most powerful mktg strategy?\nHow not to be part of the \"Ask Me How\" brigade\nWhat Wes has to say about branding and its importance to your business\n\nAs Wes shares in this show, the more human you are and the more authentically you communicate, the more people are going to connect with you. Eventually that connection builds trust and they become your most loyal clients who buy whatever it is you\u2019re offering. But first comes the authenticity and the connection, then the trust and then the purchase.\nWhether you\u2019re podcasting, blogging, using social media or creating videos in 2014, it all begins with vulnerability and authenticity. You\u2019ve got to tell the world who you are and why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. Wes\u2019 advice on how to do this? Take a look at your business and figure out how you can become more human.\nIf you take that context and create your marketing, your messaging and the foundation of your company, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll find true success in the marketplace.\n\nShow Our Sponsor Some Love!\nGet Yourself a $3.49 domain name from Godaddy with the Promo Code \u201csolo349\u2033\n\n\nEpisode Resources\nWesley's personal web site\nA Human Project\nWesley's A Human Project\u00a0on Facebook\nWesley\u00a0on Twitter\nWesley on Episode 61\nThe Solopreneur Hour's First 50 Episodes\nSoloLab\nGoDaddy\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\nFeedback on the Podcast\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast,", "duration": "1:10:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/090.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Life Coaching", "Man", "Men's Style", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Musicians", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Wesley Chapman", "A Human Project", "Entrepreneur", "Small Business", "Wes Chapman"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1395809394, "title": "89: How Branding Is The Cornerstone Of Your Business with Re Perez", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "When someone says branding, what do you think of? Do you immediately think logo, like the famous Nike swoosh? Or do you think of the way you feel when you're behind the wheel of your favorite car, or the way you feel when you step inside a Ralph Lauren store?\n\nBranding goes beyond a logo; at its core, branding is about how you feel when you interact with a company. Joining us to talk about all this and more is my fellow San Diego resident and brand consulting expert, Re Perez. Re is the creator and brand strategist behind many incredible brands, including our friend Nick Unsworth's Life on Fire brand.\n\nMore About This Show\n\nRe Perez has a long history of branding from his early days of graphic communications at NYU to his recent business, Branding for the People. He knows the ins and outs about what makes a brand an actual brand - and not just a company with a nice-looking logo.\n\nAnd in episode 89, he shares his insights and vast knowledge on how to create that perfect brand for your business.\n\nRe believes that if you look at branding solely as your logo, you diminish the full potential of what a brand can and is meant to do. We also talk at length about the necessity of a creative brief, what it is and why it is one of the most vital tools you can have in your back pocket when you're creating your brand and your visual identity.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tHow a simple word creates an entire picture: the library effect.\n\tThe location ninja lesson and why it's important for your brand.\n\tWhy it took me 3 months to get 8 words, and why it was worth the wait.\n\tWhat's the first step in building your brand?\n\tWhy business cards are dead - unless they do this one thing.\n\nTruly, when you pinpoint your brand, people get what you're up to instantly.

For her, it wasn\u2019t about the actual monetary value; it was about the process and what it would take to make a million dollars.\n\nBy the young of age 22, she was on her way: she had a great-paying job with an expense account\u2026but also with incredibly long hours.\u00a0Within a few short years, she was exhausted and absolutely dreaded Monday mornings. She decided there was a better way; she was going to find something she loved to do, enjoy her life and THEN make a million.\n\nThat\u2019s when the concept of \u201cEventual Millionaire\u201d came to her. She jumped on the domain name and began the journey that led her to today\u2019s success.\n\nThe finer details of this show include:\n\n\tHow the Eventual Millionaire brand came about.\n\tIs $1 million enough for retirement?\n\tTrue Grit: what it is and why it matters to your success.\n\tWhy you should ask someone who has successfully done what you are doing.\n\tCoaching vs mentoring: what does she think the differences are? And when do you need each?\n\nJaime's solopreneur hustle began early on: she sold books to earn some money as a child, she had the usual lemonade stand, etc. She took that same hustle and applied it to her idea for the Eventual Millionaire.\n\nLike all great businesses, EM began as a mere idea. With dedication, hard work and \u201ctrue grit\u201d, her persistence paid off. Today she has appeared in such notable media outlets as CNN and Yahoo\u2019s Homepage. Jaime and her story are the embodiment of the solopreneur\u2019s progression.\n\n\nEpisode Resources\nJaime's site\nJaime on Facebook\nJaime on Twitter\nJaime's husband\nGet Rich Slowly\nTrue Grit, the Ted Talk\nEventual Millionaire\nScrivener, what Jaime uses to write with\nGoDaddy\n\nWould You Help Spread the Word About the Podcast?\n\nI\u2019d be forever grateful if you helped share the podcast. \u00a0Click here for a pre-populated tweet\u00a0to help spread the word to your friends on Twitter. \u00a0THANK YOU!\n\nFeedback on the Podcast\n\nIf you have any suggestions for upcoming shows or a question for an upcoming episode, leave a comment below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, I\u2019d be extremely grateful if you would take a second and\u00a0leave me a review and rating over on iTunes. \u00a0Your taking a minute to do this allows me to help more people with this podcast, so I really appreciate it\u00a0(once on that page, simply click on the \u201cView in iTunes\u201d button to leave your review \u2014 thanks very much!)\n\nMP3 Download\n\nRight-click here to download the MP3 of this episode", "duration": "1:20:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/088.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Authors", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Great Books", "Internet Marketing", "Jaime Tardy", "Life Coaching", "Mindset & Overcoming Adversity", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Woman", "Advice", "Eventual Millionaire", "Millionaire"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1395382566, "title": "87: Jennifer Paige \u2013 Behind The Scenes Of A Mega Pop Star", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "When you were a kid, did you ever sing-along to the radio and dream of being a pop star?

This show was a testament to that: there are real, actionable steps you can take right now for your business.\n\nShow Natasha Some Love on Twitter By Clicking This Link\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nResources from this episode:\n\nNatasha's Art\n\nFlickr\n\nDropbox\n\nCrush It by Gary Vaynerchuk\n\nNatasha's Artist Academy\n\nSoloLab", "duration": "1:03:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/082.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Artist", "Guests", "Natasha Wescoat", "Podcast", "Woman", "Career", "Craftsman", "Social Media"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1394203792, "title": "81: Healthy Body, Healthy Business with Drew Avery", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Do you think rippling muscles and vibrant health are only for the young?

Caleb\u2019s part of the superstar team at Fizzle and is a solopreneur in his own right: he just released his first solo information product, a DIY video guide.\n\nAlthough Caleb didn\u2019t start out on the entrepreneurial path (after college he worked for Boeing in a traditional job), his discovery of blogging, and later video blogging, opened up his door to solopreneurship.\n\nToday he\u2019s at the forefront of the video revolution. He\u2019s THE guy to help you learn how to use video like a pro, even when you aren\u2019t.\n\nWe get into the nitty-gritty, how-to of video creation.

He even talks about what he picked up from the director of photography for Saturday Night Live.\n\nVideo is certainly an integral part of any solopreneur\u2019s path so I was stoked to have Caleb on the show.

I wanted to help de-mystify the launching process...whether it was a product, a service, or an affiliate business. \u00a0I used a guide created by the Suitcase Entrepreneur herself, Natalie Sisson. You can find the guide in the Resources section at the bottom of the notes.\n\nThanks to Natalie, and thanks to GoDaddy for sponsoring this episode!\n\nWithout further ado, let's dive into the outline of today's show.\n\nPhase 1. Commit to ship and plan.\n\n\tSet big launch goals within 1-3 months\n\tHire a coach or launch strategist or join mastermind to hold you accountable.\n\tFind a niche market with a real need. Make your hobbies work for you.\n\tConduct research to narrow down your niche and find your ideal customer.\n\tChoose the best product or service to launch based on your audience and your own personal sweet spot. Find something in your own Universe, find the thing you really love to do.\n\nPhase 2: Taking Action\nI advise taking the Chris Ducker approach: hire a small team, start building people around you. It's a MAJOR mistake to try to do it all yourself. You'll get so much further so much quicker when you hire a team!\n\n\tGet to work creating your product or service. Have people help you with copy, etc. Do an outline: first write out your major topics/buckets of the information you are disseminating. Then do the sub-categories: build on a gradient which means build on the previous section(s).\n\tAre you using video? Then you\u2019ll just need bullet points of the points you're making.\nDoing a screen cast? Write out more of a script so you keep it tight.\n\tCreate an effective web site: Wordpress is your best. See Resources section for more resources on this, it's here.\n\tGet your social media profiles ready if they aren\u2019t: wherever your customers hang out online, that\u2019s where you need to be.\n\tFacebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, etc. See Crush It of the Sexy Six for more on this.\n\tAnd for these social media outlets, use your personal profile. People will most commonly relate to you as YOU, not your business page.\n\tSet up an email list for Aweber, Mailchimp plug-ins, and place opt-in box at the top of your site. Give something cool away: I like resource guides. Check out Pat Flynn\u2019s episode with Clay Collins of LeadPages. LeadPages makes beautiful opt-in boxes.\n\tCreate a content marketing plan that includes regular blogging on your product or service topic, both on your personal blog and on influential blogs as a guest contributor.\n\tSet up a landing page to promote your product on your web site. Leadpages or Optimize Press for the squeeze page or sales page.\n\nPhase 3: Selling Your Product\n\n\tChoose an e-commerce solution like e-junkie, Shopify, Paypal, Authorize.net to accept payments for your products.\n\tBuild out an affiliate team to act as your virtual sales force. It\u2019s common to give away 50% to your affiliates. What would you rather have: 100 sales at $50 or 3 sales at 100?\n\tUse online software like Clickbank or 1shoppingcart to set up an affiilate management system and empower your affiliates to sell.\n\tSet up a marketing campaign using FB ads, Google adwords, other relevant platforms. Pay to play to do a really good launch. Think of it as trading a nickel for a dollar!\u00a0The current move I see happening is this: you drive people to either a live training or a recorded webinar on a specific date that gets them to buy an actual product.\n\tOr you can do what Nick Unsworth does and do a live 20 day launch. He brings people along with him. That way there's no pre-build, you almost force people to participate because they are logging in and using your product through the launch.\n\tWrite guest posts and contact media outlets that may be interested in reviewing your product.\n\tPlan an email marketing campaign for pre and post launch using autoresponders. Go through this process like you are a completely cold audience member that doesn't know anything a...", "duration": "1:04:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/079.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Affiliate Marketing", "Branding & Identity", "Career Advice", "Finance & Money", "Guests", "Internet Marketing", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Outsourcing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Natalie Sisson", "Product Launch", "Service Launch", "Suitcase Entrepreneur"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1393566708, "title": "78: Content Is\u2026Queen: With Entrepreneur on Fire\u2019s Kate Erickson", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "You\u2019ve heard the expression: behind every great man is a great woman.

But Amy\u2019s not just Rick\u2019s partner, she\u2019s also a solopreneur in her own right. She is the driving force behind her health and fitness brand, Strong Inside Out. Strong Inside Out\u2019s mission is to show people they are stronger than their struggles and they can live a full, extraordinary life through fitness and positive action.\n\nIn episode 70, Amy is honest and transparent about her experiences with body image disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.\n\nThe key in this show is to listen to Amy\u2019s story and hear how she is like so many solopreneurs; she took her own struggle and turned it into an opportunity. She learned how to turn her adversities into opportunities, opportunities to connect with others, make a real difference in the world and create a thriving business in the process.\n\nIn episode 70, some of the lessons Amy relates from her struggles are:\n\n\tEntrepeneur Syndrome: what it is, how to know if you\u2019ve got it and how to combat it\n\tThe importance of making a commitment to yourself that you\u2019ll keep fighting for you no matter what\n\tThe 5 person rule: you are the sum of the five people you surround yourself with and you are one of those five people\n\tHow to use comparison so it is NOT the thief of joy, but rather the injection of power\n\tAmy\u2019s personal protocol for combatting an experience of depression, and how it pertains to your solopreneur life\n\nWhether or not you\u2019ve ever dealt with an eating disorder/body image disorder, depression or suicide on a personal level, Amy\u2019s experiences are relatable to solopreneurs everywhere. We all, at one time or another, struggle on our path. We wonder if we\u2019re going in the right direction, if it will ever work out and if what we\u2019re doing today will be worthwhile tomorrow.\n\nEpisode 70 lets you know you are not alone in that struggle and you\u2019re not the only one with those thoughts. This show also shares with you ways to arm yourself for those dark nights and moments of doubt.

And by forward I mean make a MAJOR leap? Then I have great news for you: this episode focuses on the number one thing you can to make that happen this year.\n\nSo what is it? What is the top action you can take that is going to make all the difference? Getting a coach and joining a mastermind.\n\nYes we've touched on this topic before but after the AMAZING weekend I had, I simply had to drive this point home. Coaching and masterminds make THE difference; I experienced this firsthand over the weekend when I was in a six-person mastermind group that included Pat Flynn, Chris Ducker, and Caleb Wojcik. \u00a0People pay thousands of dollars to get coaching and suggestions from these guys - and I received it personally because I'm part of a mastermind.\n\nEvery single person out there who is making massive strides in their business is being coached and is involved in a mastermind. Everyone invests in themselves and their business; they know the best, fastest and most effective way to move forward is with a coach who is further along then they are.\n\nThis applies to you and your business. Wherever you are with your business and with your personal finances, there is a coaching and mastermind option for you. Here's the breakdown:\n\nIf you only have $100, start with the Sexy Six Solopreneur books:\n\n\tRich Dad, Poor Dad\n\tThe Cashflow Quadrant\n\tThe E-Myth Revisited\n\tThe Four Hour Work Week\n\tStrengthsFinder 2.0\n\tCrush It\n\nAnd then find podcasts you love and listen. Whether it's this one or Pat Flynn's or Amy Porterfield's or anyone else's, find podcasters you resonate with and listen to all of their content. Absorb, absorb, absorb.\n\nIf you've got a big of a bigger budget, there are a few other options when you're looking at coaching and mastermind groups.\n\nAt the $200/month level, you'll find groups like SoloLab, John Lee Dumas' Fire Starter Elite, Natalie Sisson's Freedom Fighters and many others. In these groups you'll be a part of an active Facebook group, perhaps received a bit of personal coaching and will have regular webinars and/or Google Hangouts. The point is to begin surrounding yourself with like-minded people on a more personal and private level.\n\nGoing up to the $500 per month level, your coaching and mastermind group activities will go up a notch. You'll receive more personal coaching, plus Facebook groups, videos, accountability programs and additional content.\n\nAnd beyond that you get into groups that start around $1k- $3k per month and go up from there. These are the elite groups where you can expect multiple private, one on one coaching sessions. You'll also receive copies of all the coach's training products like ebooks, videos, online courses, etc. And naturally you'll be connected to other members of the program via online and offline channels. These are the groups where the heavy hitters come to get coached and grow their businesses.\n\nWherever you're at with your business and with your finances, you can find an option that works for you. Whether you choose to coach with me or with someone else, I don't really care so long as you DO IT. This is the same philosophy as with your business: take action, even if it isn't perfect. Get out there, find someone you really like, someone you admire and respect and get coached by them. Find out what they offer and sign yourself up.\n\nAnd if you can't do it today, then start with the Sexy Six and podcasts til you can. You should be putting aside 20% of what you make and reinvesting it into yourself and your business. Start doing that and when you've saved enough, join the coaching and mastermind group that speaks to you.\n\nI want all of you to sign an NDA in the comments below and make a commitment to be coached this year!\n\nAs always, if you want to connect with me via Twitter or Facebook you can find me here:\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd here are the resources from this episode:", "duration": "1:02:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/e3/63/81/e36381a1-1ed8-0c5d-1f40-1e6c0c013bc0/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/solohour/058.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Branding & Identity", "Great Books", "Guests", "Man", "Michael O'Neal Solo", "Offline Marketing", "Podcast", "Podcasting", "Social Media", "Chris Ducker", "Coaching", "Marketing", "Mastermind", "Pat Flynn", "Private Coaching", "Robert Downey Jr.", "Sting"]}, {"seriesId": 692594227, "seriesTitle": "The Solopreneur Hour Podcast with Michael O'Neal - Proudly Unemployable\u2122", "pubDate": 1389337377, "title": "57: Hustlin\u2019 in Hollywood with Anna Vocino", "author": "Michael O'Neal Chats with Unemployable People like James Altucher, Adam Carolla, Jack Canfield, HInes Ward, and many more, in a format like Joe Rogan or Art of Charm", "summary": "Hustling: it's not just for online marketers and entrepeneurs.

If you\u2019re a regular listener you know two of the 8 steps to becoming a successful solopreneur are to learn and learn more. Events are perfect for this.\n\nAnd they\u2019re great for another key component of successful solopreneurship: meeting and surrounding yourself with like-minded people.\n\nBut something you may not know is how much of the networking takes place outside of the actual sessions and workshops. To take full advantage of the event and everyone who is there, you want to be out and about as much as possible.\n\nConnect with people over lunch, invite someone new out for drinks. Wander around your hotel til you see a familiar face, strike up a conversation and see where it takes you. That\u2019s where the real magic of events happens - in the \u201coff time\u201d.\n\nIn episode 56, I share some of my favorite \u201coff time\u201d moments of NMX as well as a commonality I saw in all the successful people in attendance: their ability to take imperfect action, consistently. I have made this point in several shows and I\u2019ll make it again: you don\u2019t have to do anything perfectly, just do it and let your feedback help you improve as you go.\n\nI dive deeper into lessons on that topic as well as my thoughts and recommendations for creating a successful, professional and powerful podcast.\n\nWant a few nuggets? Here are a few specifics from each of those areas:\n\n\tWhy it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for you to leverage your relationships for business growth\n\tThe importance of knowing your ideal listener\n\tIs there a difference between imperfect action and doing perfect work? If so, what is it?\n\tPodcasting and broadcasting: have they become one and the same?\n\tWhat you can learn from The Solopreneur Hour T-shirt\n\nI also share my thoughts on where podcasting is going in 2014 and how you can take full advantage of being at the center of this burgeoning media, whether or not you\u2019re doing a podcast.\n\nThere was so much I learned from NMX, being there and presenting, it was a pleasure to record this show and share it with you.
