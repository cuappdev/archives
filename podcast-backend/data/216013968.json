Chief among these are the two \u201cDemons\u201d of investing that must both be defeated in order to realize success. The first demon is risk, and the second is inflation. Risk comes from the fact that future returns are uncertain, and it is not possible to foresee all future events. Investments that seem \u2018safe\u2019 may turn out to have hidden dangers that we did not notice. Risk can never be eliminated, it can only be managed. The best way to do this is by properly diversifying your investments so that they are not all subject to the same market shocks. The second demon of investing is inflation. Inflation is especially difficult because it erodes the value of your dollars. Defeating the demon of inflation requires investment in multi-dimensional assets that are optimized to defeat inflation. Income properties meet this criteria well because the property itself holds real value by nature of the replacement cost of the structure, the loan allows you to have a fixed cost of capital for three decades, and the cash flow is pushed up by inflation while you cost structure remains flat because of the fixed-rate financing.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/creatingwealthpodcast/~4/TDbBMXJ9jYc\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "57:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/c2/71/6d/c2716dbf-0f91-82af-613f-e20d2fad5906/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/c2/71/6d/c2716dbf-0f91-82af-613f-e20d2fad5906/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/creatingwealthpodcast/~5/__p81g93x4A/CW_799_FBF.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 216013968, "seriesTitle": "Creating Wealth Real Estate Investing with Jason Hartman", "pubDate": 1488413572, "title": "CW 798 - Thomas J.

Next, some mortgage financial planning illustrated by \u201cA Tale of Two Brothers\u201d by Ric Edelman who has educated his clients for years on the benefits of integrating their mortgage into their overall financial plan.In his book, The New Rules of Money, Ric tells the story of two brothers, each of whom secures a mortgage to buy a $200,000 home.</p> <p>Each brother earns $70,000 a year and has $40,000 in savings. The first brother, Brother A, believes than half the nation\u2019s banks failed and millions of homeowners, unable to raise the cash they needed to payoff their loans, lost their homes. Out of this the American Mantra was born: Always own your home outright. Never carry a mortgage. The reasoning behind America\u2019s new mantra was really quite simple: if the economy fell to pieces, at least you still had your home and the bank couldn\u2019t take it away from you. Maybe you couldn\u2019t put food on the table or pay your bills, but your home was secure.</p> <p>Since the Great Depression laws have been introduced that make it illegal for banks to call your loan due. The bank can no longer call you up and say, We\u2019re running a little short on cash and need you to pay off your loan in the next thirty days.Additionally, the Fed is now quick to infuse money into the system if there is a run on the banks, as we saw in 1987 and Y2K. Also, the FDIC was created to insure banks. Still, it\u2019s no wonder the fear of losing their home became instilled in the hearts and minds of the American people, and they quickly grew to fear their mortgage. In the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s families would throw mortgage burning parties to celebrate paying off their home. And so, because of this fear of their mortgage, for nearly 75 years most people have overlooked the opportunities their mortgage provides to build financial security.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/creatingwealthpodcast/~4/x5wqSacEIds\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "28:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/c2/71/6d/c2716dbf-0f91-82af-613f-e20d2fad5906/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/c2/71/6d/c2716dbf-0f91-82af-613f-e20d2fad5906/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/creatingwealthpodcast/~5/rBhywQ4OR7U/CW_778_FBF.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 216013968, "seriesTitle": "Creating Wealth Real Estate Investing with Jason Hartman", "pubDate": 1484189361, "title": "CW 777 - Elisabeth Embry - Investor Growth, Mastermind Groups, Women In Real Estate & Meet The Masters Of Income Property", "author": "Jason Hartman", "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The upcoming 19th Meet the Masters of Income Property live event is upon us.

Generation X is more of a mystery generation because of its smaller size, which makes it less of a valuable market.\u00a0 Ken believes that the United States\u2019 best days are ahead as people bail out of the European Union. He also believes that China\u2019s economic future is bleak due to artificial tampering with the population, with demographic numbers showing China in trouble economically within ten years, struggling to feed themselves within 15 years.</p> <p>Ken shows how the housing market is being held hostage by big bank foreclosures and why this log jam will soon correct and precipitate a restoration of the United States economy. Ken also talks about how manufacturing will return to the United States with a vengeance because the United States is the only industrialized nation with a huge young highly skilled workforce.</p> <p>Kenneth W. Gronbach is a gifted keynote speaker and a nationally recognized expert and futurist in the field of Demography and Generational Marketing. Ken entertains his audiences with his own special brand of wit, humor and clear communication. He makes the science of shifting demography come alive with real life examples that make it relevant to today\u2019s culture, business climate and economy.\u00a0 In his book \u201cAge Curve, How to Profit from the Coming Demographic Storm\u201d, published by The American Management Association, Ken takes you through a fascinating common sense understanding of shifting demography and the related opportunities and challenges. The demographic landscape in the United States is made up a series of waves that are about twenty years in duration.</p> <p>It would follow that business will rise and fall according to the critical mass of customers heading toward it. Ken\u2019s latest book \u201cDecades of Difference, Making it Work\u201d (HRD Press), about the United States workforce, was released in October 2010. Ken also writes for the CNBC Guest Blog.</p> <p>Ken\u2019s perspective is macro, a view from 30,000 feet, and very big picture. Demographers are able to forecast markets, societal phenomena, and economics with uncanny accuracy because they count people, not money or things. For example crime has been down in the United States for the last twenty years because the number of high risk crime committers (men 15 to 30 years old) has been low and fully employed.</p> <p>This is because the fertility in the United States dipped sharply between 1965 and 1984 creating a deficit in our population of about nine million people. This shortage of young people in the labor force also drove labor costs up and manufacturing off shore. Ken says the Age Curve will change the way businesses market to consumers and that a sea of entrepreneurial business starts will rule as the economy turns around.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/creatingwealthpodcast/~4/RfsWqw6IN7I\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "01:05:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/c2/71/6d/c2716dbf-0f91-82af-613f-e20d2fad5906/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/c2/71/6d/c2716dbf-0f91-82af-613f-e20d2fad5906/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/creatingwealthpodcast/~5/XogcpsInbwg/CW_736_FBF.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 216013968, "seriesTitle": "Creating Wealth Real Estate Investing with Jason Hartman", "pubDate": 1475716985, "title": "CW 735 - Market Profile of Macon, Georgia - An Under The Radar Opportunity", "author": "Jason Hartman", "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Americans spend beyond their means and abstain from adding to their savings accounts, the demand for rental properties is growing at a phenomenal rate.
