In fact, not very many people or brands know how to leverage and build social media effectively. If you look at top brands in industries, for instance people like Tony Robbins or brands like Coca Cola, their social media platforms have far too few followers and far too poor engagement for how wide and broad their reach is. Yet, having strong social media is so important that it could be argued that it won the presidency in the last election!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is that most people are not actively creating experiments, measuring, analyzing, and then tweaking their strategy to be as effective as possible.

Curiosity - Curious people attract high level people.<br />2. Combination - Having the ability to combine different people's ideas and formulating it into your own.<br />3.

Others should be able to feel this from you.</p>\n<p>If you don't have all of these traits, or you are very weak in one, the best way to build them up is to train consistently.
