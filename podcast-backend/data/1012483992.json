The company shipped over 4 million barrels of suds last year and that brought in a crisp $1 billion in revenue. All that and Boston Beer accounts for just a mere 1.5 percent percent of all beer production in the U.S.And that's got some people wondering where Sam Adams fits in craft beef definition. The company's founder and CEO, Jim Koch, will tell you he's still firmly in that category and wants to continue growing the craft beer market from where it currently stands at 10 percnet to... well, who knows.Boston Beer helped pave the way for craft beer's meteoric rise in the past few decades and Koch writes about that experience in his new book, \"Quench Your Own Thirst:\u00a0Business Lessons Learned Over a Beer or Two.\" Check out an excerpt below.IntroductionFrom the way my father was looking at me, you\u2019d think I had just proposed robbing a bank. A big, ominous-looking bank with gun-toting security guards. \u201cWhy in the world would you do that?\u201d he asked.\u201cUh, well\u2014\u201dHe waved his finger at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll never succeed. The big guys will eat you alive. They\u2019ll grind you up like they did me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s taken our family a hundred and fifty years to get the smell of the brewery out of our clothes.\u201dWe were sitting in my parents\u2019 kitchen in Cincinnati. Picture a 1950s linoleum floor, Formica counters, and wallpaper depicting culinary dishes in alphabetical order, apple strudel to zucchini bread. It was the spring of 1984, and I had just announced that at the age of thirty-four, I was quitting my job as a management consultant to start a beer company. I figured my dad would be happy. After all, he had been a brewmaster. His father had also been a brewmaster. So had his father. And his father. Five generations of first sons in the Koch family had brewed beer, making us the longest line of brewmasters in the United States. And now, with me, the lineage would continue. What could be better?I pointed to the business plan I had spread out on the kitchen table. \u201cDad, nobody\u2019s doing this the right way. I think I\u2019ve got a way to make a go of it.\u201d I sketched out my idea to start a small-scale beer company in Boston making high-quality beer for a limited number of drinkers in the region. \u201cI\u2019m not going to compete with the big boys like Anheuser-Busch. I know they\u2019d kill me. But there\u2019s another way. I\u2019m going to look for drinkers who appreciate good beer and who would pay a premium for richer, more flavorful beer. I\u2019m sure those drinkers exist. If I just focus on making a better beer, I know somebody will drink it.\u201dDad tapped the table impatiently, although I thought he seemed at least faintly interested now. \u201cAre there enough of these drinkers? Can you make a living?\u201d\u201cNot the living I currently make, but I can make a living.\u201d I pointed at some numbers I\u2019d calculated. \u201cI think after five years I\u2019ll make five thousand barrels a year, with eight employees and $1.2 million in revenue. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not much.\u201d\u201cNo, but it\u2019s enough. And I\u2019ll be happy. I\u2019ll be running my own small brewery.\u201dMy father thought about this for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic. Brewing today is about size\u2014nothing else. You\u2019re crazy!\u201d\u201cDad, there are a few microbreweries that have started up.\u201d In fact, there were about a dozen, mostly on the West Coast. Quality was unpredictable. Cracking open a bottle, you didn\u2019t know whether you would get a really great beer or a science project.\u201cHow many are making any money?\u201d Dad asked.\u201cProbably none.\u201dHe laughed. \u201cSounds like a good business. You make beer but no money. How long can you afford to do that?\u201dHe was right: There was scant reason to think my venture would be any different. But I was determined to leave my job and start my own business, and brewing was the idea I had come up with that excited me. I wanted to persuade him (and myself) that I wasn\u2019t crazy.We sat there, neither of us speaking. Without warning, he rose to his feet. \u201cJim, follow me.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cJust follow me.\u201dHe led me up to the attic. He flicked on a light and began walking toward the back.\u201cWhy are we up here?\u201d\u201cI want to show you something.\u201dI followed him, taking care not to bump my head. We made our way around boxes and old furniture until we came to a dusty trunk on which he had stacked years of Road & Track and Motor Trend magazines. (Other than his family, Charles J. Koch loved two things: cars and beer.) \u201cHere, help me with this.\u201d We moved the magazines and cracked open the trunk. Inside were notebooks, folders, and loose papers\u2014some scrawled with handwriting, all yellowed with age. He rifled through papers and held a few up for me to see. \u201cThis is what is left of the Koch family beer archives\u2014my course material, my brewing notes.\u201d He pulled out a thin folder. \u201cAnd here are the family recipes.\u201d Resting the folder on the edge of the trunk, he opened it and read for a few minutes in silence. Then he let out a little hoot as he shook a piece of paper he\u2019d found. \u201cThis is the best beer recipe our family has! It\u2019s old\u2014from the 1860s. If you\u2019re going to do this crazy thing, you might as well start with the best recipe.\u201dHe handed me the paper so I could take a look. Moving to where the light was better, I saw that the recipe was for an \u201call-malt\u201d beer, one that adhered to the Reinheitsgebot (a German beer purity law dating to 1516). The Reinheitsgebot was the world\u2019s first consumer protection law, stipulating that beer could contain only four ingredients: water, yeast, malted barley or wheat, and hops. Virtually all twentieth-century American beers and some European beers used corn, rice, and preservatives in addition to malt because those ingredients were cheaper and made the beer lighter and \u201cmore drinkable.\u201d The recipe my father gave me took none of these shortcuts. It made a substantial beer, pure and simple. And it used traditional, nearly forgotten brewing techniques with arcane names like kr\u00e4usening, decoction mashing, and dry hopping.I glanced through the recipe and then looked at my father. \u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry you gave this to me.\u201dHe had one thing to add: \u201cJust do me a favor. Make a good beer, and don\u2019t worry about the marketing. People drink the beer; they don\u2019t drink the marketing. Don\u2019t get distracted. Just worry about the beer.\u201dI promised him I would.*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *THE COMPANY I FOUNDED in 1984, the Boston Beer Company (BBC), gave me both pleasure and purpose beyond my wildest dreams. By 1988, my founding partner, Rhonda Kallman, and I were selling 36,000 barrels a year, seven times what we\u2019d anticipated. Rhonda had been my assistant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the management consulting firm where I\u2019d been working, and her skills complemented mine perfectly. Together, we sustained the company\u2019s exponential growth for years. We won awards at beer competitions, entered dozens of new markets, added dozens of employees, and began to offend the companies making big imported beers like Heineken, Corona, and Beck\u2019s. Other start-ups rushed to replicate our success, and the craft beer segment was born.In 1995, when Boston Beer went public and began selling shares of its stock on the New York Stock Exchange, it seemed we could do no wrong. And then, just months later, the empire struck back (to use a Star Wars metaphor) in the form of an industry Goliath hell-bent on the destruction of Sam Adams in particular and craft beer in general. Everything we had worked for was at risk. We persevered, though, and some twenty years later the craft revolution is stronger than ever, accounting for more than 10 percent of the overall beer market. Driven by further innovations like Angry Orchard hard cider, Boston Beer\u2019s 2015 revenues have reached nearly $1 billion. That might be an impressive-sounding number, but Samuel Adams is still only about 1 percent of the overall U.S. beer market. That\u2019s right; it took us thirty years to get to 1 percent. We started at invisible, grew to infinitesimal, got to minuscule, and moved to tiny. In 2015 we can proudly say, \u201cWe finally made it to small!\u201dNever in a million years did I think Boston Beer would grow to employ more than a thousand people. Never did I think I\u2019d get to drink some 24,000 beers as part of my job. Never did I think my work days would be so diverse and engaging, and that they would include tasting experimental brews, presiding over weddings at our brewery (I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid on three occasions\u2014always a bridesmaid, never a bride), getting dunked into a tank of expired beer, designing brewing equipment, making yearly trips to Germany to select hops, and having a gun pulled on me by a startled bar owner.As I\u2019ve described these experiences in bars across the world, people have asked me what I\u2019ve learned\u2014what words of wisdom do I have? This book is my answer. I serve up stories I hope will help you if you\u2019re starting a new business, working in an established one, or trying to figure out what you want to do next. I address specific business topics like sales, hiring, innovation, culture, and leadership, but I also advocate for a broader approach of openness and experimentation in business and life. And of course, I include discussion of my most colossal screw-ups.In the spirit of a tavern conversation, I invite you to settle into your favorite chair, crack open a cold Sam, and imagine we are sitting together.

That's\u00a0not true.\u00a0It's actually more like 60 percent in the first three years.\u00a0But the sentiment still holds. It's really hard to open a successful one and even harder to make one last.\u00a0So how did an immigrant with no high school education, let alone a culinary school degree, become the most famous chef in America and build an empire worth over $400 million? It's a harrowing story that involves poverty, abuse, child labor, a firing or two, an attempted suicide and huge heaping helpings of gumption, drive and stick-to-itiveness.Wolfgang Puck is widely considered the first modern celebrity chef. But don't say that to his face.I hate the term celebrity chef. That's not who I am. I don't walk around in a Brioni suit. I don't look out for the money first. I like to make projects as good as I can and hopefully we make money off of it.And money off it he has made. Puck has an illustrious portfolio of 27 fine dining restaurants, more than 80 Wolfgang Puck Express locations,\u00a0a line of cookware, six cookbooks,\u00a0prepackaged foods and a catering business that handles the Oscars, the\u00a0Emmys\u00a0and the Governors Ball.But it may be his influence on culture that has been his crowning achievement.When we opened Spago (in 1982), we were the first restaurant with an open kitchen. I went to the farmers market, I went to the fish market. Before, \u00a0you had all these fancy restaurants that poured your seafood on an iceberg and some ketchup with horseradish and everything. That was the traditional thing, and maybe they cut a steak in front of you. But there was no imagination because it wasn't a chef who ran the restaurant. It was some owner or a ma\u00eetre' d or a director of the restaurant. So when I started Spago, and Paul Prudhomme started Portmanteau in New Orleans and with Alice Waters up in Berkeley, we were really the first chefs who controlled the destiny of the restaurant. We cooked whatever we felt like. Not what somebody told you.\u00a0Spago also pioneered the gourmet pizza movement. And Puck's cultural reach has spread far outside of the U.S., to restaurants from Bahrain to Istanbul to Dubai. Despite all his success, the 66-year-old continues to work six days a week in his Bel-Air Hotel restaurant and is on the road more than 100 days a year, checking in on his businesses.\u00a0When you love what you do and you have passion for what you do it's easy. My wife said, 'You should slow down,' and I said, what am I going to do then? I always tell people I'm only at the beginning.

He's perhaps most famous for helping to break Lady Gaga, but he's also behind the success of Eve, Meghan Trainor and John Legend, just to name a few. He is the founder and CEO of Atom Factory, a full-service talent management agency that has become famous for utilizing technology and social media.\u00a0West Philadelphia born and raisedCarter's childhood was tough. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and he spent his early years living with his mom in a kerosene-heated, two-bedroom apartment that often had no running water. Carter's mom, Gilda Carter, worked at Children's Hospital cleaning surgical instruments and when he was seven years old, his father shot and killed his new wife's brother and spent 12 years in prison. Carter found solace in music, dropping out of high school at 17 to pursue a career in rap music with his group 2 Too Many.Here's a music video from the group (Carter is in the red sweatshirt and backwards cap):\n\nI grew up carrying crates of records for Will Smith and those guys. I thought I was going to be a rapper as a kid and used to hop the train down to Jazzy Jeff\u2019s studio for like six months straight waiting outside of the studio for the big break, and one day we got in the studio and played our demo for Will and Jeff and quickly learned that we weren\u2019t that good. But Will and his partner James Lassiter saw some potential in our hustle and kind of took me under their wing.Carter went to Los Angeles with Smith and Lassiter when \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u201d went into production. He ended up back on the East Coast and while working as a concert promoter there, he met Sean \"P. Diddy/Puff Daddy\" Combs.He was one of the first young entrepreneurs that I met and he was kind of commanding the room and I said, \"I want to come work for you.\" And he said, \"Your first job is to get me that girl from behind the bar.\u2019 I got him the girl behind the bar and I started working for Puff.While working at Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment, Carter rubbed elbows with Notorious B.I.G., learned how to be a young entrepreneur and met a 19-year-old singer named Eve Jeffers. He launched his own talent management company to market Eve, building her up through a clothing line and a TV deal. Eve and Carter parted ways after several years, and that's when Carter discovered the artist whose name is now synonymous with his. Her real name is\u00a0Stefani Germanotta, but she would be introduced to the world as Lady Gaga. Carter bristles, however, at the assertion that he \"made\" Gaga.\u00a0You can't make an artist like Lady Gaga. You can help support, you can help develop the vision \u2014 I think you can add to the vision \u2014 but you just can't make an artist like that. That's like saying Lebron James' high school coach made Lebron James. Lebron James made Lebron James from the time he was able to put in at the gym, and I feel the same way about her.\n[[{\"fid\":\"294976\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Music manager Troy Carter, founder, Chairman and CEO of Atom Factory, speaks during the Digital Life Design conference (DLD) at HVB Forum on January 23, 2012 in Munich, Germany.\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_description[und][0][value]\":\"%3Cspan%3E%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fspan%3E\",\"field_description[und][0][format]\":\"full_html\",\"field_byline_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_migration_notes[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Music manager Troy Carter, founder, Chairman and CEO of Atom Factory, speaks during the Digital Life Design conference (DLD) at HVB Forum on January 23, 2012 in Munich, Germany.\",\"height\":522,\"width\":800,\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]Music manager Troy Carter \u2014founder, chairman and CEO of Atom Factory \u2014 speaks during the Digital Life Design conference on January 23, 2012 in Munich, Germany. (\u00a0Nadine Rupp/Getty Images)\nCarter's real genius came from how he marketed Lady Gaga. He used social media to build a following and was an early adopter of Spotify for his artists. He says that the music industry has been slow in realizing \"music sells everything but music,\" and there's plenty of money to be made out there.Music as a whole industry is growing exponentially, but in terms of the actual music file when you look at the actual value there to me The Beatles catalog should be worth more than Spotify. So I think the industry has done a very poor job in terms of value capture.Carter launched a start-up called The Backplane in 2011 that pairs artists with brands for non-traditional endorsements, and around the time he and Lady Gaga parted ways, he got into angel investing. One of his first buy-ins was Uber.When I first got pitched on Uber I thought it was the dumbest idea ever. I get on the phone with (Uber founder) Travis (Kalanick) and I\u2019m like, you\u2019re going to buy all of these black cars? Where\u2019s the model here? And he\u2019s like, \u2018no, you idiot, this is a logistics platform.\u2019 Once he explained it then I got it.\nCarter talks about his experiences in the entertainment world, and startup culture:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0via TechCrunch\nCarter now has investments in 90 companies including Spotify, Dropbox and Warby Parker. He has also recently launched his own venture capital firm AF Square, but he still doesn't describe himself as a venture capitalist. That's because he doesn't like labels. Carter says one of the biggest dangers in business is \"the box.\"People get stuck in a box.
