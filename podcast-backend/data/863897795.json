For years, I've been studying Stoicism, but I've always had a particular interest in The Tao of Seneca.\u00a0What is the Tao of Seneca? There's a collection of letters called, \"The Moral Letters to Lucilius.\" And I have read this entire collection of letters and other letters of Seneca, the author, probably more than 100 times. It has been my constant companion for at least the last 10 years. And I have given various forms of these letters to more friends than I can even count and several hundred acquaintances -- I feel that strongly about it. So when people ask me about my favorite book, I say this collection of letters.</p> <p>The problem has been there is no good audio edition. So I, for many months now, have made this my passion project to create\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.audible.com/timsbooks\" target=\"_blank\">The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from a Stoic Master</a>. Three volumes, and it covers them all. Here's the description:</p> <p><em>The Tao of Seneca is an introduction to the stoic philosophy through the words of Seneca. Thought leaders in Silicon Valley tout the benefits of stoicism, and NFL management (coaches and players, alike) have embraced it because the principles make them better competitors.</em></p> <p>This episode features letter #13, \"On Groundless Fears.\" Stoicism is a no-nonsense philosophical system designed to produce dramatic real-world effects. Think of it as an ideal operating system for thriving in high-stress environments.

In this episode, we discuss the\u00a0immediate and long-term effects of psychedelics when used for spiritual purposes (high dose), therapeutic purposes (moderate dose), and problem-solving purposes (low dose). Fadiman outlines best practices for safe \"entheogenic\" voyages learned through his more than 40 years of experience--from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and pre-session intention.
