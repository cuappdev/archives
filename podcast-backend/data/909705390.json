We are very aware how difficult this weekend was for a LOT of people and very much hope you understand that we take it seriously. Humor for us is a familiar tactic we call on to deal with tough situations and that\u2019s what this episode was for us.

If you are looking for your everyday, normal, by the book podcast, then you're in the wrong place. We created this because we tend to have awesome, random, and sometimes drunk conversations that we realized had to be shared with the lovely internet world. So here we are. We are currently in the process of making this podcast available through iTunes so stay tuned for that. \n\nWe also like to ustream during the podcast to get some live interaction and also quick on-the-spot input on our chats--you can participate here: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/jsolo123\n\nSubscribe to this channel for new podcasts EVERY MONDAY\n\nYou can follow us on all the things:\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/jennajulienpod\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jennajulienpod\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/JennaJulienPodcast\n\nJenna: \nIG: http://instagram.com/jennamarbles\nTW: https://twitter.com/Jenna_Marbles\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles\n\nJulien:\nIG: http://instagram.com/juliensolomita\nTW: https://twitter.com/JulienSolomita\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFightingSolo", "duration": "00:08:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/b9/12/d3/b912d364-e42d-7e28-3f35-cd9b7d643197/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/b9/12/d3/b912d364-e42d-7e28-3f35-cd9b7d643197/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.Podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/163730917-jennajulienpodcast-podcast-1-technology-kids-and-useful-vs-useless-classes-in-school.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}]}
