Let's get to it!</p> <h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>The Cheat Sheet:</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>When you repeat something enough, it often loses its meaning. Through overuse, \"gratitude\" seems to be one of the latest casualties of this phenomenon.</strong></li> <li><strong>But done right, gratitude is one of the most powerful tools we have for life improvement -- it's one of the straightest and shortest paths to happiness and connection, and it utilizes thankfulness for things we already have rather than goading us toward what's currently out of reach.</strong></li> <li><strong>The word <em>thanks</em> comes from the Old English <em>thanc</em>, which means <em>thought</em> or <em>gratitude</em>. But it's also related to the Latin <em>tongere</em>, which means <em>to know</em>. So to thank is really to know. To know someone and to know yourself -- to know what they did for you and to know how it affected you.</strong></li> <li><strong>We can't really summon the powers of gratitude if we're just going through the motions -- we have to remind ourselves of the reasons we have to be grateful.</strong></li> <li><strong>Try to remember what a friend did for you recently. Think about valuable lessons you've taken away from a tough learning process. Even remembering an exceptionally delicious meal you've had -- these are all things you <em>know</em> and can be used to plant the seed of gratitude.</strong></li> <li><strong>Once we start thinking of gratitude as a kind of knowing, we can work with it in our everyday lives. Knowing gives us three things: a way to keep us focused on the good in our lives, a way to stay connected with people in our network, and a way to express generosity.</strong></li> <li><strong>Gratitude is transformative -- it allows us to accept even negative truths as gifts and learn from them. It's facing our problems and growing from the sometimes hard lessons rather than ignoring or denying that problems exist.</strong></li> <li><strong>If you can feel a curiosity -- maybe even a little excitement about what you might gain from any situation -- then you're already tapping into your gratitude.</strong></li> <li><strong>Start saying \"yes\" to everything on a cognitive level. Accept things as they are rather than how you wish they were. Take a moment to reflect on what went well every day. It will go from a deliberate practice to something that's automatic.</strong></li> <li><strong>Communicate with those who make you grateful. Take 30 seconds to send your friend or colleague a text, an email, or a handwritten note to thank them for whatever way they made your life better. If you're looking for a way to maintain good connections and building social capital in your network, this may just top the list.</strong></li> <li><strong>To learn more about social dynamics and the place of gratitude, <a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/challenge\" target=\"_blank\">take the Art of Charm Challenge by clicking here</a>, or text CHARMED to 33444.</strong></li> <li><strong>Also be sure to <a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/socialcapital/\" target=\"_blank\">check out our Social Capital Intensive here</a>!</strong></li> <li><strong>Let us know about how you put today's Minisode Monday into practice!

This leads to what Raj calls the sin of \"mind addiction.\"</strong></li> <li><strong>When we succumb to this mind addiction, we tend to overanalyze and get into analysis paralysis -- unable to remove ourselves from a self-feeding loop that actually stops us from making a decision at all (or, in the best case, an inferior decision).</strong></li> <li><strong>Our instinct -- our gut -- packs a lot more information than we give it credit for. Evolution has given us this intrinsic command center we often ignore in favor of waiting for further, external information that may or may not exist.</strong></li> <li><strong>This isn't to say all decisions should unquestioningly be handled by the gut. Stock market investing, for instance, is a job for the brain. But making a spreadsheet to weigh the pros and cons of dating one person over another is being overanalytical of a job best handled by the gut.</strong></li> <li><strong>What is the eventual benefit you seek? Is it an emotional/experiential one, or is it a functional/practical/utilitarian one? If it's the former, go with your gut. If it's the latter, it may be worth letting your mind give it more careful thought.</strong></li> <li><strong>Do you need to justify your choice to other people? It's probably a job for your mind. If it's something for which you are only accountable to yourself, the gut may be your better option.</strong></li> <li><strong>To learn more about making decisions with the right part of your body, <a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/challenge\" target=\"_blank\">take the Art of Charm Challenge by clicking here</a>, or text CHARMED to 33444.</strong></li> <li><strong>Let us know about how you put today's Minisode Monday into practice!

Even if our generosity is unconditional, the receiving party usually feels obligated in some way to return the favor out of an inherent sense of fairness.</strong></li> <li><strong>We all want to feel as if we're good at doing something -- even if that <em>something</em> is simply being an agent of positive change. When we see our actions as making a difference in the world, we feel more than competent -- we feel powerful.</strong></li> <li><strong>On the other side of it, being <em>too</em> nice -- overly kind and giving -- can get us marked as suckers; where do we draw the line?

He remembers\u00a0having very vivid dreams as a child, and being fascinated by them. At 14 he began a dream journal to chronicle his experiences.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Although he became a field archaeologist after college, a decade later he\u00a0returned to school to study his passion: dreams. He earned an MA\u00a0in the Consciousness Studies program at John F Kennedy along with a Certificate in Dream Studies. He has worked with dream researchers and experts throughout his career.\u00a0On this episode Ryan shares us with his scientific and practical application of dreaming.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Practically speaking sleep is the third pillar of health, without it diet and exercise don't have nearly the same positive impact as they do when we're sleeping properly. We have to start with good sleep before we can do any quality dream work, like lucid dreaming.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Once good sleep is in place our dreams can help us understand what's really important (and who), face our fears and anxieties, increase our emotional IQ and come up with solutions to pressing problems.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Ryan says if we have a recurring dream about something or someone there's a lesson in it for us, our sleep is trying to tell us something. Have you had several dreams about a former lover from a decade ago? It doesn't necessarily mean you should contact that old flame. Instead, take that feeling you have from the dream and notice when you have that same feeling in real life: your dream is trying to guide you so you can change your response in that situation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Or if you find yourself dreaming about those bullies from elementary school time and again, use that dream to respond differently; you can use your dream to face those bullies, stand up for yourself and finally work through the fear and anxiety you felt in that situation. You'll have become more powerful in your dream and in real life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And you can use dreams to help you with current day issues: if you're faced with a problem or situation that you don't know how to resolve in real life your dreams can provide options and potential solutions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">First you must be adapt at remembering your dreams and you can start by keeping a dream journal.Once you're remembering your dreams you can write down your problem before you go to sleep, then write down your dreams when you wake up. Do this for at least 3 nights in a row and your dreams will provide answers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Ryan and I also explore the topic of lucid dreaming, including some of the latest technological advances in this area plus dream incubation and his dream app recommendations.

She is a licensed and practicing psychotherapist who has been profiled by\u00a0<em>The New York Times</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>The New Yorker</em>. Her book,\u00a0<em>Mating in Captivity</em>, is an international bestseller that has been published in 24 different languages.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Obviously she knows a few things about the world of relationships!\u00a0And on today's show she discusses why relationships are still complicated after thousands of years, why men deserve more freedom in their accepted roles in life and how we can rekindle any neglected relationship.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Although we've been in relationship as long as we've been in existence, we're still experiencing significant challenges and problems in our relationships. Why? Why haven't we figured it out yet?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Esther says it's because we have so many more choices today, something we've never had that before. Couple that with our\u00a0adopted attitude of novelty, replacement and you'll understand why fewer people stay together through the difficult times.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">What if you are one of those couples who is navigating a difficult time and you want to rekindle the spark you once had together? The first step is to acknowledge your role in the situation. Ask yourself if you're treating your partner the way you treat your clients? Are you as good to your significant other as you are to other people in your life? If the answer is no then say so to your partner.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And once you've acknowledged your lack of appreciation, start appreciating that person more. Don't save the gratitude for anniversaries, birthdays and Valentine's Day.\u00a0Do something for them, give them the day off from being a mom or a caretaker. Take care of them for a change, and show your appreciation for all they do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">If you're away on a business trip write a letter thanking your significant other for the things they do to make your life better, from taking care of the house while you're gone to caring for your kids, etc. You'll feel elevated by elevating and showing your gratitude for them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Esther also spells out how we can diffuse any argument no matter the subject and what hostile dependence is and how to let go of it\u00a0in any relationship.

Your playful side.<br /></strong>You open the conversation with this side of you. Ask her a question like what is she drinking? Who is she here with? Why is she out tonight? A\u00a0who, what, where, when, why or how question is a good opener.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When she answers come back with something playful. Like if you ask her what's drinking and she says cosmo, tell her it'll never work between you because your last girlfriend drank cosmos and she was a lush. Make it playful, smile with your lips and your eyes when you respond and you'll put her at ease and you'll also be giving her a role to play.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>2. You don't seek others' approval.</strong><br />This part of bantering comes next and it's done by misinterpreting what she says to you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Again, always smiling with your eyes and your mouth when you respond to let her know you're being silly, playful and yet you are your own man who isn't reliant on the approval of others, without, of course, overcompensating. \u00a0There is a fine line between a charming rogue and a boorish try-hard.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>3. Sexual.</strong><br />We'll let you learn directly from the\u00a0AoC coaches during the show for this one.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Those are the three traits and the order in which to highlight them. You'll want to practice these to get good at them, banter is definitely a muscle to be used daily. An improv class is a great way to practice banter, and so is chatting up people you interact with every day.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Check it out\u00a0on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><strong>THANKS AOC!</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let us\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending us a quick shout out on Twitter:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheArtofCharm\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank AOC\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong><a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/aoc-toolbox-attraction-episode-406/\" target=\"_blank\">Attraction Toolbox episode</a></strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheArtofCharm\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm on Twitter</a></strong><br /><strong><a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/toolbox/\" target=\"_blank\">Other AOC Toolbox episodes</a></strong><br /><strong><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps<br /></a></strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Also sponsored by:<img alt=\"Full_Logo_HG-01\" class=\"frame alignnone wp-image-9219 size-medium\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Full_Logo_HG-01-300x112.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You\u2019ll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong><span>On your phone?

But our guest for episode 407 was\u00a0the first to author a book in the New Age category; he was there long before the tricksters, hucksters and \"gurus\" made a mockery of the industry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Dan Millman is the best-selling author of\u00a0<em>The Way of the Peaceful Warrior</em>\u00a0and 17 other books. Today he joins us to talk about what prompted his first book, whether you need to travel to grow as a person and what we can learn and apply to live the peaceful warrior's way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Check Out HostGator!</a></strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><strong>More About This Show</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">For those of you who don't know him Dan Millman is the author of\u00a0<em>The Way of the Peaceful Warrior</em>, a book published in 1980. It was so new and so unlike anything else on the bookshelves that his publisher recommended the bookstores start a new category for it: New Age.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Whether you want to thank him or chastise him for that, he brings an immense amount of value on today's episode. His background in gymnastics and martial arts (before it was cool) along with some life-changing experiences granted him a grounded, simplistic yet incredibly powerful outlook and approach to living a peaceful warrior's life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Dan shares what it means to live life as a peaceful warrior: we live with a peaceful heart and a warrior's spirit. That warrior's spirit primarily does battle with our inner conflicts of self-doubt, fear and insecurity.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">He also shares his experiences in martial arts, which he started participating in as a young child in the 1950s and 60s. That training coupled with the fracture of his right leg in a motorcycle crash all helped him develop a very different, unique and disarmingly simple approach to personal growth: what he calls the \"outside in\" approach.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">What that approach means is instead of changing our thoughts and our feelings and hoping our actions will change as a result, we change our actions. We have next to no control over our emotions and our thoughts, but we can control how we act.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Even if we aren't feeling particularly kind we can still be kind! Even if we aren't feeling brave, we can act bravely by acknowledging our fear and acting despite it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And Dan's personal journey into understanding this and the life of a peaceful warrior began when he was a world-class gymnast at UC-Berkeley. One night he stopped off at a nearby service station and began talking with an old man who worked there. The old man would never tell Dan's his name but Dan nicknamed him Socrates because that's who he reminded Dan of.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Their friendship and mentor/mentee relationship would have such a profound impact on Dan he would later pen his book\u00a0<em>The Way of the Peaceful Warrior</em>\u00a0based on that time with Socrates. Although it's based on true events, fictional elements are interwoven within it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's show Dan shares why he did that, as well as why he chose to teach and share his knowledge with others and why we don't have to travel in order to grow.

On today's show we're specifically discussing the four channels of attraction: static, dynamic, self-presentation and circumstance. There are specific ways to maximize each area to maximize your attractiveness in any setting.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>1. Static.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">These are the things about you that you cannot change: your height, your eye color, sometimes even your build. You aren't going to wake up tomorrow looking like Brad Pitt but you also don't need to carry around those extra 30 pounds.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The key here is to maximize these areas by getting adequate sleep, eating right and exercising. When you take better care of yourself it will show.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>2. Dynamic.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You've probably guessed it: dynamic is what you can change about yourself. This is your body language, your energy. If you're feeling happy your body will show up. If you're feeling confident your body will show it. And you can control your emotions and change them, your body will follow.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">One thing we do at our boot camps is the power posture. This means standing in a victory pose for 90 seconds. Do it and watch how your mind shifts when you do. Make it part of your morning routine for maximum impact.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>3.\u00a0Self-presentation.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is your style and your grooming. Your self-presentation is how you get to show the world a bit about you, who you are and who you want to connect with. If you're a hipster let your fashion say so. If you're a rocker show it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And be sure your fashion is appropriate for your body type, get your clothes fitted if needed. A tailor can do wonders for your self-presentation and is worth the extra effort.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>4. Circumstance.<br /></strong>This is your surroundings and your location, it's both the place you choose to be and where you choose to be in that location. First and foremost be selective about where you go (check out\u00a0<a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/aoc-toolbox-your-third-place-episode-403/\" target=\"_blank\">Third Place Toolbox episode</a>\u00a0for details) and who you're with.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A way to maximize your circumstance is to go out alone, and we give you the specifics on how to do so. One thing to note is when you're out on your own stand at the angle of the bar. More\u00a0people \u00a0will be waiting in line there and you can strike up a conversation with them.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Those are the four channels of attraction! In this episode we also discuss additional ways to maximize each of them, how to know if you have too much or not enough energy and why you want to be Kumar when you're out at the bar (and leave your Harold side at home).</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Check it out\u00a0on this edition of The Art of Charm, and then come back for our next toolbox episode on what to say to further that attraction!</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>THANKS AOC!</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let us\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending us a quick shout out on Twitter:</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheArtofCharm\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank AOC\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></strong></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/aoc-toolbox-your-third-place-episode-403/\" target=\"_blank\">Third Place Toolbox episode</a></strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheArtofCharm\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm on Twitter</a></strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/toolbox/\" target=\"_blank\">Other AOC Toolbox episodes</a></strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps<br /></a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Also sponsored by:<img alt=\"Full_Logo_HG-01\" class=\"frame alignnone wp-image-9219 size-medium\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Full_Logo_HG-01-300x112.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You\u2019ll also like:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span>On your phone?

His company primarily focuses on training people in the disciplines\u00a0of communication, persuasion or relationship-building. Their trainings are tailored to your particular sector.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But Adam's know-how was forged during his time in counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism service for Canada, his home country. He learned two of the most important skills any of us can have are communication and relationship-building. If you can listen properly you can communicate in such a way as to build relationships.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And so much of communication is the in the subtext: it's not what the person says necessarily but more of what they didn't say and why they didn't say it. In order to read that subtext you have to be able to read people.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Adam says purpose-driven communication like this takes finesse, practice and is a perishable thing. You have to learn it, use it and keep using it so your skills stay finely-tuned.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To hone and keep your skills sharp, pay attention to a person, their mannerisms, their responses and the environment so you can\u00a0become more aware of what they are actually saying in their non-verbal communication. By listening intently and deliberately with practice and patience you'll have a better understanding of human interaction, rapport-building and relationship-building.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Put this into practice by\u00a0going to a bar or coffee shop and simply observe people there. You'll begin to read people's personal baselines: how they are in a normal conversation. Find out what's normal for someone and then communicate with them in that way.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And that's your next step after observing people: interact with them. Give yourself five seconds to build rapport, then talk with them for a few minutes to build a connection and get their contact information so you can practice building a relationship.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On today's show Adam gives us the third and final step in this process, as well as the two types of listening in a conversation and which works best, and his personal profiling technique.\u00a0Check it out on today's episode of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>THANKS ADAM NESRALLAH!</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>If you enjoyed this session with Adam, let him know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on\u00a0Twitter:</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoninIntel\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Adam on Twitter!</a></em></strong></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.ronin-intel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Nesrallah's\u00a0web site</a></strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoninIntel\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Adam Nesrallah on\u00a0Twitter</strong></a></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps<br /></a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Also sponsored by:<img alt=\"Full_Logo_HG-01\" class=\"frame alignnone wp-image-9219 size-medium\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Full_Logo_HG-01-300x112.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><strong><a href=\"http://mixergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show at our sponsor Mixergy!</a></strong></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You'll also like:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span>On your phone?

She fell in love with the idea of seeing no as a way to success. After a story her now-husband shared with her she realized mediocre results and mediocre lives occur because people avoid getting noes. They see a no as a failure, rather than part of the process on the way to success.</p>\n<p>On today's episode she shares how to reframe your model of success and failure to create more ease and more success, what focused failure is and how to overcome fear in the moment to take action.</p>\n<p>Most of us have been told from early on that no is a bad thing. It means you've done something wrong and you're being rejected. But Andrea encourages you to see a no as a good thing, see it for what it is: part of the process on the road to success.</p>\n<p>In fact she says setting no goals is beneficial: pick a number of noes you want to get in a week and then go for it.\u00a0As you get those noes and hit your goals you should celebrate them, and look for feedback. Why are people saying no? Ask the people who say no what you could've done or said differently to get a yes.</p>\n<p>When you use that approach, whether in business or dating or anywhere else in your life, you'll be more at ease. You're more likely to feel tense and have tense interactions if you are focused on a yes. But if you're actively seeking noes then you're okay with whatever response you get, and that creates a sense of confidence.</p>\n<p>And that's part of focused failure: setting a no goal, getting feedback from all the noes, receiving that feedback without letting your ego get the better of you and then implementing that feedback in your next quest for noes.

The third place is anything from a cafe to a pub to a diner, so long as it's close to your house and it fits certain criteria. Whether you're new to your neighborhood or not you still need a third place.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here are the four things to look for when choosing\u00a0it:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>1. It's a leveler.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Everyone is equal here no matter their background, socioeconomic status, etc. When someone is at this spot they're just a member of the community. In other words\u00a0if there's bottle service available it doesn't fit the criteria, and this is why clubs aren't really a third place.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>2. You're primarily there for conversation.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Your third place is where you to go to chat, interact, vent, tell stories, etc. The purpose of being there is to communicate with the people around you.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>3. You can become a regular.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">No matter what you know you'll see familiar faces when you go here. When you're looking for your third place be sure there are regulars who are a part of its community, people who if they weren't seen for awhile would be missed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>4. There's no real structure to what's happening.<br /></strong>Anything can happen and there's an openness to the energy and environment of the place.<strong>\u00a0</strong>People are just there to be there, not for any specific activity or agenda.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Also your third place shouldn't be sexy, it should be comfortable and a place you feel good going to alone.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And that's what you're going to do once you've chosen your third place. To establish yourself as a regular there go in on an off-peak night, some night of the week when it isn't packed and you can meet the staff and the regular patrons.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When you go there be sure to introduce yourself to the bartender and/or manager, smile a lot and make conversation with people around you. Let the staff know you're new in town (if you are) and tell them you'll be coming around often, then be sure to leave them a healthy tip. Continue to drop in during off peak times, chat people up and make the place better for having your presence. The bartenders will remember you and appreciate you.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Once you've set the foundation for your third place you can consider what friends to bring there and going in during a busy time. AJ and Johnny explain more about who to bring and when, as well as the vital role third places play in our communities.

He and his business partner run a web site that helps people buy diamonds without being ripped off.

The company he\u00a0worked for helped\u00a0jewelers maximize profitable - in other words they helped jewelers make the most money on any diamond ring sale.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After 8 years he was tired of that end of the business and left. His now-business partner Ari came to him with an idea: why not create an online spot to help people buy the best diamond for the best price? Together they created Diamonds.pro. The concept is simple: they help you find the best diamond for your needs and then recommend several web sites where you can buy it for your budget.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">They earn a commission from the web sites, but that commission is paid by the sites and not an extra mark-up for you down the road. Their site provides education so you know what to look for and how to get the most value for what you're spending.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On today's show Mike debunks many of the myths of the diamond industry like the 3 months' salary myth, the myth that diamonds are somehow more precious than other stones and that diamonds are actually not an investment; they are simply a commodity you're paying for, not an investment for the future.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you are shopping for rings you've probably heard of the 4 Cs: cut, color, clarity and carats. Mike says you can't get a \"top quality\" diamond that excels in all four areas.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Instead you should focus on cut and carats. Get the best cut at the best size you can afford. How well cut the diamond is will be reflected in its brilliance and shine; and size definitely matters! People will notice how it shines and how big it is.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Certification is also another tricky area. Mike recommends only relying on certification from GIA and AGS, those two are the gold standard of the diamond industry and you can count on their consistency and reliability. When they rate a diamond you can be sure that's what you're getting.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">He also says\u00a0IGI and HRD are a step below, they're not as consistent. But avoid EGL, many jewelers are facing lawsuits because they sold poor quality diamonds rated highly by EGL.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mike also has recommendations on how to set your budget, why surprising your girl with a ring isn't the best idea and the truth about the cartel behind the diamond industry. Check it out on today's episode of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>THANKS MIKE FRIED!</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>If you enjoyed this session with Mike Fried, let him know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/diamond_truths/\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Mike on Twitter!</a></em></strong></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://diamonds.pro\" target=\"_blank\">Diamonds Pro\u00a0web site</a></strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/diamond_truths/\" target=\"_blank\">Diamonds Pro\u00a0on Twitter</a></strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps<br /></a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Also sponsored by:<img alt=\"Full_Logo_HG-01\" class=\"frame alignnone wp-image-9219 size-medium\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Full_Logo_HG-01-300x112.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (Free) and Support Our Supporters!</a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br />You'll also like:</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Wanna leave a comment?

But is that what really separates the high performers from everyone else - their ability to think positively? Not according to Todd Herman, our guest for this episode.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Todd is a high performance coach who works with elite athletes, CEOs and entrepreneurs. He joins us to talk about the power of negative thinking, why alter egos are vital to your success and how to do negative prep today on the 401st episode of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>More About This Show:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When Todd Herman says he's a high performance coach he isn't joking. He's considered one of the foremost authorities in the world on crafting high performance. He has trained some of the elite athletes of the world including professionals and Olympians. He's also worked with\u00a0the royal family of Spain!</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And one thing he's discovered about high performers may surprise you: they are prone to depression and are not positive thinkers. However they are positive expecters. What does that mean? It means they think, see and anticipate threats, weaknesses and other potential negative situations.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But they don't stop there as many non-high performer people do, they take those negative possibilities and evaluate them. They ask how will I overcome this IF it happens? Or how can I mitigate this for the least impact? This way of thinking and these questions are what Todd calls the positive power of negative preparation, and it\u00a0is one of the thought processes of a high performer.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Another thought process high performers use, and something Todd coaches people to use, is the alter ego. A great example of this is Bo Jackson,\u00a0the only athlete to be an all-star in two professional sporting leagues: the NFL and the MLB.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As he once said to Todd: \"Bo never played a down of football in his life.\"\u00a0What Bo meant by that, and what he went on to share with Todd, was that he constructed an alter ego who played football and baseball. Bo didn't have a mean bone in his body; he was kind and would never want to hurt anyone in any way.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But that personality wouldn't serve him on the field and Bo knew that. So he constructed an alter ego who was gritty, nasty and the toughest guy on the field. Todd explains some of the key components of creating this alter ego for yourself in this show.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Todd also explains how to get in the zone as your alter ego (and why you don't always want to be there), what the 2 weeks sprint is and how to use it to reach your goals, plus how to overcome the \"I'm a fraud\" mentality and why thinking that thought is actually a positive sign!

This question goes hand in hand with our advice to surround\u00a0yourself with people you want to be like. And today's episode gives you practical advice on how to do just that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Whether you're moving somewhere new, have already moved or simply want to expand your social circle, this show will explain the four groups you need to have in your life, how to find those groups,\u00a0and run people through a \"social sales funnel\".\u00a0Listen in for all of that and more\u00a0on the 400th episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Check Out HostGator!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The axiom of \"you become the five people you spend the most time with\" is one of core teachings of this show. Today we'll share with you how to meet more people you want to be like, whether you've just moved to a new town or not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">There are four groups you should always have in your life and they are:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>1. An all-men's group.</strong><br />This should be a group of men you get together with regularly. It could be an entrepreneurial group of guys who meet regularly or a mentoring type group. This group is important because it gives you a chance to grow your leadership skills.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>2. A co-ed group.</strong><br />Once you have your all-men's group find a co-ed group. This could be a group of men and women who meet often to play some kind of sport or do another activity together. The web site meetup.com is a great place to find groups like these. This group is important because you'll have opportunities to learn and apply other diplomatic skills with both men and women.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>3. Your show-off group.</strong><br />This is your next group to find after finding groups one and two. In the show-off group you're going to be showing off what makes you unique. Are you a great coder or great at cooking? A drummer, guitarist, aspiring comedian? That is your show off group.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>4. A charity or community-focused group.</strong><br />Find a group where you can contribute to a charity or a community-based group. This can be as simple as attending an annual charity event, but it adds a richness and a depth to you, your social circles and your personality.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">So once you've got all four groups in your life, you can\u00a0begin the \"social sales funnel\". There\u00a0are some basic steps in the funnel.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The first is\u00a0to find people from your four groups you hit it off with. Then find opportunities to hang out with them.

He's built an empire with his brand I Will Teach You to Be Rich. He's also a well-connected networker and influencer.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On this episode he recounts what he was like when he was socially awkward, how he realized he was lacking in this area and overcame it, and why being an introvert is no excuse to be a bad networker.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Back in his younger days, Ramit was that guy who talked non-stop and would in fact talk himself in circles. So much so that people would ask him what the point was of his chattering. He didn't notice them rolling their eyes or any of their other physical cues, not at first. But once he did, he faced the music: he was socially awkward.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Instead of throwing in the towel and simply accepting his trait as his destiny, he did something about it. He looked at what was happening and decided he would change it, even though it would be uncomfortable and even painful.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Eventually he did become much better at social interactions, and even figured out how to be great at networking. And one of the keys to doing so was some advice he received from Guy Kawasaki on the topic of getting speaking gigs. In his early 20s Guy told Ramit he had to get great at something, and then people would be clamoring for him to speak.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Ramit took that advice to heart, even though it was difficult to hear, and applied it to every area of his life. He knew if he mastered something people would want to know him, whether as a speaker at their next event or simply to network with.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And that's advice he passes on today: get really good at something and doors will open up for you. While you're doing so, be sure to help those around you. The real key to networking isn't to try to connect with the Mark Cubans of the world, it's to connect with people a step above you, help them and continue doing so for the people 2 steps above you, then 3 steps, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Ramit offers a\u00a0real-life example of providing value for others when we talk about his Pitch Me Contest; he explains what was wrong with nearly ALL of the pitches he received, and why he chose the pitch that he did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">He also explains why so few people get raises, and how YOU can plus why you should adopt the seagull theory in your life. Even if you've heard him on countless other shows, you'll still get plenty of gold in this episode today.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS RAMIT SETHI!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Ramit\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramit\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Ramit\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ramit Sethi's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramit\" target=\"_blank\">Ramit\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/artofcharm\" target=\"_blank\">Zero to Launch</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramit\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/good-pitches-vs-bad-pitches-ramits-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">Good Pitches vs. Bad Pitches: Ramit's analysis</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramit\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/episode-172-ramit-sethi-iwillteachyoutoberich-com-dream-job/\" target=\"_blank\">Ramit on episode 172 of The AOC</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramit\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/ramit-sethi-will-teach-you-to-be-rich/\" target=\"_blank\">Ramit on episodes 90 and 91 of The AOC</a><br /><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps<br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Also sponsored by:<img alt=\"Full_Logo_HG-01\" class=\"frame alignnone wp-image-9219 size-medium\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Full_Logo_HG-01-300x112.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

How do we create connection through clarity and confidence?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Our guest for today's show has the answers to all of those questions! Michelle Lederman is an author, speaker, coach and self-professed recovering CPA who writes and speaks on the topics of clarity, confidence, connection and likability. Listen in for all of that and more\u00a0on episode 398 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Check Out HostGator!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Michelle Lederman wrote the book on likability, literally! Her 11 Laws of Likability is a guide based on 3 pillars of great relationships: clarity, confidence and connection. When these three pillars are in place you can build likability with the people you meet and interact with, forming solid foundations for lifelong connections.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And it starts with clarity. Michelle says you have to be clear on your intent. What do you want people to think of when they think about you? What impression do you want to leave your next date with or the people you interview with for your next job or promotion? Get clear on that first.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Then move on to confidence. Confidence is one of the most persuasive traits you can possess. But what comes first - the experiences to give you confidence or the feeling of confidence? Although it's a little like the chicken vs. the egg dilemma, Michelle says you can authentically fake it til you make it! While that sounds contradictory, it's\u00a0simply means to really find the authenticity in the acting as if part of the equation. So authentically act as if you are confident and eventually you will be.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The final piece of the puzzle is connection. Authenticity and likability are obviously important aspects of connection. Have you ever spoken with someone in a seemingly real way only to come away from the conversation realizing they had a mask on? That doesn't create a bond, and there's no foundation for a future relationship if the other person never lets you see the real them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">In other words, be authentic. If you aren't sure if you are authentic with others you'll have to spend some time reflecting on this. A great way to reevaluate a conversation or experience later is to ask yourself if you said or did anything just to make the other person happy or comfortable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">If you did, you were being inauthentic. Before beating yourself up about it simply take a look at why you were inauthentic. Were you concerned with looking good or were you caught up in your own discomfort? Find out why and then figure out what you can do next time to be real and be yourself. Then go out and do it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Another great way to be more authentic is to get uncomfortable! Michelle recommends doing so in baby steps and creating small wins for yourself. If you aren't a super social person the next time you go out make small talk with one person. Sure it will feel uncomfortable and maybe even awkward but you are stretching yourself and learning more about who you really are.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Michelle recommends doing a new, uncomfortable activity like this 10 times and reflecting on it after each experience. If you still hate doing it after 10 tries you can stop and try something else.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On this episode Michelle and I also discuss her 3 words exercise and how to apply it to your life for more likability, as well as how to maintain relationships once they're started.

Whether it's spending a week to learn to play drums for Foreigner live in concert or speaking Tagalong fluently during a Filipino interview, Tim has done it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's episode we talk about meta learning for language and other skills, what happened to his TV show, and his unique take on goals and risk. Listen in for all of that and more\u00a0on this bonus edition\u00a0of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Check Out Host Gator!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">If you've followed Tim Ferriss for any length of time you know he's man of experimentation and meta learning. In fact the title of his blog is Experiments in Lifestyle Design, completely appropriate for what he shares with the world.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's episode Tim and I talk about language hacks (and how they apply to other areas of life), the details of his current fasting regimen, the status of his TV show and his views on goal setting, risk and what he wishes every single adult would do at least once in their lifetime.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When it comes to goal setting Tim uses an approach he calls fear setting. He does this at least every 8 weeks, and any time he feels overwhelmed or anxious about a decision he has to make. And his process, of course, is quite simple.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">First he takes a physical piece of paper, lays it down landscape style and then he creates three columns. In the column on the far left he makes a list of every possible thing that could go wrong if he does whatever he's considering doing. He is very specific and writes down every single thing he can think of.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">In the middle column he writes down everything he can do to mitigate the items in the far left column. And then in the last column he makes a list of everything he can do to get back to where he is right now, if all the breakdowns from the far left column actually happen.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">With that information\u00a0he makes an informed and calculated decision that minimizes his risk, because as he puts it, risk is \"an irreversible negative outcome\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Continuing from there we also discuss two of his favorite skills he's learned: swimming and speed reading. He once thought learning to swim was an impossible thing for him because he was into his 30s before he tried it. Once he had conquered the skill, he began to ask himself \"What else once have I assumed is\u00a0impossible?\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The other skill we discuss is speed reading. Tim also gives us a tip to double our reading speed and increase comprehension at the same time. As you might expect it's a super simple trick that you can do as soon as you listen.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Tune in for that and then join me in thanking Tim\u00a0for sharing his masterful meta learning techniques on\u00a0today's episode.

On this episode we talk about why is \"late start\" and lack of business knowledge was actually an asset in starting his company, The $100 MBA. Listen in for all of that and more\u00a0on this bonus edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Check Out HostGator!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Omar Zenhom is a teacher through and through. He worked\u00a0in the education field as an ESL teacher (English as a Second Language) and he spent 10 years living and teaching ESL in Dubai.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But throughout his teaching career he was always interested in entrepreneurship. If he wasn't reading about it, he was hustling on the side to see what business would work and testing his mettle to see if he had what it takes to be a full-time entrepreneur.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">It wasn't until fairly recently that he made the leap into entrepreneurship with The $100 MBA company. The brand began back in 2013 and his podcast was launched in the fall of 2014. Today it stands as one of the top-rated podcasts in all of iTunes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On this episode we talk about his \"late entry\" into podcasting, how his lack of business experience became an asset and why it's never too late to go after what you want in business or in life in general.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When Omar began his podcast he knew he had to differentiate himself from the rest of the crowd. But\u00a0instead of reinventing himself he leaned on his background and his knowledge: teaching. He and his fiance Nicole spent two months brainstorming, planning and organizing before the launch of The $100 MBA.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">One of the most important he makes is they planned for the long haul. They weren't looking at this as a short-term gain but a long-term legacy and that's what\u00a0made them so successful.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Another important aspect of their success is their strategy for connecting and providing for their audience. If you're wondering what to give your audience Omar has some questions you can ask yourself such as \"How can I delight people?\" \"If this were my mom (or other loved one) how would I be giving to him or her?\" And then create your content and your marketing strategy based on that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">As Omar points out no one cares about what you know (or are\u00a0providing) until they know how much you care. When you come from that mindset - whether it's in business or other relationships - you have a greater chance of creating real, genuine relationships that benefit everyone.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">We also discuss how to set your own level of achievement and how to know what to focus on first when starting a business. Big thanks to Omar for sharing his experiences on those topics and thanks to you for being here. We'll see you next time on The Art of Charm!</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS OMAR ZENHOM!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Omar\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BizRepublic\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Omar\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://100mba.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The $100 MBA\u00a0web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://100mba.net/show/\" target=\"_blank\">The $100 MBA podcast</a><br /><a href=\"http://webinarninja.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Webinar Ninja</a>, Omar's program for webinars<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BizRepublic\" target=\"_blank\">Omar\u00a0on Twitter</a><br /><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps<br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Also sponsored by:<img alt=\"Full_Logo_HG-01\" class=\"frame alignnone wp-image-9219 size-medium\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Full_Logo_HG-01-300x112.png\" width=\"300\" /></a><br />You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

Listen in for all of that and more\u00a0on episode 395 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Check Out Host Gator!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Olivia Fox Cabane is known as an expert on behavioral science, and applying it to everyday life to become more productive, more effective and create more breakthroughs. Currently she is the Director of Innovation at Stanford's StartX program and has two additional books about to be published.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's show we discuss why breakthroughs are not accidental, what we've learned about the neuroscience behind epiphanies as well as ways you can realize\u00a0more of your mind's insights and genius ideas.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">One of the most fascinating topics we dive is\u00a0the different modes of the brain. The default mode network is your brain's\u00a0<span>network composed of 10-13 different areas that are responsible for the creative, innovation and genius.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span>Another mode your brain has is executive mode. Executive mode is just what it sounds like: that part of your brain that makes decisions, executes and puts plans into actions.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But here's the kicker: only one part of your brain can be in charge at a time. So if your executive mode is always on your default mode network (or DMN) cannot be running the show. That means if you are constantly engaging your decision-making mind and are in executive mode, your genius ideas have no way\u00a0to come through.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Turning off executive mode is simple: do repetitive tasks that are basically mindless. Like showering or washing the dishes or driving: these are things you already do the executive mode of your brain doesn't need to be engaged in for you to complete them. And that means your DMN can kick in.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You can do what high caliber professional athletes do and create little rituals to tell your brain it's time to ramp up or ramp down. Think of baseball players and their rituals: some brush off their shoes in the batter's box and then tap home plate between pitches. They are telling their brains to power on into high performance mode, and slow down.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On this episode Olivia and I also discuss the roles uncertainty and shame play in our creative capacities, what we can do to overcome our innate fear of both and why choice minimal lifestyle can be so liberating and freeing for our DMN!\u00a0You'll want to give this one your full attention, enjoy.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS OLIVIA FOX CABANE!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Olivia know by clicking on the link below and sending her a quick shout out on Facebook:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Olivia-Fox-Cabane-Book/422505611098117\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Olivia\u00a0on Facebook!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://foxcabane.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Olivia Fox Cabane's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://foxcabane.com/book/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Charisma Myth</em></a>, by\u00a0Olivia Fox Cabane<br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Olivia-Fox-Cabane-Book/422505611098117\" target=\"_blank\">Olivia\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook</a><br /><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps<br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (Free) and Support Our Supporters!</a><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://hostgator.com/promo/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Also sponsored by:<img alt=\"Full_Logo_HG-01\" class=\"frame alignnone wp-image-9219 size-medium\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://theartofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Full_Logo_HG-01-300x112.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

No, life handed her one of the most stressful and heart-wrenching experiences possible: her young, fit and seemingly healthy husband died. He was 31 and had just been given a clean bill of health by his doctor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Needless to say Kristen's life went into a tailspin. She was being forced to raise their 10-month old baby by herself, in addition to her very stressful corporate job.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Now facing single motherhood, Kristen was adding stress on top of stress. Her corporate job, which she had always loved, soon became a source of frustration rather than the solid rock it had always been for her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">With time she realized she had control of\u00a0what was going to happen next. And she knew she could either be swallowed up widowhood or she could face life head on. She chose the latter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Today she shares how handling stress of any kind or magnitude impacts us in every way, and how we live our lives during non-stressful crisis times also impacts our capacity to cope with stress. We also discuss the five elements of the happy hour effect, the two traps we routinely fall into and what GOALSS stands for.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The five elements of the happy hour effect are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span><strong>People:</strong>\u00a0surround yourself with the right people who will lift you higher, not people who will bring you down.<br /></span><span><strong>Presence:\u00a0</strong>check in with yourself and examine how you are engaging in your own life right now. What is your mood, what are your behaviors and are they helping the situation or environment?<br /></span><span><strong>Passion:\u00a0</strong>Routines are good to\u00a0help us avoid stress but we also need to stretch ourselves and build in passion.<br /></span><span><strong>Productivity:\u00a0</strong>This is about\u00a0making progress on the right goals for the right reasons so you impact others' lives.<br /></span><span><strong>Peace:\u00a0</strong>You know stress is inevitable, but you also know you control the times in between the stressful events. This is also about how to you create the right routines and processes to make you feel in control, even when life gets hard.</span><span><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Another aspect of the happy hour effect we discuss is the\u00a0acronym goalss. Kristen\u00a0created this acronym to help people create goals they set and actually achieved, not lofty goals way beyond their current lives. Goalss stands for:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span><strong>G for gut check.</strong>\u00a0Does it feel right in your gut? If it does, go for it.

Steve Rambam has been a PI for nearly 30 years, is the head of Pallorium, an agency of licensed investigators and has his own TV show called\u00a0<em>Nowhere to Hide</em>. We talk about all of that\u00a0and more on episode 391 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://lynda.com/artofcharm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show at our sponsor Lynda.com!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Thirty years ago Steve got a call from a\u00a0friend called. His friend promised\u00a0Steve\u00a0free beer if he'd to come to Texas and help catch some thieves who were stealing farming equipment. Steve agreed and shortly after found himself the proud bearer of a Texas state private investigator and security company license.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Today\u00a0Steve holds licenses in several states, as well as permits to work in other countries. He's the head of Pallorium and the man behind the TV show, Nowhere to Hide.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Today we talk about some of his most interesting investigations, the two types of people who get taken in by a con artist and a few simple ways he recommends to protect yourself and avoid being taken advantage of.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">There are two types of victims who fall prey to a fraudster and his tricks: either the innocent ones or the ones with a bit of hustler in them themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The innocent people are the ones who fall for the affinity fraud: these are the people who give money to their pastor for a new church, only to find out the new church is really his new vacation home. Or the people who give to someone in their close-knit community. They assume the person can be trusted because he is part of their community.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The hustlers who get taken in fraud cases are the people who think they're getting in on some kind of secret. They're being given inside info that no one else is privy to and love that fact.\u00a0You often see CEOs or high-level execs, and other movers and shakers get taken in by these schemes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">If you want to avoid being conned there are a few simple things to remember: no fraud can survive true due diligence. If you really do your homework you'll eventually spot a fraud.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And if you hire someone either to help you investigate an opportunity or pursue a fraudster, make sure you do your homework on that person.

He knew his life would reflect the 5 people he spent the most time with so he wanted to be connected to the wealthy and accomplished.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's show we talk about his copywriting background, how those same skills can be applied to other areas of life and exactly how to crash a party the right way and the wrong way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When it comes to crashing a party there is definitely a right way to do it. There are some more obvious\u00a0basics like actually finding the party and wearing a tuxedo, and some not as obvious \u00a0tips like wearing a lanyard and wristband under your clothes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Nev has crashed some high end events like a\u00a0private function hosted by Elton John and the World Congress of Information Technology, where he sat next to Michael Dell and chatted with him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">He says the key to crashing events is both how you look, how you act and what you do once you're inside. If you look the part, and act the part you can get into most places fairly easily. Unless you're trying to get into a club, the security person's job isn't to keep you out but to help you. Use that to your advantage: dress up, and walk through the entrance like you belong!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">So once you're inside, start mingling. Walk up to the bar and start a conversation with someone nearby. No one is going to give you a second glance if you're dressed up and chatting away with the other attendees. But if you're skulking in a corner by yourself you'll certainly draw attention.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Nev goes into greater detail on all of this so you can become an expert party crasher and networker. Even if you aren't interested in crashing parties, Nev shares how to use these strategies for getting a discount on anything from rent to coffee!

But that appearance misleads many folks; Scott is a famous author, keynote speaker and entrepreneur who made his biggest splash with his Unmarketing brand.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Today we talk about what that term unmarketing means, the commotion it stirred up (and continues to stir up), why he welcomes thoughtful debates and ignores trolls, and how important it is to create connections and build networks in every area of your life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Unmarketing simply means to stop marketing, start connecting and engaging. It's the idea that we become experts, position ourselves as such in front of our target markets so they chose us when the time comes. It is NOT the traditional means of marketing: splashing your goods and services in front of anyone with no regard for whether or not they're part of your target market.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Unmarketing doesn't just apply to entrepreneurs and business owners though, it applies to all of us. Scott says we are all marketing and creating our own branding whether we know it or not. All of us are never\u00a0<strong>not</strong>\u00a0under review in any area of our lives from work to our relationships.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Keeping with that idea he's been able to separate the critics from the trolls, and his advice applies for all of us. First and foremost he believes legit criticism is needed, and you'll know it's legit because it's not personal. The minute it becomes personal don't engage. Second, our job is never to convince others not to hate you; doing so simply drains your energy and your strength, don't waste your time on those people.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">He also gives a great example of how he dug his well before he was thirsty, and shares how that ties into unmarketing. We talk about the myths of social media, and much more!\u00a0Thanks to Scott for sharing his wisdom and\u00a0special thanks to you for being here! We'll see you next time on The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS SCOTT STRATTEN!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Scott\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/unmarketing\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Scott\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://www.unmarketing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Stratten's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.unmarketing.com/unpodcast/\" target=\"_blank\">Unpodcast</a>, Scott's podcast<a href=\"http://www.unmarketing.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118176286?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393185&amp;creativeASIN=1118176286&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=wwwworkyourli-20&amp;ref_=dp_ob_title_bk\" target=\"_blank\">Unmarketing</a></em>, Scott Stratten's book<br /><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/unmarketing\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Stratten\u00a0on\u00a0Twitter</a><br /><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

Gretchen Rubin is the three-time best-selling author who has made a study of happiness and habits.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">We talk about her books, including her book\u00a0<em>Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Everyday Life</em>, and the finer points of habit-formation and happiness \u00a0on episode 387 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><em><strong><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Get 10% Off Onnit!</a></strong></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Invariably Gretchen Rubin finds herself discussing habits with the people she meets, it's one of her favorite subjects. On today's episode you'll hear simple and effective habits to\u00a0help you\u00a0create a calmer, more orderly home. You'll also hear the strategy of the treat and loopholes we sometimes use to justify breaking a good habit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">A simple and effective way to create a calmer, more orderly home is to use the one-minute rule: if it takes a minute or less, do it right away! When you get home, put your jacket away instead of dropping it wherever it lands. Your home will feel orderly and so will your mind.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When it comes to forming everyday habits one effective strategy she recommends is the strategy of the treat. Choose a treat that's good for you and healthy and adds to your life, like buying new music every week if you're a music lover or lighting candles in your home.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The treat needs to be something you do for yourself consistently, think of it as a way to refortify and take care of yourself rather than a reward you have to obtain. If you are taking care of yourself and staying restored you will be more likely to maintain other healthy habits because good treats bolster your will power and self-discipline.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Gretchen also highlights a few of the loopholes we use to get out of \"being good\", these are rationalizations we make in the moment to break a healthy habit. There are over twenty she talks about in her book,\u00a0<em>Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Life</em>, but one we discuss today\u00a0is the self-actualization loophole.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">This is where the rationalization that it's ok to have this piece of cake because we need to enjoy life or we tell ourselves \"you only live once\". If you're using that train of the thought ask yourself how you'll feel about your decision later: will you feel good or will you not even remember that piece of cake? If you'll feel good and it will create a positive memory for you, then go for it. If it won't, then don't do it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">We also talk about how to frame your treats, why we can't always create habits (even the fun ones!) and the power of accountability in creating last change. Thanks to Gretchen for sharing her wisdom and\u00a0special thanks to you for being here!

By the age of 32 he was working in factory and was in a deep depression. He knew he was meant for more but every time he tried to rise up his fears got the best of him and he could not overcome them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Deciding it was time to do something about that, Geoff made a list of everything he was afraid of from smallest to greatest fear. And then he systematically confronted each one. On today's episode he talks about what some of these experiences were like including why physical violence was at the top of the list and how he overcame the naysayers who surrounded him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When Geoff was only 11 years old he was sexually abused by a teacher in his community, someone he admired and respected greatly. When no one helped him deal with the experience, not his church and not his parents, he internalized the abandonment he felt and allowed the experience to \"possess\" him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The abuse he received\u00a0became the reason he built himself into a fighting machine. He took away anything about himself that could be construed as attractive and made it ugly; he believed the world could not be trusted and everything around him soon reinforced that belief. Eventually Geoff saw he had to let go of all of the story he had created in order to build a new life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And letting go of it happened as a result of writing it down. His autobiography, Watch My Back, tells of his childhood including the abuse, his early adult years and how he shifted from a working class bloke in a bad neighborhood, in a bad marriage to a fulfilled, evolved and transformed, award-winning writer.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">We cover so much on this show but one of the main stories to listen to is how Geoff received his BAFTA. One of the principles he's learned and now teaches others is to give without conditions. What you give to the world will come back to you, often not from the same place you give it but it does come back. The story of how he wrote the film that later won a BAFTA is a perfect example of this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You'll also want to hear Geoff's perspective on dealing with negative people in your life. After he published his first book his friends and loved ones were calling him pretentious and telling him not to get above himself. How he rebuilt his life and let go of naysayers\u00a0is a powerful lesson and Geoff's wisdom will resonate with you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Thanks to Geoff for speaking so candidly and with such grace on today's show.

We delve into\u00a0a few other subjects too on episode 385 of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Click Here to Support The Show and Get 10% Off Onnit!</em></a></span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">(Direct\u00a0Download)</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">More About This Show:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Over 6.5 years ago Chris founded Actionable Books, a web site with free summaries of books in the business, personal development and growth industries. Every month they publish 20 summaries of books and give that information away to the public, at no cost.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Chris explains how he's created this as a business model and made a healthy living, as well as the role curiosity plays in success. He believes there is an ROI on curiosity and it should be explored while being coupled with drive and focus. When we explore unrelated areas of life, we often find breakthroughs and new insights we would never have found otherwise.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">But if we're always curious how do we balance that with enjoying where we're at in life and still maintain our drive to move forward? This is a fascinating question Chris sheds light on. There are three types of choices in life: unconscious, conscious and deliberate.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The first, unconscious choice, is the type of choice we make that we don't even realize is a choice. We sign up for college because that's just what we do after finishing high school. Or we work 80 hours at our job because that's the way it's done. We don't think or explore another way of doing something, it's doesn't even occur to us that it is a choice that can be done in another way.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The second is conscious choice. This is the type of choice where we do something because it's what is expected of us by society. We choose to work more hours because we want a certain type of car or we need to buy a house in a certain neighborhood; it's what we're expected to do so we make choices to make it happen.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The third and final type of choice is deliberate choice. This is the topic of his book\u00a0<em>Beyond the Picket Fence</em>\u00a0and it's the type of choice we make based on our values and what's important to us in our lives. With these choices we are in tune with our values and how we want to live, how we want to spend our days. These choices are where we can balance enjoyment, contentedness with ambition and drive. With the deliberate choice we connect with what matters to us and chose from that space.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Chris and I also talk about how to lean in and make a conversation great, how to find that special something in every person we talk to and how to ask for what you want in such a way that you get what you want, they get what they want AND they get something they didn't even know they wanted.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Special thanks to Chris for making the deliberate choice to be here\u00a0and thanks to you as well!

Over the last few years he worked as a freelance\u00a0graphic designer and spent his days creating visual graphics for others. In his free time he perfected his photography skills, all the while keeping his eye on the prize of making a living with his art.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">On today's show he talks about how to find your passionate why, how to translate that into a vision of a business and some of the most valuable lessons he's learned on his rise to the top.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Nick and I cover several subjects but two we'll highlight here are the importance of your inner circle (the people you spend the most time with) and raising\u00a0your inner game.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Who you hang out with, your inner circle, is one of the most influential factors in where you will go in life. If you have the right people in your life, people who are where you want to be, you will stay on track no matter what it takes. Surround yourself with people who inspire you and people you can add value to and inspire as well.\u00a0Nick reiterates this on the show because it was an important factor for him.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">He also touches on the topic of raising your inner game or emotional IQ. In the 5-6 years it took him to build his business Nick found that he had a lot of self-criticism and self-doubt he had to face. And it was only by becoming aware of his own thoughts that he could do so.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Everyone, Nick included, who has been successful has had these same thoughts and limiting beliefs, they've simply faced them and pushed through them.

He knew he had been passionate and dedicated to his service for those previous years, but he wasn't feeling the same way about the next 7.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Sam had always turned to digital content and web sites throughout his career so it made sense to go into that arena as a civilian.\u00a0As the head of Prism Communications today he is on a mission to help experts with powerful messages get those messages out into the world. His key to success is using the networking and negotiating skills that served him so well throughout his military career and brings them into the business world.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Today we talk about the tactics and strategies of negotiating and networking as he's learned them, whether in a hostile environment or simply a business deal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">One of the most important skills he says is to always be networking. It's something we discuss at length here at The AOC and Sam reiterates this belief. People skills and soft skills helped him fight insurgencies in Iraq and they'll help you whether you're asking for a raise, negotiating a buyout or building a network to advance your career.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">A\u00a0powerful perspective Sam recommends is to put yourself in the other person's shoes. When you're talking to them be sure they know you understand their position and where they are coming from. By doing so you're showing empathy and respect which will go a long way towards creating a solution.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">He also says it helps to keep things in perspective. In your negotiations no one is going to die, most likely you're just talking about money. In the grand scheme of things it isn't that big of a deal since no one's life is on the line. So keep that in mind. Remember you have options and you have other resources, these two things combined are one of the most potent combinations you can have in your corner when negotiating.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">And you'll have options and resources because you've continued to build your network. Spend the money to meet people face to face, it's completely worth it. Sam has done this in his business and he knows people value the relationship they have with him because they've met in person. In fact, his team's productivity doubles every time he meets with them!</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">In today's digital age face to face has become a novelty so set yourself apart from everyone else and break bread with people, it'll go a long way towards creating lasting, powerful relationships and partnerships in your professional career.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Sam also shares some tips on taking your emotions out of the negotiation and some fascinating\u00a0stories from his negotiations with insurgents.

And if you're in a relationship how often should you be doing it, how often is healthy? These are just a few of the questions we answer on today's show.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Joining us is sex and relationship expert and the best-selling author of several\u00a0books including<em>\u00a0She Comes First</em>, Ian Kerner. We talk about all of that and more\u00a0on\u00a0episode 382 of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">More About This Show:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Sex is a crucial aspect of a romantic relationship, yet it's one of those areas most couples (and singles) don't have the vocabulary to talk about. Ian Kerner is a man on a mission to change that and he's written several New York Times best-selling books to do so, as well as work with clients in his private practice as a licensed marriage and family therapist.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">One of the first things we discuss today is the fact that male and female sexuality are\u00a0different, despite the fact that our culture treats them the same.\u00a0A guy typically only needs one sexual cue to get turned on. However a woman often needs multiple cues\u00a0and her arousal is much more context-oriented.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">What that means is a woman often needs a safe, comfortable and secure environment without distractions in order to be fully ready for sex and orgasms. In fact, functional MRI scans have shown that certain parts of a woman's brain actually dim during arousal, the parts associated with stress, anxiety and high emotion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">So\u00a0arousal cues different, but do men really think about sex more than women? Not as much as you might believe. Studies of college students have shown that men only think about sex 17-20 times a day while women think about it around 10 times a day. So yes men think about it more, but\u00a0not that much more.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">And once you're in a sexually active relationship, how often should you be doing it? Ian recommends at least once a week to keep the connection there and to keep that sexual chemistry in the air.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">He also recommends using his sex pyramid to keep a good balance of familiarity and novelty to keep your sexual life healthy. The sex pyramid is grouped into multiple types of sex from romantic love-making to fantasy sex to sensual sex.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Ian gives us the full details of how to blend those sex groups on today's show! We also talk about how to use porn in a healthy way, how to deal with\u00a0premature ejaculation and much more. Listen in\u00a0and enjoy!

His parents always placed a strong emphasis on education and he went to one of the best public schools available.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">He played basketball while in school and saw the distinct economic gap that existed. Some of his teammates lived in the worst neighborhoods while others lived in large mansions. He was fascinated by this and asked the parents who lived in the mansions what they did for work. The resounding answer: Wall Street.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">By 13 he was obsessed with getting a job on Wall Street and opened his own trading account. At 16 he spent a summer interning at a hedgefund and at 20 he was exactly where he wanted to be: he was playing collegiate basketball for Brown University, studying economics and on his way to his dream career on Wall Street.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">All of that changed when\u00a0he did a program called \"Semester at Sea\". It's a collegiate program in which students and faculty spend a semester on a cruise ship traveling and exploring 10 different countries. Students and professors and administrators come from over 200 different schools to participate and Adam was one of them.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Their first stop was South Korea, but on their way they were caught in a superstorm. Their ship was hit by a rogue 60-foot wave that knocked out their power and navigation system. When the announcement came to get to their muster stations everyone, including the adults on board, believed they were going to die.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">After a few minutes though, Adam knew he was meant to do more than simply die at sea at the age of 21. A feeling of calm came over him, and soon everyone onboard was safe. They continued their semester at sea and Adam enjoyed the backpacking and exploring of each country.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">As a project during his travels he asked a child in every country what their dream was. In India one child's answer floored him. The child simply wanted a pencil. When Adam handed him his own pencil the child lit up.\u00a0That experience\u00a0was the origin of\u00a0Pencils of Promise.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">On today's episode we talk about the steps he took to building his non-profit after that experience, why it's been so wildly successful (people like Lewis Howes and Gary Vaynerchuk sit on the board) and how he wrote\u00a0<em>The Promise of a Pencil</em>.\u00a0He also shares how stepping away as the CEO of PoP actually helped the organization to grow and thrive, and he explains how you can apply his same lessons learned to your business.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">It was a pleasure to have Adam here and to find out the fascinating story\u00a0behind Pencils of Promise. Listen in, enjoy and then join me in thanking Adam for being here with us. We'll see you next time on The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">THANKS ADAM BRAUN!</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Adam\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBraun\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Adam\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Resources from this episode:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://pencilsofpromise.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pencils of Promise\u00a0web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://adambraun.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Braun's personal web site</a><a href=\"http://pencilsofpromise.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://adambraun.com/book/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Promise of a Pencil</em></a>, by\u00a0Adam Braun</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"Mailto:adam@ipromise.org\" target=\"_blank\">Email Adam here to\u00a0raise money for PoP</a></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PencilsOfPromis\" target=\"_blank\">Pencils of Promise\u00a0on\u00a0Twitter</a></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">You'll also like:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Wanna leave a comment?

Join us as we chat about this and more on\u00a0episode 380 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Get 10% Off Onnit!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Tim Larkin has spent 20 years educating others and understanding the role violence plays in various cultures. He has witnessed violence crossing all demographics and acknowledges anyone can be on the receiving end.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But what can set us apart and help us to survive the unthinkable is to use violence as a tool. In fact his company motto is<span>\u00a0violence is really the answer...but when it's the answer it's the only answer. And what he means by this is not to indiscriminately use violence in any scenario but to know that you will know when violence is necessary and to use it accordingly.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Violence is a tool and a tool we have used to survive since humans first walked the planet. We used it to fend off attacks from animals and to protect ourselves, and we did it very well because we're still here today.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Tim goes on to say criminals will use violence as a tool to get what they want, and we have to do the same to protect ourselves just like our ancestors did. With his trainings and in his book Survive The Unthinkable he makes certain we understand what scenarios we don't have to respond to with violence, and he also explains how to survive when we do have to have use violence. In essence he helps us think like violent offenders without becoming one.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The best tactics, the best information we can find is going to come from the worst part of the society: the violent offenders. These people see violence as a currency, a way to get results. What's incredibly fascinating is how most of us see violent attacks as good or bad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">For example, if a woman is attacked and defends herself by stabbing her attacker in the neck we applaud her and press no charges against her in court: she was after all just defending herself. Now if we reverse the situation and the attacker goes after the same woman and stabs her and kills her, we want him thrown in jail for life (at minimum, perhaps even seeking the death penalty if that's an option).</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Tim encourages us to look at the situation differently: what was successful in this attack and how can you use that knowledge? Odds are high that if the woman was able to stab and kill her attacker, she struck first. And vice versa.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">He gives several more examples like this one on this show. We also talk about why MMA and UFC fight moves won't help you, a simple approach to communicating that disarms and diffuses most aggressors\u00a0and much more.

Today anyone with Internet access\u00a0can download an app or software program to hack into your phone or your laptop and do any number of dubious things.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Marc Goodman spells out many of those dubious activities and what we can do to guard against them on today's show. As a former member of the LAPD, Marc has witnessed firsthand how far behind law enforcement is in this area. He says local and state level agencies are swamped with non-tech crimes to solve and they're also hampered by budgetary restrictions.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">While they are doing their best to keep pace with technology's ever-changing landscape, cyber crime continues to grow. Over the next several years even more of our day-to-day lives will be online from our clothes to our televisions to our cars. It may not sound like much until you consider our energy grids are online, our traffic systems are online, our airplane management systems are online. Soon every aspect of our lives will be accessible via the Internet.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">And we don't have the security to fully protect that information. Do you remember the breach at Target that happened during the 2013 Christmas holiday? It all stemmed from a third-party vendor who had been authorized to manage Target's HVAC systems. Millions of credit cards were breached through an air conditioning system, Marc explains how this happened in greater detail during this show.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">But it isn't all doom and gloom! Marc believes the Internet advancements will also lift 2 million people out of poverty, help us feed the world and provide clean water for everyone as well as education. So long as we harness these advancements responsibly and learn to protect ourselves.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">He gives specifics on what we can do on a global scale as well as an individual scale. For ourselves we can implement what he calls UPDATE:</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>U</strong>\u00a0- update frequently.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>P</strong>\u00a0- passwords. Use a different password for every site and get a reliable password manager (see the resources for suggestions).</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>D</strong>\u00a0- downloads. Watch your downloads and be cautious about what you install.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>A</strong>\u00a0- administrator. Don't run your computer using the administrator account.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>T</strong>\u00a0- turn off your computer. If it isn't fully turned off it's still accessible.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>E</strong>\u00a0- encrypt. There are 2 types: you can encrypt the data on your computer and encrypt the data as it is sent out using a VPN.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">There's much more Marc tells on this show.

Even some of the most accomplished people in the world don't have purpose.

We dive into those topics and more on episode 379 of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and Get 10% Off Onnit!</a></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">More About This Show:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Jairek Robbins is no stranger to accomplishments and never has been. In his early 20s he earned a Congressional award gold medal for his achievements as a youth.\u00a0Today in his coaching business he works with leaders to help them\u00a0find purpose and happiness.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">On this episode we talk about why the drive to accomplishment is often based in an unhealthy desire for approval or a need to heal pain felt early in life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">He shares stories of people who have had all the money and success anyone could dream of, but they were utterly miserable because they had no purpose. They thought money and success could win them the approval they desired, or heal that hurt from the past. And when it doesn't, they realize something is missing. Jairek helps them find that missing piece and add it to their lives.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">One of the exercises he suggests we all do is to find out if there's something missing in our lives is to check if our priorities are in alignment with how we spend our time. Jairek walks us through a step by step process to do this and how to get in alignment if we're not.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">We also talk at length about how to fall in love with hard work. He recounts a story of working as a logger in Canada for several months and the intensity of that experience. There are many valuable lessons he learned from that time including how to retrain our minds to enjoy difficulties.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">One specific thing he shares is to check your mindset. What is your brain telling you while you're working hard? Is it telling you that you deserve something more than what you've got? Or maybe it says you're smarter than everyone else so why should you have to do this type of work? Or perhaps your mind thinks you deserve more money, more respect, etc.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Whatever those thoughts are catch them and become aware of them. When you do that, you can lower your expectations of what you think you deserve from life and raise what you bring to the table. If you really are smarter, then outwork everyone else and prove it! If you deserve more money then prove it! Along the way figure out how to make it fun. Jairek gives some examples from his time as a logger and if he can apply it to logging you can certainly apply it to your life!</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Jairek gives tons of value on this episode, be sure to listen and soak it all up!

Our guest for today's episode, Chalene Johnson, says there is one key step no one else talks about. Her book\u00a0<em>Push</em>\u00a0is about that very subject: the missing yet crucial\u00a0step\u00a0to setting and achieve goals. We dive into that and more\u00a0on this episode of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show at our sponsor Lynda.com!</a></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">More About This Show:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Chalene Johnson is known by many for her success in the fitness world. Despite her humble beginnings in a poor neighborhood in Michigan, she has grown several multi-million dollar empires. She's a self-professed reformed workaholic who now shares the lessons she has learned through her podcast, her online academies and her book,\u00a0<em>Push</em>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">One of those lessons is how to set and achieve goals.\u00a0Far too often people are setting goals but never reaching them for one reason or another.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But Chalene has found the missing ingredient: it's called a push goal. A push goal, which is where the name of her book\u00a0<em>Push</em>\u00a0comes from, is that one goal you must achieve that will help you achieve all of your other goals.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On this episode she breaks down the five step process, including how to discover your push goal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>1. Set 10 goals.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Make these very specific. She recommends you set one goal in each of the following areas of your life: a get smart goal (something you want to learn), a pure joy goal (something that invigorates you and brings you joy), a goal for your romantic/love life, a goal related to family & friends, your spirituality, a goal for your environment (where you hang out like your office), a goal for your\u00a0purpose/profession, a financial goal, a fitness/nutrition goal, a mental wellness goal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>2. Set another goal: this is your push goal.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is your goal that makes a lot of those other 10 goals possible. This is your PUSH goal, it's the goal that pushes all the other ones into happening. Your push goal will have a domino effect on a majority of your other goals. Set your push goal and ignore the other 10!</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>3. Brain dump.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Get a No.\u00a02 pencil and a piece of paper, and write down every possibility to make your push goal happen. When you have all of that written down, make sure it's all on one piece of paper for your next step.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>4. Take a photo of that paper on your phone.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And\u00a0look at that photo every day, then pick 2 things to do every day from your brain dump list. Those 2 things are related to your push goal and should take you less than 10 min a day (generally).</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>5.\u00a0Set an automatic reminder.</strong></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Use your phone to create an app to remind you to decide which 2 things you're going to do today to reach your push goal.\u00a0A great way to do this is to use the If This Then That web site, it can help you set up automatic reminders that arrive as a text\u00a0to your phone.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is Chalene's 5-step process to setting and achieving goals, a system she has used herself time and time again with successful results!</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We also talk about confidence and why she's spending so much time on that one topic this year.

On today\u2019s show we talk about why fatherhood is so important to our understanding of what it means to be a man,\u00a0and what we all can do as men to help raise young men into healthy adulthood.\u00a0 All of that and more on this\u00a0edition\u00a0of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" style=\"color: #3e0711; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and get 10% off Onnit!</a></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"font-family: Montserrat, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; color: #333333;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">More About This Show:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Craig Wilkinson is the proud father of two, and fully admits to learning how to be a good dad along the way. The first moment he consciously took a look at his role as a father was after his young daughter had heart surgery. He requested to be in the operating room as she was given anesthesia and to be there when she awoke after surgery, his request was granted.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Not long after he overheard his daughter talking to someone about her surgery and she told them her heart had been broken but her dad fixed it. He was struck by the power and magnitude of her perception and her experience. He wondered if he could really live up to her words, and\u00a0then made a commitment to be that father to her and to his son.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Although it hasn\u2019t all been sunshine and roses, Craig has figured out a lot along the way and we dive into much of his discoveries on today\u2019s show. We discuss what three things really drive a man, the biggest lies we\u2019re told about what it means to be a man and he shares his dadverbs advice we can all take to heart.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">According to Craig the three things that drive a man are a battle to fight, an adventure to live and a beauty to pursue. But if a man isn\u2019t given validation growing up he will become passive and opt to seek these drives through video games, porn or shallow relationships, or he may become an overly-aggressive and dominant alpha male or he may simply pose and pretend to be someone he\u2019s not in order to impress others.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If men aren\u2019t given proper validation from an older male role model they will also grow up believing in the lies society tells us are true. The top lies told about how\u00a0masculinity is defined are:\u00a0how much power you have, how much money you have and how many women you sleep with.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">To help males grow into their healthy masculinity Craig suggests using what he calls \u201cdadverbs\u201d, or dad-related adverbs. We touch on a few in this episode including to see and to bliss. To see is when a male role model sees a younger man as separate from himself, having his own passions and interests that may or may not be in alignment with the role model\u2019s interests. The masculine role model provides this by being engaged, talking, and spending time with the younger man.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The other dadverb is to bliss, which is when older men validate\u00a0younger men for who they are, what they are passionate and curious about.

But on their YouTube channel for Simple Pickup they provide tons of entertaining and valuable content on the ever-popular topic of picking up girls.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">They have several hundred videos on their channel in which they attempt to chat up girls while doing wacky things from dressing up like Harry Potter to rollerskating while wearing a Speedo (and nothing else). While the videos are meant to provide laughs and good fun for everyone, they are also meant to show that regular guys they can pick up girls too.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">On today's episode we dive into their backgrounds and how their social anxiety played a key role in who they've become today as well as some useful techniques you can implement in your every day life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Both Jesse and Kong were not gregarious and outgoing guys by any stretch. They were painfully shy growing up and into early adulthood. In other words they understand where you may have been and where you might be right now. It's one of the reasons they make their videos silly and playful: to help you loosen up about the idea of chatting up women.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Doing so, making yourself laugh and lighten up before doing anything you perceive as \"high pressure\" like talking to a pretty girl, is one of their suggestions.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Whether you want to approach an attractive woman or you're going into an\u00a0interview for the job of your dreams, they suggest doing something you enjoy and have fun doing to take the pressure off. If you can make yourself laugh you'll help your mind see the \"high pressure\" situation as much less so.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Another suggestion they have on the topic of talking to women is to take baby steps. Start by talking to people in your every day life. Who do you see every day but don't chat with or haven't gotten to know?</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">For example if you have a regular barista you see in the morning ask that person what their favorite drink is and then try it.You'll be surprised by how good it feels to simply talk to strangers, and it'll help your game with the ladies too because you'll be much more versed in the art of creating connection.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">They give more advice and suggestions on today's show, but they want to be sure to leave you with their motto: Always be giving value, always be having fun!\u00a0Have a listen to hear all of that and more, then join me in thanking Simple Pickup\u00a0for being on the show today. And thanks to you for joining us.

His two businesses are at the top of their field, and it isn't by accident. Isaac has chosen growth over complacency, disruption over stagnation. On today's show he shares with us how he does this, the questions he asks himself and the people around him and how he juggles all of his priorities at work and at home.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">When it comes to choosing growth over staying the same, Isaac believes we can all do this by implementing productive thinking rather than reproductive thinking. Productive thinking is throwing off the existing constraints and reasons why something is the way it currently is.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Put those reasons and constraints aside, then\u00a0start questioning things. Ask yourself: \"Why is it the way it is? Why do we do it this way? Is there a better way?\"\u00a0Answering those questions will open up possibilities that didn't exist before.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Reproductive thinking, by comparison, is to simply make slight changes and improvements to stay ahead of the curve. Productive thinking changes the curve itself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If you really want to hone your reproductive thinking skill set, get clear on the quality of the questions you're asking yourself about the situation, about your leadership and about the fundamentals of your business. Isaac gives some great examples in today's show of how to do this and how he has done this.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Even if we ask those questions and are committed to productive, revolutionary thinking, we can still make poor decisions. According to Isaac we can avoid this by creating an open dialogue with those around us. We have to be willing to ask for feedback, be open to receiving it and implementing it. All of this will help others speak up if they see us going down a bad path.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Isaac specifically does this in his own life by finishing his work conversations with the question: how can I be a better leader? He also asks his wife how he can be a better husband. And when they answer him, he takes stock of what they said and then he finds ways to act on their suggestions. Doing so shows them they are valued by him, and in return their respect for him is increased.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Although Isaac and I talk about much more on this show including how he stays focused and manages all of his priorities at work and at home, how he choses what to say no to and what to say yes to and, a big one, how to respond to naysayers including specific questions to ask yourself when they criticize your actions.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">You'll definitely want to hear all of that! After you do, join me in thanking Isaac for being on the show and thank you for joining us. We'll see you next time.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">THANKS ISAAC TOLPIN!</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Isaac\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/isaactolpin\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Isaac\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Resources from this episode:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://isaactolpin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Isaac Tolpin's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://choosegrowth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chose Growth's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://throwingboulders.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Throwing Boulders' web site</a></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/isaactolpin\" target=\"_blank\">Isaac Tolpin\u00a0on Twitter</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bengreenfield\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">You'll also like:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Wanna leave a comment?

Then he needed pills to treat the side effects of those pills, and the side effects of the side effect treatment medicines.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">All of which took its toll on his health. By the time he was 16 his liver failed and he had two options: get a transplant or hope his liver detoxed in enough time to save his life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">His mom took him home, told him how he could detox and initially he resisted. But he turned to prayer and made a deal with God: if he did the detoxification, got off all the pills and God got him through it, Wesley would give to him in return.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">And it worked: Wesley detoxed, stopped his meds, lived through several days of nightmarish drug withdrawals and came out the other side with more clarity than he had ever had.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">With that clarity he finally understood he was allowing his abusers, some of\u00a0whom weren't even in his life any longer, to run the show. He took responsibility, stopped being a victim and decided he wanted to be his own hero.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">With that honesty, the first of what he now calls his H cubed tool, he could heal his old wounds properly and fully. He understood he couldn't control what happened to him, but he could control how he responded to it. And when he grasped that concept fully he found hope, the last of his H cubed strategy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Wesley is taking his own personal lesson and helping others get honest, heal, and have hope. Though his primary demographic is youth, his programs at\u00a0<em>A Human Project</em>\u00a0also apply to adults.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">He has found immense power in being vulnerable with\u00a0<em>AHP</em>\u00a0and audiences in general; he learned how to let go of shame by sharing his story and being transparent in his experiences. He no longer hides what happened to him, and is an open book because he understands how doing so allows other people to work through their own shame, fears, and challenges.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Wesley goes into even more detail on this episode, including what it was like when he finally met his biological father and why he does what he does. Please listen and join me in thanking Wesley for his candor, honesty and immense heart.\u00a0\u00a0As always, thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">THANKS WESLEY CHAPMAN!</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Wesley\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesleydchapman\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Wesley\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Resources from this episode:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://wesleydchapman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wesley Chapman's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.ahumanproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A Human Project's web site</a></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesleydchapman\" target=\"_blank\">Wesley Chapman\u00a0on Twitter</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bengreenfield\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://bootcamps.theartofcharm.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm bootcamps</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">You'll also like:</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Wanna leave a comment?

That was the case for our guest on today's episode. Christine Hassler was earning six-figures as Hollywood's youngest female agent who walked away from it all.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Today we talk about why she left, how she got the idea for her book\u00a0<em>Expectation Hangover</em>\u00a0and specific strategies we can use to change our beliefs and ultimately, our lives. All of that\u00a0and much more on this edition\u00a0of The Art of Charm.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and get 10% off Onnit!</a></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">More About This Show:</span></h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Christine's drive for success began, she jokes, in the 4th grade when she was bullied and picked on by classmates. She decided then she was going to be somebody one day and would show them!</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">And she did. She became the youngest female agent in Hollywood, by 25 she was making six figures a year, working in a posh Beverly Hills office, had her own assistant and was dating the head of a movie studio and going to The Oscars, Sundance and other red carpet Hollywood-type events. She was living a glamorous life that should've made her happy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">But despite all of it\u00a0she felt miserable inside. And the more miserable she felt, the more she pushed herself to achieve. She thought what so many of us thought: \"When I get X, then I'll be happy.\" But every time she got X, she was even more unhappy and nothing seemed to change that.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">So she did the only thing she knew how to do: she quit her job and walked away from her successful career. She floundered for the next year, accumulating debt, becoming estranged from her family, being diagnosed with an immune disorder and being left by her fiancee six months before the wedding.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">She hit rock bottom. She was on her bathroom floor pondering whether or not her life was worth living, if she should even be on Earth any more. As she searched within herself, something told her her life was valuable and had purpose. She was filled with a sense of peace and happiness.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Those feelings\u00a0were enough for her to make a deal; she wasn't religious but she told whatever Higher Power might be out there that she would dedicate her life to helping others.\u00a0Christine didn't know what that would look like exactly, but a few days later after the bathroom incident, she got the idea for her first book and that set her on a new, equally successful path.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">On today's show we discuss several topics including what an expectation hangover is, what coping methods we can use that actually work when we're curing our hangover, and how to use release writing to let go of any emotions that don't serve us.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">According to Christine an expectation hangover is when we have an idea of how we want life to be and we set our plans, our goals to achieve that idea, but life\u00a0gives us something else. Then we turn to coping mechanisms to help us cure that expectation hangover, and very often these coping methods aren't healthy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Christine shares some healthier ways to deal like asking: \"What am I learning from this?\" instead of what we usually say which is \"Why me?\". We can also remember control is just an illusion, and none of us have it! We have free will, influence and choice but we all receive curveballs from life that are out of our control.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">We can also create better relationships with ourselves and be clear on our expectations of others. Instead of thinking people in our lives can read our minds we can actually create agreements in which all parties are clear.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">She\u00a0also goes into detail on how we can recognize our patterns, giving us practical steps to take and she\u00a0shares the actionable tool of release writing, which allows us to go deep into an emotion and release it in a healthy, positive way so we can create something new where that emotion or belief had been in our minds.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">There's even more where that wisdom came from so\u00a0tune in to hear all of it straight from Christine! Then join me in thanking her\u00a0for being here\u00a0and as always, thank you for joining us.

Before you fall into the trap of thinking all Millennials are self-focused and entitled take note of what Brad has to say on the matter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">For over 35 years Brad has been an entrepreneur. He was part of the first dot-com company to go public on NASDAQ. He has seen and successfully\u00a0navigated the behavioral and technological disruptions and changes that have happened during his entrepreneurial career.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">In fact today he runs a company that helps other companies create bridges among their generation-gap workers. He finds ways to help people connect with each other and work well together, no matter what generation they're from.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When looking at the Millennial generation Brad cites the 3 reasons they seem to have developed and now act so markedly different from previous age groups. Those three reasons are:</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>1. Science fiction became mainstream.</strong>\u00a0Sound crazy? Not really if you think of it like this: Star Wars was the top movie of 1977. Before that, no other film from the genre had quite that level of impact. Star Wars was the first really BIG American film to have a global influence. To add to that, it started a string of popular sci-fi films like Back to the Future, Terminator, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Why does that matter? Because in all of these films the hero is a young person using technology to save the day, not adults. So everyone born from 1977 on grew up seeing young people as heroes, heroes who embraced technology and used it to solve problems.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>2. Video games came home.</strong>\u00a0Again it may sound off-the-wall until you realize Nintendo game stations in the home weren't commonplace before the late 1970s. But kids who grew up playing video games learned how to multi-task, they learned to take risks and learn as they went. Video games are not about following the rules, they're about risking it all to get great rewards.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><strong>3. Child-centered parenting went mainstream.</strong>\u00a0Public schools started teaching child-centered learning, they believed our problems were caused by low self-esteem. Parents started doing the same and began raising their children as part of the household. Kids were no longer there simply to obey their parents, they were there to at least be mentored by, if not befriended by, their parents.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When you look at those three reasons it's easy to see why Millennials now walk into a corporate culture and call the boss by his or her first name, why they find the most efficient ways of doing anything and then implement them (typically before getting the boss' approval). You can see why Millennials seem to behave like entrepreneurs, even if they aren't running their own businesses.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's episode Brad addresses how Millennials can use their natural predisposition to bring value to any corporate culture, while still respecting the people they work with. He gives specific ways Baby Boomers and Gen Xers can better utilize Millennials in their workforce and how to understand their thought processes and actions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Brad shares plenty more on today's show, tune in to hear all of it!

You'll hear who Ben is and the simple ways he helps people\u00a0achieve their lifestyle goals, beyond the norm of healthy eating and exercise.\u00a0And one look at Ben and you'll know he practices what he preaches.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's show Ben and I talk about his biohacking tips and suggestions for how to burn fat during your day, without adding complex exercises or another two hours on to your gym routine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">His first tip is to add cooling garments to your regular wardrobe. Don't take one of those ice packs you bought at the pharmacy, they have chemicals in them that can burn your skin. Instead Ben recommends cold packs from Onnit. The link is below the notes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When you wear those during your day your body has to burn more calories to keep you warm and get back to your body's normal temperature of 98.6 degrees. Keep the cold packs on your body for 30-60 minutes a day. Be sure to do some kind of work that isn't too mentally taxing because you will shiver and you will be a bit distracted.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You can jack up your metabolism even more by strategically placing the cold packs on areas that have more brown adipose tissue (sometimes called brown fat). Your stomach (if you have some extra fat there) is a good example.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">A second suggestion he has is to do short bursts of exercise throughout your day, things like pull-ups, air squats, or kettle bells. If you have an office where you can shut the door you can do any of these things.

Danny is the man behind Firepole Marketing and the author of\u00a0<em>Engagement From Scratch</em>. We chat about all of that and much more\u00a0on episode 368 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and get 10% off Onnit!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">A common excuse for not networking is being an introvert. Danny dispels that myth, rather effectively on this show. First he explains what an introvert is, versus an extrovert. An introvert is someone who is drained by being around people. They aren't necessarily shy, they simply don't get energy from being with others.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">An extrovert, on the other hand, does become energized by being around people. They are the people who want to go to the after party after a great party is over. An introvert will be ready to go home.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Danny calls himself an introvert and has learned how to become a great networker regardless. He's learned networking is a skill set that anyone can develop no matter if they are introverted or extroverted. He has found through\u00a0practice and\u00a0discipline he can strong, healthy networks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And those are two things that creates a great networker: someone who practices and discipline. Perhaps extroverts are naturally better at networking, but an introvert can become great at it through discipline and practice. Often they will become better than extroverts because they have to work at it, and an extrovert may think they don't.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">One of the approaches to being \u00a0a great networker that Danny has learned is to focus on the person in front of you. It may sound cliche but he likens it to building a very large crane. Take the small crane (the person in front of you) and leverage it to build a larger crane. Take that next larger crane and use it to build an even bigger crane, and so on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But before you head off to your next event thinking you need to focus on one person and finding out what they can do for you, Danny reminds us to build that connection and relationship with the intent of finding out what YOU can do for them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You've got to trust the process of connecting and relationship building knowing that what you give comes back to you. You may not see it immediately, you probably won't meet Richard Branson's best bud at your next outing and get an intro to him shortly after, but it will come back. And it usually does come back in spades!</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Danny and I cover a lot of ground on this episode, including the post-it note trick to becoming a better networker and why getting to know 4 people well at your next event is way more beneficial than getting 12 business cards. Danny also explains how to dig your proverbial well before you're thirsty in a concrete way that you can implement now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Have a listen to get all of that and more from today's show.\u00a0Big kudos to Danny\u00a0for joining us and as always, thank you for being here.

He's an Irish lad born to an East London construction family with blue collar roots.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Initially he wanted to be a stockbroker so he talked his way into that world, and eventually a job in Hong Kong. He began work there on a Tuesday and was fired by the next Saturday. But that led to his work\u00a0as a doorman at nightclubs where he noticed something curious: the most elite clients weren't just the stuffy old-money crowd, there were a lot of new rich people coming in the doors.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Soon he was being asked if he could connect those folks with the fanciest parties, the best hotels, events, etc. Even though he didn't often know how he could make connections for them, he said yes and made it happen!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">That was 18 years ago and today he heads up a company called Bluefish, a luxury concierge service that provides whatever your heart desires.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But Steve never tells anyone he runs a concierge service, he believes what they do is so much more than that. He says he is the person who makes magic happen and if you ask about a few of the events he's helped create for others you'll see why this description is so appropriate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On today's show Steve shares some of his trade secrets, including the 3 ways he communicates for maximum return and how he makes other people happy (which in and of itself is one of his secrets to succeeding in anything).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The 3 ways he communicates for maximum return are phoning people, writing letters (handwriting the envelope, even if the letter is typed) and answering people's emails with videos. The personal touch each of these provide show people they matter to him and that he's thinking of them. Steve's three suggestions\u00a0take just\u00a0a little bit of effort but they leave a lasting impression and make other people happy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Another way he makes people happy is simply by asking them! For example if a client emails him with a request, he doesn't respond with an email. He picks up the phone and talks with them. He asks them questions about their request, like: Why is this important to you? What could we create to make you so excited you won't sleep the night before this event and will have you talking about it for years to come?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">With those answers, Steve sets out on his quest to make their experience happy. But he doesn't stop with just his clients happiness, he finds ways to make the people providing the experience for his clients happy as well. He once had a hotelier who was an exceptional resource, Steve discovered this hotelier loved Maroon5 so he had the band autograph a guitar and then gave the guitar to the hotelier. You can bet that is a gift that will be treasured throughout the hotelier's lifetime!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Whether or not you run a business and have clients of your own, Steve gives examples and tips to contribute to other people in your life. He also shares many of his stories, including how he got one of his clients to sing four songs with Journey, live on stage!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">You'll want to listen in to hear all the goods Steve has to share today, there are plenty!\u00a0Special thanks to Steve for joining us and as always, thank you for being here.

Today he joins us to talk about his book, how he overcame addiction, created lasting, healthy habits and changed the mental story he was telling himself. We cover all of those topics, and more on\u00a0episode 366 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and get 10% off Onnit!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Rich Roll is a man who doesn't do anything halfway, he admits to going \"all in\" when he commits to something and his history proves as much. He was a talented athlete in high school, becoming one of the best swimmers in his state and went on to pursue swimming in college at Stanford.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But he went down the rabbit hole of alcohol and drug abuse, sidelining his athletic pursuits and his entire life. At the age of 31 he got sober and began repairing the damage he had done. It took him years to do so, but he eventually got back on track. By 39 he was on the fast track to becoming a partner at his corporate law firm in Los Angeles, he was building his dream home in Malibu Canyon and was a happily married father.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On the outside everything looked perfect, but in reality he didn't feel fulfilled. He loved his wife, his family but those were the only bright spots for him. His work and his health were exhausting him, and something needed to be done.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">His first order of business was simply to experiment. He did a 7-day juice cleanse and gave his body a fresh slate to work with. From there he went vegetarian, and relied on his wife to be a sounding board and guidepost. She'd always been\u00a0a healthy person so she helped him experiment to find what worked best for him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Originally he just wanted more energy to play with his kids, but Rich doesn't do anything halfway and he went on to become an elite ultra-endurance athlete and health advocate. He doesn't call himself an expert because he doesn't claim to have all the answers, he just shares his journey and his findings on that journey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And we go in-depth on many of those findings, including how to create lasting change and how to stop allowing the story we tell ourselves to run our lives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Rich has created long-term change, in any area of his life, through incremental shifts. He suggests making one change, like buying almond milk instead of cow's milk, and cementing that change before moving on to something else. Small shifts over time create habits, which last.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The same holds true with the stories we tell ourselves. If we create a small shift by noticing our self-talk, over time we can become aware of how this self-talk and our own stories are running our lives. With that awareness we can shift out of our \"monkey mind\" and take the reigns of our own lives, instead of allowing our programming to run us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Rich and I also talk about inspiration vs implementation, what's wrong with our hacking culture and so much more. Have a listen to get all the insights and wisdom Rich has to share on this episode.\u00a0Thanks to Rich for joining us and as always, thank you for being here.

While all of that may be impressive, it also explains the foundation and where his Sealfit programs stem from. He blends mind and body and teaches people who are interested in this type of training to reach\u00a0their full warrior potential.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Sealfit uses mental, physical, emotional, intuitive and kokoro trainings to achieve this potential. Mark says this training is meant to help the people who participate become honorable people who serve their family, their community and humanity at large.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">There are a variety of programs available from a 12-month long digital offering called The Unbeatable Mind to a 50-hour non-stop\u00a0program called Kokoro Camp, it's modeled after Hell Week and is for the elite athletes and pre-special operation forces trainees of the world.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">There are many different tools used in all of his courses.\u00a0One of the techniques we talk about in this episode is a breathing technique to control your stress levels.\u00a0Mark explains it like this: to calm down or stay calm breath in through your nose and exhale through your nose you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">What happens when you do that is your\u00a0breath is stimulating\u00a0your diaphragm. There is a bundle of nerves there that triggers your parasympathetic nervous system, the counterpart to your sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for your fight, flight or freeze response.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Doing something as simple as taking deep breaths in and out of\u00a0your nose repeatedly will calm your body, thus calming your mind. When your mind and body are calm you can focus more intently and stay alert. You can use this trick anytime you're stressed, it doesn't have to be a life or death situation! Use it before a big interview or before you ask a girl out on a date.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Mark gives us another breathing tool to use and also shares his thoughts on intuition and trusting your gut. He tells us about a few examples from his life when he did or didn't trust his instinct, and the consequences. He also explains why the most successful people in the world are the most emotionally developed, and what his programs offer in that vein.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">It was fascinating to have Mark here and to listen to his stories, his personal experiences and knowledge on how to get the most out of our bodies and minds.\u00a0Thanks to Mark\u00a0for joining us and as always, thank you for being here.

PTSD and other anxiety disorders are incredibly common, and so is the unhealthy habit of masking or attempting to treat those disorders with medication which often does more harm than good.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Here to give us suggestions on how to recognize if we're suffering from an anxiety issue and what to do about it is Kevin Davis. Kevin is an anxiety coach who runs a podcast called The Anxiety Coaches. He has grappled with anxiety personally and found solutions that didn't require medication. He'll tell us all about that\u00a0and so much more on\u00a0episode 364 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and get 10% off Onnit!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">One day while driving down his usual road Kevin had to swerve into the ditch to avoid an oncoming car. Everything happened so quickly he wasn't able to stop his car from running head on into a pole. His hood crumpled and he saw his car's engine explode into flames. Fortunately he escaped and was okay.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But a few weeks later he started having severe physical symptoms while driving down that same road. His rate would rapidly increase to 200 or more, which increased his panic. He worried he had done irreparable harm to his body by over-consuming caffeine, working out too hard and steroids. Not once did he correlate his symptoms with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from his frightening car accident, nor did anyone else in his life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">He eventually went to the doctor and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. His doctor wanted to give him medication but when Kevin read the side effects he wanted no part of it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Instead he researched all possible treatments for anxiety and started exploring on his own. He found a few things that worked, meditation being one of them. But it seemed like as one treatment would kick in his symptoms would show up in another form, he could treat his constricted feeling in his throat for a week or two only to have tingling in his hands show up the next week.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Then his mom Googled anxiety disorders and found a web site run by anxiety coaches. These were men and women who had experienced anxiety themselves and had it overcome it, without drugs. They were now trained coaches with psychology backgrounds who were sharing their expertise with anxiety sufferers. Kevin found a coach and together they realized he had PTSD from his car accident.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">That was his first step towards truly healing of his anxiety. With a new understanding and the help of his coach he was able to get a handle on his symptoms and treat their roots.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">One of the tools he learned was meditation. According to Kevin we don't have to become monks to meditate and reap the benefits. By listening to a guided meditation for just 20 minutes a day our brains will respond differently in just a few short weeks. Those 20 minutes will help our minds focus better, stay on track easier, stay calmer and reduce our overall anxiety.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Another trick we discuss is not to multi-task. When we've got 3 different things we're trying to do within the hour it's best to focus on one, knock it out and move on to the next one. If we try to juggle all 3\u00a0at the same time we won't get as far and may not even finish any of the tasks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When we're focused on one task we can hone in on it with laser focus; we\u00a0actually get far less done when we're juggling multiple tasks because it takes us up to 20 minutes to shift gears from one subject to another. So if you're editing something and you want to switch to creating a new spreadsheet it can take your brain up to 20 minutes before it's really focused in on making that new spreadsheet. So focus in on one thing, get it done and move on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Kevin and I also talk about the need to recharge and why it's important to set boundaries, and more on this episode.

When his vagabonding was complete he revisited academy and earned a Masters degree and doctorate in psychology.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">In his psychology programs he spent much of his time looking at the roots of human sexuality to better understand how our ancestors' sexual experiences have impacted how we have evolved into today's current sexual climate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">He's done that by studying our biology and physiology today; he says our bodies tell us our ancestors' sexual activities. For example, men's testicles are on the outside of their bodies and their sperm is released in mass quantities because they are in competition to impregnate women. Competition takes place at the cellular level, not at the physical level.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Along those same lines, the DNA that controls the volume and size of sperm and overall ejaculation is some of the most genetically-responsive DNA in our bodies. That means it responds and changes within our environment faster than any other DNA we have, so we can see what evolutionary changes are happening by studying this particular type of DNA.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Dr. Chris also shares why humans seem to have sex for reasons other than procreation. If you study other mammals about 99% of them only have sex when the female is ovulating, but not humans. Mammals in general have sex about 12 times per birth, humans about 1,000x per birth.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">So why is that? Because sex is about social relationships. Human sexuality has been co-opted over time to be used for\u00a0building and maintaining complex relationships, something we do very well as a species. We build communities together, and sex has played a pivotal role in doing so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">On this episode we also why open relationships can lead to healthier, happier marriages, and why some native tribes participate in partible paternity where multiple men father the same child.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But the final thought Dr. Chris leaves us with is the importance of respecting women. He gives scientific and historical evidence to show why shaming their sexual behavior and choices is like poisoning your own drinking well. When women are respected and can feel safe expressing themselves everyone in society wins.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Dr. Chris had so much knowledge to share, it was great to have him here!

Or why so many people seem to fall in love, only to be miserable with each other down the road? Harville Hendrix joins us today to answer these questions, and the psychology behind why relationships work or don't work out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Harville is a relationship expert, therapist, coach and author of several books including\u00a0<em>Getting The Love You Want</em>. He joins us to chat about all of this and much\u00a0more on episode 362 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">For over 35 years Harville Hendrix has worked in the field of relationships. In that time he and his wife Helen have worked with countless couples on how to communicate better and stay connected. In that time they've found what works and what doesn't work to maintain a healthy, happy relationship.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Harville says in order to understand why some connections last and others don't, we need to first understand why we are drawn to the people we are drawn to. Doing so will help us work within our relationships so we're actually getting the love we want.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">When we're infants we create an image of our caretakers and we're left with an imprint that tells what needs were met, and what needs were not. We create what's called an \"imago\" when we do this. This becomes our basis for what we seek in a partner. In other words if we had a need that wasn't met by our caretakers (and most of us had some need or many needs), then we actively look for that fulfillment from someone just like our caretaker.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">At first that might sound illogical (why not just seek someone who can give us what we didn't get and not a replica of the person who didn't give it to us in the first place?), but Harville says we do this so we can create growth for ourselves with that person. And we attract someone who needs something we can't fulfill for them, so we can create a growth opportunity for them in return.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But what typically happens is we fall in romantic love, the love blooms and our visions are colored by dopamine and endorphins so we think everything is rosy and perfect. Til one day the dopamine wears off and we see the other person as they truly are. And then we get frustrated that they aren't meeting our unmet needs and they get defensive when we try to talk about these needs, because we don't know how to effectively communicate without triggering the other person.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">So instead of effectively working on these difficulties, most people either give up and break off the relationship or end the marriage. In most cases we do this because we haven't learned how to talk to each other in a way that creates a safe space for the other person. We try to ask for what we need, but take a position of authority and a defensive tone that simply leads to our partner becoming defensive in return.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">To rectify this and to create a safe relationship to thrive in, Harville has a few suggestions. And these are suggestions he has witnessed work for countless couples, it's the basis for his practice, his books and his programs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">There are three things we need to do to create a safe relationship where both people can discuss their needs. The first is to learn how to talk. Instead of our usual monologue, which is how most people speak, we need to have a dialogue. And in this dialogue we need to respect our partner's differences and points of view; they should be mirrored, validated, listened to and empathized with. We can also set aside specific time to discuss relationship topics and instead of asking \"are you done?\", always ask your partner \"is there more?\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The second thing we can do is to have a zero negativity process. In a zero negativity relationship all conversations you have you affirm your partner\u00a0as different with the right to their opinions. You don't\u00a0make them bad because they are different or devalue them because of those differences. This helps create a safe environment where differences can be expressed from both of you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Thirdly affirm each other on a daily basis. Harville and his wife Helen say three things about each other that they appreciate every day. And these are things that happened that day. It's an affirmation process or a gratitude practice for your relationship. This actually helps your brain create new neural pathways and you'll see your partner in a new light. Your partner becomes a source of gratitude, happiness and joy for you instead of a sore spot.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">There's a plethora of additional relationship and marriage tools and advice in this episode with Harville.

We discuss those topics and so much more on this episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"><a href=\"http://onnit.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Support The Show and get 10% off Onnit!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Jake Ducey was like most of us: he was raised to believe the road to success meant graduating high school with good grades, going to college and then getting a good job until you retired. And then maybe when you retired you'd have enough money and enough time to really do the things you love to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">But not long into his college career Jake ditched that notion. He realized he didn't want to be another cog in the wheel, and that's all that college was preparing him to be. After reading a copy of Jack Canfield's\u00a0<em>The Success Principles</em>, he was inspired to quit school and strike out on his own.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">By age 19 he had written his first book and was turned down by a myriad of publishers. They all told him he couldn't possibly know enough to write a good book and they passed on his work. So he took matters into his own hands and self-published and self-promoted. He was his only publicist and he had no marketing budget to speak of, but he launched his book into Amazon's top 300. By the time his second book was ready he was offered a book deal, becoming the youngest motivational author at his publishing company.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Along the way he's gathered the stories of our modern day successes like Oprah, Brad Pitt, Jim Carey and The Beatles. He's been mentored and learned under the tutelage of great authors like Jack Canfield and John Gray. He's taken valuable lessons he's learned from them and passed along that knowledge to the public.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">And today he passes along much of that knowledge to us. We touch on several topics in this episode, one of those being how to take action despite fear. He says men like John Gray and Jack Canfield are afraid too, they just don't let it stop them. They take action and have courage, inspite of their fear.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Also it's important to understand you'll never get rid of fear, none of us will, so we have to move forward even when we feel it. Fear is a natural part of being alive, but we can face it and move ahead even when it's present.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Jake also says he's learned to ask himself one simple question in any scenario when he's afraid: \"What's the best that could happen?\". Rather than focusing on the worst, which is what most of us do, he focuses on the best. And if you really need to address that worst case scenario, Jake recommends addressing it, preparing for it and then focusing on the best possible outcome and hoping for that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">There are several other lessons he provides on today's episode but the final one we'll cover here is his productivity. How in the world can someone so young accomplish so much? He falls back on lessons from other motivational authors and uses the 10-minute rule and the 5 tasks a day rule. Take your To-Do list and find the items that will take you 10 (or 15) minutes to do and separate them from the others. And every day focus on 5 things you will do today to move you towards the life you really want.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Jake\u00a0and I also talk about how to lock down your purpose, how to create your most successful and fulfilling year (the one question to ask for this) and a whole heckuva lot more! Thanks to Jake\u00a0for joining us and sharing his inspirational story and insightful knowledge.

Whether you like it, hate it or think you're terrible at it, our guest for today's show will have advice, suggestions and tools you can put to good use immediately.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Marsha Shandur is a networking expert and coach who helps people enjoy networking, and become very good at it. On today's episode we talk about why networking can be and really is fun, when you approach it the right away. We also discuss how to get over your fear of striking up conversations at events, how to properly follow up after an event for maximum impact, and how to create long-lasting connections that become solid relationships over time. All of that and much more on episode 359 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">If you asked a room of 300 people to close their hands, then raise their hands if they dislike networking about 255 people would raise their hands. At least that's what our guest for episode 359 says! Marsha Shandur has done this exercise with crowds and that's what she has discovered: almost everyone hates networking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">She's here today to help us overcome that hatred, our fear of approaching new people at events and find the best ways to connect and become friends with the people we meet at networking events. Because that's her job, Marsha and I have plenty of informative topics and points we share.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">The first topic we address is the biggie: what to do if you're afraid or hesitant to event attend an event. Marsha has a number of suggestions to dealing with this very common fear. First and foremost understand that most people share your fear, so don't beat yourself up over it. Instead give yourself a specific goal or a specific \"out\" for the evening. Promise yourself you'll attend the event for 2 hours, and if you aren't enjoying yourself after those 2 hours then you can leave. Or make it your goal to talk with 4 new people that night, and when you're done with those four conversations you can go home.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Now that you've established your intention for the event, the second thing you can do is\u00a0to ask yourself this one question when you walk into the\u00a0event. And that question is \"Who here would I be friends with?\". When you find those people, strike up a conversation and connect with them because networking and networking events are about making friends, creating fun and productive connections.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">If the idea of initiating conversations with a stranger (or strangers) strikes fear into your heart, there is good news and bad news according to Marsha. She says the good news is nearly everyone else is afraid of talking to people they don't know. The bad news? You're probably always going to be afraid to take that first step. Marsha says to take it anyway. When you make that initial connection the person you talk with will most likely be so grateful you did (because they were too afraid to) that they will remember you. You'll leave an impression.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">Another great way to make an impact on the people you meet, in a positive way, is to ask questions. And these aren't the usual \"what do you do\" questions that most people ask, while waiting for you to finish so they can talk about and pitch themselves. These are questions Marsha recommends to create connection and build rapport.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">A specific example she gives is to ask people how their week has been or if it's a Monday or Tuesday ask how their weekend went. Odds are good that you'll hear something in their answer that clues you in to who they are, what they do and/or what they love. And when you hear them talk about what they love, ask more questions. When people talk about their passions they feel good and when you're the one asking about their passions you're the one making them feel good. They'll remember you for that feeling you gave them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">We also talk about how to follow up with people after the event (and how this same technique works to connect with anyone through email), and how to get out of an awkward conversation with grace and aplomb, and TONS more. This is a dandy of a conversation, listen in and you'll walk away with an arsenal of networking knowledge courtesy of Marsha.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">A big thank you to Marsha for being here and sharing so generously, check out the resources for a link to email templates that include her \"secret sentence\" that will get anyone to do what you ask them to do!

It's something we all want, yet most of us fear. We want it because with accountability things are clear, projects run smoother, results are produced and people are more fulfilled.\u00a0In relationships the same is true: we're happier with accountability because our expectations are clear and are being met.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So why do we fear it? And what can we shift in our mindset, our behaviors and our attitudes to let go of that fear and embrace accountability? Linda Galindo of The Straight Truth joins us to answer those questions and more on the 357th edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Have you ever worked in an office where there was someone who obviously didn't pull his or her weight and yet they were allowed to get away with it? Our guest for today's episode explains why this experience is so common and so frustrating, and what you can do about it if you find yourself picking up someone else's slack in your office.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It boils down to accountability and if someone isn't living up to what is expected of him or her in their work, and no one holds them accountable then everyone involved suffers. It's common in the workforce today, but becoming less and less accepted. And if you're on the receiving end of this person's workload, Linda says there is something you can do about it besides just obediently and grudgingly take on the extra work.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Here's the type of conversation she says to have with your boss if or when this happens: express your concern and let your boss know you want to do more interesting work. Assure them they can rely on you to do this new, interesting work and tell them you want to stretch yourself in your role. And let your boss know by giving you this type of work, they'll also have time to deal with the other person.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Linda has spoken with many leaders of organizations and all have agreed this type of communication is invaluable to them. By saying this you are letting them know you want to be a leader for them, they can count on you and you are willing to express your thoughts; all valuable traits they are looking for in a leader within the company.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There are a few other behaviors leaders look for from their employees\u00a0in terms of accountability. If you want to be a leader, don't talk about others when they aren't around. Instead talk to someone if you have a concern and address it directly with them. No one trusts someone who talks about others behind their back. If you talk about one person behind his or her back, what's to stop you from talking about anyone else when they aren't around? Leaders must be trusted. Addressing someone directly builds trust.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The second behavior is to not have meetings after the meeting! If something isn't clear to you during the meeting than be bold, courageous and brave and say so. You are responsible and accountable for your own clarity, so if something isn't clear to you than say so in that moment.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Accountability isn't just reserved for the workplace. Accountability is a necessary component of healthy, long-lasting relationships too. In order for a relationship to be truly fulfilling and strong for the long haul, each person in it must take 100% accountability for the relationship. You read that right: 100%, not 50%. Linda says if it's 50% then it devolves into a co-dependent, needy relationship. So if you and your significant other want it to work out take 100% responsibility for the relationship and your part in it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Linda and I also talk about the power of having someone in your life holding you accountable for your accountability and your results. She stresses the importance of having a coach or someone else in your life who is completely committed to your success and allowing that person to hold your feet to the fire. That person could be a coach or a friend, but not a significant other (Linda explains why not).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also talk about steps to take right now to change your relationship to accountability, and how to develop accountability behaviors at work, among other related topics.\u00a0Linda really brought the straight truth on accountability in this episode, so be sure to hear all the details! Thanks to Linda for being here, and thanks to all of you for tuning in.

Now what if you had just recently picked up a longboard for the first time? That's exactly what today's guest did, and he broke the world record doing so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Today Dave Cornthwaite joins us to talk about his adventures, including Expedition 1,000, and how he became a traveler, author, filmmaker and speaker on the subject of adventure travel. All of that and more on the 356th edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dave wasn't born into a life of adventure, he cultivated it. On his 25th birthday he woke up feeling completely disenchanted with his life. He had a great job earning a good living, had a lovely home, a significant other and a cat. In other words, everyone would think he had the ideal life. But in his heart he knew he only loved his cat, and that cat was about to have a much better day than he was.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That was Dave's turning point. Soon he quit his job and decided he was going to skate around Australia, breaking the world record in the process. To prepare he simply skateboarded every day for a couple of weeks and then he wheeled his way across the length of Great Britain, thereby setting his first world record. He didn't know how he was going to do either of these objectives when he set out to do them, he simply decided he was going to do them. He trained, learned and sorted things out as he went along.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And he hasn't looked back since. Within those first two years of leaving his job, he broke several world records, landed a book deal and skated the length of both Great Britain and Australia. He's also in the midst of Expedition 1000: 25 journeys of 1000 miles or more using non-motorized transport. Not bad for a guy who had been living a pretty \"normal\" life until then!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So how did he make that shift and how did he know to do so? Dave says there were signs of course, but most important he knew to follow his gut. His instinct told him something wasn't right, and there was more available to life than just going to a job, collecting a paycheck and accumulating \"stuff\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In addition to his gut telling him to search for more, he recalls not wanting to go to work on Monday. He also spent money on useless things, as a way to fit in and a way to fill the void that was creeping in from lack of happiness in his overall life. Those were his big clues, along with what his gut told him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you find yourself in that same boat, and you know what you want to do next but you've got some fear, how do you get up the gumption to do it? Dave says things are far scarier in your mind and your thoughts, than they are in real life. So stop thinking so much and go do the things you need to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And don't be bothered by the naysayers who try to stop you. Dave has heard his fair share of these folks, and even still hears from some of them today. What he's learned is when people are trying to dissuade you or they are speaking to your fears, it's not actually your fears they are speaking to but their own fears.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When someone tries to talk you out of your big goal or dream just know it's their own fear they're trying to assuage. His final bit of wisdom on the subject is to remember it takes tremendous courage even to vocalize your dreams, so if your friends aren't supportive of you and encouraging you then they aren't real friends.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There's tons more wisdom shared in this episode with Dave, tune in to hear his thoughts on how to say yes more, and have more opportunities show up in your life along with why we all need a bit of adventure in your lives.

And while some experts focus on one or two of these our guest for episode 355 focuses on all four. \u00a0MJ Shaar, author of\u00a0<em>Smarts and Stamina</em>, is a health and wellness expert who holds a Master of Applied Positive Psychology\u00a0from the University of Pennsylvania. She's also a certified personal trainer and consultant in this field.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's episode we talk about these four pillars, what her book has to say on them and recommendations she has to get smarter and build more stamina easier and faster. All of that and more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you were committed to improving your health by changing your sleep patterns, your mood, your food habits or your exercise routine, where would you start? Would you focus on the ones that need the most improvement, or would you improve on good habits you've already created in one (or more) of those four areas?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Most of us would want to shift our bad habits and make them better, but our guest today says we're better off improving the good things we're already doing. If we're good at getting enough sleep then what can we do to be even better in this area? If we're already exercising regularly what else can we do to improve? By spending our energy and our time enhancing our existing good habits, MJ says we're far more likely to naturally and more easily improve upon our bad ones too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Over the last 14 years MJ has researched, studied and explored those four pillars of health, and she's even created a business model for other health professionals to become trained and certified in. Her Smarts and Stamina program is designed to help people become happier, more productive and healthier in every way, and to do so with as little self-discipline needed\u00a0as possible!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's episode we discuss each of the four areas (sleep, mood, food and exercise) and some of the science behind the important role each plays in our overall well-being. One of the areas we spend a lot of time on is sleep. She often hears people say they are too busy to get more than a few hours rest. And while some may hear that and think the person must be very busy, MJ hears that and thinks the person's cognitive abilities are impaired and their judgment is skewed...because that's what happens from regular sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Even if you aren't that sleep deprived person, you may miss a few hours here and there. And that's ok according to MJ. She says our bodies will try and make up for it down the road, we may want to sleep an extra hour or two on the weekend or catch a nap in the afternoon. But if we continue to deprive our bodies of the sleep they need over a long period of time it's just bad news all around.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">She compares sleep to a line of credit. If you take out a line of credit (or you miss a few hours of sleep), you can easily repay it a little bit at a time as long as you do so regularly and consistently. You can rebuild your sleep health by adding on a few more hours over time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But if you miss a few payments or take out even more money (or you continually deprive yourself of sleep for weeks, months on end) then you're simply digging yourself an even bigger hole that's much harder to get out of. When you miss some sleep, grab extra winks as soon as you can and don't make it a regular habit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To help you sleep soundly, regularly MJ has a few suggestions she shares in this episode. The first thing she says is to add in a few moments throughout your day to decompress. If you're in the checkout line at the store, just take a couple of deep breaths and be in the checkout line. You don't need to check Twitter or your email, just breath. Instead of driving to lunch, walk there instead. Allow yourself a few moments throughout your day to slow down a little, you'll have a much easier time slowing down to go to sleep at night.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And secondly, create a ritual before bed. Remember how your parents tucked you in at night when you were a kid? You brushed your teeth, washed your face, maybe they read you a story and then it was lights out for the night. You can do the same thing for yourself now: brush your teeth, wash your face, get into bed and read for 10 minutes before turning out the lights. If you do this regularly your brain will catch on and will understand doing those things means you're going to sleep, it will start to sync \u00a0up with that ritual and will cue your body to get ready to sleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Those are just a few of the suggestions MJ shares in this episode, she has plenty of wit and wisdom you'll want to tune in for. A big thanks to her for being here, and thanks to you too.\u00a0Thanks so much and we'll see you next time on The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS MJ SHAAR!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let MJ\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending her a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gotsas\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank MJ\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.smartsandstamina.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MJ Shaar's\u00a0web site<br /></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gotsas\" target=\"_blank\">MJ Shaar\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.smartsandstamina.com/the-book/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Smarts and Stamina</em></a>, MJ Shaar's book</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

True according to our guest for episode 354.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Today Andrew Hallam, former finance teacher and author of Millionaire Teacher joins us to talk about the secret to compound interest, how to wisely invest, how to dig yourself out of debt and a host of other finance-related topics. Listen in for all of that and so much more on the 354th edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Very often people believe unless they are making millions of dollars there's no way they can become a millionaire. How could a teacher or a mechanic ever reach millionaire status? By saving and investing wisely and consistently over time, according to Andrew Hallam. And Andrew would know: he taught personal finance to the children of some of the world's most high-octane, Type A business parents. He also wrote the Amazon top-ranked book,\u00a0<em>Millionaire Teacher</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He didn't start out with such lofty upbringing though; he has blue collar roots and earned his way through college, the first of his family to do so. While he was working one summer he met a mechanic who was a millionaire and that man taught him to learn to master money and not the other way around.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of Andrew's keys to mastering money has been understanding the beauty of compound interest. Andrew learned to invest a small amount every month at a young age, and to do so consistently over time while watching that money grow, and grow and grow. On today's show he explains how investing as little as $6.45 a day can become a million dollars over the course of 9 years, he goes into detail on how compound interest makes this possible and how we can start doing this today.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But what if you're like millions of people who have credit card debt? Should you still invest while paying off your balance? Not according to Adam. Instead of investing, where you're getting a 9% return on your investment, pay off your credit cards because the average card is charging 18% interest. So take the money you were going to invest and pay down your credit cards.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And here's a trick to paying them off even faster: write out exactly how much you owe on a slip of paper and then write the date by which you'll have them all paid off. Take that piece of paper and post it somewhere you'll see it every day, like your bathroom mirror. Look at it and remember you're on your way to mastering your money, and not letting your money master you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Once you're on your way to having paid off your credit cards and you're ready to invest for your future, set up an automatic transfer to your 401(k) or to a separate account which you use only to invest for retirement. And if your company offers to match your 401(k) investment make sure you take advantage of it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the subject of where to invest, Andrew also has a suggestion: try the Vanguard Index. This particular index is set up by a company called The Vanguard Group, and the index is structured in such a way that you don't pay a sales commission. That means there are no fat cats and no shareholders who are making extra bucks off of you, as is the case with so many other financial packages and financial advisors.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you want to try another option, you can go with Fidelity's Index funds as well. But in most other instances he says the banker or financial advisor who is supposed to be helping you will really be concerned with making money for themselves and their employer first and foremost.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On this episode Andrew also explains which assets are appreciating (and worth taking loans out for) and which are depreciating, and why auto loans are such a bad idea.

If we don't care about learning other languages is there still value in some of the hacks people apply when becoming multi-linguistic?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Absolutely, according to Scott H Young our guest for today's show. Scott invests his days in learning how to do things more efficiently and effectively, including languages. Today he shares with us how to apply his language hacks for everyday life, and so much more on the 353rd episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Would you ever go to a country with the vow not speak English no matter what? Not only did Scott H Young do that, he went to FOUR countries without speaking English while traveling with a friend. As you might imagine, he learned a great deal along the way and much of what he learned had little to do with language itself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's show we talk about how to apply language hacks to everyday life, based on what he discovered in his pursuit of being multi-lingual. The first discovery he shares is why we'd even bother, why does it matter if we learn how to navigate differences in other people? Because all of us, even if we never travel to a foreign country, will interact or be exposed to people who are different than we are. They either live differently, think differently or run with a different crowd.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And the key to a healthier, happier and more productive life is to get along with people from all walks of life no matter how different they are from us. It's one of the most important traits employers look for in a potential new hire: will he or she fit into this culture? A great way to prove you will is to show you've assimilated or connected with people from many different backgrounds.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The fundamental way to connect, according to Scott, is to find something you respect about that culture and focus on that. Once people in that culture understand you respect why they do what they do, even if it is different from the why and how of your background, the more open and receptive they will become. Once someone is open and receptive, it's far easier to connect and build a mutually satisfying relationship where you learn and express yourselves with each other.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">This doesn't have to apply to someone from a foreign country or with a different nationality, this can be applied to the various social groups you encounter. Are you a professor who has to sit down with a group of hipsters? The best way to fit in is to find something about them you respect, then look for how they operate, communicate and how they become friends. When you find all of that you'll have a much easier time connecting and fitting into their group.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Or maybe you live in a particular neighborhood and don't \"get\" the way people live just a few miles from you. Be willing to explore, and look for ways to understand why they do what they do. When you look for and find the \"whys\" of a culture, any culture, you're far more likely to accept and appreciate that group.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also discuss why respecting someone from a different background doesn't mean we're any less confident in who we are, it isn't showing weakness to show respect for others. This is where vulnerability plays a key role. In essence vulnerability is showing the other person you respect them enough to open, and let your guard down. That gives them the opportunity to do so and allows for a much more real connection. Scott and I dive into this topic even deeper in the show.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It was a pleasure to have Scott here to chat about his experiences and the lessons he's learned, and how you can apply his wisdom to get ahead!

How could you create an event to bring them together and make them want to share a meal with you? Our guest for episode 351 did just that. Jon Levy runs an event called The Influencers Dinner in his home in New York.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's episode he shares the origins of his idea, how he executed it to become the successful experience it is and how you can apply the same principles to create a similar event of your own. Join us for all of that and more on episode 351 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jon Levy is a behavior expert, digital strategist and keynote speaker, but what is probably best known for is dinner. If you're lucky enough to get an invite to one of his exclusive dinners you're bound to have an amazing time with some of the most influential people in the world. He's had members of royal families attend, Nobel Laureates, famous actors, musicians, artists and some of the top leaders in every industry from around the globe.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So what's his secret? Did he have an amazing Rolodex and just decided to gather people together at his place? Not at all. About six years ago he attended a seminar with Landmark Education and something the seminar leader said struck a chord within him. The leader said the quality of our lives is largely determined by the people we spend our time with and the conversations we have. These two things are the fundamental elements that impact who we are and where we go with our lives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jon realized he wanted to connect with the greatest influencers he could, but how? At the time he was 28 and working for a start-up, he wasn't anyone who could get a phone call (much less a dinner) with the heads of state or Olympic medal winners. He spent the next year ruminating over how to create so much value for these people that they would make time in their already hectic schedules.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He knew whatever he created needed to be so novel they would say yes. He eventually thought of having people over for dinner. He knew a group activity like cooking together would bond them quickly, and sharing food and conversation would cement that bond.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Here's the novel part of the event: no one knows each other and each person is a leader from a different industry. They are not allowed to talk about what they do, they can only use their first names and if they are famous they must assume a different first name. Then over dinner the guests will guess what each of the attendees does for a living, only then can the guest reveal who they are!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Since his first dinner Jon has since held 36 more and The Influencers Dinner has grown to be legendary. It's been featured in Forbes, The New York-Times and has been the catalyst behind millions of dollars done in business deals, publicity and press coverage for the attendees, multiple non-profits and even some romantic relationships.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But Jon is the first to admit he overcame many hurdles and made plenty of mistakes along the way. He says he has embarrassed himself more times than not, failed countless times and had to learn many lessons the hard way. But it's all been worth it. In his words, \"it takes a long time to become an overnight success\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you're in the same position Jon was when he first had the idea, what are some practical steps you can take to get going and create your own variation of The Influencers Dinner? Jon's first suggestion is to create novelty. Find something unique you can offer your guests that no one else does. Do you love games? Then do a game night and spend some time sorting out how to structure the evening so your guests enjoy themselves and you add value to their lives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That's another key point Jon makes: be sure you do something that is true to your core values. Remember this is going to be an event you're hosting for years to come so make it fun, make it enjoyable and make it something you already like doing. If it's not games, then how about a wine tasting or a mixology night? Again put some thought into this and be sure the event and activity you are hosting is true to you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One last suggestion Jon has is to spend a lot of time coming up with the idea. It took him a full year to come up with the dinner party idea! And he cautions about following in his footsteps with the dinner party: they get expensive (he spent $30k on his last year alone) so consider other alternatives before going down that road, unless you're willing to fork out the money.

On The Art of Charm we've highlighted people and studies that prove this, and today we're joined by a guest who is considered one of the best at this art.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On\u00a0today's show is Steve Sisler, behavioral analyst. But he's not just any behavioral analyst, he's been called a people reading savant!\u00a0And when you hear him on episode 350, you'll know why. We cover how he does what he does, tips he has for you on how to read people, and so much more on today's edition of\u00a0The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For the last 10 years Steve Sisler has been reading people for a living. For him it's an intuitive skill he has a knack for, and he's put in the time, effort and energy to hone his natural talent. Today he runs a thriving enterprise helping companies and people understand how to read people: from themselves, to their employees, to their spouses and significant others.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Naturally a man like Steve has hundreds upon hundreds of stories about his work and the revelations people have experienced as a result of better understandings of themselves and each other; he shares a few of those with us on this episode and they are worth listening in to hear! What he also shares on this episode is the four types of people. You'll want to take note of these and how to recognize them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The first type is the mad type. These are the \"get to the point\", one word answer, bottom-line type people. They get stuff done. When Steve describes them as mad, it's not a bad thing. It simply means they operate out of decisiveness and want to accomplish something.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">How do you recognize them? They are bold and direct. Their emails will often be one word, brief responses with exclamation points and periods. If you still don't know if someone is a mad type, try saying things like \"here's the point\", \"the bottom line is\". If they respond positively, you know they're a mad type.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The second type is the glad type, these people come from an optimistic emotional base and they operate based on how they feel. They are usually very charming and suave, think of Bill Clinton. If you're trying to sell a car to a glad type you'll want to put them in the flashiest, fastest convertible and tell them how great they look when driving! These folks are also direct communicators, like the mad type.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Then there are the non-direct communicator types, our final two: sad and scared. The sad folks are the supporters in the world. These people are often found working in office administration roles, secretaries, office managers and receptionists. They\u00a0are calm, easy-going and quiet. You never know what they're thinking, but you can clue in based on their emails: they use question marks and commas a lot.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The fourth group is the scared group. These are the type of people who\u00a0are thinkers. They see the logical in both sides of an argument and will always acknowledge when someone is right. Think of Dr. Spock, he's a perfect example of a scared type. This group is also an indirect communicator, meaning they won't tell you directly what's going on with them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Steve has recommendations for how to communicate with each group and he says it's incredibly important to remember you are responsible for giving the other person space to communicate with you in a way that works for them. So even if you're a mad type and you're dealing with a sad type person, don't expect tell them to directly communicate. Steve says that's like telling a rock to be a tree! If you want an authentic relationship with someone, you have to be willing to meet them where they are.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There are other additional ways to communicate with each type, and Steve shares some of his personal stories about handling a dominant/mad type and also how he, a mad type, interacts with his sad type wife. He gives terrific, applicable lessons we can all use.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also cover how to be vulnerable (and if it works with mad types), and how to spot each of these types based on people's physical behaviors (like a handshake). There's a tremendous amount of valuable information in this episode, enjoy it! As always, thank you for being here,\u00a0and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS STEVE SISLER!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Steve know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/stevesisler\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Steve\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.stevesisler.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Sisler's web site<br /></a><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/stevesisler\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Sisler\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.stevesisler.org/books/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Sisler's books</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

One of the most successful podcasters in the world had to quit time after time after time in order to achieve the level of success he has today.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">John Lee Dumas, the mastermind behind Entrepreneur on Fire and Podcaster's Paradise, joins us to talk about how he found the courage to quit throughout his 20s and the success that brought him in his 30s.\u00a0Listen in for all of that and so much more on\u00a0episode 349 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We live in a culture that glorifies 18-hour workdays, even if you're in a job or running a business you hate. There is no room at the top for quitters, that's long been the motto held by many. But is any of that really true or is it ok\u00a0for you to quit until you find your thing? Turning the \"quitting is only for quitters\" paradigm on its head is our guest for episode 349, Mr. John Lee Dumas.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If this is the only podcast you listen to then you may not have heard of him. But if you know anything about the podcasting world you know this guy is a phenom. He's the ringleader of Entrepreneur on Fire (or EOFire for short), a daily podcast getting millions of downloads and today earning him a seven-figure income.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But just a few short years ago, John was struggling...really struggling. He had given up on law school after one semester, quit the corporate finance world after a few short years, and ended a brief run in commercial real estate. And John did not come from a family of quitters, he was not raised to quit anything. He was raised to give it his all and to know he'd succeed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">All of the \"quitting\" began after John spent four years in the Army. He went to college on an Army ROTC scholarship, part of which required him to serve for four years after. When he originally signed on the dotted line in the late 90s we were a country at peace.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And then 9/11 happened. The day the US was attacked was the beginning of John's senior year of college. He was concerned, of course everyone was at the time, but it wasn't until January of the following year that he understood he'd be going into a full conflict combat zone in Iraq. He was an Army tank leader and lead 16 men on a tour there through some of the bloodiest battles in that war.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Losing four of his men really shifted John's perspective. He promised himself his life would make a difference and he would fulfill on promises these men would never have the chance to. He vowed to never settle for less than what he thought he was capable of.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That vow and that promise were the reasons John explored and quit so many avenues after finishing in the armed forces. He left law school after one semester, even though he knew on his first day that it wasn't for him. He tried several other career paths, but nothing was \"it\" and he knew it. But one day while driving to work he ran out of podcasts to listen to. At the time he was in commercial real estate and was traveling a lot so while in his car he listened to inspirational and educational podcasts.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And then it hit him: he would create and produce a daily podcast! No one else was so why not him? Feeling like he had found \"it\", John went full speed ahead into podcasting creation mode. From there EOFire was born.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That's not to say it was all sunshine and roses, not even close. Because he had no college debt, John lived prudently and had saved over $100k. He used that money as his runway, and he needed it. EOFire didn't make any money for the first nine months. But he stuck it out, he honed his craft and continued (and still continues) to learn along the way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">As he got better his numbers got bigger and his reach grew. With that advertisers came calling and opportunities presented themselves, like his mastermind group Podcaster's Paradise. Today he runs a thriving podcast that garners millions of downloads and is set to earn him well into the seven figure mark in 2015. And his lesson from all of this? Quit until you make it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We talk about so much on this episode, including how to know when to quit, how to know if your side project can be a full-on business and how to find a great mentor and mastermind group. John wanted to thank all of you for listening so he's given you the gift of his Podcast Launch book, for free\u00a0<a href=\"http://eofire.com/gift\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>.

Or maybe you did say that in the past but now you actually make more and still don't feel like you have enough to start saving. Here with solutions to both situations is the author of several books including\u00a0<em>Profit First</em>, Mr. Mike Michalowicz.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Mike has written extensively about profits, making money and entrepreneurship. But even if you don't have a business or you don't consider yourself an entrepreneur, this show is for you. Today we talk about putting profit first and expenses second, whatever your financial situation. Listen in for all of that and so much more on\u00a0episode 348 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">By the time he was 35 Mike Michalowicz was a millionaire. He had sold his second business for mucho dinero and he was awfully proud of himself. Too proud in fact, something he readily admits caused his next missteps. After finding himself with boatloads of cash he decided to be an angel investor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He thought that's what everyone does after they make a million - they invest in other businesses, show those businesses how to make millions and then earn billions as a result of their investment.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That was his plan, and it completely backfired. He didn't use common sense regarding the companies he chose and he paid the price for it. He paid the FULL price for it. Between his bad investments and his need to flash his money around with expensive cars, toys, etc, he lost all of his earnings.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So after a \"Come to Jesus\" moment, he went back to the drawing board of entrepreneurship with a different mindset. Instead of asking how he could make money and how much, he asked himself what was the right thing to do? His answer was to write\u00a0<em>The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur</em>. Today it is a cult classic in the entrepreneurial and business worlds.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">From there he went on to write\u00a0<em>The Pumpkin Plan</em>, another insta-classic and then his latest best-seller\u00a0<em>Profit First</em>. His most recent book is what we spend a great deal of the show talking about today. He gives us a quick overview of what the book is about and how to incorporate the topic into our own finances.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The nitty-gritty of\u00a0<em>Profit First\u00a0</em>is this: businesses who set aside a portion of their cashflow first as profits will be more profitable and lucrative in the long run than those who wait and see if there's anything left at the end of the fiscal year. It's all based around an idea called Parkinson's Theory, which (highly simplified) says you'll use up whatever is there no matter how great or small the amount.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Whether it's toothpaste, toilet paper or money, you're going to use whatever amount you give yourself and make available to be consumed. So Mike's contention is that businesses and people alike should be taking a portion of funds out first (ie putting profit first) and dispensing them into accounts they cannot touch.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you are an entrepreneur,\u00a0when you get paid set up your account to automatically withdraw a percentage and put it into a retirement fund. If you're employed talk to your employer about your 401(k); get it set up so it automatically deducts money before you even see your paycheck. Based on Parkinson's Theory you'll learn to live off the amount that's leftover. But if you don't automate this you won't do it, you'll end up spending all the money that's available to you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Even if it seems like you can't afford to set aside any money right now Mike says to start with 1% of your paycheck. If you make $1k a week, then have 1% taken out. It's only $10, you won't even notice. But over time that money will start to add up in your retirement fund and soon you'll have far more wealth than you thought you could accrue.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">This is a fairly watered-down version of Mike's teachings so tune in to hear the full details straight from the source! And after you do, thank Mike for being here and gracing us with his priceless knowledge. And thank yourselves for being here (I do) and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS MIKE MICHALOWICZ!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Mike\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeMichalowicz\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Mike\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.mikemichalowicz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Michalowicz's web site<br /></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeMichalowicz\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Michalowicz\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><em><a href=\"http://profitfirstbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Profit First</a></em>, Mike Michalowicz' latest book<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SatoriPrime\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><em><a href=\"http://www.toiletpaperentrepreneur.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur</a></em>, Mike Michalowicz' first book<br /><em><a href=\"http://pumpkinplan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pumpkin Plan</a></em>, Mike Michalowicz' second book</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

Do you find yourself feeling like you're the low man on the totem pole in any (or maybe every) area of your life? Even if you answered no to both of those questions, you'll want to hear this episode with Oren Klaff author of\u00a0<em>Pitch Anything</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Oren helps people sell companies for a living. And not just any company, we're talking deals in $200 million range. Think that's not relevant to you? It is. High stakes, pressure-filled situations like the ones he's in magnify the buying behaviors in all of us. Whether you're asking a girl out, requesting a raise or pitching for funding for your latest business, you'll want to know what he knows. Listen in for all of that and so much more on\u00a0episode 347 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On this episode with Oren Klaff he dispels a few myths about the buyer behavioral process. For example, do you think you need to build rapport\u00a0with the person you're selling to? Nope, a waste of time and energy according to Oren. If you position yourself as the expert and authority on your service or product, and create a scarcity mentality in the buyer's mind you're well on your way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Let's look at how to raise your position to being a leader and an expert. Now bear in mind as we do this it'll be in a sales-type example, but if that doesn't apply to your job then reframe it to fit an area of your life where you do want better results (ie your relationships, your dating life).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">First off don't go into lengthy introductions at the beginning of your presentation. Your audience doesn't need to know about that mega-deal you did last year, they need to know your name and what you do currently. Keep the introductions brief, then get everyone's agreement to go full throttle into the presentation and discussion. When you do that, you're holding their attention.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">During your presentation keep it to 20 minutes or shorter, that is the absolute longest human beings can pay attention to anything in this type of setting. A person's attention span will not go longer than 20 minutes if you don't have their full buy in, such as in a sales setting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">During those twenty minutes you'll be able to frame what you have to offer them, you'll be showing them why what you have is the best and why you are the expert. This is your chance to elevate your status with them and also make them feel comfortable in the buying process. As the clock winds down you will raise the stakes and create scarcity in their minds about working with you and your product or service. Oren gives specific wording on how to do this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">At the heart of creating scarcity is this idea: what you have and what you provide expertise in is SO great that if your buyer doesn't get it, they will be diminished in some way. You must know that, believe it and feel it internally before you can create scarcity and tension during your pitch.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the topic of tension, Oren says this isn't something to avoid the way many of us do. Tension is what lets people know the stakes are high in this scenario. If you're talking to someone and there's no tension, they obviously don't value the topic you're talking about.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you're pitching something to them, they don't see the value in what you're pitching and they don't care if they get it or not. Without tension, the situation has no value. Naturally the amount of tension should be higher or lower depending on the scenario!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Oren and I go into greater detail on how to pitch anything and each of the above-mentioned topics on today's show. Even if you aren't in sales in your job or your business you're going to want to hear what he has to say, it's all pretty darn valuable.

So here to answer that question and to talk about the differences the live training Art of Charm programs have made in their lives are two single dads, Dave and Tom.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Even if you aren\u2019t a dad this episode is beneficial for you; you\u2019ll hear from two graduates about what their lives were like before doing an AOC training and what their lives were like after. They talk candidly and frankly about themselves, fatherhood and the AOC programs. Join us for all of that and more on the 345th episode\u00a0of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 14px; padding: 0px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal; font-family: BebasNeueRegular; color: #333333;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">As a listener of this show you most likely know we offer training programs, and if you haven\u2019t taken one yet you may be wondering if they\u2019re worth your time and effort. Rather than talking your ear off ourselves, we\u2019ve brought in two alumni to share what their personal experiences were.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Tom and Dave are both single dads who have taken some of our programs and they both faced similar difficulties before coming in: they weren\u2019t fully present with their kids, they had major difficulties in even talking with women, let alone dating and they generally were looking for better quality relationships than the ones they had.\u00a0So despite the significant challenges they both signed up and participated in our live programs.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">On today\u2019s episode Dave shares first about his before and after. He says he was incredibly negative and angry all the time, especially with his ex-wife. He allowed her to \u201cwalk all over him\u201d with their custodial arrangement of their daughter; she would be late when picking their daughter up after his visits, with no regard to the impact it was having on Dave. But Dave never said anything, he just reacted in a passive-aggressive manner which kept him in a negative, ticked off state around the clock.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">But after taking a course with the Art of Charm, Dave realized he needed to set and maintain better boundaries. And not just with ex, with every area of his life including work and his personal relationships. By doing small, simple things over a period of time he grew his confidence so he could set and maintain his boundaries. And he found the courage to have a vulnerable conversation with the mother of his child about how her actions were impacting his life. By being vulnerable with her, and doing it in a courageous way, they were able to calmly work out a better solution for everyone (especially their daughter).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">But that wasn\u2019t the only relationship that was positively impacted by Dave\u2019s newfound confidence. His relationship with his daughter changed for the better. He feels much more present when he\u2019s with her, he\u2019s able to give her his undivided attention and to be a strong, positive role model in her life. In response she has blossomed. She\u2019s become outgoing and now makes friends on her own, something she never did before.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Tom has had a similar impact in his own life. As the single dad of a now-teenage boy, Tom was initially floored by his ex-wife\u2019s request for a divorce. Once he got over his shock and dismay they were able to have a healthy relationship and able to easily share custody of their boy. But Tom wasn\u2019t at all prepared to\u00a0be a single dad.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Before working with The AOC, Tom was consistently worried he wasn\u2019t being a good enough father for his son. He was concerned he wasn\u2019t living up to his full potential and wasn\u2019t being a good example for his boy. And he didn\u2019t feel like he could really talk, connect and bond with his son to the extent he wanted to.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">For Tom having a deeper relationship with his son was so important because it was something he never had with his dad, Tom wanted to break the cycle and really be there for his young son. Since participating in The AOC programs Tom is happy to report he and his son take many adventures together, and talk about everything even vulnerable and delicate subjects. Tom is more confident with his son and he\u2019s more confident in public, something his boy has noticed and even commented on.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">One thing they both agree on is they are now able to ask for what they want. They no longer act in passive-aggressive ways, they are clear in their communication with everyone from business partners and colleagues to the women they date.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">On the topic of dating they both feel far more confident in connecting and dating then they ever have before. Dave says before the program he had gotten 2 women\u2019s numbers in 4 years and now he could get 2 numbers just walking the down the street! And Tom had no clue about how to date after his divorce, but today he\u2019s learned how to chat with a woman and find out if she\u2019s someone he\u2019d want to have a relationship with.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Tom and Dave also discuss the impact these programs have had on their friendships and their general quality of life, have a listen to get the full download!\u00a0This is a terrific episode for any of you who are single dads, might become fathers or have been thinking about signing up for one of our live training programs.

Here to answer these questions is Shawn Achor, Ted Talk speaker, Harvard professor, positive psychology expert and author of\u00a0<em>The Happiness Advantage</em>.\u00a0Not only does he answer these questions (and more), he also provides the science to back up those answers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On this episode we'll discuss why happiness is such an advantage in every area of life, as well as some simple happiness hacks you can practice right now. Listen in for all of that and so much more on\u00a0episode 344 of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Shawn Achor is the leading expert on positive psychology; he won over a dozen awards for his teaching at Harvard on this topic (his class was the most popular at the university), he's also written several best-selling books including\u00a0<em>The Happiness Advantage</em>, has been featured in\u00a0<em>The Harvard Business Review</em>\u00a0and even had a two-hour interview with Oprah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But today's episode isn't about what he's done, it's about what his research has discovered about the happiness advantage, and why happiness matters. The first thing to address is his definition of happiness. It's not mere pleasure like the enjoyment of a good dessert or the like. Happiness is the joy you feel as you are growing into your full potential. With a definition like that, it's much easier\u00a0to be an optimist.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">A study done with Metlife sales personnel as the subjects reflects the power of a positive attitude. They took two groups of people: in one group they hired optimists who scored low on the industry standard tests and in the other group they hired pessimists who scored high on the same tests. Within a year, the optimists had done 19% more in sales. Within 2 years they had done 57% more in sales!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It's not just sales that are impacted by attitude and outlook, optimists are consistently found to be more attractive, more trustworthy, better liked and are more likely to receive promotions at work. And the people around the optimists are found to be happier as well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The link between optimists and those around them being happier could lie in the science of mirror neurons, a subject we've talked about on the show before. Put simply mirror neurons are those neurons in our brain that influence our bodies to respond as a reflection to what's happening around us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Shawn gives us another study to explain the mirror neuron phenomenon. At its core the research showed that if you are near someone who is anxious, you will start to feel anxious. If that person is tired, you'll feel tired. The same is true of happiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Shawn also shares the brain functions that explain why happiness begets success, NOT the other way around. Achieving goals doesn't make us happier, because when we achieve those goals our brain automatically creates another goal or definition of success. Now that you've gotten that big promotion, your brain automatically redefines success as the next promotion, the next \"get\". So instead of focusing on achieving something to make you happy, embrace the definition of happiness Shawn gives and success will naturally follow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In fact, Shawn's research has shown that if you find ways of raising your optimism and happiness, EVERY area of your life will be more successful and your happiness will continually increase through your life making you happier and healthier. But if you pin your happiness to a specific goal or set of goals, your happiness levels will flatline.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We got into greater detail on all of this and more in this episode of the show, and we wrap with 5 happiness hacks you can incorporate right now to bump up your optimism levels. Shawn says you don't have to do all five, just choosing one will make an impact. All five are simple, they vary from journaling to emailing to meditating, and only take a few minutes a day. To hear the five and the rest of our fascinating discussion, listen in to the full show.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After you do please join me in thanking Shawn for sharing his positive outlook, his vast scientific knowledge and the practical application of that knowledge.\u00a0Thank you for listening, I appreciate each and every one of you!

Today we talk about how to reach out and connect with the greatest influencers in your life, and how to set the stage for potential friendships and real connection.\u00a0Join us for the 342nd edition\u00a0of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">As the founder of Live Your Legend (LYL) and Ted Talk presenter, Scott knows a few things about helping people find and express who they really are in the world. One of the keys to doing that, he's found, is connecting with the right people and surrounding yourself with your greatest allies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Originally LYL\u00a0started out as career/business tools-type company but as Scott says in this episode, all the best tools in the world aren't going to do a thing for you if your friends are telling you're an idiot for using those tools. So he shifted gears and changed the focus of his organization.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's show he shares the best practices for connecting and creating friendships with people you admire and people who are going to bring out the best in you. If you don't have those kinds of people in your life right now and you want to expand your social circle, Scott has advice for you. His first suggestion may seem counterintuitive, he says to not go to a networking event.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Instead, take a look at the people in your life right now and see who you admire and inspires you, and then find someone who brings you down. This next week choice to trade out time with the energy vampire for the person you admire. If that person you admire is someone you know personally invite them to\u00a0get together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Find some way to add value to them, obviously it's easier if they are already your friend you can simply ask them. But if you don't know them yet, do your research and find out what they may need help with right now. Always remember you do have something to offer to other people, even those who seem to have everything, you simply may have to find a creative way to help. It may be as simple as sharing with them what you're good at and then asking how you can apply your talents to help them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you feel nervous about talking with them or initiating contact simply imagine they are your best friend, and you just haven't chatted yet. Scott gives us a great example of how he did this when a well-known blogger moved to his area. The blogger invited about 50 people to meet up and chat when he settled in. Scott knew he'd only have a minute or two to chat with the blogger, who had been very influential for him, so he wanted to make it count.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Scott knew the blogger and his wife were vegans and he also knew the blogger was an avid runner. So he compiled a list of vegan restaurants in the area and a list of the best local running trails. He chatted with the blogger, thanked the man for being such an influence in his life and then handed him the suggestions he'd gathered. The blogger was so touched he invited Scott out for a run, that run led to the two becoming friends and running an ultra-marathon together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Whether or not you meet your new BFF this way, you can still apply the same principles.

As the joke goes \"We'd rather be IN the casket than giving the eulogy at a funeral.\" But if you're wanting to face that, or are in a position where you must face that fear, today's chat with David Nihill will\u00a0give you some tools you can use to overcome your fear and give a great presentation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Not long ago David was rubbish at public speaking, he dropped far too many F bombs and was generally a nervous, sweaty mess. When one of his friends suffered a severe spinal cord injury David wanted to help raise funds. He suggested organizing a comedy show with top comedians as a fundraiser and the idea took off. The only glitch? David's friend insisted he give the opening speech, and David was petrified.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Instead of backing down from the challenge, David emulated one of his mentors Tim Ferriss and rose to the occasion. He took a very Tim-like approach to the subjects\u00a0of comedy and\u00a0public speaking. He wanted to break down the best speeches and comedic routines to figure out how he could follow in their footsteps. Were there common processes for both? Did the two overlap and if they did, how could he fuse them together to make his opening speech funny and well-received at his friend's fundraiser?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">David went through a laborious and intensive study, and it paid off. His opening for the fundraiser was well-received, so much so that he was invited to open for a group of comedians at The Punch Line\u00a0in San Francisco.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And that opened a new door for him. Today he has performed comedy routines at some of the top comedy clubs in California, he held the first Funny Bizz conference in 2014 and has just published his first book\u00a0<em>7 Comedy Habits to Be a Funnier Speaker</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's show David explains a few of the many lessons he's learned about public speaking and comedy. The first topic we touch on is how to use humor in your presentations and speeches. Humor is the easiest way for others to relate to you, so use it early on in your speech to connect with your audience. If you're coming to their town learn something about the city you're in and use it humorously to show your audience you care about where they live and what their lives are like there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Humor also makes your speech or presentation memorable;it\u00a0accomplishes this by breaking down barriers between you and them. If you can break down those barriers and make people\u00a0laugh, they\u00a0will remember you and will be talking about you long after you've finished speaking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">All of that is well and good but how do you make people laugh? Is there a formula or a process we can take from comedy and apply to public speaking? There are several and we go into each of them on this episode; the one we'll discuss here is evaluating your performance. The best public speakers and the best comedians all evaluate themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Yes it's awkward, uncomfortable and unpleasant, but it is how anyone improves anything they do (especially public speaking and stand up comedy). So record yourself and dissect what you do, how you do it. Look at what worked, what didn't work, trim out everything you can and hone in on the good stuff. Get a coach to help you if you can.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">David dishes out other ways we can make our speeches and presentations funny and memorable including using the art of the callback and the rule of 3.\u00a0So tune in to hear all of that and more, then join me in thanking him for the laughs and the learning. He was an awesome guest and you're awesome for listening.

Long gone are the days of working for one or perhaps two companies in your lifetime. Now most people will work in at least 3 different\u00a0<strong>careers</strong>\u00a0in their lifetimes, some of us will work in as many as six! And note that says\u00a0<em>careers</em>, not jobs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you're like millions of others trying to get a leg up on the fierce competition in the marketplace, we've brought in Dan Schawbel to talk about how. Dan is the author of Promote Yourself, and that's exactly the topic we dive into today. Dan shares the facts, figures and suggestions he has for the best ways to promote yourself and stay relevant in the workforce today. All of that and more on the 338th episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dan Schawbel has made a successful living by studying what other people do for theirs. He has specifically studied the millenium generation, otherwise known as Generation Y or The Millenials. But he's discovered some interesting facts and applicable information for everyone along the way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For example when it comes to your ability to promote yourself and stay relevant in the workplace, Dan suggests zagging when everyone else is zigging. What does that mean exactly? The current trend is for most people to bounce to another company in order to be promoted or earn more money, there isn't much loyalty anymore. And Dan says you can capitalize on that by staying put and developing a strategy to make yourself indispensable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The first one is fairly easy to do: generally it's easier to stay where we are than to find a new job. But not all of us have a strategy to make us indispensable, and to be sure the company we're working for keeps us around and that we're also top of mind for promotions. Dan shares how to do this on today's episode.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">His first suggestion is master your current role. Do the job you've been hired to do and do it well, do it to the best of your abilities. Often this will take you at least the first six months you're in a new position. Dan says you can't stand out until you've done what you've been hired to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Once you've done that, then you can ask for more work, ask for that special project, offer to pitch in to help others in new areas outside of the scope of your job. This is also when you start presenting ideas for new opportunities for work. Do you see any area where the company could be more efficient, some way you can help the company make more money in an area? Now you can create a presentation and pitch it to your boss. But you can only do this once you've shown you are competent at your job, otherwise no one will take you seriously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another great way to promote yourself is to join special interest groups outside of work. Are you intrigued by marketing? Then join up a marketing meetup group or join a local branch of a marketing association. Find a conference you can attend on a weekend about the topic you are interested in, and then bring that information back to your job. You'll find useful ways to apply yourself in your role when you do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Though we discuss many other topics, one final subject we'll touch on here is the necessity of soft skills. Nearly every recruiter and headhunter out there wants someone with great soft skills. They want to know you can work well with others, you're a team player and will enhance the company overall with a good attitude, cooperation and team work.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dan and I discuss other useful suggestions he has for staying relevant and making yourself someone your company can't live without. He gives us specifics on how to promote yourself through tracking the metrics of your successes and why growing your network will ensure you're never without job offers.\u00a0It was great\u00a0to have him on the show, please join me in thanking him and thank you for being here too.

He is looked to as a thought leader in marketing, communications and entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's episode he shares his thoughts on the creative process, what it means to be in \"the dip\" and how to succeed in business without having an exclusive focus on the bottom line.\u00a0Listen in for details on all of that and so much more on the 336th episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Believe it or not there was a span of time when Seth Godin struggled. In fact, he says he spent 8 years teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. But living on that edge so precariously for that long brought him tremendous insights and experiences, many of which he shares on this episode.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of those experiences he shares with us is how he managed to cope and thrive from rejection. In his first year in the book business he was rejected 800 times! And he learned to see it in the best possible light: each rejection was a step closer to a yes and\u00a0he was very willing to be bad until he was very good. Those rejections helped him get better until he became great.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On a similar note we discuss why he says quitting and failing are not the same thing. Seth wrote\u00a0<em>The Dip</em>\u00a0to help us have mature, intelligent conversations about quitting. He believes you have to be willing to quit everything else\u00a0in order to be the very best in the world at one thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Too often today we don't quit to focus on that one thing, we become mediocre at many things. And none of us really want mediocre! We don't go on the Internet to buy from the most mediocre person we can find. We want the best from the very best.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In order to become the very best and quit everything else, we also have to set parameters for our quitting. When we take on a new project or a new business we have to decide at what point we will quit, and then actually quit if/when we reach it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For example if you start a new business and you decide you will quit when you have spent the $10k you currently have set aside on that business, then you must quit when that $10k is gone (and the business isn't working). Don't burn through the $10k, have a failing business and then go mortgage your house to keep going. Set the circumstances ahead of time and then honor them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But while some paths do endure The Dip, yet others are simply dead ends. Seth suggests if you are a budding entrepreneur you should follow a path that's been trodden successfully in the past. Learn from those who have gone before you and have succeeded, figure out when you're in The Dip and ride through it.

Rarely do they think of value creation, which is what our guest for today says is at the very heart of being an entrepreneur.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Joining us for episode 335 is self-made multi-millionaire and value creator Pejman Ghadimi. Today he shares his personal story of how he became financially independent by 25\u00a0as well as \"Secret Entourage\" and third circle theory, the name of his company and the title of his latest book. Listen in for details on all of that and so much more on this\u00a0episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Pejman Ghadimi learned to face challenging circumstances at a very early age. His family was forced to flee when the Iranian ruler was overthrown; his family had been working for the Shah and had to leave or face persecution. \u00a0Believing the US was the best place for her son, Pejman's mother tried in vain to be allowed into the States for the next year 10 years. She raised him in France, built a successful business and provided him with a stable, happy home.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After 10 years of trying she was finally granted a tourist visa. She had a choice: either visit the US and come back to the life she had created for them, or sell everything and take a huge risk to settle in the US. Pejman's uncle lived in Los Angeles and said he could help her extend her visa and eventually settle there, if that was what she wanted.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So she sold as much of their belongings as she could, basically left her business and moved them to the US just a few short weeks after being granted a visitor's visa. It began a new chapter for Pejman and his mom. They had no social security numbers and no way to be hired by the usual means. So Pejman hustled, he took whatever job he could find including delivering pizzas on his bicycle in the \"hood\"!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But he learned what it meant to lay it all on the line and to look at every opening as an opportunity, often where others wouldn't. He found work with a telemarketing company, a job most people would hate, and he found a way to succeed after an initial struggle in the position. So much so in fact that by the age of 18 he was in a management role.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He parlayed that success into the banking industry before going out on his own. In this episode he shares exactly how he approached a grocery store branch of a bank and landed his first banking job which would lead to being a branch manager before the age of 25. Along the way he started several other companies on the side which continue to be successful today. When he talks about all of these roles and his experiences, he explains how his perspective and his actions have determined his success and how he has not allowed circumstances to slow him down or defeat him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also discuss his third circle theory, the name of his company and his most recent book. He goes into the theory in greater detail on the show, but in essence the three circles are circumstances, society and life. Each of them rely on mastery of the previous circle to advance to the next.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When we learn circumstances can be overcome then we can advance to the level of society mastery, where we discover how to show society we have advanced. We succeed in our jobs, we become wealthy and show others circumstances haven't stopped us. At that point we can move to the level of life mastery, this is where legacy becomes important. We are concerned with mastering life by giving our greatest gifts to the world.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One additional topic we discuss is what entrepreneurship is at its heart: value creation. All of us have a degree of entrepreneurial spirit within us, some of us choose to follow it and express it through our career while others don't. Yet all of us can create value for the world, and the byproduct of that value is monetary gain.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Pejman explains that in more detail, along with so much more on today's episode. It was an honor to have him here on the show! Please join me in thanking him for sharing his personal journey and his sage-like advice, and thank you for being here too. Enjoy the episode and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS PEJMAN GHADIMI!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Pejman Ghadimi know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretEntourage\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Pejman\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.pejmanghadimi.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Pejman Ghadimi's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.secretentourage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Secret Entourage</a><a href=\"http://psych.unm.edu/people/directory-profiles/geoffrey-miller.html\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://www.secretentourage.com/store/third_circle_theory/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Third Circle Theory</em></a>, Pejman Ghadimi's\u00a0latest book<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretEntourage\" target=\"_blank\">Pejman Ghadimi\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

It seems to be a question men have asked themselves and have been trying to answer for centuries. If you're tired of wondering and you want actual answers to help you better understand, connect and have quality relationships with women then have a listen to today's show.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Our guest is Dr. Geoff Miller, is evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico-Albuquerque and author of several books including\u00a0<em>The Mating Mind</em>. Presently he is teaming up with Tucker Max to produce podcast episodes for\u00a0<em>Mating Grounds</em>\u00a0and a book on the same subject: understanding what women want and how to give it to them.\u00a0Listen in for details on all of that and so much more on the 334th episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To understand what Dr. Miller shares in today's episode it's helpful to understand his background and his line of studies. He is an evolutionary psychologist which means he spends his time understanding topics like human sexuality, mate choice, and human emotions to name a few. He says he has long been fascinated by women's psychology and why women chose the men they do and the links those choices have to our history as humans.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And one common thread he has found is that attraction transcends all other boundaries, certain ways of attracting a mate are not exclusive to particular cultures and countries. It is primal and instinctive within humans. Attraction doesn't have a secret language, anyone can learn it and use it wherever they live.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We get into several useful applications of mating behavior in this episode, the first of which is the body types women are most attracted to. Dr. Miller says women in general find tall and lean men most attractive, they want the Olympic swimmer-type look. They prefer men who look capable and athletic, but still have some body fat so long as it's not abdominal fat which women are turned off by.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So why does it seem like women like the super-buff gym rats? During their most fertile times of the month women find more masculine traits attractive, like big muscles. You can use this to your advantage if you aren't a big muscle guy. If a girl says no when you ask her out one week, try again the next week. It could just be where she is in her cycle.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another fascinating topic we dive into is how to know when a woman is at her most fertile. It seems men know this on a subconscious level, Dr. Miller gives us an example of a study done that showed women who were professional lap dancers made more money during their peak ovulation times (ie their most fertile time of the month) then they did at another time of the month.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But if the woman you have your eye on isn't a lap dancer, there are other cues you can look for. You'll need to know her a bit for this but watch how she dresses. It's been scientifically shown that women who are closest to their peak fertile times will dress more provocatively, wear red, wear lipstick or more makeup than usual and will wear more jewelry than usual. Sort of \"peacocking\" female-style that seems to happen about 10-14 days into her cycle.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dr. Geoff also explains a woman's cycle and the time of the month when she will generally be most fertile. He gives us reasons why we as men need to know about hormonal birth control and how it impacts a woman's choice in a man - there is scientific evidence that shows women on hormonal birth control choose different man than if they are not using hormones. An important lesson to know whether you're dating or in a relationship.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He also gives us tips on how to attract women whether we're wealthy or poor, the important role language plays in dating and mating, and what we should be focusing on to attract quality women (and it's not more time in the gym!). It was a pleasure to have Dr. Miller on the show, I want to thank him for joining us and to thank you for being here too.

Think again. In today's workplace we all have a personal brand, and too few of us are managing it. So says our guest for today's show, Dorie Clark.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dorie is the author of\u00a0<em>Reinventing You</em>, a former presidential campaign spokeswoman and regular contributor to Harvard Business Review, Forbes and Entrepreneur magazine. Today we cover what a personal brand is, how to discover yours and recreate it to your liking, the wingman strategy and\u00a0so much more on the 333rd episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">While you may not think you have or even need a personal brand, today's workplace demands it. Long gone are the days of working for one company for the duration of your career. The working world is in the midst of a new era, a world\u00a0where workers are a commodity and you have to set yourself apart from the rest. And the best way to do so is through your personal brand.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dorie Clark says to manage and truly benefit from your personal brand you first need to understand what a personal brand is, then find out what yours is and then either recreate it or find ways to bridge the gap between your personal brand as it stands today and the personal brand you want to be in the world.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the first point she says a personal brand is what people say about you when you're not in the room, it's what you leave people with. Your personal brand is synonymous with your reputation and it acts as career insurance. No longer can we rely on loyalty and mentorship to bring us up through a company's ranks. Often our mentors are let go or leave for a different position and if we've solely relied on them to teach us and spread the word about who we are and what we're committed to, we're left in the lurch when they go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To avoid being in that position, Dorie says to find out what your personal brand is and then either reinvent yourself if you don't like it or bridge the gap between what your brand is today and where you want it to take you tomorrow. An easy way to discover your personal brand is by asking at least six people close to you (family, friends, co-workers including your boss) the three words they'd use to describe you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When you do so it'll be revealing and you'll see patterns. Take stock of those patterns and then start to think about where you want to go. Envision it and get clear, then create a narrative about it so you can explain to people how your past matches up to the current opportunity you're either working on or working towards.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Once you've done that, take the necessary steps to move you from your place today to your vision of tomorrow. According to Dorie this approach, actually working on your personal brand,\u00a0gives you a significant advantage over almost everyone\u00a0else and is worth your effort.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dorie also fills us in on the wingman strategy. A lot of you may know this as it applies to dating, but Dorie says we can use it in the business world as well. Wherever you use this strategy it works in the same way. You and a friend attend an event together (dating or work-related) and while you're talking with others, you bring up your friend's most salient and relevant points during the conversation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">By doing so you're giving them status in the other person's eyes, then\u00a0later you introduce your friend to the person you mentioned them to. It works best if you know who you want to meet prior to or at the beginning of the event, and then you team up to meet each other's interests. It's a relevant strategy we've discussed on the show, and it also works exceptionally well in a networking environment!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dorie\u00a0provides additional insightful strategies and relevant strategies on this episode, including how to command respect and attention\u00a0<em>before</em>\u00a0you attend a meeting (even if no one knows you) and the most common mistake most people make in their personal branding.\u00a0It was a pleasure to have Dorie\u00a0on the show, I want to thank her for joining us and to thank you for being here too. Enjoy the episode and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS DORIE!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of The Art of Charm Podcast, let Dorie know by clicking on the link below and sending her a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dorieclark\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Dorie\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://dorieclark.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dorie Clark's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://dorieclark.com/reinventingyou/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reinventing You</em></a>, Dorie Clark's\u00a0latest book<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dorieclark\" target=\"_blank\">Dorie Clark\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Wanna leave a comment?

What would you try out and what do you think you could learn? Our guest for episode 332 has done this several times and discovered so much through each experiment. AJ Jacobs is a four-time\u00a0<em>New York Times</em>\u00a0best-selling author who has used his life as an experiment on several occasions, and then written about it to share with all of us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For example, he once spent a year living life according to the rules of the Bible! He has also tried to become the healthiest person alive, the smartest person alive and many other adventures. \u00a0AJ is here to talk about those experiment adventures and so much more on the 332nd episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">AJ Jacobs has experienced many things in his life, most of which we never will. He once stoned an adulterer in Central Park; he's read the encyclopedia from A to Z and he followed George Washington's 101 rules for living with civility. Instead of following in his footsteps, we can live vicariously through him by reading his books and listening to today's episode.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Aside from stoning an adulterer (it was not as violent as it sounds), AJ gained a lot from his year of living biblically. One of the most profound lessons he learned was the lesson of gratitude. One of the Bible's rules is to give thanks and he found himself giving thanks hundreds of times a day. He'd be thankful the elevator took him to the proper floor and that it didn't fall to the basement. Finding things to give thanks for made him a happier person overall.\u00a0We also talk about how to use the Song of Solomon from the Bible to get dates!</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After his year of living according to the Bible, he joined the ranks of most of us in treating religion like a cafeteria. He took the rules that made him happiest and followed those. AJ says we all do this to some degree; we pick and choose which rules to live by and which don't serve us, even the most conservative among us does this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On that same note of picking and choosing, AJ talks about our information diet and how to more carefully watch what we are consuming every day. His general rule of thumb is if something doesn't make him happier, he limits or removes it from his information diet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">AJ gives us a personal example: he has a tendency to read about rare diseases or disorders on the Internet and he's found doing so leads him down a dark hole, so he has stopped doing this.

He has studied some of the greatest achievers in history and he's noted this about their success: they had to fail A LOT in order to have the successes they did.

What projects would you start, what relationships would you enrich and which would you let go of?\u00a0These two words became the motto for this episode's guest few years ago and they had such an impact that he decided to write a book on the topic.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Todd Henry, author of\u00a0<em>Die Empty</em>, joins us to talk about the value of going to college or not going, the deadly sins of mediocrity, how to avoid becoming mediocre or get yourself out of that rut if you're already in it...and so much more on the 331st episode of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Todd Henry is the best-selling author behind such notable books as\u00a0<em>The Accidental Creative</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Die Empty</em>. He's also the man behind The Accidental Creative podcast and a consultant who helps companies create more effectively. He calls himself \"an arms dealer for the creative revolution\"!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">His \"arms dealings\"\u00a0originally stem from the assistance he offered his friends, they were people who worked in large companies but often struggled\u00a0with how to create effectively in their jobs. He called them Accidental Creatives because they didn't see themselves as creative types but they were still working their way through the creative process. The name stuck and later became the title of his first book.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But Todd was most strongly influenced by two words he later stumbled upon, die empty. He felt these words had meaning not just for him, but for everyone. They were the keys to living a full, rich life and shaking off the dulling effects of mediocrity. He published a book called\u00a0<em>Die Empty</em>\u00a0and talks at length in this episode about how to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He discusses the 7 deadly sins of mediocrity in that book and in this episode we hone in on the first: aimlessness. He says mediocrity is combined from two other root words: medius and ocris. Medius meaning middle and ocris meaning rugged mountain; mediocre means to stop halfway up the rugged mountain.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Many people do this by becoming comfortable where they are and never moving beyond that position, never challenging themselves further.<br />Aimlessness is one of the reasons, one of the deadly sins that causes this. Aimlessness happens when someone loses sight of their true passion and connection to their passion project, they get stuck as a result.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Todd says we can avoid this the same way he does: by following EMPTY which stands for Ethic Mission People Tasks You. Here's a breakdown of what each of those words in empty stand for:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Ethic</strong>\u00a0means asking yourself how do I engage in work every day? What do I bring to my\u00a0work on a daily basis?<br /><strong>Mission</strong>\u00a0means\u00a0applying your productive passion and understanding the thing you're really trying to do. It's the ultimate outcome you're committed to.<br /><strong>People</strong>\u00a0relates to\u00a0the people in your life you have to interact with. how can you build relationships into your life that are stimulating, challenging and cause me to see the world in new ways?<br /><strong>Tasks</strong>\u00a0are the tasks if you accomplish them this week they would make it successful in your mind.<br /><strong>You</strong>\u00a0represents yourself and how you care for yourself. What self-care do you make a priority in your life? And are you developing discipline for intentional growth for yourself?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And finally Todd gives us some specific ways we can implement his advice immediately. The first thing he suggests is to form of circle of 5-7 people you meet with once a month. The goal of your group is to get together and talk about work you're doing, your aspirations, what you're planning to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Todd offers more actionable advice along with his thoughts on the pros and cons of college, how he's educating his children and tons more!\u00a0It was a pleasure to have Todd\u00a0on the show, I want to thank him for joining us and to thank you for being here too.

At the Art of Charm we stand on the belief that men are far more than just \"alpha tough guys\" or \"beta door mats\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And today Scott Kaufman, Scientific Director at the Imagination Institute and author of\u00a0<em>Mating Intelligence Unleashed</em>, shares the science behind that belief. On this episode, we talk about why the \"alpha-beta\" thing is far too simplistic, what the dark triad/bad boy thing is all about, and why assertiveness, kindness and humor are some of the most attractive traits to women ...all of that and so much more!</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When it comes to the alpha vs beta showdown, Scott Kaufman sees neither as being the ultimate for an ideal male. He says there are really two paths for men:\u00a0dominance or authentic. The dominance path is the one we typically associate with the alpha male: aggressive, arrogant, unstable ego and underneath the bravado, insecurity.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And on the authentic path is the type of men we strive create through our work at The Art of Charm: well-earned accomplishments, positive mental health, conscientious, satisfying personal relationships, and genuine self-esteem based on knowing yourself to be a person of value. Contrary to the pop culture definition, Scott says an alpha male is really a man who has cultivated these skills and uses them appropriately.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another misnomer in today's society is that women love the bad boy. While it may be true that the \"bad boy\" racks up more sexual partners, scientific studies indicate that quantity of sexual partners does not necessarily indicate higher levels of personal happiness. That's why you'll often hear men who've bed high numbers of women later lament they still weren't happy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Those men who end up with such high volume of sexual partners also often score high in the Dark Triad, not an affiliation you'd want. The Dark Triad is made up of three pillars: Machiavellian tendencies, narcissism and psychopathy. They are more likely to scheme and manipulate anyone to get what they want, sex or otherwise. The short-term strategies they use are effective in generating multiple partners, but not in cultivating relationships that are meaningful, fulfilling or long-lasting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To do that, Scott says to focus on what science and studies have shown women actually want: an assertive, kind and funny man. The assertive man asks for what he wants, shares what his needs and desires are\u00a0without demanding them or having them fulfilled at the expense of others.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Kindness may seem like an obvious trait, but often men are concerned about coming off as doormats by being kind to others. Scott provided some useful suggestions in the show as well as meditations which are linked in the Resources section below.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And lastly, on the topic of humor, Scott talks about several studies that highlight women do want men who make them laugh. But also if you're in a group of women and you make one of them laugh, she's the one you hone in on. Science proves that if a woman is already laughing at your jokes, she finds you attractive! A woman will not laugh at a man's jokes (no matter how funny they are) if she doesn't think he's attractive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Laughter is also a great indicator of the potential long-term success of a relationship.\u00a0The couples who stay together longer are those who laugh together. The best pairing here is a man who crack jokes plus a woman who laughs at his jokes, that combination has the most potential for staying together the longest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Scott and I also talk about the role vulnerability and creativity both play in attraction, and so much other great info!

Probably an incredibly different place than it does today. One person helping us move in that direction is our guest for episode 328, Dr. Guy Winch.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Guy is the author of\u00a0<em>Emotional First Aid</em>; he also has a PhD and has been a trained psychologist for over 20 years. On this episode he discusses why numbing ourselves to pain doesn't help, the high health risks of loneliness, and what healthy habits to adopt in times of emotional distress...all of that and so much more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For over two decades, Guy has been a trained psychologist listening to what people talk about their experiences, and even more importantly, their own self-talk about those experiences. Along the way he's formed opinions and hypotheses in his field; before he shares those opinions, he researches the science that supports or disputes his opinions and he adapts from there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of the fundamentals he stands on however is people's need to treat themselves emotionally and to provide their own emotional first aid for their wounds. Very few of us are taught how to take care of our hurts and our suffering; we're all taught how to care for our skinned knees or sprained ankles, but rarely are we taught how to care for our emotions after we've been rejected.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Instead of taking care of our wounds, we often numb ourselves to the pain with alcohol, other recreational drugs, video games, sex or food. Guy says these things don't help us when we try to come back and address that area of our lives. If someone dumps us and we spend three weeks numbed out playing the latest WoW, we are going to have a tough go of it when we try to date again because we've spent three weeks avoiding the pain rather than coping with it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But those of us who obsess over a situation aren't any better off either. If we focus on replaying and replaying the break-up in our heads we are doing even more damage the actual experience did. We're physically re-creating the pain for ourselves by mentally reliving it. As a species we're hard-wired to feel even the slightest bit of rejection; Guy shares the study that discusses how MRIs show the same parts of our brains are activated by physical pain AND emotional pain.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Instead of obsessing over a rejection or numbing ourselves to it, Guy offers a few tips. The first of which is to be aware and understand what's happening. Now that you know emotional and physical pain are experienced in the body in much the same way, you can stop beating yourself up for feeling bad about the experience. You're human, you're supposed to feel what you're feeling!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The second suggestion he has is a useful tool to boost your self-esteem when you're suffering. This is particularly helpful if you've just gone through a break-up or a significant rejection of some kind. Spend a few minutes writing 10-15 things you're good at. So if you've just been dumped, write 10-15 qualities that make you great in a relationship. For example: you're a good cook, a good listener, you have a great sense of humor, etc. Write those 10-15 things down.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Then pick just one of them and write for 10 minutes about why that quality is important and how you'll exhibit it in future relationships. You have to write it down, this isn't useful if you just think about it so be sure to spend 15 minutes doing this exercise. Doing so will help you feel better about what you bring to the table and will\u00a0boost your self-esteem at a time when you really need it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Guy and I discuss several more topics (including the health risks of loneliness and numerous studies highlighting the importance of emotional first aid), one final area worth mentioning here is how to approach failure. If we can experience a failure and examine where we could have done better and where we can improve for next time, we have a much higher chance of tackling future challenges rather than simply giving up. There are always things within your control in a situation, even when you've failed, and if you can pinpoint those and how you can adjust the next time around there's a much higher chance you'll actually pursue a \"next time around\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Guy was a terrific guest who\u00a0generously shares so much of his 20+ years of psychology experience and knowledge with us in this episode, have a listen to hear it all!

Maybe the last of those three pops to mind but certainly the first two don't! And that is what makes our guest for episode 327 so interesting. Dandapani is a Hindu monk who lived in a Hawaiian monastery where they gave him a MacBook Pro and he spent some of his time coding websites!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's show we talk about his origin story as a monk, how to keep children from sucking the energy out your relationship and what to do about energy vampires...all of that and so much more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dandapani knew he wanted to be a monk since the age of 4. And he spent years looking for a teacher he connected with. He found many along the way, but none were the ideal match until he was a sophomore in college. He loved how practical and down to earth this particular teacher was and so when he told Dandapani to finish his engineering degree before joining his monastery, that's what he did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The moment he knew he had passed all of his exams and had completed his degree, Dandapani was on a flight to Hawaii. For the next 10 years he lived a life of celibacy and technology. He says his guru believed in bringing their teachings to the world, not through stone tablets, but through electronic tablets and web sites.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So that's what the monks did: they built web sites, they learned a myriad of technology tools like Adobe products, Final Cut Pro, audio editing software, etc. And if that wasn't unconventional enough, they also watched 30 minutes of the news every day to keep them in touch with the world. Of course they also performed their daily chores and meditated, but only an hour of meditation per day and not the entire day like some orders.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dandapani learned a tremendous amount from his time with the order. When his 10 years were up, he left and returned to the mainland of the US (and not his home in Sri Lanka). He spent a year transitioning\u00a0into \"real life\" and then moved to New York City with his wife where they now live.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Although they don't have children yet, Dandapani has sage words for anyone who does on how to keep their marriage or relationship in tact while raising a family. He believes in what he calls \"an energy hierarchy\" and that if you follow his hierarchy, you will be able to stay connected to your significant other through the ups and downs of family life and you won't lose your relationship to your children's lives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In his hierarchy, you come first. That means you have to take care of yourself first, so you then have energy to give to your spouse who is next on the list. Children come in third. And why is this? Because typically if you take care of you and your spouse before your kids, you'll have the energy necessary to take care of them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the subject of energy, Dandapani also had valuable advice on how to deal with energy vampires. He says 99% of the people he speaks with say they have energy vampires in their lives, but all too often we don't have the courage to address the issue. Once a year he sits down and assesses his relationships. He looks at who is an energy vampire in his life and then asks whether this is their natural way of being or are they simply going through a rough patch right now. If it's just a rough patch he never breaks ties with them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But if the person seems to just be depressed and negative on the whole, he finds a way to either minimize contact with them or to stop communicating with them entirely. He calls this affectionate detachment and in this episode he shares when and how to use it. One tip he gives us is to avoid communicating your stance with the energy vampire(s) in your life; you don't need to tell them you're cutting them out of your lives whenever possible because that simply instigates more negative conversation from them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dandapani has quite a few additional suggestions and practical advice he generously shares with us in this episode, have a listen to hear it all!\u00a0I want to thank him\u00a0for joining us and to thank you for being here too.

What if they\u00a0had 10 billionaires in their Rolodex, would you listen then? That hypothetical person is our guest for today's show. \u00a0On episode 324 we're talking with and taking notes from Judy Robinett, a power connector, a giver and the author of\u00a0<em>How To Be a Power Connector.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We'll be discussing how to be a power connector, a life hack for connecting with people who have zero time, and what makes a quality relationship...and so much more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Judy Robinett knows what it's like to build a network. She wasn't born into powerful connections and in fact, she considers herself to be shy. To add to that, she lives in a small town in Idaho of less than 300 people so she's had to put in the time, effort and energy to build her Rolodex and be the power connector she is today.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And she's done that\u00a0by knowing the value of relationships and how to connect with people to build and solidify a relationship. She says it boils down to a few things, one of those being in the right room. What she means by that is putting yourself in the right place to connect with the right people. You have to connect and bond with people who are influential, wealthy and connected; and you have to know the right rooms to find them in.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Regardless of where you are in your life, Judy says you do have something to give to these people: your ability to listen. Everyone has a problem they need solved, but all too often we're consumed with our own lives and our own issues to actually listen to someone else and hear their problems. And listening to someone allows them to know, like and trust you. And when someone knows you and likes you and trusts you, they are far more likely to help you with your problems and to connect you with their sphere of influence.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you need a way to find these people, Judy recommends joining the symphony or joining a powerful organization as a volunteer. You have something to give and you have something to offer, find a place where you can give it and connect with influencers in the process.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another life hack all of us can use to connect with anyone, even the uber-busy successful millionaires and thought leaders of the world is to attend an event they're at, meet them and establish a bit of a rapport\u00a0before offering to drive them to the airport. They have to get to the airport somehow right?!\u00a0If you can take them there, you'll have their undivided attention and be able to chat with them one on one.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">By doing so, you're adding value to their lives and making things easier for them which are two key components to building a solid, robust and successful relationship. So whether you're driving someone to the airport or volunteering within their organization or simply listening, you're adding value and contributing to that person's life. And Judy says that is one of the most important ways to start a connection that will strengthen and add value to both of your networks and both of your lives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Judy had so much value to contribute in this episode! I really appreciated how generously she shared her knowledge and insights, and the real-life examples of being a power connector are particularly valuable. I want to thank Judy for joining us and to thank you for being here too.

However long you've been together, keeping your relationship with her fresh is key to its long-lasting success.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">A great example of something you can do on an everyday basis is to offer suggestions for your nights out. When you ask her what she wants for dinner, offer her a choice between two options. If she wants something else she'll tell you, otherwise she'll choose between the two offers you've given her. By providing two different possibilities, you're showing her you care about the experience of dinner together and also giving her room to contribute by making the final choice.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another important aspect to keeping your relationship fresh is to be vulnerable. Some simple ways to do this are to be silly around her. Do you dance and sing when you're alone, but stop the minute she walks in the room? Allow yourself to be silly and express yourself, she and everyone else will respond to your authentic passion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That ties into the 3 A's of relationships: acknowledge, accept, and appreciate. Acknowledge your partner's passions. Did she just love the new yoga class she took? Then acknowledge it, don't just nod your head and say \"that's cool\" without enthusiasm. Be genuinely interested in what was so great about it for her and then acknowledge it. This shows empathy which is what ultimately truly connects us to others in a deep, meaningful way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Next accept her passions, accept who she is. Does she love her pottery class but you have no interest in it? That's fine, you don't have to love what she loves in order to be successful together. Doing so shows you care about her and what matters to her. Be supportive and accept what she is passionate about, even if you aren't because that will make her feel good. And feeling good around you is key to relationships.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And finally there is appreciate. Appreciate when she shares valuable information with you and is vulnerable with you.\u00a0Expressing herself, sharing her thoughts and feelings with you is an act of vulnerability so appreciating and thanking her for doing so will go a long way to keeping you together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In addition to the 3 A's we dive into a few more topics, but one last one area we'll touch on here is how to break out of a rut. Justin gives us some simple methods to doing so. He recommends finding new restaurants to go to if you've been going to the same ones, go on a different hike than you've been on before, try a new activity together preferably something neither of you have done before. What it boils down to is doing something new together, it'll help reignite that spark you felt in your early days of dating or it'll help keep that spark alive if you're still honeymooning.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There's so much more we cover on this episode! It was a blast to chat about keeping relationships fresh and vulnerably sharing mistakes we've made in the past and things we're doing now in this area of our lives.\u00a0It was great to create this show for you and I hope you enjoy the episode!</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS AoC!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let us know by clicking on the link below and sending us a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheArtofCharm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Click here to thank The AOC</em><em>\u00a0on Twitter!</em></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox/\" target=\"_blank\">Previous Toolbox episodes</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheArtofCharm\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Charm\u00a0on Twitter</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/My-Secret-Garden-Nancy-Friday/dp/1416567011\" target=\"_blank\"><em>My Secret Garden</em></a>, by Nancy Friday<br /><a href=\"http://www.thrillist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Thrillist</a><br /><a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">Unencyclopedia</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><br />Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

A happiness expert. A hip hop artist. A CEO of a multi-million dollar company. Can you find the common thread? Maybe, maybe not. Our guest for episode 322 can; these are all types of people he has interviewed on his podcast,\u00a0<em>The Unmistakable Creative</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On\u00a0today's show Srinivas and I talk about\u00a0the current state and future of podcasting, why comparing yourself to others is a losing battle,\u00a0as well as the roles curiosity and creativity play in succeeding at business. Join us for all of that and so much more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Just a few short years ago, Srinivas was faced with the daunting task of finding work in a declining economy. He had just graduated business school and wanted to find work that would give him a creative outlet. He had had a social media internship but felt wholly unequipped to work in that field.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So he began experimenting. He started a web site, but quickly stopped when he couldn't deliver\u00a0on the topic of the site. Then he started a blog and started interviewing people. That experimentation eventually led to what is his podcast today,\u00a0<em>Unmistakable Creative</em>. The show gets over 10,000 downloads an episode and allows Srinivas to connect with some of the most innovative and interesting people in the world. As we mentioned earlier, he's interviewed a bank robber, happiness experts, behaviorists and super successful CEOs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The show has been so successful and has such a wide appeal is the varied guests but also Srinivas' approach to podcasting. He views it as a craft, an art form that must be invested in, worked on and molded into its finest form. To do this, he naturally analyzes his previous shows and looks at what to do better in the future, but he also turns off distractions and unplugs. Some of his greatest inspirations and breakthroughs have come through unrelated activities, like surfing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He also did an experiment where he spent 20 hours learning to do something he was terrible at: drawing. As a result of studying the art of drawing, he also saw the impact in his business. It's a practice he recommends to everyone: experiment with art and see where it takes you. Go out and sing, take an improv class and explore the new insights it gives you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Not only will art give you insights, it also provides a much-needed reprieve from our information-overload society. Srinivas has discovered the value in unplugging and being conscious of what information he's taking in, and he suggests everyone do the same. There is scientific evidence to support him; science has shown that our environment can and does have a significant impact on our overall well-being.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One final topic we discuss is the state of podcasting. We dive into the reasons why anyone doing an interview show needs to take the craft seriously and why it's important to cultivate relevant, interesting content (and why that is no small feat).\u00a0Even if you aren't a podcaster or an entrepreneur, we cultivate\u00a0relevant information for you in this show.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Srinivas was an interesting and insightful guest, please join me in thanking him for being on the show today.

But check back in a few weeks and a lot of them have changed their field of expertise. And that is not how to become a recognized leader according to our guest for episode 321.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">John Jantsch is the author of his latest book:\u00a0<em>Duct Tape Selling.</em>\u00a0He's also the head honcho of Duct Tape Marketing, a brand and business devoted to practical, systemized marketing for everyone from employee to business owner. And in today's episode we discuss why everyone needs a personal brand, a content creation platform and specialized skills in speaking. And why these three things are so important even if you don't have a business or want to have a business of your own. Join us for all of that and so much more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">John Jantsch has been called the world's most practical small business expert; he jokingly says all the other titles were taken and that's why he was given his moniker! But the truth is he is a practical expert and teacher for small businesses and employees alike. His practical teaching extends beyond small business to everyone when we discuss the necessity of a personal brand. John says branding isn't just for big companies or just for companies in general, it is for all of us. We must find something we stand for and take on a point of view, then share that viewpoint with the world.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">John's stance is practicality and his viewpoint has always been that marketing is a system. Others may teach and preach about the latest marketing technique, but John has always relied on his marketing system philosophy.\u00a0Doing so has served him well. He's a widely-known speaker and author, the latest being the book\u00a0<em>Duct Tape Selling</em>, but he also has penned three others. And he's been a podcaster since 2005 and a speaker even before then.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When you're establishing your brand and what you stand for, it's important to tap into something you truly believe in and to stick with it. Far too many people today are what he calls the \"six week expert\", meaning they find a new topic and for about 6 weeks (or even less in some cases), taught themselves as the latest and greatest source for anything and everything related to that topic.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Once you've found your thing, John recommends finding a platform to express yourself from. A blog is always an obvious choice since it's simple to get started and nearly anyone can do it. He also talks about the benefits of running a podcast and the access you can have to incredible thought leaders and experts, people you may not have been able to connect with otherwise. There are other platforms too, the important point here is to choose one and again, stick with it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another great topic John and I chat about is how valuable speaking is for anyone and everyone. Speaking is like social interaction on steroids, everything you do and every way you are being is magnified on stage. Plus it's incredibly beneficial to face a fear like public speaking and act, despite that fear.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To help overcome that fear, John gives us a terrific suggestion: \u00a0take an improv class. He says it's absolutely humbling but it's also one of the most useful activities he's ever done for himself and for his speaking abilities. It's something he encourages everyone to do, even if they aren't interested in becoming a public speaker.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One final suggestion he makes, another practical tip, is to turn our phones off for extended periods of time. He says it makes him exponentially more productive and reduces his distractions and recovery time from those distractions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Join me in thanking John for those useful tips as well as his practical insights on choosing a personal brand, sticking with your unique viewpoint and the importance of public speaking for everyone, whether an employee or a business owner. It was great to have him on the show and I hope you enjoy the episode!\u00a0Thanks for being here and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS JOHN!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let John know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ducttape\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank John on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://ducttapeselling.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Duct Tape Selling</em></a>,\u00a0John's latest book<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ducttape\" target=\"_blank\">John on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"https://feedly.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly<br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Joining us to give us insights on to why that is and how powerfully sound impacts every other aspect of our lives is Julian Treasure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Julian is a sound expert and Ted Talks speaker who helps people understand the importance of conscious listening. On episode 320, a few of the topics we touch on are\u00a0the four ways hearing touches you and impacts you, why the listening\u00a0stereotype about men has some truth to it (and what we can do about it) and how we can fix some poor listening and speaking habits. Join us for an interesting and informative show!</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">All of us are greatly impacted by sound in our lives, but few of us are fully conscious of it and even fewer of us are conscious listeners. When you walk into a store that's playing loud pop music notice how your body speeds up and actually wants you to get out of the store faster! Our guest for this episode says the retailer didn't take sound into consideration when they designed their store.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">This behavioral response is rooted in our body's\u00a0awareness of\u00a0sound: if it's loud, we move away from it and if it's quiet or soft and soothing, we slow down. There are three other ways our bodies respond to sound: physiological, psychological, and cognitive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When it comes to the physiological, our bodies will speed up or slow down according to the sounds we hear. If there's loud music like in a dance club, our heart rate quickens, and our blood pressure goes up. If we are listening to the sounds of the ocean, our heart rate slows down as does our blood pressure. Sounds can even change our hormone secretions, the sense of sound is incredibly connected to our physiology and has been since we were in the womb.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The psychological response to sound is similar.\u00a0If we're listening to birds sing, we become calmer and more at peace. Over the centuries our bodies have understood that if the birds are singing than everything is ok in the outside world and we don't have to be on the alert. If we're walking in the forest by ourselves and we hear a branch snap behind us, sound immediately tells our brains to look around and make sure we are not in danger.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And cognitively, we are bothered by loud conversations while working because our brains can only take in about 1.6 conversations at any given time. That means someone's conversation\u00a0can be so loud you cannot think or concentrate, and thereby lowers your productivity in a loud office or working space.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So how does this tie into conscious listening? Simply by being aware of our bodies' responses to sound we can see the immense value in what we're saying and how it's being received. If we understand that every sound, every word has an impact and a response in those around us we start to become aware of the necessity of conscious listening. And we can take this awareness into every aspect of our lives, including relationships.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the topic of relationships, Julian\u00a0goes on to explain the nuggets of truth in the gender stereotype of men as\u00a0poor listeners, but he says men can overcome this. Men tend to listen to hear a point and then offer a solution, most of us already know this. But\u00a0that's nearly the opposite of how women speak and how they listen: they do so to share and relive an experience with their listener as a way to connect, they don't talk about problems because they want them fixed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">A way for men to be better listeners in that situation is to ask the question: where am I listening from right now? If you catch yourself listening from a place of wanting to fix, be conscious of it and practice moving into what Julian calls \"empathetic listening\", which is the type of listening and communicating women naturally use. Empathetic listening can mean offering her a glass of wine and your undivided attention while she shares.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That tip ties into Julian's recommendations to become a conscious listener and to change your bad speaking and listening habits. Simply by being aware of where you're listening from, the pace you're using with your voice, the register of your voice and your intonation you can begin to become a more active listener and a more conscious speaker.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And there's lots more where that came from. Julian was a \"treasure trove\" of knowledge (see what we did there?) on this episode, he gave us a lot of excellent material to start shifting our listening to a more conscious place.\u00a0It was great to have him on the show and I hope you enjoy the episode!\u00a0Thanks for being here and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS JULIAN!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Julian\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliantreasure\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Julian\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.juliantreasure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Julian's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen\" target=\"_blank\">Julian's latest Ted Talk</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliantreasure\" target=\"_blank\">Julian\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRKVQcbIByo\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Freeman chats with Jimmy Kimmel while sucking helium</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewferebee\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

You might be an entrepreneur trapped in an employee's life. Such was the case for our guest for episode 319.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Andrew Ferebee was a manager at a big chain retailer when he realized he was actually an entrepreneur. But it wasn't one of those epiphanies he had in a nanosecond, instead it was a battle with clinical depression combined with a quest for personal growth that led him to this discovery. In this episode we cover what the experience of depression was like for him, how he moved forward with his life and took an incredible leap of faith that has paid off handsomely with his brand\u00a0<em>Knowledge For Men</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Today Andrew is the headmaster at Knowledge For Men, a web site and podcast about helping guys create their best, most fulfilling lives. But this was a business idea born from his disenchantment, loss and depression.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It all began with his first job out of college. He became a manager for a well-known retailer who gave him one of their most high-risk stores in Southern California. By high-risk they meant high problems, like sketchy neighborhood, less than stellar employees, high turnover and just a lot of headaches in general. At the same time,\u00a0his social network was completely changing post-college\u00a0and he lost a romantic relationship with a woman he wanted to marry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He soon found himself dreading the work day and the monotony of it. That monotony led to an episode of clinical depression that was so severe one day while driving over a bridge, he wondered to himself what it would be like if he simply drove off the edge. He wondered if it would take away all the gut-wrenching pain he was struggling with.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Having a level of self-awareness, Andrew understood he needed help and reached out for counseling. He was diagnosed with clinical depression and combined his treatment with massive action and personal growth to pull himself out of his depressive state.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He read tons and tons of books on the subject, in fact he still does. And he listened to hours of podcasts like this one and many others while on his way to and from work. He also made it a goal to attend meet ups and become friends with other \"wantrepreneurs\" and real-life entrepreneurs. Finally one day he decided he had had enough and it was time to leave his soul-sucking job.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Without a real game plan, he did. He spent the first week celebrating, the second week freaking out and then published an article on a blog called Knowledge For Men. That article, without any push or marketing\u00a0from him, went viral. In its first 24 hours it was read by 50,000 people. He had so many visitors to his site that it crashed and he had to upgrade! That trend continued with the next batch of content he released and he knew he was on to something.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That was in the spring of 2013 and since then, he has grown his blog to become a web site and a podcast. He leveraged his blog audience to gain an even larger podcast listenership and to land\u00a0such well-known guests as Jordan Belfort, the Wolf of Wall Street and Kevin Harrington of TV's Shark Tank.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Andrew attributes his success to his openness to personal growth and his willingness to take massive action on goals he sets for himself. He was an attendee at our bootcamp and says it not only taught him new tactics but also helped him take action to implement them. He learned how to improve his social life of course, but it all parlayed into him becoming a more solid person and a force to be reckoned with in the business world.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Please join me in thanking Andrew for sharing his stories with us.

But what does that phrase even mean and is it really a good idea? Yes and no says our guest for episode 318, Grant Baldwin. Grant is a speaker and podcaster who produces the show \"How Did You Get Into That?\". On his show, he interviews men and women who encountered a \"mid-life crisis\" and got into an unusual profession or started a unique business as a result.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's episode he and I discuss why there's no such thing as \"the perfect job or career\", why not to take a job solely for money, when following your passion is terrible advice and how to discover what your passions actually are and then create a job or business you love based on them. Join us as we talk about all that and so much more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of the most challenging questions any of us will face is what to do with our professional lives. The advice we usually hear: follow your passion! But if you're like most people, following your passion means something vastly different at 18 than\u00a0it does at 28, 38 or 58.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Grant Baldwin knows this, he's been there. \u00a0He has always known he loves speaking and loves\u00a0working with people to help them find out what they want to do in the world. Today he is a sought-after speaker and also runs a podcast aimed at helping people find their path in life by hearing other people's cool jobs and unique businesses. He helps people see they aren't stuck where they are, no matter how deeply entrenched in their career choice they feel they are.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One thing Grant has discovered in his journey and his discussions with people is that there is no such thing as the \"perfect career or job\"; everything you do, no matter how much you love it, will eventually take some work and some hustle. And I concur. But as long as you have more days that you love than hate, you're on the right path.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also agree that taking a job solely for the money it will pay is the wrong choice, but money should be a factor. So if you're looking at how to make your passions a real paying gig, money is naturally a consideration but it shouldn't be the only one. If you're thinking of going to law school because lawyers make bank, not because you love what it takes to have a career in law, you'd be wise to rethink that course. Both Grant and I agree we'd rather do something that makes us less money but makes us happy, rather than make more money and be miserable in that job or business.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">A common complaint both Grant and I hear is that it's too late for someone to make a change, they're in too deep with mountains of debt from school, a family to take care of, etc. And while those are always factors and considerations, Grant and I know people who have overcome all those obstacles to switch career paths, create new opportunities and new businesses that now make those same people happy and plenty of money.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Grant's recommendation in a situation like that is incremental bravery. One of his guests coined the phrase and he liked it so much he uses it. Incremental bravery is taking small, calculated risks towards the goal or vision you are pursuing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In other words, don't chuck your job on Friday and think you'll find your dream career the next Monday. It doesn't work like that. But if you take steps towards figuring out what you love, what you're good at and how you can make money by combining those two, you'll be on your way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On this show, Grant gives us some actionable tips and suggestions on how to follow our passion, find our talents and then see potential career possibilities based on the combination of those two. It's real world advice to get you started on a new path towards happiness and professional satisfaction. Thanks for being here and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS GRANT!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Grant\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrantBaldwin\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Grant\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.grantbaldwin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grant's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrantBaldwin\" target=\"_blank\">Grant\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://grantbaldwin.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">5 Questions To Find Your Passion</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaysonGaignard\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><br />Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

But what if we we choose it, make a ton of money doing it but are utterly miserable? What happens then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Here to share his experience of that scenario is Jayson Gaignard. Jayson is the CEO and driving force behind Mastermind Talks, an event-based organization devoted to bringing the greatest entrepreneurs together through events and networking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Have a listen to\u00a0episode 317 in which Jayson and I talk about how he sabotaged\u00a0his first multi-million dollar company and how he then relied on his network and his word to build a new business and rebuild his life.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There are generally two pieces of advice given to most people starting out in business or on their career paths: network and pick a profitable market to get in to. Jayson Gaignard did both with his first business. He was in the ticket-selling industry and he built a ton of high-level contacts while in the game.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But it was a niche he hated. Jayson had no interest in ticket sales or the events attached to those tickets. And one day, after he had amassed a highly lucrative business, he looked around and realized he was miserable. He had destroyed many relationships while building his company, his health was plummeting and he didn't care one iota about selling tickets or taking care of their customers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Being the savvy businessman he is, he knew he should sell it and this was his plan. But subconsciously he says he was disenchanted with everything about his business that he sabotaged it, so he would have nothing to sell. When he looks back now, he understands he did so because he didn't want the burden of selling such a life-draining business to one of his friends. He had plenty of offers, but he just couldn't sell it to someone else and risk tarnishing his friendship with them if they ended up hating it as much as he did by the end!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So instead, life intervened as it often does, and he found himself with a defunct business and $250,000 in cash debt. Not sure where revenue was going to come from next coupled with the stress of a newborn baby, Jayson hustled his way out the only way he knew how: his network.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He began throwing dinner parties and bringing together 6-8 entrepreneurs for conversation and connection. And they were an incredible success, he knew the first night it was something he would do for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">His next break was\u00a0an opportunity to bring Tim Ferriss to Canada for the first time. Tim was in the midst of a book blitz for The Four-Hour Chef. One of Tim's package deals was to buy $84,000 of books in exchange for two speaking engagements. Not having any idea how he'd pay for it, Jayson went for it. He knew he'd figure it out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And so he did. Jayson's network came through for him and one of his friends invested the $84k to get him off the ground.\u00a0Leveraging Tim's name and their mutual friends, Jayson brought together a world-class group of speakers for a mastermind weekend. From over 3,000 applicants, he hand-selected attendees and the weekend was unforgettable. The first one was so successful he has since held another weekend with the same caliber of speakers and attendees!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That was how Jayson not only brought himself out of a quarter of a million dollars worth of debt, but also how he fully realized the power of a network. Today Jayson continues to host events through his company, Mastermind Talks. And he has rebuilt his work and his life around new values of integrity and connection.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jayson was a terrific guest, it was great to have him on the show and hear his story, his insights and his wisdom.\u00a0Have a listen and then take action to create a powerful network of your own.\u00a0We'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS JAYSON!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Jayson know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaysonGaignard\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Jayson on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.mastermindtalks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jayson's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaysonGaignard\" target=\"_blank\">Jayson\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://fourhourchef.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The 4-Hour Chef</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaysonGaignard\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://londonreel.tv\" target=\"_blank\">London Reel</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><br />Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

He was a good language student in middle school and high school,\u00a0but only in the respect that he tested well. He couldn't speak any language he learned outside of the classroom and after awhile, he had forgotten much of the vocabulary he had learned.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In college, he double majored in Mechanical Engineering and Voice. He always wanted to be an engineer so he opted to go that route, but he also loved singing so he wanted to make that more than just a hobby. As a voice major, he had to learn to sing in Italian, Spanish\u00a0and German.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Not knowing a lick of German, his friend suggested he go to a school in Vermont called Middlebury and take a summer program. If Gabriel opted into one of their programs, it meant he had to speak the foreign language of his program for the entire time he was there. If he slipped up, he would be kicked out and would lose all of the money he had paid to be there. It sounded crazy enough to work, so he signed up and spent the next 7 weeks immersed in German.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">At the end of those 7 weeks, he was a B1 or a B2 on the European fluency scale, meaning he could order in a restaurant and carry on an in-depth conversation with ease. But that wasn't enough for him, he returned the following summer and earned a C1 certification in German. That certification meant he was fluent on the European scale; in Europe, if he had wanted to, he could teach in their school system and he could write an academic paper with ease.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Even though immersion works, Gabriel realizes not everyone has time for that. Most of us can't take 7 weeks off and run to Vermont to learn another language! If you're like most people and need to learn a language within the confines of a typical life, he has plenty of suggestions for you in this episode.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">His first suggestion when getting started is to learn the pronunciation of a language. Train your ear to hear the words in that language, before you do anything else like learning the alphabet or colors or numbers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After you've trained your brain on how to hear the language, which will take about 2-3 weeks, then learn basic words.\u00a0But here's a critical life hack to doing so: use images. And not just any images, use the Google search tool in your target language to learn the images associated with words. Often simple words mean something else to their native speakers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Once you've moved through those stages, then go on to learn the grammar. But all you need is your grammar guide, you won't need grammatical drills...Gabriel tells us why.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One last tip he leaves us with is a way to expand our vocabulary and become fluent faster after we're speaking a new language. When you find you don't know a word, you can either revert back to English or you can use the other words you do know in the new language and get other people to help you fill in the blank. You'll have the added benefit of having learned something new from someone (and perhaps giving them a laugh in the process), and having learned while under a bit of stress which makes your brain retain it better.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Please join me in thanking Gabriel\u00a0for being on the show. He was a fun guest to have on. I loved that we debunked some language myths, gave you some life hack language-learning tools and generally set the foundation for the fast, easier way to learn and retain a language.\u00a0Thanks for being here and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS GABRIEL!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Gabriel\u00a0know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fluent_Forever\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Gabriel\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"https://fluent-forever.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gabriel's web site<br /></a><a href=\"https://fluent-forever.com/the-book/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fluent Forever</em></a>, Gabriel's book<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fluent_Forever\" target=\"_blank\">Gabriel\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://ankisrs.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Anki</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><br />Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Her book,\u00a0<em>Wild Connection</em>, gives the low-down on what the love lives of animals can tell us about human relationships and human dating. She has spoken on the topic with NPR and has her own weekly blog on Psychology Today (links to both are in the resources section below).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">I thought she would be a fascinating guest to bring on and we dive into the correlations between animal behavior and human behavior in the relationship world. It turns out there are far more similarities than you might think, and we can learn a lot from our animal counterparts.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On today's show, Jennifer and I talk about those similarities and what we might learn including why animals rarely have miscommunications, why humans do and what we can apply from animals to lessen those miscues, as well as why deception never works in the long-run when you're looking for a lasting relationship. Animals aren't dishonest and don't camouflage who and what they are, humans should do the same.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Regarding the topic of miscommunication, this is a common occurrence that just isn't seen in the animal world. Jennifer says there are three steps we can take to have fewer communication issues.</p>\n<ol style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>Listen to each other better. men are programmed to pay attention to deeper voices, biologically programmed to do so. men should be aware of this and take steps to listen to their mate's voice. women can speak deeper.</li>\n<li>Stop talking over one another - animals don't do it because it doesn't work. They want to receive information so they listen. Our brains can't multi-task so if you're thinking of a response while someone is talking it's the same as if you were actually talking according to your brain.</li>\n<li>Explain what you mean in detail. The greater amount of detail you give the better your chances of being heard and understood.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When it comes to pretending to be something you're not, again animals don't do this because it doesn't work to find a proper mate. In human lives, eventually the other person is going to see who you really are. Instead of pretending to be someone or something you're not, find your best attributes and display those because there is someone out there who finds those attributes attractive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The best way to feel confident and comfortable in who you are and the attributes you have is to take stock of yourself. What do you like? What don't you like about yourself? Now what can you change and what must you accept? You'll never be 6'5\" so accept the height you're at, there IS someone out there who will find you attractive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But if there are things about yourself that you don't like and you can change, then do so. Do you like wish you were more confident and charming in social situations? Then make a plan to become more social, more charming and act on it. You'll find yourself becoming more comfortable and more at ease with who you are as you do, all of which makes your more attractive to others.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Please join me in thanking Jennifer for being on the show.\u00a0She is knowledgable, funny and she graciously shared a host of suggestions to get you on your way to finding the ideal relationship.\u00a0Be sure to listen and then take action on what we talk about in this show.

He's explored and studied this topic in depth, it's the theme of his book\u00a0<em>Smart Cuts</em>. He's even coined a phrase for it called \"lateral thinking\". He says lateral thinking is\u00a0reframing problems in such a way that you come up with different rules or you rearrange the pieces in new ways and see new things as a result. In short, lateral thinking about a topic is \"Macgyvering\" it: seeing a solution that is completely out of the box.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In this show, we go into detail on how to create habits of lateral thinking as suggested by Shane. One of his primary moves is to create what he calls \"neurotic spreadsheets\". These spreadsheets list your problem and then every possible assumption about that problem. Then list the answer to the question: what if this assumption weren't true? This will help you create a detailed, neurotic spreadsheet about your situation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Later in the show, Shane and I revisit neurotic spreadsheeting and apply it to discovering why someone was the best\u00a0and why. Shane did this for former US\u00a0presidents and his results were startling. He looked at multiple factors like who had the highest approval rating, how much time they spent in Congress, etc. He shares his findings with us - it's really interesting!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Neurotic spreadsheeting is just one component of how to create lateral thinking habits. Another, perhaps easier, way to do this is by simply asking the question \"Why?\" -And not in an annoying way but getting to the bottom of why something has been done a certain way can help us reframe how we look at it. This line of thinking and questioning in business will help us to break convention and create innovative solutions, where others can't or don't see those solutions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Although we cover much more on this show, one final piece of advice Simon had for us is his 5 second rule. It goes like this: you have five seconds to do something or agree to do something, even if you are afraid of doing it. Are you afraid to speak in public, but you were just offered an incredible keynote opportunity? You have five seconds to say yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When you\u00a0do this often enough, you'll eventually stop being afraid of what you're agreeing to and become far more afraid of breaking your word to yourself and letting yourself down. You can apply this to any area of your life from your career to your love life. Too afraid to ask her out? Use the five second rule: give yourself til the count of five and then go ask. This is something Shane uses daily and it's made a world of difference what he takes on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Shane and I cover a lot of ground in this episode, he was an awesome guest to have with us. His lateral thinking approach, his habit of skeptical optimism are additional powerful topics we touch on. Be sure to listen and then start implementing his\u00a0<em>Smart Cuts</em>' suggestions.\u00a0We'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS SHANE!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Shane know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/shanesnow\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Shane on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.shanesnow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shane's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.shanesnow.com/smartcuts\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Smart Cuts</em></a>, Shane's book<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/shanesnow\" target=\"_blank\">Shane\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/macgyver\" target=\"_blank\">Episodes of MacGyver online</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><br />Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

He says there are habits that separate the rich from the poor.

He analyzed that data over a 16 month period and came up with some startling revelations: there is no \"secret\" to getting wealthy, there are simply daily habits the rich engage in and daily habits that poor people do too. And the two sets of habits are miles apart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">With the data he gathered and the insights he uncovered from his study, Tom wrote the book Rich Habits and launched his Rich Habits web site. On the show today, he shares some of the material in the book as well as his personal story of being wealthy as a child, losing it all and the impact that experience had on him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When Tom was 9, his family was running a business that had made them very wealthy. They were worth $4-$5 million dollars (quite a lot back then), until a fire took all of that overnight. Tom's family struggled to rebuild and he had to put himself through college. He worked nights as a janitor, and went to school during the day. All the while that painful loss from his childhood acting as a thorn in his side, urging him on.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That loss would play a factor in why he undertook his 5 years of research and later published his first book. But the tipping point that pushed him over the edge was when a wealthy client of his came to him for help. The man was losing his business, everything he had worked for and he had no idea what he was doing wrong. He asked Tom for help.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There wasn't much Tom could for him and he had no advice to give. All of his clients were already wealthy when they joined his company so he had never watched them grow and amass their fortunes. So Tom began to look for resources for his floundering client; Tom wanted to understand what the rich did differently on a daily basis. Not finding any books or other sources on the topic, Tom saw the opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace and his Rich Habits brand was born.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On this episode, Tom and I talk about those rich habits and what they are. Did you know 79% of rich people watch under an hour of TV a day? Instead, they are out hustling: they are volunteering at charitable organizations, teaching, speaking or networking several nights a week. And all of those activities are focused on getting them to their next goal or dream.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But Tom admits it goes deeper than simply working harder and doing more. Rich habits are also built by our belief systems, or mini computer programs as Tom calls them. In fact, beliefs might be the \"secret\" to what's holding you back if you aren't wealthy. The good news is you can change those beliefs. It's a matter of awareness, and then creating a new habit to replace the old, negative one that is holding you back. And consistently doing so over a period of time, Tom recommends 18-254 days to create a new habit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There's plenty more of those nuggets in this episode!\u00a0Tom\u00a0was\u00a0an awesome guest who provides insightful how-tos on building your rich habits every day, networking with the wealthy on your way to the top and creating something he calls opportunity luck. Have a listen and then starting shifting those daily habits into rich habits!\u00a0 We'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS TOM!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Tom know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RICHHABITS\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Tom\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://richhabits.net\" target=\"_blank\">Tom's web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://richhabits.net/rich-habits-books/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom's books</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RICHHABITS\" target=\"_blank\">Tom on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://richhabits.net/spend-your-time-wisely/\" target=\"_blank\">How The Rich Spend Their Time</a>, Tom's blog post</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><br />Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Today you can't turn on a TV, go into a bookstore or walk down the street without having the concept thrown in your face (often times literally). And it's a concept we at The Art of Charm and\u00a0our guest for episode 312 don't buy into, not unless you want to be a douchebag.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">James Fell is a fitness and health writer for the LA Times, Ask Men, the Chicago Tribune and Time magazine, and he joins us to talk about why the alpha male marketing idea is bullshit, how to actually face your fears and grow your confidence to achieve your dreams without relying on the instant-fix ploy of Alpha Male and how to know who to listen to for advice and when...and plenty more.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of the\u00a0biggest issues James and I both have with the Alpha Male idea is that it takes guys who are trying to build their confidence and develop themselves and basically teaches them to be assholes. And it says that by acting like a tough guy with muscles and a spray tan, they'll magically get a hot girlfriend, become a millionaire and all their problems will be solved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Instead of being truthful about what will get them those things: putting in the time, effort and energy to develop their inner game, learn how to connect and build relationships with women and in business and gain the skills and confidence to cope with anything life brings their way. Because this idea, as opposed to the Alpha Male thing, isn't a quick fix.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It's not sexy to tell someone it's going to take them years to become who they want to be and get what they want. But the reality is it does take time, it does take effort and it does take commitment. Both James and I agree on that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also agree on the importance of running towards your fears and facing them to build that confidence. James says it's important to take baby steps and build that confidence, acquire your goals bit by bit. Take a look at where you want to go, the skills you want and need to develop to get there and then set a foundation to get there through self-improvement, self-reflection and hands-on learning, even formal education where it's appropriate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Action is key, another point we agree on. No amount of daydreaming will get you that Ferrari. James even shares the exact reason why daydreaming actually stops you from achieving what you want. His advice? Instead of daydreaming, strategize how you're going to get from where you are now to where you want to be. Then go out and do it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">James\u00a0and I discuss SO much more in this show.\u00a0He was an awesome guest who pulled no punches in giving us the lowdown on why Alpha Male is bullshit, how to be who you really are and get what you really want. He gives some real-life examples and strategies you can use, so have a listen and get moving! \u00a0We'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS JAMES!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let James know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BodyForWife\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank James on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.sixpackabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Six Pack Abs<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.bodyforwife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Body For Wife</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BodyForWife\" target=\"_blank\">James\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.sixpackabs.com/how-to-find-and-keep-a-girlfriend/\" target=\"_blank\">How To Find (and Keep) A Girlfriend</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\"><br />Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Is this really true and does it work when it comes to networking and expanding our social circles? Adam Grant has the answer to that question and he's our guest for episode 311.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Adam is the author of \"Give and Take\" and an\u00a0organization psychologist professor at Wharton School of Business.\u00a0He was also named by\u00a0Malcolm Gladwell as one of his favorite social science writers. In this show, Adam and I talk about how to spot takers and protect yourself against them, how to use the 5 minute favor to expand your social circle in a favorable way and give yourself greater happiness in the process, and lots more!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Most of us probably believe we're givers, or at the very least we want to be giving to our social circles. But chances are some of us simply aren't giving. Adam Grant helps us rectify that in this episode. One of the best ways to be a giver or an even better giver than you are now is to simply ask what others need. If you know what they need, you can find a way to give it to them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Or you can approach the person you want to give to by sharing what you're good at and how you could contribute to them. For example, if you are an encyclopedia of research studies let them know that and tell them they can contact you if they are looking for a particular study or you can help them find a study that supports a concept they're exploring.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you're looking for a way to connect with that person before approaching them, there's an app called Refresh which will gather all their social media information and collect it in one place for you. You can look for things or people or connections you have in common and use that as a talking point to establish\u00a0common ground. Once you've connected and have bonded, you can go deeper into the relationship to find out what their greatest needs are and how you can fulfill those needs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And if one of those needs you fulfill involves introducing another person, Adam and I discuss the proper steps to doing so with a double opt-in introduction.

This is the art and craft of giving some of the power in a connection to the other person, thereby showing you are willing to give for the greater good and you aren't there simply to take advantage of the situation.

But with time, patience, the right attitude and the proper support, we can take those experiences and propel ourselves into lives we never even dreamed possible.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Here to share his own\u00a0version of this is Michael O'Neal from The Solopreneur Hour podcast. In episode 310, we talk about how the loss of both of his parents in less than a year devastated and altered his life completely, how that experience led to his commitment to never trade time for dollars again, why it's important to say yes and be open and how to get past the fear of creating a new business and lifestyle of your own.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In the very early days of the Internet, Michael O'Neal was one of those early adapters. He created and designed web sites and made a good living doing it. Eventually he left the office world and became a freelancer working for himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He was so good at what he did that he was courted by a Fortune 500 company. He didn't need the job but talked to them anyway. After receiving a highly lucrative offer, one that was\u00a0<em>more</em>\u00a0than he asked for, he went to work for them. The beginning days were fun: kegs and foosball on Fridays but once the start-up was bought out all of that changed. Soon it was meetings and minutes. Within a year, Michael left with a healthy severance package.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">About the same time, his father's battle with congestive heart failure took a turn for the worse. Eventually his dad lost that battle and died. Seven months later, Michael's mom passed away from a combination of a broken heart over the loss of her husband and a rare kidney disorder. Losing his father was incredibly sad, but not surprising as he had been battling for 4 years. But the passing of Michael's mom was unexpected and heartbreaking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Emotionally, Michael was devastated. Financially, he was devastated. His parents' illnesses ate up his 401(k), he lost his home, his cars, his savings, all of it. It was a tremendous burden to bear and in his own words, he simply \"muddled\" through it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It wasn't until he was sitting on the couch of a billionaire friend over a year later that he realized he hadn't mourned. He was simply in survival mode. His friend's acknowledgment of this gave him the space to grieve.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Soon he set off on a journey to take his parents' ashes to Europe and give them the trip he had always wanted to give them when they were alive. For four months he traveled and lived in Italy, Belgium, France among other places. And when he returned to the States, he was still dead broke but he was sure of one thing: never again would he be tied to a job or to clients to make a living.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He read a series of books, which he now calls the Sexy Six, that opened his eyes to a new way of living and doing business. He found a network marketing company he believed in, a company that became a new family for him and he quickly built a successful business with them through his own proven social media tactics.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">From that success, he developed a course on social media to teach other network marketers and solopreneurs how to do the same. That course led to a gig producing the popular podcast, The Kick-Ass Life with David Wood.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And that podcast led to Michael's own show, The Solopreneur Hour. Today he is the head honcho at The Solopreneur Hour, a podcast that produces a six-figure income for him and has grown to over 1.5 million downloads in its first year. \u00a0On the show, he interviews successful solopreneurs on what they did from the time they became unemployable to their present day success. I've appeared on the show as has Michael Gerber, Pat Flynn, Chris Ducker and numerous others.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Michael\u00a0and I get into tons more valuable content on what it means to be a solopreneur, the steps he recommends someone take to get started and why taking action is so important. He was a great guest and I enjoyed having him on the show, I hope you dig this episode too. \u00a0Thanks for listening and we'll see you next time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS MICHAEL!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Michael know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/solohour\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Michael on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333;

And since 2007 he has made those areas his life's work. He helps people make changes in their health and fitness by understanding what's holding them back psychologically. Inherently, most of us know there is no magic pill or quick-fix to getting healthy and we know we have to eat right, exercise and take care of ourselves to be as healthy as we can be. Adam helps us understand what's in the way, psychologically, to doing so.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the topic of weight loss, Adam believes there are a lot of psychological factors at work. Is someone afraid of losing weight because they won't fit in with their friends any more? Or perhaps their spouse or significant other doesn't\u00a0support them in getting fit - their partner sabotages their weight loss efforts by making meals that don't fit their diet plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">All of those examples have an underlying psychology to them that applies not just to weight loss, but to any area of our lives we're improving. And that psychology is fear of rejection, and fear of success. We may sabotage our efforts in an area because we don't want to lose the friendships and the partner we're comfortable with; we don't want them to reject our new \"selves\" so we make changes, but don't stick with them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Adam and I discuss the specific ways to navigate these situations so we can actually be okay with making changes, being uncomfortable and helping others while we're in the process of growing and shifting. One of the most pivotal keys to doing so that Adam and I talk about is awareness. When you're aware of what's happening, you can better navigate any change.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also dive into the related area of discomfort and how to use it as our compass. Adam believes if we truly want to become the person of our dreams, whether it's a healthy awesome body or the ideal relationship or our perfect job or business, we have to use discomfort to guide us to get there. If we continue to do what's comfortable, we'll continue to stay where we are. So in order to steer us into that new body, relationship, job or business, we have to do what's uncomfortable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There's so much more Adam and I discuss but one of the biggest takeaways we both want you to get is this: you must take action on this knowledge. All the tricks, tips and tools we give you are pointless until you implement them. So listen to this show, get yourself a coach or accountability partner to help you and then take action!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Adam was a terrific guest and I enjoyed having him on the show, I hope you enjoy this episode as well.

She's the author of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.susanroane.com/how-to-work-a-room/\" target=\"_blank\">How To Work A Room</a>, now on its 4th edition and silver anniversary. She joins the Art of Charm podcast for our 308th episode to dish the details on the ins and outs of networking and connecting, even if you're shy. She's got advice, techniques and tips for everyone in any industry.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Considered one of the leading experts in the field of networking, Susan RoAne has seen her share of the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to networking. And some of her favorite advice to give people is simple: you never know. You never know who someone is, who is in their network and what doors they are connected to - so always be nice to everyone. Because you never know.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of the reasons the topic of networking, and her book, have been so important and continue to be so important, is because everyone needs to network. The details may change from generation to generation, but the rules generally don't. If you want to be a good networker, always be nice to others and treat other people like you're a host.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Why act like you're a host? Because hosts listen and make their guests feel welcome, and at home. That's what you should be doing when you network: make others feel comfortable in your presence. Stop worrying about, or even having an agenda when you go somewhere. Go there to have fun, be lively\u00a0and connect with people...not to get someone or get something for yourself or your business. Susan says that is the essence of networking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In this episode, Susan gives us some nuts and bolts on how to prepare for an event, how to engage with people (even if you're shy) and how to really work a room.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To prepare she says to go online and research the people who may be there. Find their LinkedIn profile and study it, as well as their Facebook page. Look for what you have in common with them outside of the business realm. Then when you meet them, work it into a conversation. Are you both recovering lawyers? Say so. Did you both go to the same college or grow up in the same part of the country? Say so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When it comes to engaging with people, Susan has three suggestions for starting a conversation:\u00a0\u00a0introduce yourself in under 10 seconds with a pleasantry, say something about the event and then give the benefit of what you do (not what you do precisely). Keep it short, sweet and to the point.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To really work the room, even if you're a shy person, get there on time or within 15 minutes of the event starting. That way the room works YOU, not the other way around! As people arrive, you'll be able to mingle and mix on a more intimate basis.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Susan and I\u00a0really get into the finer details of networking in this episode! We talk about how to exit a conversation graciously (and it's not by saying you have to use the bathroom!), how to follow up and make yourself stand out in that follow up, and how to remember the people you meet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And here's plenty more where that came from! Susan\u00a0was a terrific guest and I enjoyed having her on the show; be sure to get out your notepad or your Evernote and write her tips down so you can take action the next time you're at a networking event.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS SUSAN!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Susan know by clicking on the link below and sending her a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/susanroane\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Susan\u00a0on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.susanroane.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Susan's\u00a0web site<br /></a><em><a href=\"http://www.susanroane.com/how-to-work-a-room/\" target=\"_blank\">How To Work A Room</a></em>, hard copy<a href=\"http://smartpassiveincome.com\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://audiblepodcast.com/aoc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Work A Room</em></a>, audio version<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/susanroane\" target=\"_blank\">Susan\u00a0on Twitter</a><a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

And it all began when his Plan A fell through.\u00a0In this show, we talk about how Pat has overcome adversity throughout his career, how he has found the courage to overcome challenges\u00a0and how he has become efficient and effective at work to create a better balance between work and the rest of his life.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">From a fairly early age, Pat had his career path mapped out. He got excellent grades throughout every level of schooling, including architecture school. He put in the long hours necessary to be one of the top students in his class at architecture school and did whatever needed to be done to put himself among the very best.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So when he landed a job with an architecture firm and began the process of becoming a licensed architect, he thought he was well on his way. And for three years his life went exactly the way he had planned.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But one day his firm dropped a bomb: they were letting people go and he was one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The timing could not have been worse for Pat; he had just gotten engaged to his now-wife and they were planning their wedding. He had no Plan B and had no idea what to do next.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It was then that he learned how valuable it is to have supportive people in his life. His wife and family encouraged him and believed him. They all told him he'd get through this experience, and be better for it. Pat listened to them and took advantage of the few months he had between receiving news of his layoff and actually being unemployed to look for opportunities.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He found one in particular that led to the creation of his LEED exam preparation guide. The LEED exam is a common certification for architects to take that helps them land better jobs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Pat had built a site while preparing to take his LEED exam and he had created a resource where people asked him questions about the test. He responded and provided valuable information for everyone who visited. He took those questions and answers and created an online ebook based on that information.Because of all the time and energy Pat had put into his site and his community in its early stages, his guidebook was a massive success early on.\u00a0It showed Pat the power of online marketing and propelled him on his current path of entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Since then, Pat has become known as one of the most transparent business men on the planet (even Forbes said so) and he shows why in this episode. We talk at length about some of the tools he's learned to balance his work life with his home life so he's fully present\u00a0in whatever he's doing. He also shares his shoebox trick for staying grateful and a few practical ways to spot opportunities and then act on them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Pat was a terrific guest and I enjoyed having him on the show. And I really appreciated the advice he gave about becoming more efficient with email and how to let go of that responsibility. Of course, there's\u00a0plenty more Pat and I discuss on this show so have a listen and enjoy!</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d2c2a;\">THANKS PAT!</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\">If you enjoyed this session of the Art of Charm Podcast, let Pat know by clicking on the link below and sending him a quick shout out on Twitter:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #111111;\"><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patflynn\" style=\"color: #8f0a0b;\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to thank Pat on Twitter!</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</h3>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://patflynn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pat's personal web site<br /></a><a href=\"http://smartpassiveincome.com\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Passive Income<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/no-ideas-no-expertise-no-money-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Dane Maxwell on the Smart Passive Income podcast</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patflynn\" target=\"_blank\">Pat\u00a0on Twitter</a><a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

In fact, in high school he admits his mindset and his life were about as big as his 4'10\", 85 pound frame. Until one day he found himself at a concert and had the revelation that he was living life at the same pitch as the section he was sitting in: the back rows of the show where everyone was checked\u00a0out and low energy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Decided he no longer wanted that for himself, he made a commitment to shift. He began studying the greats, the people who were high energy, front-row kind of people. And he found the courage to leave his corporate job to pursue something greater than his 9 to 5.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Within two years, he had $85,000 in credit card debt and was choosing whether to buy groceries or pay his mortgage. He was being paid to speak, but it wasn't yet a thriving endeavor for him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He made a front row decision to invest his last $4,000 into a mailing promoting his speaking services. He got no response from the mailing. But that didn't stop him, he understood he needed to take care of his family and so he continued to dig, dig, and dig until he worked his way out of debt and into a whole new business: The Front Row.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jon learned immeasurably valuable lessons along the way like how to treat everyone like a rock star and how to take any situation and find the positive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When it comes to treating people like rock stars, Jon says to write\u00a0a list of the top 10 people in our lives, those who matter the most and add the most to our lives, and then find out what their biggest dream or goal is for this year. Now write down what you can do to help them achieve that goal.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And when it comes to finding the good in a seemingly \"bad\" situation, always ask yourself: what else could this mean? When you habitually do that, you'll see the positive a lot faster.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also talk about legacy\u00a0versus currency, and how to be a \"moment-maker\" versus an energy-taker. Jon was generous enough to detail a few actionable exercises to practice right now. Of course, there's\u00a0plenty more Jon and I discuss on this show. Tune in, I hope you enjoy listening!</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://frontrowhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon's\u00a0web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonvroman\" target=\"_blank\">Jon\u00a0on Twitter</a><a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><em><a href=\"http://connectedthebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Connected</a></em>, by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler<a href=\"http://www.nichepursuits.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><em><a href=\"http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/about-the-book/\" target=\"_blank\">Quiet: The Power of Introverts</a></em>, by Susan Cain</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

It's a dating app available on smart phones that allows men and women to meet. Tinder works by allowing you to post a quick profile, using your basic information (location, age, gender) and it posts a few photos of your choice from your Facebook account. There's room to write a short bio and then you simply see pictures of women in your area. You swipe right if you like them and want to connect, left if you don't.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There are some keys to standing out among the Tinder crowd and setting yourself apart from the rest of the guys on there.\u00a0Giving us the\u00a0details on how to do just that are Justin Jensen of The Art of Charm and Byron, an AOC graduate. We talk about how to best showcase your personality through your photos and also how to establish rapport and connection with the ladies you want to meet. Join us to hear all of that and more on this episode.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Like so many other dating opportunities out there, Tinder offers\u00a0a way to meet people you might not come across during your normal daily routine. And also like other dating outlets, there are ways to stand out on Tinder that will make plenty of women notice you and want to meet you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Two guys who have Tinder on lock, Justin and Byron, tell us a few ways you can showcase yourself as an extraordinary guy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The first thing they recommend is creating some interesting and engaging photos. This doesn't mean get Photoshop and make yourself into a male model (although that might work for a little while). It means taking photos of you being you, and then maybe adding a silly message or a tongue-in-cheek phrase at the bottom to grab her interest. Doing so also gives her a talking point when you message her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You want to create as much opportunity for banter as possible when you two connect on Tinder. Once your photos are up and she swipes right to say she's interested, it's up to you to open up that line of communication for the banter to begin. Don't wait for her, you've got to initiate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Most of the women on Tinder receive plenty of messages, and that's where your witty banter and personality-based photos will help you stand out from the crowd. Once conversation has been opened, you two are communicating and bantering has been happening, then you'll want to move it along to the actual offline date. If the banter vibe is working, strike while the iron is hot and give her your number.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After she texts you, text her back to tell her you'll call to set up a date later.\u00a0And then actually call her. Very few men on Tinder are actually calling the women they meet, so right there you're already a leg up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When you call, give her a couple of different days when you are available\u00a0for your date. Be sure to take the lead: set the date, pick the venue and let her know you're in the lead. You'll establish yourself as confident in her eyes. And if you mix in some humor, you've got the top two things most women are looking for in a man (confidence followed by sense of humor).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Those are just some of the tips and techniques Justin and Byron give us for mastering Tinder.\u00a0Whether you're looking for first dates to hone your skills or you want to find your ideal match, they lay it all out here in this interview.\u00a0Have a listen and then get to Tindering!</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://artofcharm.com/tinder\" target=\"_blank\">Free ebook about using Tinder</a>\u00a0(from\u00a0The Art of Charm)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

It seems to be a rare commodity today, especially in the online social media world. If you're like most people, you have that one friend online who is always bragging about how great his/her life is. They post pictures of their flashy car (or even just a flashy car, it doesn't have to be theirs) and their latest awesome vacation. They're a trophy wall poster.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">While we might be inclined to think a trophy wall makes someone cool, it actually has the opposite effect. And here to tell us why and the science behind that (and plenty more) is Michael Simmons of Forbes magazine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace for free and help support\u00a0The Art of Charm!</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Michael is a writer for Forbes magazine and he's also an international keynote speaker, author, teacher and entrepreneur. He was also voted one of the Top 25 Under 25 by Business Week.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Today he also writes for Forbes magazine\u00a0on the topic of\u00a0authentic relationship building in the age of social media and he spends hours on each article. Each piece is\u00a0thoroughly explored, researched and backed up by various scientific studies and expert input.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We talk about numerous aspects of networking in this episode, the first being the clusters in the networks you have. Most people think they have one big network, but in actuality we all have smaller clusters within our giant network.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The greatest indicator of our success and anyone else's is how well connect those clusters. According to Ron Burt, an expert on networking, the most successful people in the world are those who connect people from their various clusters. To do this, you've got to establish your identity and connections within each cluster and then move to connect your connections. It's what Ron calls \"brokering\" and it is what makes people the most successful.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One way to build your reputation is, of course, online through social media. But where most people fall down is using social media to brag and post about how great their lives are. They only post the \"trophies\" and the victories, not the struggles and challenges they overcame to get those \"trophies\".</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And Michael believes sharing authentically, vulnerably and courageously about those struggles and challenges along with the triumphs is what will actually deepen and strengthen your relationships.He cites a Princeton University study on authenticity to back this up as well as work produced by Abraham Tesser, an American psychologist and research professor with the University of Georgia.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another related topic we explore is his habit of making one introduction a day. He talks about the value this creates for others and how he uses a double opt-in introduction format for the most impact.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There's plenty more Michael and I talk about in this like his 7 power networking habits to cultivate and how your own story makes you relatable online and in person. There's plenty of useful and applicable content in this episode, I hope you'll listen, digest and apply all the great takeaways we share. Thanks for listening.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://michaeldsimmons.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael's\u00a0web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaeldsimmons\" target=\"_blank\">Michael\u00a0on Twitter</a><a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelsimmons/2014/01/14/the-one-thing-you-should-do-after-meeting-anyone-new/\" target=\"_blank\">The One Thing You Should Do After Meeting Anyone New, Michael's article on Forbes<br /></a><a href=\"https://www.contactually.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Contactually</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.spartzinc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emerson Spartz</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/charm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Squarespace (free) and support our supporters!</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

He climbed his way out of\u00a0the projects in Brooklyn to become a keynote speaker at the White House, a millionaire and one of Inc Magazine's 30 Under 30. He's also contributed to Forbes, and delivered a TedX\u00a0talk. All on the subject of likability.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He joins The Art of Charm today to share with us what likability is, why it had such an impact on his upward mobility from the projects in Brooklyn and how to cultivate and authentically apply it in your personal and professional life.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://lynda.com/artofcharm\" target=\"_blank\">Try Lynda.com and help support the show!</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Being raised on public assistance and living in the slums of Brooklyn, there wasn't much opportunity around Arel. The only reason he saw it was possible\u00a0to be more, do more and have more, was because his mom put him in every possible program the city made available. Over time, he went to affluent neighborhoods and saw people who spoke and looked like him who had wealth and influence. He decided he could and would have it too; he would embody the American Dream.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He learned to connect with people, even when he couldn't offer them anything other than his undivided interest and his time, that's what he did. He made people feel their time and energy were so worthwhile, so naturally they gave more. And he discovered taking action on people's advice was also a key piece of creating a likable relationship with people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He soon found one of the ultimate keys to success in any connection:\u00a0understanding people, empathizing and showing you care about the other person, that is the true essence of likability.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Although he's certainly got likability down to an art form, he doesn't rest on his laurels.\u00a0He believes we can always strive to be better and greater, no matter how good we are at something today. For example, competitive athletes who become known as the best in their game don't stop practicing because they're now the best. Not at all! Anyone who is great at anything continues to learn, grow and push themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">So how can we take the art of likability and apply it to our everyday lives? When it comes to business, people buy YOU. People don't buy your product or your service, they buy you. People buy from people they know, like and trust.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">To create that bond, you\u00a0have to get interested in what your customers are interested in. And you can find out what they're interested in by listening to them, listen for clues.\u00a0What does your client love, what are they into at the moment?

But what if you've met an\u00a0incredible woman and the only way you can be together is long-distance and you want to give it a shot?

We talk about the 3 phases of dating, what factors to evaluate when considering moving in with someone, behaviors that are red flags in you and in the woman you're dating, why trust is so vital and how to communicate to keep your connection no matter how far apart you are physically.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">I put myself on the hot seat for this one! With Kim, I talk about my long-distance relationship that is soon to become a same-city relationship. My girlfriend is moving back to LA and we're talking about moving in together.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Because the majority of our relationship has happened while we've been in different cities, I had a lot of concerns and questions I wanted to bring up. Like even though it's practical, is it really a good idea to move in together if we've almost always been in two different cities? What if this relationship isn't moving on the timeline I would've picked?</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It isn't all about me though; we also talk about some basic relationship issues like communication, trust and red flags to look out for when dating.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Although we've talked about it before on the show, the topic of moving in together seems to be common. Kim and and I speculate the reason so many couples who live together first eventually divorce may be because there's really nothing to signal the significant event of marriage.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When you live together you just separate your stuff, you move out and you're done. Going\u00a0from this I-always-have-an-out option to marriage is a tough transition because there's really nothing that signals that big change. But if you don't live together first and then you marry and move in together, the massive change all happens at once because of the wedding ceremony (but not really of course). \u00a0Suddenly it's real and it's forever and you take it more seriously than when you just lived together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another topic is the phases of dating, in response to my concern about the ideal dating timeline. The three phases, according to Kim, are:</p>\n<ol style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>Courting phase: This is the cat and mouse chase. This is when the guy gets girl, the girl wants the guy to chase her.</li>\n<li>Pure dating phase: This is when you've been dating for a\u00a0few months. At this point you're exclusive and you're figuring out if you're compatible for the long-term.</li>\n<li>Full-blown relationship: This is when you're moving towards partnership, marriage, the forever kind of situation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One thing Kim pointed out about these phases is that if you're good at one - like most guys are good at courting - you're probably weak in another phase, like the full-blown relationship. If that's you, working on yourself and listening to this show (attending one of our programs *ahem*), are all good ways to strengthen your abilities in the other dating phases.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Now if you're dating a woman and you want to evaluate yourself and her before moving into one of those latter phases, how do you know what to look out for? What are some red flags? Here are a few we talk about:</p>\n<ul style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>You must know what you both want. Communication is huge so you have to talk about what you both are looking for in this relationship.</li>\n<li>And that leads into talking about the longer-term picture: do you both want children? do you both want to get married? etc.</li>\n<li>Look at your values: do you see money, religion, and work the same way, etc? Does she have a career and want to keep it after marriage and you start a family? If not, why not?</li>\n<li>Your social lives:\u00a0is one of you more social than the other? This is especially challenging if you go from a long-distance to same-city/living together situation. Suddenly she has no one but you. It's something to think about.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Obviously those are all important considerations and factors to weigh when you're looking at your relationship, whether it's long-distance or you're in the same city.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And so much of that list is dependent on communication. As guys we're not the first ones to offer up our feelings, but that is one of\u00a0the best ways to make sure the woman you're dating or your girlfriend (or wife) knows how you really feel about her. This is even more critical in long-distance relationships because you aren't spending time together and you can't rely on the physical aspect of the relationship to show your feelings.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There is tremendous strength in being vulnerable and showing her how you feel. Periodically telling her you care, you miss her and you're thinking of her are important in any relationship, but again especially when you're long-distance. Whether it's with a phone call, a text or a Skype chat\u00a0will show her you care, you'll feel good expressing yourself and she'll feel good hearing those words from you. It becomes a positive circle that grows and strengthens your relationship, even if you live in the same city. This is actually critical if you are in a long-distance relationship, it is what will keep you together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And it'll help if you start to feel jealous. The most important thing to remember about jealousy is this: if you feel secure in who you are, you can feel secure in a relationship and not be threatened by every guy who talks to her or she hangs out with. Jealousy needlessly screws up a lot of relationships because one (or both) of the two people aren't secure in their own self and it shows up in the relationship.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">This is of course absolutely true of long-distance relationships. Any insecurity is going to poison the relationship than you can stop it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">While this episode was devoted to the topic of long-distance relationships, so much of the content applies to any and all types of relationships. Whether you're dating, in a relationship or in a committed long-term situation, I hope you found valuable content you can take action on to get what you want out of your love life.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.eliteimagemakeovers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kim's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeltzerKimberly\" target=\"_blank\">Kim\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

If someone said to you sending an 18 year old to college is like sending an 18 year old to Vietnam, would you agree? That's James Altucher believes and he's our guest for episode 300.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Having founded over 20 companies along with creating and publishing 11 books, James Altucher knows a few things about how the world works and he doesn't see the necessity of college for most people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Today\u00a0James and I talk about alternatives to college and why they are important to thriving in today's economy, how the American Dream has gone through a death and a rebirth, how to choose yourself everyday and how James stopped a $30 million financial fraud...accidentally.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Although he is not in favor of college for the average person, James did attend undergraduate and graduate school. He's an alum of Cornell for his undergrad degree in computer science and he earned his graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon, also in computer science.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Despite this stellar education, James' programming skills were so limited his first employer sent him to a remedial school to get up to speed. Although his programming skills were eventually brought up to par, James went the entrepreneurial route.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In fact, it's a route he considers to be far more valuable than a college degree for most people. If you start and fail at a business, you will learn just as much \u00a0or MORE than if you would have \u00a0gone to school for a college degree, according to James.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He believes starting a business is the best alternative to spending thousands, even hundreds of thousands dollars in debt for a degree you may not use later on life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another alternative he offers is to actually work in the field you want to go into. Want to be a doctor? Go work in a hospital changing bedpans for six months. If you still want to heal the sick and be in medicine, go to school for it. Think you want to be a lawyer? Go work in a law firm and see if you still like it at the end of summer. If you don't, at least you didn't waste your time and a lot of money on a legal degree.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You need to do this before investing your time and money into a degree that you hate is because\u00a0America's economy has shifted. No longer are there a plethora of middle management jobs. According to James that entire layer of the US economy has fallen to the wayside.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">While that may raise some eyebrows and some concerns, he says there is still plenty of money and innovation in our country. It would benefit everyone to explore other options instead of trying to hang on to work that is no longer there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And that's where self-care can be such a powerful tool. Instead of fretting over things you can't control and worrying about how to network your way to the top as the old mindset teaches, James believes in focusing on four areas of life every day to ensure you're healthy and happy on the inside. Everything external comes from your internal state so take care of the internal and the external will get taken care of too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Our conversation on the topic of skipping college and alternatives to higher education may be a controversial one but it's a discussion worth having. As always, we don't leave you hanging! We point out alternatives and options if you decide not to go or not to send your kids to college.

And yet there are stories of triumph from those who rise above to lead happy, healthy and impactful lives.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Such is the case for our guest on episode 299, Ted Ryce, fitness expert and martial arts competitor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In this show, Ted talks candidly and powerfully about the impact of the kidnapping and murder of his young brother\u00a0Jimmy, as well as his mom's mental illness and abusive treatment of him and his subsequent personal journey. We also discuss how all of those experiences helped Ted become a warrior in mind, body and spirit and to\u00a0discover the resiliency tools he uses today\u00a0to create a life of fulfillment and joy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When he was only\u00a014, Ted's mother was killed in a car accident. After the birth of his sister, she became\u00a0mentally ill but was never properly diagnosed or treated. Around that same time, she began beating Ted.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Naturally, he was pretty distraught about the loss of his mother. He was angry and sad and lashed out as teenagers do: he skipped school, experimented with sex and drugs and even stole the family car and ran away. As he says, his high school days were all about sex, drugs and rock-n-roll.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But he did enough to get through high school and get into college, where he began to enjoy himself. Still the rebel, he skipped class but was earning A's in his courses and working on subjects he enjoyed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One day, while skipping class, he went to his friend's house to see his little brother, Jimmy, after school. Ted's parents were on vacation and Jimmy was staying at Ted's friend's house.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When Ted arrived, Jimmy wasn't there and had missed a piano lesson that day; all of that activity was unusual for him because he was a punctual and on-point kid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Eventually the police were called in and then the FBI. Search teams were sent out to look for Jimmy and people were questioned, especially Ted and the rest of his family members. Susan Smith had recently been arrested for drowning her children and lying about it to authorities and in the media, so the FBI wasn't going to overlook a potential family member's role in Jimmy's abduction.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Despite their interrogation tactics, the FBI turned up no leads. The search parties found no trace of Jimmy for 3 months. Until one day a neighborhood woman realized she was missing some jewelry and a handgun. She suspected her farmhand of stealing them and went to the trailer he was living in on her property to look for the missing items. She didn't find her jewelry or handgun, but she found Jimmy's backpack and one of Jimmy's missing person's flyers\u00a0in it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The farmhand was arrested and, after numerous wild goose chases and tall tales, he finally confessed to kidnapping, murdering and disposing of Jimmy's body.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Ted and his family were distraught. The case went to trial the next year; Ted left college, stopped eating and generally didn't function even in the most basic sense of the word. It took several years before he even began to turn his life around.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And he believes he was only able to do so because of martial arts and fitness. He found principles and tools in each of those areas which have helped him not just cope with his horrible loss, but also find empathy and compassion for others. What he has learned from training his body and the mental discipline of martial arts is the joy and happiness that comes from serving people and how to help those who need it AND are willing to work for it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In this episode, we talk about Ted's early life of course because it was so crucial in his path, but also how he applies nutrition, fitness and the principles of resilience to lead a warrior's life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Ted's message is a powerful one and he shares it from his heart, it's one of the many reasons I wanted to have him on the show. There's plenty more\u00a0Ted and I talk about, I hope you'll listen and digest all the great takeaways...and then start applying them to your life for self-mastery.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.alphamanproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ted's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlphaManProject\" target=\"_blank\">Ted\u00a0on Twitter</a><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Smith\" target=\"_blank\">The Susan Smith Case</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Plenty.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Jesse Elder is a present day successful entrepreneur and business man who\u00a0started his career in the underground bar fight scene and learned some startling self-mastery lessons along the way. He joins The Art of Charm to share his lessons, his keen insights and authentic views on life, love and business.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>More About This Show:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Jesse's path began like it does for many people: he took martial arts as a kid. He loved it and by the age of 15, he was teaching courses. He had the benefit of having teachers who\u00a0were always happy to get out of the way once they had given the help that was needed and Jesse thrived on that support. By 17 and 18, he was competing and quite successfully so.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Around this time, the UFC was gaining in popularity and one of his local clubs began to offer bar fight night on Thursdays. They rolled out a wrestling mat on the dance floor and whoever wanted to, could step into the ring.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">He thought this was an opportunity he would regret not seizing so he went for it. And that first night, he entered two fights and won both. A new path opened up for him; in addition to bouncing and teaching, he started fighting regularly and built up a reputation.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">One summer in particular, he\u00a0simply kept winning. Until he faced one particular opponent. This man was 40 pounds heavier than Jesse and, unbeknownst to Jesse, was greased up with Vaseline. No matter what Jesse did, he couldn't get a handle on this guy and couldn't bring him down. For three full rounds, he sparred and tried his very best but to no avail. Jesse could not bring him down and Jesse lost, in front of hundreds of people including friends, family, and his students.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">When Jesse left the match, he told his crew to take him to the hospital because he couldn't breath. It felt like he was sucking air through a coffee straw.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">At the hospital, the doctor told him his nose was moved over an inch from where it should be, he had a concussion and his left lung was collapsed. But as Jesse sat there taking it all in and seeing what his family and friends who were waiting for him were going through, he asked himself: How I am doing right now? And the strange part was his answer: I am fine.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Jesse thought, who is this I if I am fine? He understood it wasn't his body, which was racked with pain, but the energy that animated his body. For so long he had associated himself with his body, but now he understood he was far more than that.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">He also got that he couldn't change someone else's experiences. He saw his friends and family going through what they were going through when he was in the hospital, but he couldn't change that for them. It was their own\u00a0independent experience to have. That was one of his first lessons in self-mastery.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">That moment in the hospital was absolutely pivotal for him.\u00a0He stopped caring what others thought of him, and started seeing other people as an extension of himself.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Within a year, he opened his own martial arts school and sought out successful mentors to help him understand the business side of things, he knew nothing about sales or marketing. He soon understood his success wasn't going to rely on how great of a martial artist Jesse was, but how well he served others.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Not long he understood and implemented those practices, the business was earning six figures a year, then six figures a month and about the time Jesse sold it, the business was reaching six figures a WEEK.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">So why would he walk away from that? That brings us to his second lesson in self-mastery: he realized he was done with it. It was time to move on to the next thing, the next phase of his life. He sold his business to a partner and walked away from it because he wanted to work with people outside of (or not just within) the martial arts world.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Soon after, he\u00a0started coaching. His first program was done all via grassroots marketing efforts, meaning he sent people private messages on various social media outlets about the program and enthusiastically encouraging them to sign up! There was no funnel system, no landing page, none of that. He simply had the idea to go for it one day after he posted a video about self-mastery and got tons of great feedback. He wanted to help people upgrade their lives, in any and all areas.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And that's exactly what he does today and why he joined us for episode 298. There's so much more Jesse and I talk about, I hope you'll listen and digest all the great takeaways in this show...and then start applying them to your life for self-mastery.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://jesseelder.com/\">Jesse's web site</a></span><span style=\"color: #323333;\"><br /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrElder\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">Jesse on Twitter</span></a><br /> </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"color: #323333;\">You'll also like:<br /> <a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</span></a><br /></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\" style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</span></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Or is there a new 3.0 version we can put into practice to\u00a0make a difference in the lives of everyone in our circles?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Derek Coburn is a master networker and author of <em>Networking Is Not Working.</em>\u00a0He believes there is a better, natural way to fulfill the art of networking. He joins us for episode 296\u00a0to talk about what works, what doesn't work and how successful people network differently than the typical \"big event\" style.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #d01d00;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://bombfell.com/charm\">HATE CLOTHES SHOPPING?

Some of those people have read books on the next level up of networking or the \"how can I help you now so you help me later?\" genre.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">But neither of those apply to what Derek says networking is. To him, networking is about connecting with others in your circles so everyone is\u00a0enriched\u00a0in the process.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And this is most definitely something that happens outside of those big box-type networking events. Derek says you don't need those events and they probably won't do much to help you expand your relationships, your business/career path or any other area of your life. For the most part, they are useless.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Why is that? Because, according to him, no one is who any good at networking is actually going to those events. The best and the most successful\u00a0networkers won't be there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Derek goes on to explain the various versions of networking (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0) and why 3.0 is where it's at it today.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">According to Derek, in version 3.0 you can truly make yourself stand out among anyone else by adding value to all of your relationships through networking. That's the power of 3.0. A great example he gives is his 3 for 1's as he calls them. In the past, if he had a set of 4 tickets to a sporting event or a tournament he was sponsoring, Derek would invite 3 of his clients and the four of them would hang out together.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Sounds great right? Sure, it was a good time for all of them. But Derek realized his clients would have an even better time if they were there with their friends, not a couple of guys they didn't know very well. So from then on, he began giving away 3 tickets for every 1. He gave his client a ticket to an event and then told him to invite 3 of his buddies and have a good time. Naturally, his clients loved him all the more for it.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">When Derek and his wife started the CADRE group, they wanted to help members gain referrals. Instead of just asking for referrals, they created an email template they could send out to anyone they wanted to invite to an introductory session.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Even if you don't have your own business, you can take the principles of both of these examples and apply them to your life. Derek is always thinking about how to benefit others in his life and how he can make their life more enjoyable and more fulfilling. By adding value to their lives, they remember him and return his generosity.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Think about: who do you know amongst your circles who would benefit from knowing each other? Derek also shares with us the proper way to make those introductions and pave the way for a clear connection between your two people. There's a definite way to make fruitful introductions and a way NOT to! Derek walks us through his thought process before doing so and we talk about introductions we've made on each other's behalf and what we'd do differently next time.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">There's plenty more to discover from Derek in this episode. He truly is a masterful networker and connector who has taught me a TON and I know he'll do the same for you. Have a listen and let me know what you think in the comments or send me an email!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.derekcoburn.com/\">Derek's web site</a></span><span style=\"color: #323333;\"><br /> <a href=\"http://www.cadredc.com/\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">Cadre DC\u00a0</span></a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.derekcoburn.com/book/\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\"><em>Why Networking Is Not Working</em></span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"color: #323333;\">You'll also like:<br /> <a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</span></a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</span></a></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

For those of you who haven't heard of this company, it's a cutlery company that has the (according to John) best in class product, these are some of the finest knives in the world. And Cutco offers a top of the line training program for anyone who joins the company to sell.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">They've been around for over 60 years and John still holds the record for most sales made.

His family never had a lot of money so gifts were incredibly rare and special. But it wasn't until he was in college and working for Cutco that he saw the true potential in the art of the perfect gift.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia;\"><span style=\"color: #323333;\">He approached his then-girlfriend's father, Paul, who was known to be a generous gifter to his clients. John\u00a0</span>pitched him the idea of giving Cutco pocket knives to his clients.\u00a0Paul\u00a0asked if he could engrave the knives. John was puzzled. He agreed, if\u00a0Paul\u00a0would\u00a0tell him why he wanted engraving. Paul's response was:\u00a0\"If you take care of the whole family, everything else will take care of itself.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">What he learned from Paul was\u00a0how to be memorable with clients, how to stand out with people who already get gifts and how to gifting can make a considerable difference in all relationships, from business to personal.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia;\"><span style=\"color: #323333;\">A great example of how John would do this: he'd find a CEO he wanted to connect with, then the CEO's wife name. He'd</span>\u00a0take a carving set and engrave the wife's name on it. Then he'd write a note that would accompany the carving set, it would say: \"Carve out 5 minutes for me, I promise it'll be worth it.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Naturally, John would land a meeting with the CEO. The CEO would be impressed with John's youth and fortitude. John would further cement that strong impression by explaining to the CEO how they'd set up employee appreciation programs.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And John would typically get the CEO's business.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Over time, John began to see that most of his clients were Type A business men, men who were terrible at gift giving both at home and at work.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">He realized he could capitalize on this by creating a company solely focused on appreciation and gift-giving.\u00a0He has since\u00a0trademarked the term <em>Appreciative Leadership.</em>\u00a0And today he and his team speak, teach and consult for million dollar companies to 20 billion dollar companies, as well as professional sports teams. They help these people understand and implement ways to stand out and be memorable in any and all facets of their lives.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">So how do you apply gifting in your own relationships, business and personal?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia;\"><span style=\"color: #323333;\">John says a</span>s humans we have to have something tangible to remember each other by, photographs are okay but they tend to get put away and forgotten. A memorable gift, however, can stay with someone for a lifetime.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">There is a\u00a0subconscious effect of giving: we're all built for reciprocity. Take a look at a meeting of any heads of state, especially Asian cultures but really across all countries. When heads of state meet each other they offer gifts. The\u00a0item you give is a token of how much you value the relationship.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">In business, how much is it worth to you to have your clients take your phone call? If it's worth a lot, giving a memorable and thoughtful gift is the perfect way to assure they'll pick up when you call.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">In your romantic relationships, many women speak the language of gifts. If you really understand why women want a big ring when you get married, you'll understand why they value presents so much. To them the ring you give her (and other gifts before and after), are a symbol of how much you value her. She feels validated every time she looks at that ring.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Even if you aren't at the ring stage, a thoughtful gift will have a similar effect: if you give her something that shows you understand and cherish her, every time she sees that thing she'll be left with that feeling.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And after you do get married, the gift-giving shouldn't stop there. In fact, that should be the beginning. Marriage is much like running a business, it's work but it's worthwhile in that you'll get out of it what you put into it. And giving thoughtful gifts on special occasions and NOT so-special occasions will be a worthwhile investment.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">If gifts are so important, how can you start giving good?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">John says to start by making a list of your key relationships on paper. Then jot down the\u00a0short-term and long-term value (monetary if it's a business relationship) of each.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Next you're going to write down everything you\u00a0know that\u00a0makes them tick, brings them joy, their most important people, etc. The more info you have on them on paper, the more you'll be able to do with that information when it comes to finding appreciation gifts.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">John has a few rules of thumb he follows.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">In business, he never gives a gift between Thanksgiving and Christmas. He says everyone gives gifts then and they're always the same tired gifts of wine, fruit, etc.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">In his personal relationships, he says to\u00a0pick at least 2-3 dates a year that are not birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's Day occasions. Those are typical gift-giving days, you want to find a few atypical dates. These atypical dates are when you will send flowers, chocolates, or some other little memento to say \"I love you, I'm thinking about you.\" This is the only time you're allowed to send the typical flowers and chocolate-type gifts. These surprise gifts will go along way in your relationships.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">There's plenty more advice and gift-giving guidelines in this episode with John. Please join me in thanking him for being here and generously giving of his time, talents and experiences. He's a goldmine in every sense of the word, I hope from now on your gifts reflect what you learned here with him!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://johnruhlin.com/\">John's web site</a></span><span style=\"color: #323333;\"><br /> <a href=\"http://ruhlingroup.com/\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">John's Business site</span></a><br /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruhlin\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">John\u00a0on Twitter</span></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"color: #323333;\">You'll also like:<br /> <a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</span></a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</span></a></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Indeed it can according to our guest for show 293, Michael Port.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Michael has been on such notable TV shows and films as\u00a0<em>Sex and The City</em>,\u00a0<em>Law & Order</em>,\u00a0<em>Third Watch</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>The Pelican Brief</em>. He's a highly sought after keynote speaker and New York Times best-selling author of several books, including\u00a0<em>Book Yourself Solid.\u00a0</em>Today he's taking what he learned from his\u00a0television and movie days and applying it to the written word and to the speaking stage and he joins us to share all that and more on this edition of The Art of Charm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">By most accounts, Michael achieved success in his acting career: he was being cast on multiple top TV\u00a0shows and landing roles in hit movies. But it wasn't working for him, and he got out of the \"biz\". Looking back on it now, he\u00a0says he\u00a0was impatient\u00a0and didn't do the work he needed to do\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\">to get those juicy roles he really wanted.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">He'll also tell you doing this\u00a0was his own form of self-sabotage; he shot himself in the foot with a poor attitude. And that poor attitude was his way of controlling the outcome. He was so passionate about being a great actor that he was afraid if he really went for it and didn't get it, he'd have failed. To avoid that, he simply made up excuses and didn't do the necessary work to get the roles he wanted the most.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Michael's learned from that time in his life, and today\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\">he leaves everything he has in the room or on the stage when he speaks. He is done pretending he doesn't care anymore, now people know how much he's going to give.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And acting actually helps him do so. He says he does this (and you can too) by\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\">amplifying different parts of his personality so he can develop a character appropriate for particular scenes. He understands the backstory, the situation, the conflict and the resolution; and by doing so, he can\u00a0increase the conflict in a positive way.</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In other words, he allows himself to become the person he needs to be and to risk what needs to be risked to achieve his goals. He knows the\u00a0more risk taken, the more profound the experience of achieving that goal.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">The finer details of this show include:</h3>\n<ul style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Where did \u00a0the concepts in<em>\u00a0Book Yourself Solid</em>\u00a0originally come from?</span></li>\n<li>The two reasons\u00a0he is called \"the uncommonly honest author\".</li>\n<li>What's the key to the roles we play in life?</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The first rule of improv: what is it and why should you care?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Why he'll never hire someone who plays the devil's advocate</span>.</li>\n<li>And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">How do you take greater and greater risks to raise the stakes in your own life? How do you reach\u00a0that resolution and fulfill on your goals?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">By\u00a0making really big, public promises. If you don't make big promises and don't fulfill them, nothing happens.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The risk is all in that promise. no matter what you do for a living.\u00a0If you make a promise that is just bigger than you think you can deliver, then you're in\u00a0an exciting and compelling place. Now you'll have to reach up to deliver on that the promise you made. And when you do, you'll be center stage. And this applies to every area of your life: relationships, business, all of it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Michael says you stay center stage by adopting the first rule of improv: always be a \"yes and\" person. What he means by that is keeping the energy of a situation alive. Don't be a naysayer, a doubter or play devil's advocate. If you think someone's idea or new concept is crazy, there's a way to help them critically think about\u00a0it without raining on their parade. And it all starts with saying \"yes and\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Is that the same as\u00a0being a \"yes man\"? No, according to Michael. There's a difference between being a \"yes and\" person and being a \"yes man\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If you're simply a \"yes man\" (or woman), you go along with anything in any scenario. If you're a \"yes and\" person you jump into the energy of the situation and\u00a0keep it moving forward, while still being aware of what's happening around you. That's where things get interesting in life!</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One final topic we discuss is Michael's eating disorder and how it spurred his growth and his ability to connect with others.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For twenty years, he was a compulsive binge eater who managed to hide his secret. Til one day he had had enough. He was done; he would no longer eat his \"trigger\" foods and that was that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">From that day forward, his life changed. His income doubled that year because he wasn't playing small by hiding out. He also noticed a rather interesting occurrence: when he would share something personal about himself (like his eating disorder) with others, in return they would be vulnerable and open up to him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It was that turning point that showed him the\u00a0true strength in vulnerability and how being open and candid allows you to authentically connect with others. You instantly become more relatable and trustworthy, with everyone in every setting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the show today, he had one final message to share with you: k<span style=\"color: #000000;\">eep thinking big about who you are and what you offer the world; together we can do a lot more for the world than we can do alone.\u00a0Please join me in thanking him for being a part of The Art of Charm, and let him know you heard his message loud and clear.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.michaelport.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelport\" target=\"_blank\">Michael\u00a0on Twitter<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.bookyourselfsolid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Book Yourself Solid</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.thinkbigmanifesto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Think Big Manifesto</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Contrarian-Effect-Typical-Opposite/dp/0470237902\" target=\"_blank\">The Contrarian Effect</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.beyondbookedsolid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Booked Solid</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:<br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode, <a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0 This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Probably not says our guest for episode 292, Tony Blauer.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Tony is a self-defense expert and options facilitator who teaches people (from law enforcement to civilians) how to defend themselves in an ambush scenario, like being held up at an ATM or a thief in your house. And he teaches people without using any martial arts. In this show he talks about simple ways to pay attention to your intuition, read an attacker\u2019s intention and get yourself out of trouble\u2026and plenty more.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Times; color: #323333;\">More About This Show:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">I originally met Tony a few years ago when I took his class while at a Counter-Terrorism Summit; it was awesome. Tony is the\u00a0head of Blauer Tactical Systems (TBS), a\u00a0leading consulting company that specializes in the research and development of\u00a0close quarter tactics &\u00a0scenario-based training.\u00a0As the leader of TBS, Tony\u00a0has developed systems like S.P.E.A.R. and High Gear, and many other programs.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">As part of his work, for the last two decades Tony has studied\u00a0the\u00a0body\u2019s physiology to find out\u00a0what is in our genetic wiring that has allowed us to survive when other species perished.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">He says part of it is your startle response. When it is working in conjunction with your\u00a0instinctive intuitive system, it alerts you to danger and creates awareness\u00a0so you can take appropriate action.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">In this show, Tony and I discuss\u00a0how to hone those physical survival instincts and awareness, why martial arts doesn\u2019t work and might even get you killed, when to listen to that bad feeling you\u2019ve having because it may save your life, how to devalue yourself as a victim and how to manage fear to get a better read on the situation you\u2019re in.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Honing those survival instincts is the first key to protecting and defending yourself and your loved ones. But you do need to practice using it. Fear is like\u00a0fitness, you can exercise it according to\u00a0Tony. In that respect, fear is good for you. If you face it and confront it, you get stronger and your fear management skill set becomes more adept.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">If that\u2019s true, then why doesn\u2019t practicing martial arts work? Because when fear kicks in, the part of the human brain that gets activated is the amygdala and the cognitive centers of the brain get bypassed.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">And where is your martial arts training is stored? You guessed it, the cognitive regions. In other words, when fear kicks in you don\u2019t have time to think and you react instinctively. That\u2019s why Tony says you must rehearse any of the strategies he gives you. They are abilities you already have, you just need to hone and practice them before you\u2019re actually attacked.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 14px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Times; color: #323333;\">The finer details of this show include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">It\u2019s not who\u2019s right in a fight but who\u2019s ___. Tony fills in the blank.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">How to avoid the victim mindset.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">What\u2019s your reticular cortex and why does it matter?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">The person attacking you wants 1 of 3 things:\u00a0what are they?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">Tony and I share our personal stories about how we avoided being victims.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">When it comes to dealing with any situation where you\u2019re in danger, Tony recommends the 3 Ds: detect. defuse. defend. The first step is to detect the threat. Did you get a bad feeling? If so, now it\u2019s time to defuse the situation. This is where you will shift the power by using your verbal skills. You\u2019ll say something that gets in their head so you have time to shift psychological gears and better defend yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">The verbal defusing is where you devalue yourself as a victim.\u00a0One scenario Tony gives is this: if someone confronts you with a knife and wants your wallet, say \u201cHey that\u2019s an awesome knife, I collect them. I\u2019m going to give you my pants and my wallet and buy that knife from you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">That would obviously throw off your attacker, it\u2019s not a response they\u2019d be expecting. By throwing them off, you buy yourself time to evaluate the situation further. Does it seem like they are backing down or do they not care that you just offered to buy their knife? If they\u2019re backing down, continue the verbal defusing. But if they haven\u2019t paused at all based on your response, you know they want more than just your wallet and they may be trying to kidnap or kill you. That\u2019s when you need to know how to physically fight back by gouging someone\u2019s eyes, and any other number of practical self-defense moves Tony\u2019s team will teach you.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">And while using the 3 D\u2019s to get yourself out of the situation, fear management will play a big role. Tony says it is possible to stay calm when faced with a frightening scenario like being attacked. The Golden Rule of self-defense, according to Tony, is accept what is happening.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">There\u2019s tremendous comfort in denying what is a scary situation but the sooner you accept what\u2019s really going on, the sooner you can take action and get out of harm\u2019s way. It\u2019s a natural human process to deny the fear: it\u2019s called cognitive dissonance. Your brain can\u2019t rectify the reality of the situation and so it makes excuses to keep you comfortable and keep you feeling like you\u2019re safe, even when you are not.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">When you do realize you aren\u2019t safe, Tony says you have to fight back:\u00a0those who fight back are more successful than those who cooperate in 100% of cases.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Tony is a master at the science of self-defense and reading dangerous situations; it was terrific to have him on the show and get his insider knowledge on how to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 14px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Times; color: #323333;\">Resources from this episode:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #d01d00;\"><a href=\"http://www.tonyblauer.com/4105/01_01_home.asp\">Tony\u2019s web site</a><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><br /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SPEARsystem\">Tony\u00a0on Twitter<br /> </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tony+blauer\">Tony\u2019s videos on YouTube</a><br /> <a href=\"http://iamalpham.com/\">I Am Alpha\u2019s web site</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/IamAlphaM\">I Am Alpha on YouTube</a></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #d01d00;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You\u2019ll also like:<br /> <a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcas</a></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

You'd call him Tai Lopez.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">An aspiring Renaissance Man, Tai has excelled at a variety of endeavors and has learned as much as possible along the way. In this episode we talk about a host of topics including how to earn and deserve what you really want in life, why the 4 Hour Work Week is a myth that won't make you happy, why you should go straight to the top when seeking counsel and why the more you learn, the more you'll earn...and loads of other valuable content.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">More About This Show:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Tai is clearly a man with a passion and zest for living. He has what most of us would consider the \"good life\": he's healthy, wealthy and dates beautiful women. And he's learned what it takes to earn all of those things: he says you have to deserve it and you have to work for it...but it is yours for the taking when you do.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He believes books like Tim Ferriss' \"Four Hour Work Week\" give us the mythical notion that we only have to work four hours a week and we'll make $10k a month in passive income. Once we do that, we can go out and do the things we love to do, like learn the art of the tango in Argentina. Tai disagrees, he doesn't believe financial success happens by only working four hours a week, nor can we find real happiness that way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">He believes there are three types of happiness: the hedonic life or a life built around the pursuit of pleasure (which is the category most people pursue after reading \"The Four Hour Work Week\"), the authentic life and the meaningful life. It's in the last one that we find the most joy and the most fulfillment; we reach this state by aligning our work and our love. So loving what we do is key.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another contributing factor\u00a0to our happiness is experimenting. To that end, he spent 2.5 years living in an Amish community as an experiment. He wondered what it would be like to live without a material focus and he knew living with the Amish would be the ideal setting to conduct his experiment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">The finer details of this show include:</h3>\n<ul style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Associative Cognitive Bias: what is it and how does it work?</span></li>\n<li>Why he loves Ray Croc of McDonald's story.</li>\n<li>How fear impacts our brain and how to annihilate it.</li>\n<li>The hereretical factors that influence women's attraction.</li>\n<li>What is selective proceptivity and why should you care?</li>\n<li>And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Coming from a very humble background, Tai has long been fascinated by people who have done great things with their lives. He's made it a habit to study these people, and he has a few practical tips he's learned along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The first tip he gave was the 1/10th rule. He says<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0whoever you copy and surround yourself with and idolize, at best you'll do 1/10th of what they do. In other words, if you want to learn how to earn money and you copy, study and idolize people who have made money you're going to earn 1/10th of what they earned. So you have a choice: copy, study and idolize people making $500,000 and you'll earn $50,000 OR copy, study and idolize people who earn $300 billion and earn $30 billion. It's up to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The other tip he has is the 33% rule. It goes like this:\u00a0spend 33% of your time with people below you, mentor others. Then spend 33% of your time with people at your level, friends, etc. Spend the remaining 33% of your time with people above you, people you are uncomfortable being around because they are so much further ahead than you are. These are the people who are 10-20 years ahead of\u00a0you. Most people don't do this last one and it's critical to growing, learning and earning more.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">His final tip is to learn more so you earn more. He has rich friends and he has poor friends, he never lets friends go just because they aren't at his same level. He says the difference he sees between his rich friends and his poor friends is that his rich friends are constantly learning. Invest your time and your energy in learning more and getting better at what you do in life.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">All three of\u00a0these tips highlight the importance of going straight to the top when you're seeking advice or you want to learn something. Tai says to be humble enough to listen and learn from everyone, because ultimately everyone has something to teach you. But in the end, heed the advice that feels uncomfortable to you: that is how you'll know it's truth.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Tai goes on to say\u00a0if you're going to learn from the best and heed their advice, you have to go after it.

Is it just a matter of will power and determination, or is there more to it than that?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Joining The Art of Charm to answer all these questions and more is Dr. Heidi Reeder. In episode 290, Dr. Heidi provides the science and the data behind the most pressing commitment quandaries in business, relationships and life in general.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Times; color: #323333;\">More About This Show:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">What exactly is commitment? Dr. Heidi, who has written for \u201cPsychology Today\u201d and appeared on \u201cThe Today Show\u201d, defines commitment as being psychologically attached to something and intending to stick with it. So it\u2019s a longer term process and perspective than determination and will power.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Dr. Heidi would know, her career focus is taking rigorous social science research and finding the application for it, such as her book \u201cCommit to Win\u201d and the 40 years of research it\u2019s based on.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">In this episode, she shares evidence that commitment is more than determination and will power, the 4 main factors that predict commitment, what random rewards are and how to utilize them in our relationships, and whether moving in together before marriage is a good idea\u2026 and many other commitment-related topics!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">On the first topic, Dr. Heidi says the differentiating factor that makes a commitment a commitment is that commitment has a long-term perspective: you\u2019re psychologically-attached and you stick in there to find and create the good. It\u2019s like wedding vows, they are a promise you make on your wedding day. Your commitment is everything you do after that day.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 14px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Times; color: #323333;\">The finer details of this show include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">Sliding vs deciding: what is it and why does it matter to your relationships?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">Familiarity does tend to breed liking: true or false?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">The sunk cost effect: what is it and what does it have to do with commitment?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">Why people with the gold memberships at the gym never show up?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">The Forbidden Fruit Hypothesis: fact or fiction?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;\">And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">She also explains the four factors that predict commitment: treasures, troubles, contributions and choices. She also explains what each of these are. Treasures are the things that we value in a situation like a job or a relationship. If it\u2019s a job do we feel our skills and creativity are being fully utilized? Are we being paid appropriately? Things like that.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Troubles are obviously the detractors in the situation. Is our commute to work terrible? Does our boss not respect us? All of these are troubles.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">By nature as humans we look at the balance of these. Do our treasures outweigh our troubles? Then we\u2019re satisfied. If troubles outweigh the treasures, we are not satisfied which may lead us to look for a new job.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">One interesting point she raises is that satisfaction doesn\u2019t equate to commitment. That\u2019s where the other two factors of commitment come into play: contributions and choices.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Contributions are what we\u2019ve put into the situation. If you\u2019ve been at your job for a decade, you\u2019ve invested a lot of time and energy. If you\u2019ve helped build the company, you\u2019ve invested a lot of \u201csweat equity\u201d. In either situation, you\u2019ve made considerable contributions to your work situation which may cause you to stay.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Which segues next\u00a0to\u00a0the fourth factor: choices. Even if you\u2019ve been with your company for 10 years and helped build it, if you believe you have choices (either real or imagined) it can play a significant role in how committed you are to your job.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Another fascinating topic is random rewards and how this is useful in increasing commitment in our relationships. A random reward is something unexpected, some kind of reward we receive out of the blue. For example, everyone can bring flowers or cook on Valentine\u2019s Day but if you do it on a date that has no significance you\u2019re providing a random reward for your significant other. There is immense satisfaction we receive from random rewards.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">And I asked Dr. Heidi something I was dying to know: what does science say about living together before marriage? Science says if you move in together as a trial run and then you decide to get married, you are significantly more likely to get divorced.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">BUT you can move in together if you already know you want to marry each other before you live together. Dr. Heidi explains the scientific data behind both statements and a whole lot more on this show.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">The topic of commitment is an intriguing one and I was thrilled to have Dr. Heidi\u2019s scientific knowledge explain what it is, what the components of it are, how to increase our commitment levels, and how those components impact our life choices from work to relationships to marriage. I hope you enjoyed this one as much as I did!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 14px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Times; color: #323333;\">Resources from this episode:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #d01d00;\"><a href=\"http://www.heidireeder.com/\">Dr. Heidi\u2019s web site</a><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><br /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heidireeder\">Heidi\u00a0on Twitte<br /> </a><a href=\"http://www.heidireeder.com/#!commit-to-win/c1ybo\"><em>Commit to Win</em></a>, Heidi\u2019s book<br /> <a href=\"http://iamalpham.com/\">I Am Alpha\u2019s web site</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/IamAlphaM\">I Am Alpha on YouTube</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">You\u2019ll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #d01d00;\"><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\" style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a><strong style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Today we talk about the two parts of every communication, as well as how our unconscious\u00a0 determines most of our communication, how we can influence the emotions of others by cultivating those emotions within ourselves, the primal power of vocal tonality and how to focus on our own emotional power in crucial moments to leverage it for success.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://bombfell.com/charm\">HATE CLOTHES SHOPPING?

He was a professor of public speaking and earned a Ph.D. in rhetoric. Til one day a friend of his asked if he wanted to see if he had what it takes to make in the real world. The invitation was to join the governor of Virginia\u2019s office as a speech writer. And so Nick accepted the job, pole-vaulting his career in a new and public direction.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Since the governor\u2019s office, Nick has written testimony for Congressional members, he\u2019s written speeches for Fortune 50 CEOs, TED talks and TV. He\u2019s certainly well-versed in communication and the impact it has on our lives.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And one of the things he\u2019s studied at length is the role our unconscious plays in our behaviors, our actions and our results.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">He says our unconscious guides our actions, including our body language. And in order to control this we must be aware of the internal conversation happening in our minds and our bodies and then practice shifting them. When you can control your own attitude, you can reset your unconscious to dictate positive behaviors which will lead to positive outcomes.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">You can confidently walk into that all-important meeting or securely ask out that amazing woman by retraining yourself to perceive the situation in a positive way. Visualization is a key tool to use. It\u2019s what Olympic athletes do to reassure their unconscious mind that things are going to go exactly as they want and they will be victorious.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">In short, Nick says we have to align our beliefs and our intent, then our body will fall in line. We shouldn\u2019t leave it to chance, we really can take charge of our unconscious communications. It takes time and practice but there is big, big pay-off.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>The finer details of this show include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Body language or content: which wins every time?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">How many millions bits of information is our unconscious mind taking in every second?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">What is the friend or foe zone and why does it matter?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Why charisma isn\u2019t something you\u2019re born with.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Can you read others\u2019 body language to know what they\u2019re going to do before they do?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Nick and I talked about so other fascinating topics. Like did you know you can influence other people\u2019s emotions by being in a particular state yourself? Mirror neurons work unconsciously to reflect the emotions of people around us. If someone\u2019s in a bad mood, you can usually feel it. If someone\u2019s happy, it\u2019s equally contagious. You can use this effect to your advantage: if you want someone to feel relaxed and happy around you, tap into those feelings yourself. Their mirror neurons will pick up on that and they\u2019ll begin to feel relaxed and happy with you, often without knowing why.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Another facet of this topic we tapped into is how to read others body language to know what we\u2019re receiving from them. Most of us know about the open and closed body language signals, but by simply listening to our own unconscious reactions and feelings about the other person we can know what they are feeling. From knowing this you can determine what they\u2019re about to do, before they do it.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">One last piece we discussed - which was utterly fascinating to me - is vocal tonality. Did you know that when we get people together in a room, we unconsciously elect a leader with the sounds of our voices? It\u2019s true we do. And within 5 minutes after a small group has gathered, we line up our undertones and overtones with the person who is the leader of our group.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">The great thing about this discovery is that we can increase our own undertones in our vocal range to increase our chances of being perceived as a leader. Nick gives us some real-life examples that highlight this phenomena.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Nick was a veritable wealth of information on the importance of understanding and controlling our unconscious mind and it was a pleasure to have him on the show.

Is there really a \u201cmath\u201d gene or can anyone, with enough practice, become great at Algebra?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Hunter Maats, our guest for episode 287, says if you\u2019ve learned one thing in your life, you can learn anything. And he is here to share the science that supports this belief.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>More About\u00a0This Show:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Hunter Maats, founder of Straight A Conspiracy and Harvard graduate, \u00a0joins the Art of Charm to talk about numerous aspects of how and why we learn. To name just a few topics, we discuss the impact emotions have on our learning experience, the fallacy of genes giving us certain traits and not others, what the worst idea ever is and why you should forget it immediately, the danger of the 10,000-hour rule, and automaticity.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">On the point of emotions impacting our learning experiences, Hunter says science is now showing us that attitude and perspective make a significant difference in our ability to learn and retain something.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">For example, if you\u2019ve ever said \u201cI feel stupid\u201d you\u2019re exemplifying his point. Stupid is associated with an actual feeling - shame. If we get something wrong and take it personally, we feel ashamed of our mistake and call ourselves stupid. There\u2019s nothing genetic about it, it\u2019s just our emotions and our personal association with the mistake.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">If we could change our perspective to simply acknowledge our mistake, examine it to learn where we went wrong and what we could do differently next time, we remove the shame and the feeling of being \u201cstupid\u201d.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">You can change any experience, any mistake you\u2019ve made by shifting your perspective and your attitude. Again, it has nothing to do with \u201ccertain genes\u201d giving you certain talents. If you\u2019re willing to learn from a past failure, you can improve in that situation going forward. And if you approach every failure this way, you\u2019ll do nothing but get better and better.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Need a quantifiable example? Airplanes. Though they weren\u2019t the safest machines when they were invented, today they are a regular part of most people\u2019s travel plans. And do you know why? Because after every airplane failure, the situation was examined until it was uncovered where things went wrong and what could be done to prevent the same mistakes in the future. Those preventions were put in the place each time a mistake was found and today, airplanes are safer than walking.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>The finer details of this show include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Team Descartes and Team Newton: dispelling the myth of gravity's discovery</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">What\u2019s the best way to get people interested in you?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Bill Bradley\u2019s practice strategies that led to becoming one of the greatest basketball players ever.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">The lesson from a Stone Age village in Papua New Guinea</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Why ADD medications effect everyone EQUALLY: the science behind it.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">After Hunter and I cover that topic thoroughly, we discuss what he calls \u201cthe worst idea ever\u201d. What is it exactly? The idea that some people are either born smart or stupid. He says toss that idea out - stop thinking that you\u2019re either smart or not, you either have \u201cit\u201d or you don\u2019t.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Science has yet to find a gene for above average to genius level intelligence. We haven\u2019t found any evidence to support a genetic link to intellect. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t one, but we haven\u2019t found one yet. So get rid of that concept so it stops holding you back.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Though we haven\u2019t found any genes that make one person more intelligent than another, we have found our brains to be flexible and adaptable.\u00a0 It\u2019s something we have as human beings: a capacity to adapt to our surroundings and circumstances. And that boils down to our brain\u2019s capacity to change and learn new things when we allow it to.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Think that\u2019s a myth? Hunter talks about a village in Papa New Guinea where they were living at a Stone Age development level: no one could read or write let alone use modern day technology. However within two generations there has been a tremendous shift. First one man learned to read. Then this man\u2019s son taught himself how to use a computer! They went from not understanding a written language to using a computer. So if you think you can\u2019t learn to be charming, think again.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And that led us into a discussion about the 10,000 hour rule made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. Hunter is in full support of this rule, with one contingency: be aware of the quality of those 10,000 hours. In other words, don\u2019t focus on the quantity of the practice, focus on the quality of it. Hunter calls this fix it focus practice. Pick something you want to work on - something specific - then fix whatever isn\u2019t working in that area and then focus on fixing it. Once it\u2019s fixed, move on to the next big.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">If you were a basketball player and wanted to become great, you would focus on one thing you didn\u2019t do well like free throws. That\u2019s your area to look at what isn\u2019t working and then fix it by working at it until you\u2019ve got it down. You would do nothing but free throws until you were great at them and then you\u2019d move on to the next thing, focus on that and fix it.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">One last topic we touched on was automaticity, or how our brains can do anything if we practice often enough. Think about it: you couldn\u2019t read, speak or walk when you were born. But you practiced and practiced speaking until you mastered it\u2026then you moved on to walking until you mastered that and then on to reading. And today you do all three without thinking about them: that\u2019s automaticity and it\u2019s the most important trait of the human brain.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">We talk about plenty of other fascinating and cutting edge topics. Hunter seems to know every author and every book ever written about the human brain and he drops so many of them in this show! Be ready to add a LOT of titles to your reading device of choice after you tune in.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">A big shout out to Hunter in thanks for having me join him in person in Los Angeles; it was great to do a live show and go deep into such fascinating subject matter.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>Resources From This Episode</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"http://www.thestraightaconspiracy.com/\">Hunter's web site</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/huntermaats\">Hunter on Twitter</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/str8AConspiracy\">The Straight A Conspiracy on Twitter</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/\">Quiet: The Power of Introverts</a><span style=\"color: #323333;\">, Susan Cain</span></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Sports-Gene-Extraordinary-Performance/dp/1591845114\">The Sports Gene</a><span style=\"color: #323333;\">, David Epstein</span></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393317552\">Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</a><span style=\"color: #323333;\">,\u00a0Jared Diamond</span></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"http://www.boysadrift.com/\">Boys Adrift</a></span>, Leonard Sax, M.D., Ph.D.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113514\">Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and The Brain</a><span style=\"color: #323333;\">, Eric Hagerman</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

But is that really true? Does the quantity of sleep\u00a0we're getting\u00a0matter or is this a case of quality over quantity? And\u00a0what does sleep do for us anyway, is it that important?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Shawn Stevenson, our guest for episode 286, says it definitely matters. His philosophy\u00a0is that\u00a0good sleep is one of the most important things we can do to get healthy and stay that way. Today we talk about why sleep matters, the impact lack of sleep has on our health and how an orgasm before bed helps us all sleep better!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>MORE ABOUT THIS SHOW:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">At the young age of 20, Shawn was diagnosed he had degenerative disc disease at 20: had the spine of an 80 year old. He saw 5 doctors and they all said it was incurable, there was nothing they could do. He lived with this diagnosis for 2.5 years, asking \u201cwhy me\u201d and questions of that nature.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And then he decided to get well. With that decision, everything changed. He started to ask what is it that I need to do to change, to get healthy? And one of the things he changed significantly was his sleep. Six weeks later, he had lost 30 pounds and his back pain was gone.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Today he helps others change their sleep and other aspects of their health to get well\u00a0or stay healthy.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Shawn says sleep is more than just a necessity, it\u2019s a vital component of our health that affects everything and he\u2019s got the science to prove it!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">He calls sleep a force multiplier: it enhances or diminishes our results in any area it touches.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">He says sleep impacts more than just our energy levels, it affects our productivity, our immune system, our hormones, our memory, and even the speed of our aging!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">One specific area we discuss is memory. Memory processing is what helps us convert something from short-term to long-term and it happens during the deep processes of sleep, non-REM sleep. Shawn has learned that when people aren't getting adequate amounts of this type of deep sleep, the brain won't be able to cement what is learned.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">He goes on to say one night of sleep deprivation creates a 14% reduction in glucose getting to your prefrontal cortex, which is the human part of your brain that controls your decision-making processes, your emotions, etc. In essence, you get dumber, crankier and you make worse decisions when you are sleep-deprived because your prefrontal cortex isn\u2019t getting what it needs to function properly.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>The finer details of this show include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">What are telomeres and do they matter to you?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">How lack of sleep ages you faster: the science that proves this.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Shift work is a Class 3 carcinogen: true or false.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Why it's NOT about the number of hours you need.</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Horemetic stressor: when is this a good thing?</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">We don\u2019t stop with the brain though, we talk about how necessary good sleep is to getting and staying fit. Did you know your body actually recovers from a workout when you sleep? It does. So if you aren\u2019t getting into deep sleep, your body isn\u2019t getting what it needs to recover. Sleep is an anabolic process, which just means it is a building process.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Another component of exercise is keeping your body fat low. When you\u2019re not sleeping properly, it actually causes your body to store more fat around your midsection. So if you can\u2019t drop those last few pounds around your waist, it may be because of your sleep.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">You also need sleep to stay young, it\u2019s called beauty sleep for a reason Shawn says! In the first 90 minutes you are sleeping, your body releases its highest levels of something called human growth hormone. Now this isn\u2019t the stuff that makes the sporting news, this is the actual hormone your pituitary gland secretes. And human growth hormone has been shown to keep us young, it\u2019s that thing that kids have that gives them so much energy.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Shawn is a big proponent of taking action to get optimal sleep so he gave us some strategies you can use, starting tonight. One of my personal favorites: why an orgasm before bed provides some of the best sleep possible. There is scientific evidence to prove this and he gives us the lowdown!</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">Shawn was a fun and informative guest; he listed a number of fascinating studies to back up his philosophies. I learned so much from him and I hope you do too.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15.2px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\"><strong>Resources from this episode:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/\">Shawn's web site</a></span><span style=\"color: #323333;\"><br /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShawnModel\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\">Shawn on Twitter</span><span style=\"color: #042eee;\"><br /> </span></a><a href=\"http://www.sleepsmarterbook.com/\"><span style=\"color: #042eee;\"><em>Sleep Smarter</em></span></a>, Shawn's book</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #323333;\">You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia; color: #042eee;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/toolbox\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theartofcharmpodcast.com/best\" style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a><strong style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

The main paradox when it comes to being charismatic that you want to create, is to create the paradox of strength & warmth .\" -Isaiah Hankel</span></strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Most people believe charisma is something you\u2019ve either got or you don\u2019t - that you\u2019re somehow born with it. Not so according to our guest for episode 284.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dr. Isaiah Hankel is an author, biotech consultant and successful owner of three multi-national businesses. He\u2019s worked with clients such as Amgen, Pfizer and Roche. And he\u2019s presented at such esteemed academic institutions as Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge and The Curie Institute.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">MORE ABOUT THIS SHOW:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Isaiah Hankel has a Ph.D. in Anatomy and Cell Biology but at one point he was a sheep farmer! He was also diagnosed with ADD and ADHD and he struggled through much of his academic career. It was that struggle which helped him understand how to focus in a way that allows him to create dozens of entrepreneurial endeavors, build thriving relationships and travel the world as a speaker and author.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Today he combines what\u2019s he has learned from his sheep, his academic studies and his entrepreneurial life to speak to audiences around the world on focus, purpose and other topics, like charisma.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">That\u2019s one of the topics we touch on: the actual science behind charisma: what makes one person interesting and another person forgettable. He says the charisma that makes one person interesting can actually be scientifically proven because it can be broken down into components and studied. He gives us the 7 components of charisma and the studies behind each!</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">The finer details of this show include:</h3>\n<ul style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>What is the skill set that 60% of job applicants lack?</li>\n<li>True or false: there\u2019s a small \u201cbrain\u201d in your gut?</li>\n<li>The best and worst days to ask for a raise, according to studies.</li>\n<li>What trick can you use if you find your mind drifting while talking to someone?</li>\n<li>People 90% more likely to get this after a raise, what is it?</li>\n<li>And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of the key components of charisma we talk about at length is being present. And we don\u2019t mean \u201cI\u2019m one with the Earth now\u201d or creepy, scary tool guy present! The kind of present we mean is showing up to give another person or a project our undivided attention and focus to effectively create partnerships, relationships, and the business results we want.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We go into the other six components of charisma (expressiveness, sensitivity, self-control, clarity, mystery and paradox) in detail too. We discuss what each component means, the scientific studies behind the importance of each component and tools to begin practicing today.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">One of the fundamental takeaways to get from Isaiah is that charism and the ability to influence others is knowing when and what is best for the other person, not just yourself.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We went on to talk about other aspects of emotional intelligence and sensitivity, one of the components of charisma. For example, Isaiah also tells us why reading fiction material actually increases emotional intelligence. He points out which types of fiction do this the best, so you can take action on this nugget now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Other actionable content Isaiah shares is willpower depletion and how to rule your emotions with an iron fist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the topic of willpower depletion, Isaiah gives us two scientific studies that prove we have a finite amount of willpower we can use throughout the day and how stress and worry actually deplete those levels and lower performance.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On ruling your emotions with an iron fist, he shares how we can stay even-keeled no matter what emotions we\u2019re feeling or their intensity levels. By simply doing the opposite of what we\u2019re feeling we can balance our emotions out. He also gives us a specific question we can ask ourselves to rule our emotions with an iron fist - both awesome nuggets you can use right now!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dr. Isaiah really was a fascinating guest, clearly he\u2019s got the charisma thing down because I will remember this episode for a long, long time! I think you\u2019ll get a ton of actionable items out of this interview so I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.isaiahhankel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Isaiah's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/isaiahhankel\" target=\"_blank\">Isaiah on Twitter</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.isaiahhankel.com/book\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Black Hole Focus</em></a>, Isaiah's book<br /><a href=\"http://theartofcharmpodcast.com/2014/04/21/robert-greene-mastery-48-laws-power-episode-250/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Greene on The Art of Charm</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Hour-Between-Dog-Wolf/dp/1594203385\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The\u00a0Hour Between Dog and Wolf</em></a>, John Coates<br /><em><a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/books/freakonomics/\" target=\"_blank\">Freakonomics</a></em>, Steven D.

He also shares how that process led to his \u201cLess Doing\u201d brand, which is devoted to helping men do less and live more through optimization, outsourcing and automation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">MORE ABOUT THIS SHOW:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Ari\u2019s journey began at the age of 20. He had the brilliant idea to renovate some old cigar factories into lofts and he set about doing so. What he had expected to take six months, turned into three years and over $3 million in debt. He spent those three years learning every construction trade he could and invested every bit of himself in that development.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And in the process, he destroyed his body. He was smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, drinking every night and eating fast food a few times a day. Within a month of finishing his construction project, he was given the diagnosis of the incurable Crohn\u2019s Disease and handed prescriptions for 16 different pills, 16!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Never one to be thwarted by circumstances, Ari decided he wasn\u2019t going to settle for all the misery and discomfort associated with Crohn\u2019s. Instead, he set out on a journey of self-tracking and self-discovery to finding out what would heal his body. Within four months he was off ALL his medications and six months later he was competing in a triathlon.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">The finer details of this show include:</h3>\n<ul style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>What is Crohn\u2019s Disease and what led to his diagnosis?</li>\n<li>How he defines being \"cured\" of Crohn\u2019s.</li>\n<li>The two main things that were the most helpful in curing his Crohn's.</li>\n<li>What's the Zeigarnik Effect and what does it have to do with To Do lists?</li>\n<li>His $8 biohack for better sleep in one night.</li>\n<li>And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Though he learned much about the body and he\u2019s since applied that knowledge to help others treat and cure their Crohn\u2019s, the most profound lessons he learned through his healing process were on the topics of being more effective and more efficient in using your time. He discovered he had times of the day and days of the week when he was more effective. By taking that knowledge and using it to schedule corresponding tasks, he was able to be most his most efficient.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For example, he found he is most creative after 8pm and he gets the most done on Tuesdays (the least on Fridays). So now when he has to do something creative, like write a blog post, he knows not to try to write it until 8pm or later at night. And if he has a lot to get done, he schedules the bulk of it for Tuesday.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">From that experience and with those practical lessons under his belt, he created the Less Doing brand. Now he works with clients, about half are men, to help them do what he has done: optimize, outsource and automate. He believes, and has proven in his life, that by becoming more efficient and effective, you create the head space to come up with amazing ideas that have been obscured by all the other crap you\u2019re focused on.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Another fascinating topic we talk about is why \u201cTo Do\u201d lists don\u2019t work and why they\u2019ll destroy your productivity. There\u2019s an actual psychological effect that proves his theory and we talk about in this show.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Ari was a truly fantastic\u00a0guest and it was awesome to have him here. He teaches so much about making the most effective use of our most precious commodity: time. He suggests some great tools and even an awesome biohack technique for better sleep, one I\u2019ve never heard before. So tune in, check it out and get more living with less doing!</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.lessdoing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ari's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/arimeisel\" target=\"_blank\">Ari\u00a0on Twitter</a><br /><a href=\"http://lessdoingbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Less Doing Book</a><br /><a href=\"https://followup.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Follow Up</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.boomeranggmail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boomerang</a><br /><a href=\"https://evernote.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Evernote</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.myaquanotes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua Notes</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Blue-blocker-Aviator-Pilot-Vintage-Sunglasses/dp/B007NNL1JQ\" target=\"_blank\">Blueblocker Sunglasses</a><br /><a href=\"http://marriedmansexlife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Married Man Sex Life</a><br /><a href=\"http://theartofcharmpodcast.com/2014/03/13/athol-kay-married-man-sex-life-episode-239/\" target=\"_blank\">Athol Kay on the Art of Charm\u00a0</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.

Of not knowing when she\u2019ll go from zero to crazy in .002 seconds? And what about your own hormones - can you manage them yourself so that you don\u2019t feel tired and achy when you get up in the morning and grumpy when you come home at the end of the day?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Our guest for today\u2019s show says yes to all of those questions. Dr. Sara Gottfried, author of The Hormone Cure, is a Harvard-trained medical doctor, wife, mother and yogini. And she\u2019s here to give us the scoop on male and female hormones.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">MORE ABOUT THIS SHOW:</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dr. Sara is, as she puts it, board-certified in everything that can go wrong with a woman\u2019s body. She knows firsthand what it\u2019s like when hormones go haywire and it was her own personal experience that led her into deeper discovery on the topic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After sorting out her own hormonal imbalances, Dr. Sara decided to specialize in helping others do the same with their hormone levels. Today she treats both men and women.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">She\u2019s also written a book on how to properly treat hormone imbalances and in this episode she shares much of her knowledge, her personal experiences and a lot of \u201chow to\u201d advice on all things hormones.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">The finer details of this show include:</h3>\n<ul style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n<li>The three words to say to your woman when she's complaining.</li>\n<li>What is adrenal burnout?</li>\n<li>What common birth control method can shrink the clitoris by as much as 20%?</li>\n<li>What's the hormonal cause of Grumpy Old Man Syndrome?</li>\n<li>What is tilt and why does it ruin many relationships?</li>\n<li>And so much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dr. Sara and I dive deep into these topics and many more. We talk about the importance of knowing your woman\u2019s hormonal cycle and how to cope with her different needs at different times of the month. For example, there are certain times when your woman will benefit more from getting together with her friends than she will from being with you. Dr. Sara tells us how to know when your woman needs her friends and when she needs you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also talk about the three main hormones for men and women. They are different (naturally) and Dr. Sara explores each.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">For men, the top three are called \u201cThe Three Amigos\u201d and they are testosterone, cortisol and thyroid. For the ladies, she dubbed their top three hormones \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d. They are estrogen, cortisol and thyroid.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">She tells us why each hormone is important to their respective gender, how to know if any of the big three hormones are off-balance and what you can do to reset them to normal, healthy levels if needed. She also explains why you should get them checked regularly, at least every six months.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We also\u00a0discuss\u00a0the subject of tilt: what it is, why it happens and what to do about it. Tilt is when our nervous system gets overwhelmed. Tilt has a major impact on our overall personal health and also on the health of our relationships. Dr. Sara gives us symptoms to look for when questioning whether we\u2019re in tilt or not and how to cope if we are and how to help our woman cope if she is.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">And two other topics I made sure we touched on are the importance of orgasms in hormonal health and the three types of girls you should run from! Dr. Sara weighs in on both.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We packed SO much into this episode of The Art of Charm! I think Dr. Sara and I could\u2019ve talked for a few more hours; she was an amazing guest with a fountain of knowledge. I really appreciate how generously she shared her time and her wisdom; I hope you enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed interviewing her!</p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px;\">Resources from this episode:</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.saragottfriedmd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Sara's web site</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com//DrGottfried\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Sara\u00a0on Twitter</a><br /><a href=\"http://theartofcharmpodcast.com/2014/06/27/dr-jeffrey-leake-insulin-carbs-hormones-episode-280/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Leake on The Art of Charm</a><br /><a href=\"http://onetaste.us/\" target=\"_blank\">OneTaste</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.drweil.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Weil, MD</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.imagorelationships.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Imago Relationships</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.canaryclub.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Canary Club</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.wellnessfx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WellnessFX</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">You'll also like:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/toolbox\" target=\"_blank\">-The Art of Charm Toolbox</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"http://www.TheArtOfCharmPodcast.com/best\" target=\"_blank\">-Best of The Art of Charm Podcast</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>HELP US SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">If you dug this episode,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">please subscribe in iTunes and write us a review</a>!\u00a0\u00a0This is what helps us stand out from all the fluff out there.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>Ways to subscribe to The Art of Charm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.iTunes.com/theartofcharm\">Click here to subscribe via iTunes</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://feed.pickuppodcast.com/podcast.xml\">Click here to subscribe via RSS</a></li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/art-of-charm/pickup-podcast-9283\">You can also subscribe via Stitcher</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><strong>FEEDBACK + PROMOTION</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Hit us up with your comments and guest suggestions.
