In this episode you'll hear about the distinct advantages and disadvantages of using these services from the driver's perspective. For me, the biggest downside is probably having limited control over your earnings when the company's decide to cut rates. One friend in Denver explained that just this year Uber cut rates by 20%, and then cut them by an additional 20% a few months later. It's similar in the affiliate marketing space, when the advertiser decides to cut your commission. There's not always a lot of recourse, although in that case you can generally try and negotiate to keep your higher rate in exchange for preferred placement or something like that.
