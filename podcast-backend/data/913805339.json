In Season 1, Alex Blumberg told the story of launching this business, Gimlet Media, a podcast network.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Season 2, Alex is joined by co-Host Lisa Chow, to follow an entirely new company. The business is Dating Ring, a dating company that combines technology with old-fashioned matchmaking. The founders are women in their 20s, outsiders in the male-dominated world of Silicon Valley. And over the 10 episodes, we'll take you inside that world. Some of the challenges they face are different from Alex\u2019s: founder disagreements, hellish fundraising, and sexism. But just like Gimlet's story, theirs is also a transparent account of something that happens everyday in America, but we rarely get to see firsthand: starting a business.&nbsp;<br /><br />", "duration": "1770", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/02/a1/a1/02a1a1d9-01c0-ec58-af8f-f230f5f1e181/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/02/a1/a1/02a1a1d9-01c0-ec58-af8f-f230f5f1e181/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.hearstartup.com/~r/hearstartup/~5/TnWsuVLFidk/GLT6732031595.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["startup", "Blumberg", "Alex", "business", "entrepreneurship", "podcast", "company", "network"]}, {"seriesId": 913805339, "seriesTitle": "StartUp Podcast", "pubDate": 1423962000, "title": "#14 Where We Are", "author": "hearstartup@gmail.com (Gimlet)", "summary": "An end and a beginning&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />", "duration": "2065", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/02/a1/a1/02a1a1d9-01c0-ec58-af8f-f230f5f1e181/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/02/a1/a1/02a1a1d9-01c0-ec58-af8f-f230f5f1e181/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.hearstartup.com/~r/hearstartup/~5/odkRu3NR4vA/GLT5995614380.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["startup", "Blumberg", "Alex", "business", "entrepreneurship", "podcast", "company", "network"]}, {"seriesId": 913805339, "seriesTitle": "StartUp Podcast", "pubDate": 1422752400, "title": "#13 Fake It Til You Make It", "author": "hearstartup@gmail.com (Gimlet)", "summary": "Episode 13 addresses a question that has been dogging us since the company\u2019s beginnings: Are we a technology company or a content company?<br /><br />This question led to months of debate.
