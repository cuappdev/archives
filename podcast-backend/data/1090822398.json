She had to slow down, prioritize her health, and figure out what was really important in her life. She discovered what mattered most by getting rid of everything that didn\u2019t matter at all. In the end it all came down to love and health.<br /> She went from a busy, overwhelmed advertising director to spending 2-3 hours every morning taking care of herself, loving her work, and being present and engaged with the people she loves. Her family changed, too. They moved from wanting bigger closets, nicer furniture, and more stuff to downsizing into a 750 sq. ft apartment with no storage.<br /> Courtney has written books, courses, and hundreds of articles to help you simplify your life and work so you can focus on what really matters.</p> <p>The original posts are located here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bemorewithless.com/track-your-spending-mini-mission\" target=\"_blank\">http://bemorewithless.com/track-your-spending-mini-mission</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://bemorewithless.com/how-my-starbucks-addition-fed-a-community\" target=\"_blank\">http://bemorewithless.com/how-my-starbucks-addition-fed-a-community</a></p> <p class=\"c1 c1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/ofdpodcastreview\" target=\"_blank\">Please Rate & Review the Show!</a></p> <p class=\"c1 c1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://OLDPodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Me Online at OLDPodcast.com</a></p> <p class=\"c1 c1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">and <a href=\"https://oldpodcast.leadpages.co/leadbox/140249e73f72a2%3A14136e0c2f46dc/5682617542246400/\" target=\"_blank\">Join the Ol' Family to get your Free Gifts</a>!</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "09:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/33/f0/e4/33f0e496-f74f-4cc5-55d9-bb216a210b65/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/33/f0/e4/33f0e496-f74f-4cc5-55d9-bb216a210b65/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/optimalfinancedaily/Optimal_Finance_Daily_106.mp3?dest-id=359832", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1090822398, "seriesTitle": "Optimal Finance Daily: The Best Of Personal Finance | Minimalism | Investing", "pubDate": 1469174400, "title": "105: Questions and Answers with the Washington Post - Part 5 by Mr. Money Mustache (Retire Inspired with Passive Income)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Mr. Money Mustache fields a ton of finance and early retirement questions.

She had to slow down, prioritize her health, and figure out what was really important in her life. She discovered what mattered most by getting rid of everything that didn\u2019t matter at all. In the end it all came down to love and health.<br /> She went from a busy, overwhelmed advertising director to spending 2-3 hours every morning taking care of herself, loving her work, and being present and engaged with the people she loves. Her family changed, too. They moved from wanting bigger closets, nicer furniture, and more stuff to downsizing into a 750 sq. ft apartment with no storage.<br /> Courtney has written books, courses, and hundreds of articles to help you simplify your life and work so you can focus on what really matters.</p> <p>The original posts are located here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bemorewithless.com/worth\" target=\"_blank\">http://bemorewithless.com/worth</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://bemorewithless.com/unconsume\" target=\"_blank\">http://bemorewithless.com/unconsume</a></p> <p class=\"c1 c1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/ofdpodcastreview\" target=\"_blank\">Please Rate & Review the Show!</a></p> <p class=\"c1 c1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://OLDPodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Me Online at OLDPodcast.com</a></p> <p class=\"c1 c1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">and <a href=\"https://oldpodcast.leadpages.co/leadbox/140249e73f72a2%3A14136e0c2f46dc/5682617542246400/\" target=\"_blank\">Join the Ol' Family to get your Free Gifts</a>!</p>", "duration": "09:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/33/f0/e4/33f0e496-f74f-4cc5-55d9-bb216a210b65/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/33/f0/e4/33f0e496-f74f-4cc5-55d9-bb216a210b65/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/optimalfinancedaily/Optimal_Finance_Daily_068.mp3?dest-id=359832", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1090822398, "seriesTitle": "Optimal Finance Daily: The Best Of Personal Finance | Minimalism | Investing", "pubDate": 1464681600, "title": "067: How to Make Money in the Stock Market - Part 2 by Mr. Money Mustache (Quick & Dirty Financial Tips Like Dave Ramsey)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Mr. Money Mustache walks through the basics of stock market investing.
