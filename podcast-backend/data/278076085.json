Here are many bookish podcasts for you to check out! (Keep in mind, what's included here is just the list. For descriptions of the podcasts, be sure to listen to this episode.)\n\n \tCheckout the Podcasts - Books & Authors thread at the BOTNS Goodreads Group for an existing list of podcasts\n \tThe Readers\n \tLiterary Disco\n \tLiterally Unplanned\n \tAdventures with Words\n \tBook Riot has several podcasts, including The Book Riot Podcast and All the Books\n \tMashreads\n \tDrunk Booksellers\n \tOverdue\n \tWhat Should I Read Next?\n \tThe New York Times Book Review Podcast\n \tSpoiler (the new podcast from the hosts of The Reading Room)\n \tPW More to Come\n \tA few Penguin Random House podcasts: Beaks & Geeks, This is the Author, and Book Club Appetizer\n\nLastly, we recommend several non-bookish podcasts:\n\n \tGood Job, Brain\n \tWait Wait...

The novel follows British soldier Captain Tom Barnes, but, in a unique twist, the story is told from the points of view of objects that interact with Barnes: dog tags, boots, medical instruments used to keep him alive after an explosion powered in part by another \"narrator\" - a bag of fertilizer.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend The Girls by Emma Cline. This debut novel follows a young teen in Northern California of the late 1960s, who gets pulled into a Charles Manson-like cult. The writing is astonishingly good and it will surely be one of my favorite books of 2016.\nAnn also loved The Girls, and mentions listening to You Must Remember This, a podcast about old Hollywood, that did several episodes about the Manson murders.", "duration": "50:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/XgsaODqab-c/BOTNS387.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcasts", "books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1465340404, "title": "BOTNS #386: The Final Interrogation", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "We answer your burning questions, and then recommend The Happiness Equation by Neil Pasricha, and Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you to everyone who sent us messages, tweets, comments, etc. about the ending of\u00a0Books on the Nightstand.

I won't recount every question and answer in these show notes\u00a0(you can listen to the podcast for that!), but here are a few questions for which the answers have links:\n\n\tJessie from Maine asked if we'll continue to recommend books via social media (yes - twitter: @AnnKingman and @mkindness, and Michael is using Litsy more).\n\tYes, Heidi, the Books on the Nightstand Goodreads group will continue to exist!\n\tJoanne asked about becoming a more focused reader. Ann recommends taking a creative writing class (like the one she took at Grub Street in Boston), and also reading Francine Prose's Reading Like a Writer.\n\tAnne asked about how we create the podcast. Awhile back we wrote up our workflow for a presentation we did at BEA. You can find that info at the very end of these show notes.\n\n\n\u00a0\nTwo Books We Can't Wait For You to Read\u00a0(51:44)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI recommend The Happiness Equation by Neil Pasricha. It is one book in a sea of books about happiness, but it is speaking to me in a way that other books haven't. Filled with 9 secrets informed by insights gleaned by the author as well as wisdom from past great thinkers, The Happiness Equation is showing me simple things I can do (and am doing) to be happier every day.\n\nAnn recommends Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi. It's the story of two half-sisters (each unaware of the other) in 18th-century Ghana. One is married\u00a0off to an Englishman who is a slave trader, and the other is slave, sold by this man. The book then moves forward, tracing the descendants of these two women. Ann knows that this will end up being one of her favorite books of 2016.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBooks on the Nightstand Podcast Workflow\n\n\n\tMichael and Ann each record on Zoom H2 microphones in their own home offices, while talking on the phone with headsets. Each uses a pop filter while recording to cut down on hard p and s sounds.\n\tWe alternate editing duties on a weekly basis. The person who is not editing sends their .wav file to the one who is editing.\n\tEditor uses Audacity to combine the two files. Editor tightens the file by removing mistakes, coughs, etc. Intro music and intermission tracks are added.\n\tFile is exported into MP3 format and uploaded to Libsyn (podcast host).\n\tShow notes are written in Wordpress, hosted at HostGator. URL of Libsyn file is plugged into Wordpress post, and post is published. Post is automatically distributed to iTunes, Instacast, Stitcher, etc.\n\tShow is linked and promoted through Twitter, and other social media\u00a0networks.\n\nApproximate time - Recording: 1 hour \u00a0- Editing: 1 hour. - Show notes - 30 minutes.", "duration": "1:02:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/tezJSfU-Hb4/BOTNS386.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcasts", "books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1464731305, "title": "BOTNS #385: Our final Booktopia Petoskey author talks", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "Author talks from Booktopia Petoskey, including W.

It's the story of Evie's childhood, some\u00a0of which she spent visiting family in Australia. She was obsessed with sharks and shark attacks, and those memories and experiences are brought to vivid life via that unusual juxtapositions of art style and color.\n\nAnn recommends Sweetbitter by Stephanie Danler. It's\u00a0the story of a young woman indoctrinated into working at a high-end NYC restaurant (based on the real-life Union Square Cafe). Stephanie Danler actually did work at the Union Square Cafe and that background brings a level of reality to this work of fiction.", "duration": "40:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/JJkZ1sOhnWc/BOTNS384.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcasts", "books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1463603499, "title": "BOTNS #383: Women in books and bookstores", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "Sad author news, a roundup of book news featuring girls and women, and two books we can't wait for you to read.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBooklovers, especially Michael, \u00a0are mourning the passing of two authors that have touched many with their work.\n\nKatherine Dunn, author of Geek Love, died at age 70.\n\nDarwin Cooke, writer and artist of Michael's favorite superhero graphic novel ever, DC The New Frontier, passed away at the age of 53.\n\n\u00a0\nAudiobook of the week (04:49):\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Be\u00a0Frank With Me by Julia Claiborne Johnson, narrated by Tavia Gilbert,\u00a0is my pick\u00a0for this week\u2019s\u00a0Audiobooks.com Audiobook of the Week.\n\nSpecial thanks to\u00a0Audiobooks.com\u00a0for sponsoring this episode of Books on the Nightstand.\n\nAudiobooks.com allows you to listen to over 100,000 audiobooks, instantly,\u00a0wherever you are, and the first one is free.

She's partnering with the fabulous Books and Books to open a location in Key West, Florida. I'm dying to visit. If you go, please let us know how it is.\n\tThe Nebula awards for 2015 were given out this past weekend, and of the six major awards, five were given to women.\n\nThe winner of Best Novel, Uprooted by Naomi Novik, was an Audiobooks.com Audiobook of the Week in episode #337, chosen by Michael.\nOther winners:\nBest Novella: Nnedi Okorafor for Binti\nBest Novelette: Sarah Pinsker for \"Our Lady of the Open Road,\" featured in the June 2015 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction\nBest Short Story: Alyssa Wong for \"Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers,\" featured in the Oct. 2015 issue of Nightmare Magazine\nWinner of the\u00a0Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy: Fran Wilde for Updraft\n\n\n\tAfter hearing a lot about a young adult graphic novel called Lumberjanes, which features a diverse group of strong female characters, I was thrilled to see an article in the New York Times:\u00a0Boom Box Comics Tell Stories of Teenagers, With a Light Heart.

I made a pretty harsh pronouncement about the members of The Man Book Club, however my opinion was very much colored by the article and by my slight misreading of it. One of their rules (which they admittedly don't always follow) is no books by a woman about a woman.\n\nAnn and I discuss the possible reasons for this rule and whether it could ever be considered a good thing to limit one's reading this way.\n\nBe sure to read the group's blog post, titled An Apologia, where they respond to the omissions in, and misconceptions perpetrated by, the NYT article. And do check out the list of books they have read thus far.\n\nI officially apologize for my original comment!\n\n\u00a0\n\nTwo Books We Can't Wait For You to Read\u00a0(22:24)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI recommend Paper Girls, Vol. 1, written by Brian K. Vaughan, with art by Cliff Chiang. It's the story of 4 twelve-year-old paper girls in 1988. It's the morning after Halloween, and strange \"people\" are wandering their neighborhood. Are they teenagers still in costume from the night before, or are they something more sinister?\n\nA few weeks ago, Ann recommended Nobody's Fool for our Don't You Forget About Me. She read it recently to prepare for reading Richard Russo's newest book Everybody's Fool. The new book returns to North Bath, NY. It's both funny and tragic, and it revisits many of the characters from the first book, as well as introducing some new ones.

Just 177\u00a0pages, it packs a punch that belies its small size. Most of the novel is set in just 5 hours in the spring of 1924, with the story of a young housemaid who spends her day off in an illicit assignation with the son of the wealthy neighbors. There, her life changes in an instant.\n\nMichael takes a different direction, telling us about the first book in a science fiction trilogy. Sleeping Giants by Sylvain Nouvel starts with a young girl, Rose, who falls off her bicycle into a hole in the ground that turns out to be a chamber that is actually a metal hand. Fast forward 20 years, and Rose is a physicist\u00a0who is helping to investigate the origin of this hand and what it means.", "duration": "33:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/-kkrNRqM8L0/botns381.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcasts", "books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1461718835, "title": "BOTNS #380: A New Batch of Book Awards", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "Litsy, Book Awards, \u00a0plus, don't you forget about 84, Charing Cross Road and Nobody's Fool.\n\nAnn and I are both on Litsy, a new\u00a0photo-focused\u00a0book-based social media app (usernames AnnKingman and mkindness).

It's something that all book lovers should read, and a book I only read myself a few years ago.\n\nThough it's an older book, Ann only recently read\u00a0Nobody's Fool by Richard Russo. On paper, Donald \"Sully\" Sullivan doesn't seem like a character you'd fall in love with. He's a drinking, gambling, womanizer who lives in a dying town in upstate New York.

Some people think they're pretty awful, but there are a few that we think are funny (B.J. Novak/Mindy Kaling, Gary Shteyngart) and some are viral and don't even mention the book.\n\nJessie from Montana asked if the reading we do for work happens during work hours or during evenings and weekends. We definitely do our work reading in off hours, and that's the case for most of the publishing and bookstore industry.\n\nMaryAnne from Oceanside CA asked if either Ann or I write or wanted to be a published author. Ann did want to be an author, until she started working in publishing, and realized how hard it would be! As for me, other than an extremely derivative short science fiction story in grade school, I've never really enjoyed writing. I much prefer to read!\n\nElenor H heard about James Patterson's generosity toward bookstores, booksellers, and libraries, and wonders if author philanthropy common.

Yet Ann found the writing compelling and irresistible.\n\nI recommend Geek Parenting by Stephen H.

She read a whole series and got so excited about how HILARIOUS they are that she mailed all three books in the series to me and is now dying to have me read them AND REPORT!\n\nI'm thrilled she's reading--truly I am--but when the books arrived and I began dipping into them, I immediately recognized they are NOT MY CUP O' TEA!... I am skimming so I can talk about them with her--clearly what she desires--but I can hardly bear the thought of saying anything to her about them.\n\nI may be (am) a book snob, but I surely do not want to be discovered as such, and I sure don't want to rain on her new reading hobby. What shall I do? What would YOU do??\n\n\nOur listener also posted this question on Goodreads and had a number of good suggestions, including helping the new reader to find a book club with similar tastes, and telling the friend that you've been reading so long that you like more \"experimental\" fiction. Michael and I firmly believe that the main thing is to not make the new reader feel judged, but we're not exactly sure how best to do that. I'm in favor of asking the new reader what she liked about the book series, and then finding similar books to recommend.

Are there any \"adult\" version of this? Like a podcast that is a short stories being read out loud? I am looking for like 10-15 minute story rather than an entire audiobook. Thanks so much!\"\nSome ideas for Jen:\n\n\tSelected Shorts\n\tThe Guardian Short Stories podcast\n\tThe Moth podcast\n\tThe New Yorker Fiction podcast\n\tWelcome to Nightvale\n\tThe Archers\n\tor try an audiobook of short stories\n\nMary from Byfield writes:\nI am a retired librarian from a private school in MA. One of my former students contacted me recently and asked for book recommendation for her advanced 9 yr old reader(female).This child wants to read adult books. I listen to your Podcasts and wonder if you have ever considered doing a show on adult books for young readers. Or if you and Michael have any personal recommendations for this query. Thanks for any help...a loyal listener and a die hard reader. Ann...thought you'd like to know the next book to be read on my nightstand is A Little Life...\nWe were a little stumped on this one, so we're looking to our listeners for ideas. A few thoughts we had:\n\n\tMichael immediately thought of\u00a0Uprooted by Namoi Novik\n\tI think this is a great time to introduce classics, because kids of this age aren't yet intimidated by classics. In our house, we started with reading aloud Oliver Twist and Great Expectations, and then my daughter moved on to books that interested her, like Les Miserables, after she had seen the movie.\n\tHave your friend take her daughter into a library or bookstore and let the experts work with the child to figure out what she might like.\n\n\u00a0\n\nspancho asks:\nIs there a single resource for keeping abreast of author lectures and signings? I'd like to hear Hanya Yanagihara but she doesn't seem to have a website... I'm so pleased with the 2016 TOB authors and I'd like to hear from as many of them as possible!\nWe don't know of one, though that's a great idea! We recommend that you go to Library Thing and click the \"Local\" tag (free membership required). That should give you a list of author events near you. Other options are to subscribe to newsletters from bookstores and libraries near you, and to check out author festivals. You may have luck with a particular author by looking at the publisher's website to see if a tour is listed.\n\nPat8 inquires:\nI'm trying to remember where I heard recommendations for novels that revolve around book sellers/bookstores. Len at The Kindle Chronicles thought he'd heard something like this several years ago as well. I've asked over on the Goodreads group as well. Do you remember a list of recommendations like this from a podcast of yours?\nIn BOTNS #138,<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/ZwZqz0xHB9o\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "40:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/P7ZkigSwlps/botns375.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1458090019, "title": "BOTNS #374: Commercial vs. Literary Fiction", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "Defining literary and commercial fiction.

Diving into the research surrounding productivity, Duhigg presents things that were\u00a0discovered by telling the stories of people and teams encountering problems and solving them. The book's\u00a0appendix shows how to put the research and finding to work for you.\n\nAnn recommends All Things Cease to Appear by Elizabeth Brundage, which she says is both literary and commercial (!).

In 2014, author Ellen Oh and 21 other children's book authors and industry professionals began using the hashtag #weneeddiversebooks in response to\u00a0an all-white, all-male panel of children\u2019s book authors at a major book convention. The social media campaign has gone worldwide and has grown into the We Need Diverse Books movement that's bringing this issue to the attention of publishers and readers.\n\nLee & Low Books, the largest multicultural children's book publisher in the United States, recently released the results of a survey they conducted, which shows that the lack of diversity in books and authors published might be exacerbated by the lack of diversity among publishing employees and book reviewers.\n\nThankfully, the discussion of these issues is\u00a0leading to some small changes, such as more diverse participants on author panels, and even the creation of\u00a0Salaam Reads, a new Simon & Schuster imprint that will publish children's books featuring Muslim characters and stories.\n\nAnn mentioned an article about the difficulty of getting an agent in Hollywood if you're a person of color, and wondered if that's an issue with literary agents as well.\n\nThen, there's the story of Marley Dias, an 11-year-old girl from New Jersey who was sick of reading books about \"white boys and dogs.\" Where were the books starring black girls like her? She set out to collect 1,000 books with black girls as the main characters. She quickly blew past that goal, thanks to the help of Twitter, and others. Her quest is serving to educate people, including teachers and librarians. Way to go Marley!\n\n\u00a0\nTwo Books We Can't Wait For You to Read\u00a0(29:16)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnn recommends What Belongs to You by Garth Greenwell, which is getting much critical praise lately. The unnamed main character, an American teacher, meets Mitko in a Bulgarain public bathroom and pays him for sex. He returns to Mitko again and again in this gorgeous, uncomfortable novel that Ann said felt like a literary masterpiece from the first page.\n\nIn the vein of Just Mercy, Ghettoside, and Between the World and Me, I recommend Evicted by Matthew Desmond. A difficult, but vital\u00a0look at the eviction process and how, once caught in it, it can be so hard to escape. This is one the most important books you'll read this year.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/9L4ZFdEThcw\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "40:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/R0CXd2Akh8E/BOTNS372.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1456279321, "title": "BOTNS #371a \u2013 Oops", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "Hi all, Ann here.\n\nEpisode 371 was accidentally published with the incorrect audio file (episode 317 -- you can see how it happened).\n\nI've fixed the file so that if you received it via email or find it through the website, you'll have the correct file.

Coverage of these authors' deaths went beyond the book community into the national news. We were pleased to see the outpouring of stories and postings about how these authors influenced many of today's readers and writers. Lee, of course, is best known for To Kill a Mockingbird, and Eco was best known for his historical mystery The Name of the Rose.\n\nA few articles about Harper Lee and Umberto Eco:\n\n\t\"Harper Lee, author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' dies at 89\"\n\tUmberto Eco, 84, Best-Selling Academic Who Navigated Two Worlds, Dies\n\t\"Translators to be eligible for Man Booker Prize\" (Umberto Eco on his translator William Weaver)\n\t\"When Harper Lee, of \u2018Mockingbird,\u2019 Corresponded With Opus the Penguin\u2019s Creator\"\n\t\"The Dirt-Cheap Apartment Where Harper Lee Would Hide Out\"\n\tUmberto Eco walking through his library (Facebook video)\n\nThe authors' books we mention in this episode:\n\n\tTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\tGo Set a Watchman\n\tThe Name of the Rose\n\tFoucault's Pendulum\n\tNumero Zero\n\tOn Ugliness\n\tHistory of\u00a0Beauty\n\n\nDon't you forget about me (22:05)\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMichael tells us about Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn, a literary take on the noir detective novel, featuring a main character detective with Tourette's Syndrome.\n\nMy \"rediscovery\" of the month is Kindred by Octavia Butler. Butler is now posthumously becoming very well recognized and respected for her work as a science fiction author. Kindred was written in 1979, and is a novel that features time travel. The main character, Dana, is transported from 1976 California to a slave plantation in 1815 Maryland.

Perhaps she hasn't found the right, riveting book yet. Maybe she could try listening to smaller pieces, including short story podcasts like Selected Shorts. It could be the activities she's been doing while listening are too distracting, or maybe she's just not a person who enjoys listening to audios!\n\nAnna from Ohio has just started working on a master's degree in human genetics (wow!) and realizes that she'll have less time to read for fun (her usual fun reading includes fiction, historical fiction, graphic novels, and science writing). She's hoping for recommendations of shorter things to read. Other than collections of short stories, we mention and recommend:\n\n\tThe Best American Science Writing series\n\tThe Best American Short Stories series\n\tThe Best Food Writing 2015\n\tThe Best American Comics series\n\tDaily Lit\n\tVertigo CMYK\n\tVertigo SFX\n\tPoetry\n\tMicro Fiction or Flash Fiction (Rose Metal Press is one of Ann's favorite flash fiction publishers)\n\tEssays\n\n\u00a0\nTwo Books We Can't Wait For You to Read\u00a0(23:51)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnn recommends Flight of Dreams\u00a0(on sale 2/23/16)\u00a0by Booktopia alumna Ariel Lawhon. Her new book explores the tragedy of the Hindenburg, telling the story\u00a0from the point of view of several passengers and crew. Based on fact and using real-life people as characters, the book also includes a fictional locked-room type mystery at its heart.\n\nI recommend Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig, also on sale 2/23/16. Nearly two decades ago, Matt Haig nearly took his own life. This book recounts his struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts in a way that depressives will recognize\u2014whether or not they've contemplated suicide themselves\u2014and every one else can understand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/wSypQxTNG0A\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "32:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/UPzytMIVCo8/BOTNS370.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1455062118, "title": "BOTNS #369: For the love of brackets", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "The Tournament of Books brackets have been announced, and we couldn't be more excited!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nRumors:\nThe book world was abuzz last week with rumors that Amazon was going to open 300-400 new brick and mortar bookstores.

Bryson is now looking at England through the eyes of a long-time resident, and it is both humorous and also a lament to the changing times and landscapes of Great Britain.\n\nMichael recommends The Unfinished World by Amber Sparks, a collection of stories that I love as much as he does. Amber Sparks is a true literary talent, and you should read this and her earlier collection, May We\u00a0Shed These\u00a0Human Bodies.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/Z4LWI1sPusg\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "37:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/EEtW-V3z3lc/botns369.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1454461210, "title": "BOTNS #368: Michael Crummey, Dylan Landis, and Kelly Link from Booktopia Vermont", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "This week we bring you three more\u00a0author talks from Booktopia Vermont 2015, recorded at Northshire Bookstore:\n\n\tMichael Crummey, author of Sweetland\n\tDylan Landis, author of Rainey Royal\n\tKelly Link, author of Get in Trouble\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/eyUd-n3fHZw\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "32:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/L_Mxx97ymYs/BOTNS368.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1453852013, "title": "BOTNS #367: Questions from Abroad", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "We answer listener questions, recommend a historical mystery and a book of poetry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks to all for your well-wishes.

I'm looking for recommendations for my husband as I \"curate\" his reading. He likes \"hard\" science fiction, or books based on current science but extended into the future or an alternative reality. He has read lots of the \"masters\" and has particularly enjoyed William Gibson, Vernor Vinge, Gregory Benford, L.E. Modesitt Jr., John Scalzi, Ramez Naam, Neal Stephenson, Oryx and Crake.

I thought the show did a brilliant job of explaining the characters by way of song, particular in the opener, \"Prologue,\" which points out that indeed, is a \"complicated Russian novel/Everyone's got nine different names\" And that made me want to read (or try again to read) War and Peace.

Ann binge-watched Making a Murderer, and I worked my way through Jessica Jones.\n\nIn addition to watching TV, our families, coincidentally, each ended up doing some purging of clutter, moving some books, and culling some books. These processes put us in mind, of course, of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Marie Kondo's recommendations on getting rid of books doesn't sit well with most true book lovers. (She basically recommends only keeping a few beloved books, and none that you haven't read yet.) Ann and I have each \"Kondo-ed\" our book collections, to varying degrees, and we discuss what that process has been like and how we feel about the books we did keep.\n\nMarie Kondo's new book Spark Joy, expands on her method somewhat and includes many illustrations on her folding methods and other organizational ideas.\n\n\u00a0\nTwo Books We Can't Wait For You to Read\u00a0(29:53)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOne of the books Ann was able to find more easily after reorganizing her books was Lum by Libby Ware. The story follows Columbia who, at age eight, is diagnosed as intersex (physically\u00a0both female and male). In her early thirties she moves among the houses of family members, helping out where she can. This outsider existence is thrown into turmoil when construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway threatens her family's farm.\n\nI recommend Chris Bailey's The Productivity Project, a look a what he learned during the year he spent experimenting with\u00a0multiple productivity methods, strategies, and apps. What I love about this book so far is how \"hands on\" it is: each chapter ends with a short exercise for the reader, exploring the topics and ideas just covered.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/m0w5oVCHuRg\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "38:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/W-PaOtYJuIg/BOTNS364.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1450836098, "title": "BOTNS #363: Favorite books of 2015?", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "In which we discuss listener favorites, Michael's\u00a0favorite books of 2015, and books that I\u00a0love even though I refuse\u00a0to choose favorites.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is our last episode of 2015, as we're taking next week off to spend Christmas week with our families and our books.\n\nWe've closed out the poll of Books on the Nightstand listeners' favorite books of all time, and favorite books published in 2015.\n\nFavorite book of all time: tie between A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving and Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.\n\nFavorite book published in 2015: There was a runaway winner -- A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara.

But I also read so many other books that I loved and it feels unfair to pit them against each other.\n\n\tIn the Country by Mia Alvar\n\tEverything, Everything by Nicola Yoon\n\tThe Book of Aron by Jim Shephard\n\tThe Mare by Mary Gaitskill\n\tEverything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng\n\tEpitaph by Mary Doria Russell\n\tThe Book of Unknown Americans by Cristina Henriquez\n\tGratitude by Oliver Sacks\n\nMichael did make a list:\n\n\tFortune Smiles by Adam Johnson\n\tBetween the World and Me by Ta-Nahesi Coates\n\tBoys in the Boat by Daniel James Brown (on audio, narrated by Edward Hermann)\n\tDevotion by Adam Makos\n\nIf you do want \"Best of\" lists, check out Largehearted Boy, which compiles all of the lists that are published online every year.\u00a0It's a massive, massive list.\n\nAnother fun read was sent to us by a listener: Winners and Losers: Publishers pick the 2015 books they loved, missed, and envied.\n\nHave fun!<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/ASRg2yVCQXU\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "33:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/Be8weSkyv9o/botns363.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1450227651, "title": "BOTNS #362: Are Books Getting Bigger?", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "Belated Bingo.

Are books really getting longer or are we just buying and talking about the books with the biggest page counts? Some of the big and little books we mention:\n\n\tA Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara\n\tThe Goldfinch by Donna Tartt\n\tAll the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr\n\tA Song of Ice and Fire series by George RR Martin\n\tBrave Enough by Cheryl Strayed\n\tOur Souls at Night by Kent Haruf\n\tHabibi by Craig Thompson\n\tThe Sculptor by Scott McCloud\n\n\u00a0\nTwo Books We Can't Wait For You to Read\u00a0(23:02)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nI recommend Mark Bittman's Kitchen Matrix. It's the first full-color Mark Bittman cookbook and its multiple takes on single ingredients and pick-and-choose recipes make it perfect for new home cooks as well as those who've been cooking along with Bittman for years.\n\nAnn has known about\u00a0We Should All Be Feminists by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, for quite some time now. But, prompted by the news that every teenager in Sweden was given a copy of this book, she finally read it, and is making her\u00a0daughters read it too. It's a short book, but its size belies the important messages and discussions it contains.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/0he4E-vP9b4\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "34:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/ifL-R7rFRFE/BOTNS362.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1449624716, "title": "BOTNS #361: Why we like the books we do", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "Alternative book clubs, an \"elevator pitch\" to describe books we like, and new books about knights and gut microbes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI was intrigued by this story, \"The Rise of the Alternative Book Club,\" including a \"walking book club,\" so I thought I'd share it with you.

Please join us as Michael and I explore and try to express\u00a0why we like the books we do. We don't talk a lot about specific titles, but we do mention a few:\n\nStitches by David Small\n\nAsterios Polyp by David Mazzucchelli\n\nJudge This by Chip Kidd\n\nBooks by Wally Lamb. I don't know Wally Lamb was the example that jumped into my mind when we were discussing blurbs, but I do enjoy his books.\n\nWe completely failed to come up with a two-sentence \"elevator pitch\" about what we like to read, and we admire Elaine greatly for being able to pinpoint her preferences so well. What about you? Can you boil down your reading preferences into two sentences that will help others recommend books to you? Share them here, if you like. I'd love to read them.\n\n\u00a0\nTwo books we can't wait for you to read (31:13)\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nMy recommendation this week is Rules for a Knight by Ethan Hawke (yes, that one). Written in the form of a letter\u00a0to his children by\u00a0a Medieval knight who is going off to war, it's a wonderful book of parables and life lessons. This is perfect for ages 10 through adult, or you can have fun reading it to a younger child. I really love the design of the book and the way that it feels in the hand.\n\nMichael recommends Follow Your Gut: The Enormous Impact of Tiny Microbes by Rob Knight with Brendan Buhler, which is an accessible look at the importance of the microbes in our system, and how they impact things like antibiotics, probiotics, and antibacterial soap. It's entertaining and informative that makes a very complicated topic very easy to understand.\n\n\u00a0<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/nN8CnLpXVoA\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "43:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/OkWqcmE4IWQ/botns361.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1449018014, "title": "BOTNS #360: What Do We Call This?", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "The Holiday Gift Guide is here!

We discuss what that category could include, what it should be called (we have no idea), and will categorizing books that way limit their audience?\n\n\tI Feel Bad About My Neck by Nora Ephron\n\tOn My Own\u00a0by Diane Rehm (on sale 2.2.16)\n\tOur Souls at Night by Kent Haruf\n\tMajor Pettigrew's Last Stand by Helen Simonson\n\tThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce\n\tBootstrapper by Mardi Jo Link\n\tThe Woman Upstairs by Claire Messud\n\tAny Human Heart by William Boyd\n\tThe Hot Flash Club by Nancy Thayer\n\tOlive Kitteridge by Elizabeth Strout\n\tThe Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes\n\tThe Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein\n\n\u00a0\nTwo Books We Can't Wait For You to Read\u00a0(23:36)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe Grownup by Gillian Flynn, is a short story newly released in a special small hardcover. The story follows an unnamed narrator who, in her scam job as a medium, is called in to investigate the\u00a0evil that's pervading a family. But is that evil coming from the old Gothic house they recently moved to, or is it coming from the sullen teenage son\u00a0full of\u00a0anger and threats? In true Gillian Flynn fashion, you will be kept guessing!\n\nGratitude by Oliver Sacks, is a beautiful hardcover containing the four essays written for The New York Times by Dr. Sacks in the two years leading up to his death. These powerful and moving essays are filled with universal truths and should\u00a0be read and re-read by everyone.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/gBEebeqUO8k\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "31:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/gmRR7eiC0JQ/BOTNS360.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}, {"seriesId": 278076085, "seriesTitle": "Books on the Nightstand", "pubDate": 1448404883, "title": "BOTNS #359: Cornucopia Redux", "author": "comments@booksonthenightstand.com (Books on the Nightstand)", "summary": "A statement of disclosure; a cornucopia of links, and two books that we don't want you to forget about.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe received a comment asking us to let listeners know when we talk about a book if we've gotten it for free, and to mention when it is discounted. Much of what we read is for work, usually before the book is available to the public. Other times, books are\u00a0sent to us by publicists who hope that we will cover the book on the podcast. When we accept books from publicists, we are careful to let them know that we may not talk about it. Though we do purchase many books ourselves,\u00a0for the purposes of this blog and podcast, it is easiest to assume that we have received the books for free. At no time does the cost (or lack of cost) of a book determine if we talk about it on the podcast. We only talk about books that we recommend, and our recommendations are not determined by the price that we pay.\n\nWe also don't mention specific retailers or sales when recommending books. We encourage you to buy books from your preferred source. When we mention a price, we mention the publisher's suggested retail price. Many booksellers, both online and bricks and mortar, discount some selection of books, be it bestsellers, books sold at an author event, staff picks, etc. The books discounted vary widely between retailers. It's easier for us to just mention the retail price of the book, and let our listeners buy the book where they choose.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nAudiobook of the week (07:47)\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Dumplin',\u00a0written by Julie Murphy\u00a0and narrated by Eileen Stevens, is my\u00a0pick\u00a0for this week\u2019s\u00a0Audiobooks.com Audiobook of the Week.\n\nSpecial thanks to\u00a0Audiobooks.com\u00a0for sponsoring this episode of Books on the Nightstand.\n\nAudiobooks.com allows you to listen to over 60,000 audiobooks, instantly,\u00a0wherever you are, and the first one is free.

We hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks to Hypertext Magazine for interviewing us! If you haven't yet explored Hypertext, please do -- it's a great online magazine featuring fiction, essays, and articles.\n\nMargaret Atwood has lent her name to a line of Certified Bird-Friendly coffee that is available at Balzac Coffee in Canada. This topic is raised in Atwood's novel The Year of the Flood, and I love the real-life way to help the cause.\n\nAfter the horrible terrorist attacks in Paris, Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast has seen a resurgence in sales. Many think that the book represents the best of the French way of life and is a way to celebrate freedom and not let the terrorists win.\n\nThe New Yorker has announced that it will periodically feature novellas on its online site, chosen by Fiction Editor Deborah Treisman. The first one, In Hindsight\u00a0by Callan Wink, is up this week alongside an interview with the author. Some of our favorite novellas are those in Melville House's \"The Art of the Novella\" series, On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes' The Sense of an Ending, and the forthcoming novella from Graham Swift, Mothering Sunday (which will be published in the US\u00a0in April 2016).\n\nWe liked this Time Magazine article on the history of Young Adult as its own category. Did you know that the category developed through the efforts of librarians?\n\nA listener emailed us this article from Inside Higher Ed:\u00a0\"Station Eleven and an Idea for a Cross-Disciplinary Course on Collapse,\" by Joshua Kim.

The idea arose to read one book a month from a list of BOTNS's listener favorites. We'd love for you to include your favorites on the list: your favorite book of all time, and your favorite book published in 2015. You can enter your choices in this form, which we will post in the near future.\n\nMy plan is to spend some of 2016 focused on the personal essay. A few weeks back I talked about Sarah Bakewell's How To Live and how much it made me interested in Montaigne, who is considered to be the first personal essayist. So now I want to read Montaigne, and I also want to explore other personal essays to discover for myself what I like and what I don't about reading essays.\n\nMichael started out by saying that he was going to just read whatever he wants whenever he wants, but stick to reading one book at a time. But then as our conversation continues, it turns out that he also wants to read from a list of short stories. Of course I couldn't let that pass, so I recommended 100 Years of the Best American Short Stories, edited by Lorrie Moore with coeditor Heidi Pitlor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTwo books we can't wait for you to read (28:38)\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMichael recommends Thunder and Lightning: Weather Past, Present, and Future by Lauren Redniss, a graphic nonfiction book of science that it illustrated with incredible images that tell the story of weather in a very unique way. Redniss looks at weather throughout history, from the scientific aspects to the human interest stories behind weather events. It's gorgeous and informative, and very visual, so please do go take a look at the finished book in your local bookstore. Redniss is the author of Radioactive, a book about Marie Curie that was the first illustrated nonfiction to be nominated for a National Book Award.\n\nMy pick for this week is Brave Enough by Cheryl Strayed. This is a book of quotes from Cheryl Strayed's work: Wild and Tiny, Beautiful Things are represented here, but there are also quotes from her interviews and other writings. Strayed's words have inspired many, and people have enjoyed sharing quotes from her work via social media. This collection takes the words out of the context in which they originally appeared, which gives them a weight and power of their own. It's a great gift, which Strayed describes as a \"mini instruction manual for the soul.\"<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~4/ovCict1NcOg\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "38:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/08/7d/d6/087dd673-b967-e2ce-88df-eec649b632ae/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BOTNSPodcast/~5/kq7KNQWa9B4/botns357.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["books", "book", "reading", "publishing", "Random", "House", "literature", "authors", "bookstores", "bookstore", "literary"]}]}
