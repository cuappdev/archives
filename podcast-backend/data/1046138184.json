I definitely didn\u2019t think we would make it this far but I am super grateful to have you here. Today we talk about public speaking. I know a lot of you have a fear of speaking in public but in order to be a great entrepreneur you must learn to be able to be a great communicator. Today I give you my top three tips to help you overcome your fear, become more confident, and become the world class speaker you are destined to become.</p> <p>Most everyone deals with the fear of public speaking and it is certainly one of my number one fears. I was always the student who never wanted to raise their hand in class and was never confident amongst my peers. I knew that in order to become a successful entrepreneur I had to get over this fear and become more comfortable with communicating.</p> <p>The first time I gave a public speech was at a hotel early on in my career to about 30 individuals. I remember opening the meeting in pure panic. I actually considered just leaving right on the spot. There was even a cup of water that I was holding and I was so nervous that I was shaking and spilling the water. When that meeting was over I couldn\u2019t run out of that room fast enough.\u00a0 I then made a commitment to myself that I would never embarrass myself like that ever again.</p> <p>Three strategies to overcome fear of public speaking:</p> <ol> <li>Record yourself giving a presentation to see, hear, and critique your mannerisms.</li> <li>Read aloud and practice putting emotion and life into the words</li> <li>Start modeling other people. Find other speakers whose style resonates with you and study them.</li> </ol> <p>It took years of implementing these three strategies before I actually became pretty good. In the book, <em>The War of Art</em>, it talks about how the things we fear the most, we were actually put on this earth to do. I want you to face your fear and recognize that the fear is an indicator for something you are destined to do. With these three tips you too can become a world class presenter!</p> <p>Quick reminder: I have a live training event coming up on April 7 \u2013 9 that you should strongly consider.

I never quite understood why I did this and now looking back, it is very clear. To be truthful, I actually didn\u2019t believe I had what it took to be a leader. This was a vicious cycle that I was in for years that was extremely frustrating. The thought of having a large organization and being in charge of its direction scared me to death.</p> <p>To attack this problem, you need to do two things:</p> <ol> <li>Recognize that this fear is real and something that you will have to deal with.</li> <li>Then, acknowledge the resistance. Many times in our life the things we fear the most are the things we were put on this earth to do. If you are fearing this idea of becoming a leader than you were probably meant to lead!</li> </ol> <p>Stop letting fear control your business and pressing the snooze button on your dreams, goals, and passions.

Hopefully by now, many of you are using Facebook and creating videos to build your following. Perhaps you are doing this but you are still struggling. This can be extremely frustrating!

However, you must remember that marketing takes time and it is hard work.</p> <p>In this episode I share the formula for how I built my social media following to where it is today. This took me over six months of creating content every day.

I want to share with you a mindset that once adopted, can help you dramatically increase your customer base. Sometimes it is easy to lose focus on customer acquisition when tapping into your own personal network. Today\u2019s episode highlights strategies to increase your effectiveness at reaching out to this network. After realizing these strategies you will be amazed at how much easier it is to acquire customers from within.</p> <p>Customers are the lifeblood of your company. Without customers there is no money and if you want your business to provide true freedom to you and your family, you need a lot of customers! If you have not made it a priority to acquire a lot of customers, that can start to reflect poorly on the rest of your team. If you can lead by example and grow your customer base then your team will follow your lead.</p> <p>Two Questions to think about:</p> <ol> <li>When you think about the people in your life, your family and friends, how many are using your products and services?</li> <li>Of the people not currently your customers, are they already using products or services that are similar to what you offer.</li> </ol> <p>For many of us, the people we know are already using the products and services that we are selling and often times these products are inferior. It is at this point that you must take the mentality of a traditional business owner. If friends and family are using similar products that are inferior is that okay to you? You should expect at the very least they give your products and services a try.</p> <p>A traditional business owner will:</p> <ol> <li>Draw a line in the sand. Expect their network to support their business.</li> <li>Share with people why they are in business and why it is important to them.</li> <li>Make a list of every person that has done a favor for them and ask them to return the favor and try their product or service.</li> <li>Ask their network to TRY their product or service, COMPARE it to the current version they use, and listen to their FEEDBACK.</li> </ol> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Now not everyone is going to like the product or service and that is okay, but in order to be successful and grow your business, it is necessary to have a strong mentality when you approach potential customers. Don\u2019t go so far as to lose friendships and relationships over your business but it is important to let people you know how important your business is to you.</p>", "duration": "17:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e4/a6/fa/e4a6fa6f-b6f3-40f6-dabb-e5051c708b4c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e4/a6/fa/e4a6fa6f-b6f3-40f6-dabb-e5051c708b4c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/bobheilig/Your_Virtual_Upline_47.mp3?dest-id=311387", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1046138184, "seriesTitle": "Your Virtual Upline Podcast:  Personal Branding | Network Marketing | Online Marketing", "pubDate": 1482514367, "title": "46: The Lesson of the Chinese Bamboo Tree", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode we discuss the powerful lesson learned from the Chinese bamboo tree.</p> <p>Network marketers especially but in any business, we put so much pressure on days like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and small business Saturday.

It is much more the little things that you do every day that matter most.</p> <p>The Chinese bamboo tree is a perfect example of this principle. Once planted, this remarkable tree takes four years to break the ground. That is four years of consistent watering and fertilizing with no visual results. Only at this point does the tree begin to show growth when it shoots up to 90 feet into the sky within 6 weeks.</p> <p>My message today is that you have the patience and engage in consistent actions.

relationship between success and failure. \u00a0The only way you can become massively successful in your life, is you have to also become a massive failure.</p> <p>Sounds kind of counter-intuitive, right? \u00a0Here's what successful people know, that most failures do not - the positive you get in your life is actually the BY PRODUCT of the negative. \u00a0You will be successful to the degree that you are willing and able to put up with all the bad, negative \"stuff\" that you encounter.</p> <p>Any goal you have in your life is a 2-sided coin. \u00a0On one side is what you want, and on the

that 20% of the people. \u00a0This is a recording from my \"signature course\" for network marketers, the Breakthrough Academy. \u00a0 \u00a0</p> <p>One of the biggest mistakes I see leaders make, is they spend all their time working with the wrong people. \u00a0They spend time working with the people on their team that NEED, but don't DESERVE their time. \u00a0I like to call these the \"squeaky wheels\", these are the people that don't ever produce but are constantly demanding your time and all they want to do is complain. \u00a0</p> <p>What you need to learn to do is identify and focus on the top 20% of your team, and start spending your time there. \u00a0These are the people on your team that don't NEED, but they do DESERVE your personal time. \u00a0One of the most important things I ever did for my business, was starting to spend more concentrated time helping this group of people. \u00a0</p> <p>In the training you will learn how to identify who the 20%'ers on your team, and I explain a detailed process of beginning to work more closely with them. \u00a0If you can start following this rule and implementing what you learn in this training, I promise you that you won't believe the difference this will make for your business. \u00a0</p> <p>If you are interested in learning more about the Breakthrough Academy you can visit the following link to see all that is

be an incredibly powerful way to generate momentum in your business.</p> <p>The sad reality is however, that most people go about new product launches completely the WRONG way. \u00a0They immediately go to their social media and start posting every day all the information about the new product, and how excited they are to share it with everyone. \u00a0</p> <p>They start \"spamming\" their contact list, thinking that people will just jump all over the new offer just because they put it out there. \u00a0This is NOT the way you want to approach a new product launch. \u00a0You have to view the information that you have about this new product, etc. as a very valuable commodity. \u00a0The information that you have about that new product is a reason for you to reach back out to prospects and re-engage with them. \u00a0When you just freely put the information out there at every opportunity, you lose all of the power. \u00a0In my opinion, it actually de-values the information. \u00a0</p>

implement these things in my team. \u00a0I just expected that the people on my team should automatically \"get it\", and it frustrated me when they wouldn't do the things they were supposed to be doing.</p> <p>In my training today, I share with you how to implement these two things in your team, so you can instantly start seeing better results. \u00a0Start doing some of the things I share with

but never make a decision. \u00a0This also works incredibly well with prospects that have stopped responding to you after initially expressing interest.</p> <p>Anyone looking to become more effective at following-up with, or closing prospects into your business NEEDS to listen to this episode. \u00a0One of the things that I talk about a lot in this training, is the importance of posture and attitude when it comes to the exposure process.</p> <p>If your prospect feels like you \"need them\", then they're not going to be as interested in what you're offering them. \u00a0A lot of times people keep pushing or come across as too \"needy\", and that's why they struggle. \u00a0If you learn to use this method of following-up, you're going to start to start to see prospects respond to you

Your Team</strong></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>This is session is for the leaders out there who are in network marketing or anyone else leading any type of a team.</p> <p>Ask yourself these questions:</p> <ol> <li>Are you frustrated because the people on your team are not showing up or not putting in the work?</li> <li>Are your people not advancing or do they seem to have hit a ceiling?</li> <li>Do you feel that you want it more than they do?</li> <li>Why won't your people follow what you're saying?</li> </ol> <p>Since we are not in the corporate world, it's important to realize that in network marketing, we are building a volunteer army. \u00a0The problem is we have to figure out how to motivate and inspire our team. \u00a0How do we do that? \u00a0By leading them by example.</p> <p>All of us start off our businesses in phase 1, which is recruiting, meeting people and going out there every day to build our business. \u00a0But then we start feeling the need to train the people we have and fall into what is called \"management mode\". \u00a0We concentrate on teaching our team how to do things, in turn being dependent on them for growth. \u00a0So, what will you do when they aren't progressing? \u00a0How do you get them back on track?</p> <p>The highest responsibility of a leader is to lead by example and to demonstrate the correct behaviors to our team. \u00a0Stop and ponder on these important points:</p> <ol> <li>Are YOU part of the reason why you team isn't succeeding?</li> <li>Do you lack personal accomplishments in your business?</li> <li>When was the last time that YOU rank advanced in your company?</li> <li>Are you showing them that's it's possible to hit your goals?</li> <li>When you are in \"management mode\" and not doing Phase 1 activities, how is that affecting your business?</li> </ol> <p>If you have stopped rank advancing, then consider that your people may be struggling with if it's even possible for them. \u00a0Sometimes we need to get a little selfish, get out of management mode, start showing everyone it's possible to getting back to Phase 1.</p> <p>A good example of this is the story of Roger Bannister. \u00a0He was the first person to ever run a 4 minute mile. \u00a0Before him, people thought it was humanly impossible to complete this goal. \u00a0Once Roger Bannister accomplished it, within a year hundreds of others also accomplished this once thought impossible feat. \u00a0</p> <p>What changed? \u00a0It took one person to show the entire world that it was POSSIBLE. \u00a0I challenge you to run the 4 minute mile for your team. \u00a0Show the leaders on your team that it's possible to rank advance and achieve your goals. \u00a0This will encourage them to stretch and achieve their goals. \u00a0</p> <p>Make a decision today to hit that next rank, to get your next promotion. \u00a0Get uncomfortable, get out of management mode, and back to Phase 1 activity. \u00a0Show your team that it's possible to do what they may now think is impossible. \u00a0</p>", "duration": "17:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e4/a6/fa/e4a6fa6f-b6f3-40f6-dabb-e5051c708b4c/source/600x600bb.jpg",
