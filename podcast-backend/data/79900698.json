However, you will have more assurance of the project manager\u2019s future success by conducting a lessons learned evaluation focused on the practice of project management before claiming victory.</p>\n  <p>By sharing the warning signs, right-sizing approach, and lessons learned from these case studies, we hope you will leverage our experience to keep your next project \u201con track\u201d to successful delivery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"uk-alert uk-alert-large\">\n  <p class=\"uk-h3\">PDU Tip</p>\n  <p>This interview is 29 minutes and 57 seconds long.

Here are the abstract and conclusion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>Abstract:</b> There are good possibilities of success when adopting an agile approach in an organization, but five symptoms in particular serve as warning signs that the organization\u2019s agile transformation is not working well.</p>\n  <p>The five warning signs include: (a) no signs of value delivery for over 3 months, (b) teams resisting customer changes, (c) teams \u201cwaterfalling\u201d sprints, (d) customers foregoing involvement in development and testing, and (e) lack of visibility for agile in the organization. Potential solutions for these problems are also described in this paper. Many organizations can solve these problems internally, but sometimes an external resource such as a change agent or an agile coach is needed. By addressing these issues, organizations can increase the chances of a successful agile transformation.</p>\n  <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Agile doesn\u2019t work by itself. Organizations that implement agile with minimal team support and expect it to work perfectly \u201cout of the box\u201d will likely be disappointed. Successful agile adoption depends on factors at the organization and team levels. Organizations need the right mindset, a strong commitment, a culture conducive to implement agile, and the ability to secure resources and outside help as needed. Teams need the training, skills, and empowerment to absorb and implement agile principles. With these factors in place, organizations and teams should be able to build the foundation for agile success.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<a class=\"uk-button uk-button-large uk-border-rounded\" href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/pmpodcast/PM_Podcast_382_2017_01_13_white_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"uk-icon-file-pdf-o\"></span> Click to download the white paper</a>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Episode Transcript</h2>\n<p class=\"uk-text-large\">Below are the first few pages of the transcript.

Here are the abstract and final thoughts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Almost all large enterprises are making some transition to agile practices. There are many approaches to scale agile in the large enterprise, and we\u2019ll give an overview of the most common scaled approaches and their limitations. This paper also discusses the most common challenges our customers\u2019 teams are facing when scaling agile and provides suggestions to overcome those challenges.</p>\n  <p><b>Final Thoughts:</b> This sounds like a daunting task\u2014to transition to agile approaches in a large organization. However, with solid collaboration and communication, it\u2019s absolutely doable. Teams will constantly be collaborating through elicitation, answering questions, and testing the actual product. Business analysts have a critical role to play in keeping the collaboration running smoothly, including helping to facilitate backlog grooming and elaboration, participating in planning in sprints, working with interfacing teams to identify dependencies, and serving as a product owner proxy on any teams as needed. Likewise, project and program managers can act as advisors about appropriate levels of process, help guide projects toward common goals, and ensure a focus on prioritization based on business needs. Instead of instilling a hierarchical control between PMO and product owner, in agiLE the PMO and product owner work together to achieve the objective. The real goal for agiLE teams is self-organization and creativity, while still contributing as a part of a large organization</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<a class=\"uk-button uk-button-large uk-border-rounded\" href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/pmpodcast/PM_Podcast_381_2017_01_06_white_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"uk-icon-file-pdf-o\"></span> Click to download the white paper</a>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Episode Transcript</h2>\n<p class=\"uk-text-large\">Below are the first few pages of the transcript.

Here is the abstract:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Product portfolios can easily scale to 50 teams or more in meeting large organizations\u2019 needs. Large portfolios with strong foundations are derived through values-based leadership. The technique links corporate and individual values to scientific principles. Scientific principles inform us that change is constant and therefore adaptation defines good practices.

Their agile, adaptive product development practices continue to evolve from plan-driven provenance. Leveraging agile practices at the portfolio, program, and project level continually unleashes innovation, quality, and throughput of value. Though contextualized in terms of software product development in the 2010s with Scrum, the message of innovation through values-based adoption of scientific principles is timeless and framework unallied. Implementation of practices observant of values and principles endures as a way to deliver the best products regardless of toolset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<a class=\"uk-button uk-button-large uk-border-rounded\" href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/pmpodcast/PM_Podcast_380_2016_12_19_white_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"uk-icon-file-pdf-o\"></span> Click to download the white paper</a>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Episode Transcript</h2>\n<p class=\"uk-text-large\">Below are the first few pages of the transcript.

Managing effectively requires the ability to understand individuals and teams, establish working relationships, manage goals, and motivate team members. Effective tools and techniques discover what makes the team members and the team itself tick, to communicate effectively with many different people both one-on-one and as a group, and to generally balance the process part of the equation with the people part of the equation are critical to project success.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"uk-alert uk-alert-large\">\n  <p class=\"uk-h3\">PDU Tip</p>\n  <p>This interview is 24 minutes long.

This interview about leading without authority with Kristine Hayes Munson was recorded at the 2016 PMI Global Congress in San Diego, California. We discuss her paper and presentation \"Getting Things Done -- Influence Without Authority\". Here is the abstract:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Project managers frequently face the dilemma of how to accomplish the project\u2019s work without having any functional authority. Resources assigned to the project report to someone else who writes performance appraisals and recommends pay increases. In addition, resources may be assigned to multiple projects with competing priorities. Project managers must rely on their ability to influence others to get work done in a timely and thorough fashion.</p>\n  <p>This paper explores the influence cycle and the associated skills to be used by project managers in order to get things done using influence rather than authority.

We discuss her paper and presentation <a href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/pmpodcast/PM_Podcast_375_2016_11_06_white_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Risky Business of Assumptions - Uncovering the Truth, as We Assume It to Be</a>. Here is the abstract:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We all hold assumptions, then make decisions and take actions based on those assumptions without verifying their validity. Worse is when other people hold assumptions about our work and we don\u2019t know it. This can impact user adoption, timeline, scope, quality, and overall project success. Not to mention personal frustration, stress, and desires to pull out one\u2019s own hair.</p>\n  <p>Unchecked assumptions can be very dangerous in the workplace. We should be mindful of some common assumptions and actively work to uncover assumptions. Doing so will bolster project work and open up new paths for identifying risks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p>Some <i>project assumption examples</i> that Beth introduces us to are assuming a project or task is easier or faster than it actually is, assuming priorities are aligned and haven't changed, and assuming who owns, or is responsible for, what.</p>\n\n<p>Very importantly the paper and discussion also include a section about uncovering assumptions. Here, Beth offers us 5 ideas on how to develop and expand our <i>project assumptions list</i>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"uk-alert uk-alert-large\">\n  <p class=\"uk-h3\">PDU Tip</p>\n  <p>This interview is 23 minutes long.
