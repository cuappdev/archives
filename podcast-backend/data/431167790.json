The \u201cIntelligent Investor\u201d column that you read every Saturday in the Wall Street Journal...yep, that\u2019s his awesome work.  \n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Jason\u2019s for a long time, so it\u2019s a no brainer that he\u2019s on one of the early episodes of \u201cBetter Off.\u201d And let me just say, it was no easy get! We, and when I say we I really mean Mark, the best producer in the world, have been going back and forth with Jason since last October trying to nail down a date.  \n\nWas it worth it? Let\u2019s just say that when we do interviews, Mark and I are acutely aware of how long they\u2019re running. We try to keep them 30 minutes or less. Well, Jason was so good we kept him for nearly an hour. His knowledge and insight of the financial industry is so wide and deep that we decided that we needed to feature him in back-to-back episodes, a \u201cBetter Off\u201d first!  \n\nIn part one of the interview we cover the power of index funds, the importance of having rules in your financial life, the beauty of passive investing and the importance of technology and humans working together. We also talk about the evil F-word (fiduciary) and why such a simple concept of putting clients first, is such a controversial issue for a conflict-ridden industry.\n\nIf you like Jason\u2019s column, you should also check out his books. His latest work, The Devil\u2019s Financial Dictionary, skewers the plutocrats and bureaucrats who gave us exploding mortgages, freakish risks, and banks that are too big to fail. It also distills the complexities, absurdities, and pomposities of Wall Street into plain truths and aphorisms anyone can understand.  \n\n\u201cBetter Off\u201d is sponsored by Betterment.\n\nFor a recap of every episode, visit https://www.betterment.com/resources/topics/inside-betterment/better-off-podcast/.\n\n\"Better Off\" theme music is by Joel Goodman, www.joelgoodman.com.", "duration": "00:44:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JillOnMoney/~5/hp9pZ1GbNCs/4222ce8e-9015-45ce-8837-974bb19cbf73.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["wallstreet", "insurance", "mortgage", "interest", "finance", "networking", "saving money", "Better Off", "Jill Schlesinger", "interestrates", "refinance", "interest rates", "credit card debt", "credit", "Schlesinger", "JillSchlesinger", "studentloans", "ROTH", "stocks", "credit score", "personalfinance", "IRA", "wallst", "investing", "funds", "indexfunds", "cash", "BetterOff", "retirement", "CFP", "savings", "Podcast", "personal finance", "401k", "Debt", "fiduciarystandard", "529plan", "RothIRA", "finance and home loans", "creditscore", "network", "fiduciary", "Betterment", "money", "annuity", "annuities", "WSJ", "WallStreetJournal", "Zweig", "investor", "JasonZweig"]}, {"seriesId": 431167790, "seriesTitle": "Better Off with Jill Schlesinger", "pubDate": 1488268860, "title": "BONUS call 003", "author": "", "summary": "This week on the BONUS call we talk to Karen from Kentucky who was wondering about an annuity.

I use Uber all the time and it seems like everyone I know has used Airbnb.  My producer Mark just used Airbnb for a week in Tokyo and loved it.  James Altucher, our guest from the second episode, basically lives full-time in various Airbnb locations. \n\nIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that these companies have almost single-handedly disrupted stodgy industries (taxi/limousine and hotel), become stars of the Silicon Valley venture capital world and made their impact felt across the globe. That\u2019s why we were delighted to have a great conversation with Brad Stone, Bloomberg journalist and author of \u201cThe Upstarts: How Uber, Airbnb, and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley are Changing the World.\u201d\n\nBrad defines an upstart as either \u201ca newly successful person\u201d or \u201csomeone who does not show proper respect to the established way of doing things\u201d -- you\u2019ll need to decide whether or not Travis Kalanick of Uber and Brian Chesky fall into one or both of those categories. They certainly were brash survivors who didn\u2019t create the ideas that made each company successful, but somehow they were able to execute better (more ruthlessly?) than their competitors.\n\nUnlike in his previous book about Amazon, \u201cThe Everything Store\u201d, where CEO Jeff Bezos would not talk to him, this time Brad had access to all the key players and he writes a compelling page-turner. He opens the story with the 2008 Obama Inauguration, which founders of both companies were attending. \n\nWhat lessons have these wildly successful upstarts learned over the past nine years? How have they matured and become better leaders?  After reading this book, you\u2019ll have a whole new perspective the next time you ride in an Uber or make an Airbnb reservation.\n\n\u201cBetter Off\u201d is sponsored by Betterment. \n\nFor a recap of every episode, visit https://www.betterment.com/resources/topics/inside-betterment/better-off-podcast/.\n\n\"Better Off\" theme music is by Joel Goodman, www.joelgoodman.com.", "duration": "00:44:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JillOnMoney/~5/GqUM8RvrKAw/35a5a0de-0cfa-4e52-89c1-57149d3b81f8.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["wallstreet", "mortgage", "interest", "finance", "networking", "AirBnb", "saving money", "Better Off", "Jill Schlesinger", "interestrates", "refinance", "interest rates", "credit card debt", "credit", "Schlesinger", "JillSchlesinger", "studentloans", "ROTH", "stocks", "credit score", "personalfinance", "IRA", "wallst", "investing", "funds", "indexfunds", "cash", "BetterOff", "retirement", "CFP", "savings", "Podcast", "personal finance", "401k", "Debt", "fiduciarystandard", "529plan", "RothIRA", "finance and home loans", "creditscore", "TheUpstarts", "network", "Upstarts", "fiduciary", "Uber", "Brad Stone", "BradStone", "insurance", "Betterment", "annuities", "money", "annuity"]}, {"seriesId": 431167790, "seriesTitle": "Better Off with Jill Schlesinger", "pubDate": 1487664060, "title": "BONUS call 002", "author": "", "summary": "For the BONUS call this week we chatted with Brian from Seattle who plans on leaving his Roth IRA to his two kids...since this won't be happening for many, many years, he was wondering how he should be invested inside the Roth.

We taped that interview just days before President Trump signed a Memorandum that instructs the DOL to examine the rule \u201cto determine whether it may adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the fiduciary rule could be toast. Well, not on this show--it\u2019s going to be a running theme on Better Off because as a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER\u2122, fiduciary is an issue about which I\u2019m deeply passionate. So is our guest this week, Betterment CEO Jon Stein.  \n\nBy now it\u2019s no secret that Betterment is the sponsor of Better Off. But that\u2019s not the reason why we\u2019re having Jon on today. Jon has been an industry leader on the issue of fiduciary, publishing an open letter to President Trump, and voicing his company\u2019s support for the rule.   \n\nJon\u2019s take is simple and one that should resonate: U.S. investors should be able to trust that the financial advice they\u2019re getting is in their best interest. As he stated in the letter, \u201cInvesting can be made intentionally complicated, and salesmen are clever. Left to its own devices, the investment industry for decades sold bad products to Americans.\u201d \n\nThe good news is that Jon and I are not alone. There\u2019s support out there from plenty of high-profile people, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who penned a letter to the DOL highlighting support for the fiduciary rule from several financial institutions, including Betterment, adding that a delay \u201cwould be a slap in the face to the companies that have invested, in good faith, for a deadline that has stood for the past year -- and to the everyday worker deserving of the assurance that their retirement adviser is working in their best interest.\u201d \n\nSafe to say Jon and I have plenty to discuss!\n\n\u201cBetter Off\u201d is sponsored by Betterment.  \n\nFor more information on this and past episodes, visit www.betterment.com/resources/topics/inside-betterment/better-off-podcast/\n\n\"Better Off\" theme music is by Joel Goodman, www.joelgoodman.com.", "duration": "00:45:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JillOnMoney/~5/XRlxQ9YI_c4/5ff7bc2c-c41e-4f14-ad39-3139b6468421.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["wallstreet", "mortgage", "interest", "finance", "networking", "Trump", "saving money", "Better Off", "Jill Schlesinger", "interestrates", "refinance", "interest rates", "credit card debt", "credit", "Schlesinger", "JillSchlesinger", "studentloans", "ROTH", "stocks", "credit score", "personalfinance", "IRA", "wallst", "investing", "funds", "indexfunds", "cash", "BetterOff", "retirement", "CFP", "savings", "fiduciary", "Podcast", "personal finance", "401k", "Debt", "DOL", "fiduciarystandard", "529plan", "RothIRA", "finance and home loans", "creditscore", "network", "insurance", "Betterment", "annuities", "money", "Stein", "JonStein", "annuity"]}, {"seriesId": 431167790, "seriesTitle": "Better Off with Jill Schlesinger", "pubDate": 1487059260, "title": "BONUS call 001", "author": "", "summary": "On this week's BONUS call we talk about navigating the tricky world of student loans with Ashley.

In a nutshell, fiduciary is the standard of care which requires financial professionals to put the interests of their clients\u2019 first. Seems like a pretty obvious and basic principle, that should be the standard when someone is talking about your money, right?  \n\nWell, you may be surprised as to learn that the majority of the financial services industry has long been held to a lower standard, which was called \u201csuitability.\u201d Suitability meant that any financial product that was sold had to be appropriate for you, though not necessarily in your best interest. The problem is that most investors have been unaware of the different standards that have applied for all of these years. \n\nEnter the the Department of Labor (DOL), which in the aftermath of the financial crisis -- and in conjunction with the Obama Administration, began working on a way to incorporate elements of the fiduciary standard to those who provide retirement services to American investors.\n\nAfter a lengthy comment period and lots of negotiation with the financial services industry, new DOL fiduciary rules are scheduled to begin implementation on April 10th. These rules are intended to help protect investors by requiring all who provide retirement investment advice to plans, plan fiduciaries and IRAs to abide by a \"fiduciary\" standard, putting their clients\u2019 interest first. (There are exceptions to the new rules, which require advisers and financial institutions to follow certain procedures to avoid being in violation of the new rules.)\n\nFinancial service companies large and small had made big plans to comply with the new rules, but that was before the election of President Donald Trump. It is now widely expected that Mr. Trump, along with Congressional Republicans, may delay and perhaps kill portions of the proposed DOL rule.  \n\nAs you can see it\u2019s a complicated issue.  It shouldn\u2019t be, but it is. That\u2019s why we brought in Megan Leonhardt from MONEY Magazine and Jack Otter from Barrons to try and help us make sense of it all.  With implementation day rapidly approaching, if the government takes the position that the fiduciary standard is not important, you may want to ask yourself this question: If a broker or salesperson doesn\u2019t want to put you first, why should you work with him?\n\n\"Better Off\" is sponsored by Betterment.\n\nI would love to hear your feedback on this thorny issue.

Of course, it\u2019s all about who you know and having connections. \n\nAs someone who has been called a \u201cnatural networker,\u201d I wholeheartedly cling to that concept. In fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70% of all jobs are found through networking. And because it\u2019s a new year, a time when people often make changes, especially career changes, we thought it was a good idea to talk to networking expert Kelly Hoey.  Kelly\u2019s new book, Build Your Dream Network: Forging Powerful Relationships in a Hyper-Connected World, has just been released and is perfect for anyone looking for networking and career advice.\n\nWe have all heard that networking can be an effective and important tool, but Kelly emphasizes  creating meaningful connections, defining your goal and honing on those who can help you form a strategy for connecting. Some of her tips include:\n\n1) Determine the most effective ways to connect with others so you don\u2019t clutter your calendar with dead-end coffee dates and informational interviews 2) Synchronize networking efforts with your digital outreach 3) Turn \u201cclosed door\u201d conversations into strong personal relationships and business opportunities 4) Eliminate FOMO by keeping your networking efforts focused\n\nWe also talk about how the rules have been rewritten now that we live in a digital world where our lives are dominated by Facebook, Twitter and apps.\n\nThe book also includes a series of Q&amp;As with some of the best networking experts in the business who share some invaluable advice based on their successes and failures.\n\n\u201cBetter Off\u201d is sponsored by Betterment. \n\nAs always, ratings and reviews matter in the podcasting world, so if you have a free minute, please leave us a rating in iTunes.

Check.\n\nIvy League educated. Check. \n\nObsessed with statistics. Check. \n\nObsessed with politics. Check. \n\nA rising star in the media world. Check. \n\nYep, that pretty much describes this week\u2019s \u201cBetter Off\u201d podcast guest.\n\nAs promised, we tackle uncomfortable, and even controversial, money and investing issues, but on this episode, we are wading into the choppy waters of politics, with Harry Enten, senior political writer and analyst for FiveThirtyEight. If you\u2019re not familiar with the site, it\u2019s the brainchild of statistician guru Nate Silver who gained recognition in 2008 after correctly predicting the outcomes in 49 of the 50 states in the presidential election. \n\nWith the presidential inauguration upon us, we thought it made sense to talk to someone about the recent race, more specifically the numbers behind it, and how so many people got it wrong. \n\nWhat were the warning signs that so many missed? What did Hillary do wrong? Was it all about the economy or were there other factors? Did the third party candidates have an impact?\n\nHarry breaks down the election/forecasting/statistical terminology we\u2019ve been bombarded with over the past year or so. What is probability and what does it mean? How about margin of error? What about sample errors? Are polls perfect or are they just a tool?  \n\nAs you\u2019ll hear, politics was the main theme, but we also talked about Harry\u2019s background and his love of sports and weather. That\u2019s right, weather. This guy loves a good snowstorm. So much so that it played a role in picking a college.\n\nI think you\u2019ll really enjoy the interview. It was very fun and informative, definitely one of my personal favorites. Harry Enten is a name you will be hearing more and more of in 2017. We just hope he remembers us little people. \n\n\u201cBetter Off\u201d is sponsored by Betterment. \n\nAnd one more thing...ratings and reviews matter a lot in the podcasting world.

Like you, I love podcasts. I subscribe to many, probably too many. But that\u2019s how I found our guest this week, the one and only James Altucher.\n\nLast spring, I was walking on an isolated Long Island beach, picking up trash on Earth Day, listening to his podcast, The James Altucher Show, and was so blown away that I said out loud, \u201cI need to interview this guy!\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what I did. After getting in touch via Twitter, James was a guest on my radio show and we\u2019ve been pals ever since, hence his appearance on the podcast today. \n\nAside from hosting his own successful podcast, James is also a serial entrepreneur and investor. How smart is this guy? As you\u2019ll hear right off the bat, he\u2019s smart enough to know that when it comes to investing, he\u2019s not smarter than the market, which is why these days, he prefers the robo-advisor model, which essentially prevents him (and the rest of us) from making stupid decisions. Makes sense since he\u2019s a lover of technology. One day we\u2019ll get his thoughts on virtual reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nJames is also an accomplished author with more than a dozen books under his belt. You can now add another one to the list with the recently released Reinvent Yourself. More than anything else, that\u2019s exactly what initially drew me to James: his ability to continually reinvent himself, as well as his authenticity and his willingness to talk about it. He really is an open book. And he\u2019s not just talking about his successes, of which he\u2019s had many, but also his failures, of which he\u2019s probably had more. This guy has made millions and lost it all, more than once! More than twice! Yet he somehow continues to reinvent himself and come out on top. \n\nAs you hear this interview I suspect you may think, \u201cHow can I be more like this guy?\u201d If so, you should definitely check out his book, Choose Yourself and his newest release, Reinvent Yourself.\n\nAnd one more thing...ratings and reviews matter a lot in the podcasting world.

Or to be on the Oprah Winfrey Show six times? Well, I have no idea, but our \u201cBetter Off\u201d guest, David Bach, does!\n\nLet me back up...this is the first-ever episode of \u201cBetter Off\u201d where I tackle sometimes uncomfortable -- and even controversial -- money and investing issues. For the show premiere, I talked with David Bach, who has written eleven national bestsellers, with over seven million books in print. He\u2019s best known for \u201cThe Automatic Millionaire.\u201d It was so popular the first time around that he just released an expanded and updated version.  \n\nOf course, there\u2019s no secret recipe to becoming an automatic millionaire. There\u2019s no magic formula. It\u2019s something that takes time, work and discipline. If it were that easy we\u2019d all be millionaires...and Mark probably wouldn\u2019t be my producer. You\u2019ll get to know Mark in subsequent episodes. He\u2019s the guy that makes the show appear in your feed every week.  \n\nAs you\u2019ll hear, I don\u2019t agree with David that skipping a latte a day will help you become rich, but we also discuss many topics in the book upon which we both agree\u2014perhaps none more important than becoming an \u201cautomatic investor.\u201d Research shows that we have more positive outcomes when we take emotions and self-discipline out of the equation and put our financial lives on autopilot. That may be the biggest takeaway from the book. Whether it\u2019s a retirement plan at work, an IRA, or a service such as Betterment, set it, forget it and let the magic of compounding interest go to work. \n\nIt\u2019s the beginning of a new year, a time when we reassess our financial situations and maybe even make some resolutions. Listen to this podcast, read the book and I have no doubt you\u2019ll pick up some useful tips that will help you achieve your goals in 2017. \n\n\u201cBetter Off\u201d is sponsored by Betterment. \n\n\"Better Off\" theme music is by Joel Goodman, www.joelgoodman.com.", "duration": "00:48:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JillOnMoney/~5/Jb3gU5wa05g/4715bd17-e33d-4565-a6e0-b076265e9860.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["mortgage", "finance", "saving money", "student loans", "Better Off", "Jill Schlesinger", "investing", "cash", "retirement", "savings", "fiduciary", "personal finance", "david bach", "automatic millionaire", "money", "wall street", "401k", "millionaire", "business", "fiduciarystandard", "finance and home loans", "insurance", "annuities", "creditscore", "Betterment", "annuity", "network", "CFP", "networking"]}, {"seriesId": 431167790, "seriesTitle": "Better Off with Jill Schlesinger", "pubDate": 1482361552, "title": "Teaser Episode", "author": "", "summary": "Better Off with Jill Schlesinger launches January 5th!", "duration": "00:10:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/29/f6/15/29f615d0-0112-f461-5509-b542adc77df7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JillOnMoney/~5/a7JIoSIndv4/952e5264-ce4c-4364-8b8b-bc547064e30b.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["finance", "saving money", "Better Off", "Jill Schlesinger", "investing", "retirement", "savings", "fiduciary", "personal finance", "fiduciarystandard", "finance and home loans", "insurance", "annuities", "creditscore", "Betterment", "annuity", "network", "CFP", "networking"]}]}
