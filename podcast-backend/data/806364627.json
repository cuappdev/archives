What tools does he need to create a course?\n\nThese are the tools I recommend. For hosting the course, if you don\u2019t want to create your own website, you can use Udemy (http://www.udemy.com/) or Teachery (https://www.teachery.co/). For a merchant account, you can use Stripe (https://stripe.com/), PayPal (https://www.paypal.com/), 1Shopping Cart (http://www.1shoppingcart.com/) or Authorize.net (http://www.authorize.net/). Kajabi is another option for hosting courses, but I have not tried it out (https://www.kajabiapp.com/).\n\nTo host a course on your own website, look into these WordPress platforms: WP WishList (http://member.wishlistproducts.com/), WP Courseware (https://flyplugins.com/wp-courseware/), and Zippy Courses (http://askpat.com/zippycourses).\n\nFor screen recording, I recommend Screenflow for Mac (http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) or Camtasia for PCs (https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html). A great, inexpensive microphone is the AudioTechnica ATR 2100 (http://askpat.com/atr2100).
