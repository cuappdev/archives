So I understand that you are a very busy man. My problem, while small compared to all of the things you must worry about every day, is of dire importance to me.   </p>\n\n<p>I have been a fan of your Ragu line of pasta sauces for many years.   </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, I <em>love</em> your Ragu Robusto\u2122 Six Cheese Pasta Sauce.   </p>\n\n<p>More specifically, I love to have sex with your Ragu Robusto\u2122 Six Cheese Pasta Sauce.   </p>\n\n<!--break-->\n\n<p>Yes, I am a salsaphile\u2014someone who is stimulated by tomato-based sauces or pur\u00e9es. Yes, it is very real. The <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> (psychiatry&#8217;s literal Bible) almost refers to it several times.   </p>\n\n<p>For years, I have loved Ragu Six Cheese. A fine pur\u00e9e and creamy balance of cheeses, lovingly microwaved for 45 seconds, has been my companion for so many otherwise lonely nights. In fact, two years ago I broke off my relationships with all other sauces and decided to see Ragu Six exclusively. After a final, lingering kiss with Newman&#8217;s Own Cabernet Marinara, I and Ragu Six were free to begin the next stage of our life together.  </p>\n\n<p>Then, <em>disaster</em>.   </p>\n\n<p>Some bean counter in your accounting department must have decided to cut costs. Suddenly, one Saturday evening, Ragu Six changed. The viscosity was off. The skin-feel was different. I looked down into my specially designed bowl and didn&#8217;t recognize the sauce staring back up at me.  </p>\n\n<p>You might think that I am an isolated case, some lone &#8220;weirdo&#8221; with a grudge. Not true! The forum at NoShameTomato.org is on fire with dozens of complaints from folks who also preferred the amorous texture of the previous formula. Those are complaints from many different people who are definitely not me.   </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Polman, I understand that you are probably not sexually aroused by a liquified Burpee Super Italian. But, please, I beg that you go back to the old recipe. Give me back the sauce I once loved so much.   </p>\n\n<p>Best regards,<br />\nTaylor Martin<br />\nGrants Pass, OR  </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Special introduction by <a href=\"http://www.youwillnotbelieve.us\">Matthew &#8220;Frenchish&#8221; Latkiewicz</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Also: Hidden Mickey and the eighth dwarf; a new kind of trust exercise and restaurant; Blueberry Morning; untenable stuff; Mexico is full of 200W bulbs and Concord Grape Pop Tarts; Maximum White Creme Pomade; writing to the CEO; ungrippable body wash; Action Line with the Wet Man; Depression-era food; welcome to The Jungle; brokavore gourmet; the CEO of Can; a handful of gravel; generics.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/YouLookNiceToday/~4/stSxmHKIPLE\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "00:32:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/22/25/e5/2225e5b7-4857-eab7-87d6-b94a91d4d5b1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/22/25/e5/2225e5b7-4857-eab7-87d6-b94a91d4d5b1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/YouLookNiceToday/~5/OCfyVvbE1AE/Morning_Glory.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["customer service", "holes", "mexico", "monasteries", "ropes courses", "salsaphilia"]}, {"seriesId": 277928864, "seriesTitle": "You Look Nice Today", "pubDate": 1343887381, "title": "The Rules", "author": "You Look Nice Today", "summary": "<p><a href=\"http://youlooknicetoday.com/episode/the-rules\" title=\"The Rules\"><img alt=\"Very Nice.\" height=\"*\" src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3423/ylnt/s02e06/the-carpet-merchants.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Hello, my friend!

Not entirely, anyway. </p>\n<p>In retrospect, it&#8217;s clear that you, The Shareholders, have suffered grievously by our own shortcomings and missteps along the way. And&#8211;at least according to our surprisingly costly team of lawyers&#8211;we may be exposing ourselves to numerous litigious quagmires if we were to claim otherwise. </p>\n<p>And, so, for a variety of tediously complex legal and personal reasons, <em>YLNT regrets the error</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/18923395305/numbers\" title=\"The trend line has NOT been promising.\"><img alt=\"YLNT Trend Line\" height=\"*\" src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3423/ylnt/ylnt-subs.jpeg\" width=\"98%\" /></a></p>\n<p>In truth, it is now blindingly obvious that many of The Board&#8217;s reactions to YLNT&#8217;s less-than-satisfactory output were inadvisable, incurious, and, on occasion, <em>bizarre</em>, to say the least.</p>\n<p>For example. The one well-publicized miscalculation that many have chosen to beat into the ground? </p>\n<p><em>The bone marrow restaurant concept</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"okay.wegetit\">Okay. We &#8220;Get It&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Sure. We all knew that opening a chain of 1,500 <strong><em>Adam&#8217;s Bone&reg;</em></strong> takeout restaurants on the same hot August weekend was a potentially &#8220;risky venture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And, yeah, fine, cynics will always claim that, from beginning to end, the entire project was &#8220;a poorly-conceived and sloppily-implemented boondoggle of epic and osteopathic proportion.&#8221;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"http://youlooknicetoday.com#fn:1\" id=\"fnref:1\" title=\"see footnote\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>For one, as we all learned by Labor Day, beef marrow sales historically suffer a precipitous plunge in the late summer of <em>every year</em>. Not something we could control. </p>\n<p>But&#8211;<em>yes, fine</em>, we <em>know</em>&#8211;even inasmuch as our initial numbers demonstrated that most Americans will &#8220;happily hork on any shit with Adam&#8217;s face plastered on it,&#8221;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"http://youlooknicetoday.com#fn:2\" id=\"fnref:2\" title=\"see footnote\">[2]</a> we probably should have teased out the subtle but very real response of &#8220;universal consumer disgust&#8221;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"http://youlooknicetoday.com#fn:3\" id=\"fnref:3\" title=\"see footnote\">[3]</a> to the very notion of &#8220;choking down a beige-tan slurry of room-temperature bone meat porridge extruded into a cheap foam bowl.&#8221;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"http://youlooknicetoday.com#fn:4\" id=\"fnref:4\" title=\"see footnote\">[4]</a> </p>\n<p>Clearly, these data would have been far more useful to The Board had they emerged during that Spring&#8217;s costly 6-week pilot program.

Happy now? </p>\n<h2 id=\"rockbottom\">Rock Bottom</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s just say this, get it out of the way, and move on to bluer pastures: for well over a year now, we&#8217;ve essentially been eating our own boogers and pretending it&#8217;s Pinkberry.

By understanding how the world looks to them, we hope to provide the best possible educational experience. In other words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>How have things &#8220;always been&#8221; for East Arcadia&#8217;s incoming class of &#8216;13?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s kick off the ought-niner MindSetter with the hard and painful facts.</p>\n\n<p>Folks, there&#8217;s no nice way to put this: many of these kids are young and uneducated.</p>\n\n<p>Recent data conducted by the prestigous Van H\u0153t Group suggests that many of the 17- to 20-year-old students who comprise the fattest part of our freshman curve are not yet 21 years old; many are barely older than 16. But, it gets worse.</p><!--break-->\n\n<p>Van H\u0153t has aggregated, analyzed, and cross-referenced historical data suggesting that as late as September of 1960, at least 40% of the students entering college for the first time did not have a Bachelor&#8217;s <em>or</em> Master&#8217;s Degree &#8212; let alone the extensive post-doctorate experience we all now understand to be critical for the long-term success of dodging costly loan repayments. Today that number is over 90%. You heard right. That&#8217;s &#8220;ninety.&#8221; With a &#8220;b.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>So in sum, these kids are mostly under 20, completely hopeless, probably armed, frequently drunk or high on I-don&#8217;t-even-want-to-<em>know</em>-what, plus they <strong><em>already</em></strong> can&#8217;t afford the education that they haven&#8217;t received with the money they haven&#8217;t figured out how to not pay back. It&#8217;s literally that bad. Today. Here.</p>\n\n<p>But we keep our chins up at East Arcadia. It&#8217;s one reason everyone  loves scarves and complains of chronic neck pain.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Students entering college for the first time this fall were generally born in 1990. Some were born earlier or later than 1990. Our youngest student is a Fulbright Scholar and surprisingly robust preemie who, because he was  born last week (36 weeks pre-term),  will be our sole tenant in the spanking new Petri Hall. We think the nurturing culture there will suit &#8220;Li&#8217;l Jacob&#8221; well.</p>\n\n<p>That said, for all of these students, Thomas Aquinas, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Petrarch have always been dead. Bob Hope and Guy Lombardo have always been assumed to be dead (N.B.: both are, indeed, now dead).</p>\n\n<p>Many other people have also been dead, but space and costly mimeograph expenses preclude our typically exhaustive accounting. Thanks in advance for understanding (especially if you&#8217;re the obese tenured &#8220;atin-lay ofessor-pray&#8221;  whose entirely avoidable 4th cardiac event singlehandedly sent the entire college&#8217;s insurance premiums through the roof. Keep inhaling  those pork rinds, <em>Professor</em>. Sic Semper Pork something).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway.</p>\n\n<p>So, our big, annual question: <strong><em>How&#8217;s life always been for this year&#8217;s incoming class at East Arcadia?</em></strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Copper has always expanded when heated. Although, it&#8217;s also always been less satisfying as a snack than, say, a Hot Pocket or a slice of cold lamb with a little sea salt and a dash of fresh ground pepper</p></li>\n<li><p>March has never been called &#8220;Burkina Faso&#8221; which is one possible reason so few of our students choose to attend  Spring Break on whatever continent that place is</p></li>\n<li><p>Phones have always had some sort of technical facility for sending <em>and</em> receiving the sound of the human voice while one is nude, dining, or just quietly masturbating to a well-loved 1978 facebook</p></li>\n<li><p>Elephants have always been the one thing most people associate with Hannibal&#8217;s famous attack, although almost no one knows why, but they still sing that song &#8220;Baby Elephant Walk&#8221; and make really obvious <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> jokes until security arrives</p></li>\n<li><p>Golf has always been a costly diversion for tedious white people who dislike their children, but enjoy drinking near sprinklers and pesticides</p></li>\n<li><p>Anilingus has always been something many people of all ages are  nervous to ask for (even if it&#8217;s for an anniversary or your birthday or because you literally caught your so-called &#8220;spouse&#8221; doing it to a civil servant like she was eating corn on the cob and Jesus Christ right there in your own goddamned house where your fucking kids sleep at night. Or what have you)</p></li>\n<li><p>Laser bird shoes and the dangerous nesting boxes that are used to store their colorful waste have both always never been invented yet (for now)</p></li>\n<li><p>Tattoos have always been more permanent and cost-effective than an equivalently regrettable t-shirt &#8212; especially given the rising popularity of the japanese symbol that someone in rubber gloves whom you just met after Tiffany&#8217;s &#8220;Sex in the City&#8221; themed engagement party while you were admittedly pretty drunk has told you means &#8220;Um&#8230;.&#8217;one&#8230;ness&#8230;of&#8230;brave&#8230;spirit&#8230;woman&#8230;hearts&#8230;and peace.&#8217; Yeah. It&#8217;s Kanji.&#8221;</p></li>\n<li><p>Oceans have always been a sloshy, watery, unnavigable presence, teeming with dragons, non-white immigrants, and rich deposits of Lorenzo&#8217;s Oil, all floating in completely unknown locations somewhere between the better documented but much smaller big, landy parts of the continent things</p></li>\n<li><p>Jetpacks and moving sidewalks have always been a lazy way to frame false dichotomies about society, technology, and the complex ways that resource scarcity do or do not hew to century-old pulp fiction and coloring books. Related:</p></li>\n<li><p>Steampunk has always been a diverting way to make something pedestrian a little less useful by adding  a makebelieve brass thing and some polished wood. (Don&#8217;t miss our collection of Jules Verne&#8217;s infamous &#8220;Felching Jars&#8221; and &#8220;Walnut Poppers&#8221; in the rear of the Lisagor Library, [Wing B]. Ask for &#8220;Betty&#8221;)</p></li>\n<li><p>Three-card monte has always been  a socially acceptable urban application for soiled cards and shoddy,  collapsible tables. (FACT: This is why East Arcadia&#8217;s marching band still plays Joplin&#8217;s popular &#8220;Pump the Suckers then Boogie with the Booty Rag&#8221;  before every football game)</p></li>\n<li><p>For this class, mentioning the music of Mozart has always been a subtle means to evoke sophistication in a way that many people are too polite to call out as proof that the mentioner is so full of shit because did you know that <em>Amadeus</em> actually has enough plot holes and factual errors that it might as well be called <strong><em>Ooooo, Look at Me! I&#8217;m Fucking Peter Schaffer, and Apparently I Couldn&#8217;t Distinguish Mozart and Salieri from Fucking Simon and Garfunkel Unless I Had a Goddamned Flashlight, Five Viennese Rent Boys, and a Giant Bouquet of Edelweiss Up My Ass. Wheeeeeeeee, Mozart Something Something!</em></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Lists have always been a great way to turn a bunch of bullshit into some fast web traffic.

They were a mostly-ukulele jam band out of Montr\u00e9al, famous for their 4 hour sitar/uke trance sessions and subsequent pancake breakfasts. Sadly, their CD\u2019s were deemed \u201cobscene\u201d by US Customs (a clerical error, one must assume), and all copies were destroyed at the border. Worse, the band had forgotten to hold on to the original recordings.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Five Senses finally disbanded when their entire tenor uke section disappeared while berrying in Greenland. Our possession of one tiny fragment of one song is pure luck: Merlin was working at the incinerator where the ill-fated CD\u2019s were sent to be destroyed. He rescued one half-melted disc from the flames, and spent the next year piecing together the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s\u2014the digital scraps of the once-proud ukelele band\u2019s magnum opus.<!--break--></p>\n\n<p>That year of labor yielded the song fragment you know as our opening theme. Gallop on, proud ukulelists. Gallop on.</p>\n\n<p>YLNT listener <a href=\"http://twitter.com/scott_h\">Scott</a> heard this story of courage and dedication, and came forward with his own Five Senses artifact. He owns what might be the only physical evidence that the band ever existed: a jewel case from their legendary performance at the Festival International de Jazz de Montr\u00e9al.

A few listeners sympathized, but one brave soul took us on an immersive tour of one of his go-to fantasy scenarios: Satisfaction Island. Sadly, due to a crippling case of ERSF, the island has lost its magic:</p>\n\n<p><hr />\n<blockquote>For years I&#8217;ve had a nighttime fantasy where I&#8217;m stranded on an island with an attractive woman. We fill our days with the only activity not requiring a whole lot of equipment and learning. The sex, that is.</p>\n\n<p>I revisited recently, after a long time away from Satisfaction Island. Everything went well, except I felt I had to introduce the situation by first explaining how we ended up on the island, where the others were, and how we got past the initial shock. I had to establish reliable sources of food and water, and explain why the weather is always excellent.</p>\n\n<p>Then I thought about this woman. She would obviously need to give full consent\u2014nay, approach me first\u2014and while I can believe that she would reach out for me the very first night, looking for some comfort, I knew that this would probably make for a rocky long-term relationship.</p>\n\n<p>So I had her wait a few weeks and get to know and like me first.<!--break--></p>\n\n<p>Then there was the matter of my being married. I couldn&#8217;t just jump into this with my wife out there, worrying about me. But I figured we were reasonable people, and eventually she&#8217;d move on and I&#8217;d realize I would spend the rest of my life on the island. Seeing how this was a fantasy, I allowed about six months for these wounds to heal.</p>\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the matter of birth control. It was getting late in the fantasy so I just made my island-partner infertile. That made me sad for her, though, so I tweaked it a bit; she had also come from a large family and she had always wanted to go the adoption route. Good, good.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I was starting to feel a little embarrassed about the casual way in which I assumed that our food and shelter were accounted for, so I spent some time justifying how we found ourselves in a worry-free situation. The show <i>Lost</i>\u00a0was very helpful here.</p>\n\n<p>Between the fruit-gathering and the water-getting, I don&#8217;t think I fantasized about any actual sex. Maybe once or twice we tried, but there was sand everywhere, and it just kept getting in the way.</p>\n\n<p><hr />\nImage by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/island_life/2357544534/\">Island-Life</a>.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/YouLookNiceToday/~4/Ngc0dtEs9fQ\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/22/25/e5/2225e5b7-4857-eab7-87d6-b94a91d4d5b1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/22/25/e5/2225e5b7-4857-eab7-87d6-b94a91d4d5b1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": null, "type": "episode", "tags": ["fantasy", "island", "lost", "News", "fantasy", "island", "lost", "News"]}, {"seriesId": 277928864, "seriesTitle": "You Look Nice Today", "pubDate": 1225214058, "title": "Who Voted?", "author": "You Look Nice Today", "summary": "<p><a href=\"http://youlooknicetoday.com/episode/who-voted\"><img alt=\"Booth\" src=\"http://youlooknicetoday.com/files/images/vote.jpg\" /></a><br /></p>\n\n<p>Thousands* of you wrote to us asking for Election Day guidance.

During that conversation, Merlin accidentally revealed a bit of the forthcoming game&#8217;s soundtrack. It was a pretty big mistake: the game&#8217;s soundtrack has been a closely guarded secret for months.</p>\n\n<p>This morning, our carrier pigeon returned from Asia with some very sad news.</p>\n\n<p>An entrepreneur in Kowloon heard the episode and turned that tiny whiff of melody into a million-plus selling cassingle. You think we&#8217;ll receive royalty payments on those sales? Ha! We&#8217;ll never see a single \u4ed9. It&#8217;s piracy folks, plain and simple.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, YLNT &#8220;fan&#8221; Neven Mrgan <a href=\"http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/43037808/you-know-and-love-ylnt-right-youve-heard-their\">made a ringtone</a> out of it. Worser, he put it on the internet for anyone to download. Worsest of all, it&#8217;s fantastic. </p>\n\n<p>A single call to the legal team we share with NBC Universal could bury this &#8220;Neven&#8221; under a pile of C&amp;D&#8217;s. But what can we do? The music is already out there. The cat&#8217;s out of the bag. The train&#8217;s left the station. The seed&#8217;s been spilled. </p>\n\n<p>So instead of suing Neven, we&#8217;ll give him a taste of his own medicine. Please take Neven&#8217;s ringtone and use it to make your own version. As an example, Scott has already made a party version of the track. </p>\n\n<p>Post a link to the mp3 or flash version of your ringtone in the comments (or on Twitter) so we can all check it out.</p>\n\n<p><b>Neven&#8217;s Original Version</b>:\n<a href=\"http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshow/Hotdogsladies.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">mp3</a> | <a href=\"http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshow/Hotdogsladies.m4r.zip\">iPhone download</a></p>\n\n<p><b>Scott&#8217;s Party Remix</b>:\n<a href=\"http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshow/HOTTdogzRING.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">mp3</a> | <a href=\"http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshow/HOTTdogzRING.m4r.zip\">iPhone download</a></p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href=\"http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshow/boop.aif.zip\">AIFF file</a> of the original snippet.
