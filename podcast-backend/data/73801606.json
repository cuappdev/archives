Faiveley, Domaine de la Croix Jacquelet, Mercurey 2003 ($20) - Deep ruby color with aromas of dark cherry, fennel and sage. Rich black cherry and raspberry fruit with a touch of earth finishing with firm tannins and good acidity. The bold fruit balances the tannins so I expect this wine to improve with a year or two more in the cellar. Alternatively, you could give it a couple hours in the decanter to open up before enjoying.

The history of BBQ appears to be an American invention, but there seems to be some debate on this if you look closer. Whatever the derivation, today the term means either the slow cooked meats prepared across the southern U.S. from pork, beef or chicken or grilled meats in general. I took the latter definition for the purposes of this post and podcast and chose three wines I think would pair well with summer grilling. Different than in the other months I have participated in this event, my three wines will be a white, a rose and a red. All quite dry and loaded with fruit flavors to stand up to the heartiest summer fare.\n\nSince yesterday was Independence Day here in the U.S., my grilling choice was classic Wisconsin brats and traditional side-dishes, potato and macaroni salad. Whatever wines I select, they would need enough acidity to cut through the mayonnaise in the salads and brown mustard on the brats. I selected two different kinds of brats, the common \"beer brats\" and a new-age chicken with bacon and swiss cheese. Both presented an interesting flavor profile to deal with in matching wines, where in past years I've just reached for an IPA or dark beer.\n\nOf course, the best wine for Bar-B-Que or grilled meats depends upon the type of meat roasted. If I made steaks, for instance, I would have probably selected three red wines to match here. But since I had foods that were not overpowering in their flavors, I had a pretty open spectrum of wines to choose from. My strategy was to find wines with enough flavor to stand up to the food, but also enough acidity to enhance the flavors and not overpower the food. The rule of thumb at this time of year is to choose a dry rose, so my first match was a Wolffer Ros\u00e9 2005 the winery sent me recently as a sample. You probably remember Wolffer from my interview with winemaker Roman Roth in Winecast 56. Their ros\u00e9 is made from 48% Merlot, 39% Chardonnay, 8% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon with the red grapes given a short time on the skins to minimize the color. The wine was totally made in stainless steel to accentuate the freshness of the fruit and retails for a reasonable $14 a bottle. This ros\u00e9 is salmon in color with aromas of peach and fresh flowers. Rich and crisp in the mouth, showing cherry and citrus with a bit of white pepper on the dry finish. A very nice ros\u00e9 for a hot summer\u2019s day and nice accompaniment to my grilling yesterday. In fact, this might be the most versatile wine for grilled meats in the round-up. 11.5% ABV. Finished with natural cork. Score: 8.5/10\n\nI usually don't think of white wine and grilling, but I do think about white wines on hot summer days so I thought I would pick one from my cellar to see how it might work here. I\u2019ve always liked the aggressiveness of Sauvignon Blanc, particularly from New Zealand, but I didn\u2019t have any bottles handy from that country. What I did have was the 2005 vintage of Veramonte\u2019s Sauvignon Blanc from the Casablanca Valley of Chile. I first tried this brand in my round-up on Winecast 12 last year and it has made it into my cellar ever since as a great value for hot summer days selling for $8-9 a bottle. The wine is light straw with a slight green hue. Fresh hay, lime and pineapple aromas with some gooseberry reminiscent of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. On the palate, there is tart grapefruit flavors with nice acidity to match with food. The match was especially good with the chicken brats adding an nice counter-point to the bacon and swiss cheese flavors. I\u2019d recommend this one for grilled pork too, as long as there is not spicy BBQ sauce involved in the preperation. 13.5% ABV. Stelvin closure. Score: 8/10\n\nFinally, I wanted to try a fruit forward red wine. After considering Syrah/Shiraz, I fell back on my old favorite Zinfandel, selecting a 2003 Chiarello Family Vineyards, Zinfandel, \"Giana,\" which sells for $28 a bottle. I first tasted Chiarello Zin at ZAP this past January and was very impressed with all their wines. You might recognize the family name from owner Michael Chiarello's Napa Style TV show, book and website. If anyone knows how to make food-friendly wines, it\u2019s Mr. Chiarello, but I have to say that you need a steak or, better yet, Mexican food to match with this Zin. The wine is garnet-purple in color with powerful aromas of blackberry, plum and licorice. In the mouth it is substantial with blackberry jam, black pepper, spices and silky tannins. A hedonists Zin that somehow balances the substantial alcohol with fruit. Delicious, but overpowering to my 4th of July brats. 16.1% ABV. Finished with natural cork. Score: 9/10\n\nSo what did I learn this month? That a range of wines go well with grilled meats. If I had some true Bar-B-Que to match here, I think only the Chiarello Zin and Wolffer Ros\u00e9 would have made the cut. For best wine, it easily goes to Chiarello Family Vineyards, Zinfandel, \"Giana\" 2003 and best value to the versatile Wolffer Ros\u00e9 2005. Thank to Joel over at Vivi\u2019s Wine Journal for hosting this month and a great theme. I'm looking forward to seeing what founder Lenn has in store for the two-year anniversary of WBW next month.\n\nShow Notes:\n00:21 - Welcome and show theme\n01:10 - Matching wine with Bar-B-Que or grilled meats\n03:56 - Veramonte, Sauvignon Blanc, Casablanca Valley, Chile 2005 ($9)\n04:58 - Wolffer Estate Vineyards, Ros\u00e9, Long Island, New York 2005 ($14/sample) +\n06:20 - Chiarello Family Vineyards, Zinfandel, \"Giana\" 2003 ($28) *\n07:50 - Best of tasting\n07:58 - Best value\n08:15 - Wrap-up and contact details\n08:50 - Next show theme\n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com\nCopyright 2006 Acan Media, Inc.

This was a bit more of a challenge than even I expected, however, in this day and age of powerful, fruit driven wines that average 13.5% ABV and up.\n\nTastes and technology in modern winemaking has changed quite a bit over the past 20 years or so. Most of this change has been for the good. No more are there thin, marginal wines with green flavors on the shelf and most red wines these days have concentrated fruit flavors and aromas. But this has also encouraged vineyard practices of leaving the grapes on the vine as long as possible to extract the most flavor possible. This long \u201chang time\u201d also increases the sugar levels which is converted to alcohol during fermentation. There are things winemakers can do to deal with this such as watering back the wine or even removing alcohol from the finished wine but the most common approach is to release the wine with a higher level of alcohol that was thought excessive not so many years ago.\n\nSo why is this a big deal? The first reason is the obvious public safety issue of drunk driving. These wines can start to cause impairment in the normal half bottle serving which commonly is the portion consumed by wine lovers at a restaurant. Even the old \u201c2 glass\u201d rule of thumb can go out the window with a 16.5% Zinfandel. The second reason is the deadening of the taste buds caused by the attack of alcohol and how it intensifies the wines flavors. Many of these high alcohol wines do not match well with food as a result, which for me is at least half the fun of enjoying wine in the first place. The final reason is the most basic from a winemaking point of view: balance. All the elements in a wine need to be in harmony; the fruit, acidity, tannins and, yes, alcohol level should be balanced in order to produce a fine wine that will stand the test of time and be enjoyable in it\u2019s youth.\n\nI thought this would be an interesting challenge because when I first got into wine, back in the early 1980\u2019s, it was rare that a wine got up to 13% ABV. I remember Sonoma Zinfandels that were 12.8% and even some Napa Valley Cabs right at or slightly under 12%. Yes, there were some green, vegetal aromas and flavors in some of them, but there were also plenty of great wines that never got out of the 12% range. Would there be any out there today? The first thing to do was look over my cellar. Right away I went for the cold climate wines, including a Frontenac from Minnesota that clocked in at 11.5% ABV. This was taking the easy way out and not something I thought would make for a compelling post or podcast (I\u2019ve already covered local wines a couple of times here in the past). So I found some Bordeaux from the mid 1990\u2019s that were 12 to 12.5% ABV. Again, nice to see, but how about some of the 2000\u2019s or later? All my Zinfandels and Syrah\u2019s were off the charts with the most moderate example at a \u201csensible\u201d 14.4%; most were in the 16% range including one that was labeled 16.8%! So I began my search of the local wine stores reading the fine print and talking with the staff to find some acceptable wines. My goal was not to pick a cold climate appellation, but regions more typical of these high octane wines. This meant California, Australia, Spain, Italy and France\u2019s Southern Rhone. Could I find a Zinfandel, Shiraz or Grenache that would come in under the limit?\n\nI guess the first thing that somewhat surprised me is there are quite a few wines in the stores these days that are labeled 12.5% from Bordeaux and the Northern Rhone. I also found some reds from cool climates that easily came in under 12%, including one from Germany that checked in at just 9.5% ABV! But I was after a more illusive prey; a hot climate region that produces a lite (alcohol) red wine. Sadly, I had to cross off my beloved Zinfandel off the list early with the lowest octane version coming in at 13.4%. Ditto for Cabs and Merlots, although some of these were closer to the mark. What follows are the three wines I picked up for tasting this month that I think meet both of my criteria. Here are my tasting notes:\n\nVi\u00f1a Albali, \u201cAltos de Tamaron\u201d, Tinto, Ribera del Duero 2002 ($10) \u2013 At 12.5% ABV, this bottle is at the limit, but I was intrigued to see what might be missing from this 100% Tempranillo at lower than normal alcohol levels.\n\nThis wine is bright ruby in color with pleasant, but restrained, aromas of cherry, strawberry and a touch of violets. In the mouth, it has medium body with tart bing cherry and strawberry fruit flavors finishing smooth without noticeable tannins. Overall, a nice food wine but a little light in the aroma department. Score: 7.5/10\n\nVinum Cerbaia, \u201cIl Valore\u201d, Toscana, IGT 2002 ($6) \u2013 I found this one on the shelf next to the $4 Primitivo from the same producer at the new Trader Joe\u2019s market here. It was surprising to see that this 100% Sangiovese clocks in at only 12% ABV, so I thought it would be worth the chance for $5.99 (your price might even be lower). I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been too surprised here, since I did later find several Chianti that would also qualify that come from the same area and grape.\n\nThe wine is medium ruby in color and has the classic Tuscan Sangio aromas of strawberry and violets. The flavors are typical of an inexpensive Chianti (think straw covered bottle), with plums and strawberry dancing over nicely high acidity and medium tannins. Not complex, but a perfect foil for tomato sauces and the kind of wine you drink from a water glass in Italy. This is also a nice value for six bucks a bottle. Score: 7.5/10\n\nJ. Lohr, \u201cWildflower\u201d, Valdigui\u00e9, Monterey 2004 ($10) \u2013 Finding a red from my native state of California proved most difficult, but I did notice this wine online and was pleased to see it in a store near my home I sometimes visit for their eclectic selection. Seeing that this vintage produced a 12% wine also piqued my interest here that outweighed my concern that this wine might be a little long in the tooth. If you are not familiar with Valdigui\u00e9, it\u2019s a grape with a long tradition in California. For many years, wines made from this grape were labeled Gamay Beaujolais, Napa Gamay or Gamay Noir, the true grape of Beaujolais. These sometimes made for light, fruity and enjoyable wines but they never reached the quality level of most Beaujolais. Recent DNA testing shows that only a few acres of these vines were actually Gamay Noir and that most was actually Valdigui\u00e9 or a lesser clone of Pinot Noir.\n\nThis wine had a deeper color and a lot more aromas than the first two wines tasted. The rich ruby color and fruity strawberry aromas made me think of Cru Beaujolais. Bright flavors of strawberry and cranberry fills the mouth finishing with wild cherry cough drop flavors and tart acidity. No tannins are present to slow you down and the wine almost has too much fruit for it\u2019s own good. Would be nice served chilled, a la Beaujolais Nouveaux. Score: 8/10\n\nSo the best of tasting will go to the J. Lohr, \u201cWildflower\u201d, Valdigui\u00e9 2004 and best value to the Vinum Cerbaia, \u201cIl Valore\u201d, Toscana 2002.\n\nSo what did I learn from this experience? It seems that most low octane wines available in the Twin Cities market are on the low end of the price scale, although I did see some $50 and $60 Northern Rhone wines I could have picked up labeled at 12.5% ABV. I also didn\u2019t note any green flavors or lack of flavor concentration in any of the wines. The first two tasted were a bit shy on the aromas, so perhaps the alcohol does intensify that aspect a bit. Lastly, all three wines had pleasantly high acidity, which bodes well for a good food match.\n\nOne note on the U.S. wine labeling laws. According to a great piece by Blake Gray of the San Francisco Chronicle, there is a 1.5% loophole in U.S. labeling that means that wines marked 12.5% ABV might actually be between 11 and 14%. Over 14% ABV, there is a higher tax rate so some wineries, particularly from France, label all their wines 12.5% regardless of the actual alcohol content as long as it\u2019s under 14%.\n\nAs I write this post entries are pouring in from around the globe. We even have some Shiraz that passes the low octane limit and several other surprises. I\u2019ll be posting a summary of all entries on Friday, so if you are a day or two late in posting, you will still make it in my write-up. Thanks to Lenn for a great idea and for allowing me to direct the proceedings this month. I\u2019m very much looking forward to the next installment in July and the two-year anniversary of WBW in August.\n\nShow Notes:\n00:21 \u2013 Welcome and show theme\n01:20 - Alcohol and wine styles\n09:07 - Wine ratings and tasting notes\n09:15 - Vi\u00f1a Albali, \u201cAltos de Tamaron\u201d, Tinto, Ribera del Duero 2002 ($10)\n10:15 - Vinum Cerbaia, \u201cIl Valore\u201d, Toscana, IGT 2002 ($6)\n11:59 - J.

So for IMBB 26 and WBW 21 the rules are fairly simple. For us wine bloggers, pick a bottle from your cellar and find a recipe to pair with it; for food bloggers it\u2019s the other way round choosing one of their favorite recipes and then finding a wine.\n\nSo when I read about this theme last month, I immediately thought of a food podcaster, Anne Bramley of Eat Feed, to give me some recipe ideas for the wine I chose. I spoke with Anne earlier today and she gave me several recipe ideas that might match with the White Rose Estate, Pinot Noir I selected from my cellar.\n\t\nAfter considering all of Anne\u2019s suggestions, I picked the pork with apples and brandy cream we spoke about and cooked it for dinner this evening. Anne suggested a couple other recipes that can be found online here:\n - Pork Chops with Quinoa Pilaf and Dried Fruit\n - Pork Tenderloin with Gorgonzola and Figs\n\nHere are my tasting notes for the wine and match with the meal. Much more detail is available on the podcast:\n\nWhite Rose Estate, Pinot Noir, White Rose Estate Vineyard 2002 ($65/gift from Jay Selman from Grape Radio) - Ruby in color with powerful aromas of earth, black cherry and spice. Some people might be put off by the gamy, earthiness of the aromas of this wine, but I rather like this aspect. In the mouth its concentrated raspberry, black cherry and a little earth, finishing with supple tannins and good acidity to match with food. I really found this wine to be delicious, but I can see why others might not like this style at all. Score: 9/10\n\nAs for the match with the dish, I thought that the shallot cream sauce and the mild gaminess of the pork tenderloin matched almost perfectly with this wine, really enhancing the fruit. But when tasted with the saut\u00e9ed apples, it really didn\u2019t work too well. I think the next time I make this dish I\u2019ll omit the apples or at least reduce the quantity down to a single apple.\n\nThanks for Alberto and Lenn for a great idea to merge the two leading wine and food blogging events and to Anne Bramley for some great recipe ideas. I\u2019ll see you next month for WBW 22, where I most likely will not have to cook ;-)\n\nShow Notes:\n00:22 - Welcome and show theme\n01:12 - Conversation with Anne Bramley of Eat Feed\n15:03 - Selected recipe\n16:58 - White Rose Estate, Pinot Noir, White Rose Estate Vineyard 2002 ($65)\n18:14 - Wine and food match\n20:12 - Contact Details\n20:31 - Next Show Theme\n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com\nCopyright 2006 Acan Media, Inc.

He encouraged us to find wines made from Rh\u00f4ne varietals no matter where in the world they came from for his \u201cWhen in Rh\u00f4ne\u201d theme. Listed in his announcement were some 22 varietals common to France\u2019s Rh\u00f4ne Valley, known for their blends of mostly red, and occasionally, white wines. Outside of relative well known varietals such as Syrah, Grenache and increasingly Viognier, most of the other 20 are rare outside the region. \n\t\nLongtime readers and listeners of my podcast will recall I have covered those more common Rh\u00f4ne varietals in the past, so I eschewed the \u201ceasy way out\u201d and visited Chuck at Solo Vino in St. Paul for some recommendations. After all, they were the store that I found the bottling of Counoise for WBW 18 last month. After a bit of discussion and consideration of some of their many Rh\u00f4ne blends, and some other obscure varietals, we selected two blends for tasting this time; one white and one red.\n\t\nThe first wine selected is a white from Domaine de Piaugier, their Sablet Blanc 2004, a blend of 40% Grenache Blanc, 30% Clairette, 20% Viognier, and 10% Roussanne. The vineyard is located in the southern Rh\u00f4ne, where Sablet is one of the 16 villages that comprises the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne appellation. Although 90% of the wines made here are red or rose, whites like Domaine de Piaugier can be found in many wine stores around the world. Grenache Blanc is the white version of the popular red variety while Clairette and Roussanne are common blending grapes of the northern Rh\u00f4ne where they are used in both red and white wines.\n\t\nDomaine de Piaugier, Sablet Blanc, C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages 2004 ($22) - Clear light straw in color with a tinge of green; peach, apricot and spice aromas. Stone fruit and honey flavors combine with a rich mouthfeel and lively acidity, finishing with just a touch of lychee. A big, dry white that will stand up to more substantial food matches than most whites. Don\u2019t drink this one too cold or you will miss the considerable nuances of aroma and flavor. Score: 9/10.\n\t\nThe second blend, this time a red from the southern Rh\u00f4ne, is from Domaine du Trapadis, their C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne from the 2001 vintage.  The grapes used in this blend are 60% Grenache, 13% Carignan, 10% Syrah, 10% Cinsault and 7% Mourvedre. While Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre are well known in the Rh\u00f4ne, Carignan and Cinsault are somewhat below the radar. In fact, Carignan is the most widely grown wine grape in France, mostly appearing in blends for its spice, deep color and full body or in vin ordinaire from carafes at bistros throughout the country. Cinsault is also grown in quantity in France where it is almost always used in blends for it\u2019s high acidity and soft tannins. Cinsault was also crossed with Pinot Noir to create Pinotage, a varietal popular in South Africa.\n\t\nDomaine du Trapadis, C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne 2001 ($15) - Ruby color with pronounced aromas of black cherry and earth; raspberry fruit flavors with dusty tannins and nice acidity make this a good food wine. The nose may be too funky for some tasters, but I found this added to the overall experience. Score: 8.5/10.\n\t\nSo the best wine of the two, is the Domaine de Piaugier, Sablet Blanc, C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages 2004, which I also found to be a nice value. The Domaine du Trapadis, C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne 2001 is another fine value for those looking for a red.\n\t\nThanks again to Jathan from Winexpression.com for a great theme and for Solo Vino for providing the wines for tasting this month.

Dr. Vino who didn\u2019t suggest a wine grape variety or region, but to buy wines suggested by the staff at wine stores \u201cthat feel the love\u201d.  This being February, it seems like a great pre-Valentine\u2019s day theme for WBW.\n\nAfter this theme was posted, I immediately thought of Solo Vino, my current favorite Twin Cities wine store.  The store is located in St. Paul conveniently near the university where I teach part-time, so when I am on campus, I generally stop by to pick up some wines.  What I like about the store is the wine selection, which is hand selected by the owners. Many selections are only locally available at Solo Vino and they are always open to bring in new selections based upon customer demand.  For example, I asked for Trinitas, Bigalow Vineyard, Zinfandel and it was in the rack a couple of weeks later. \n\t\nSolo Vino was founded and is run by three wine geeks: Dana, Robert and Chuck who are almost always in the store to speak with.  I stopped by yesterday and chatted with Dana who provided me with a list of the top 9 values they have chosen from their current stock.  She also suggested the Alsatian Pinot Noir from WBW 14, so I picked Dana\u2019s suggested Rhone wine made from 100% Counoise.  This grape is one of several that usually gets blended into the wines of Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape where it adds a bit of aromatics, fruit, acidity and soft tannins.  It\u2019s quite rare to see this bottled on its own, so I had to give this one a taste.\n\nDomaine Monpertuis, Cuvee Counoise, Vignoble de la Ramiere, Vin de Pays du Gard 2003 ($13) \u2013 Medium ruby in color with aromas of violets, earth, fennel and other spices; plum, earth and spice flavors with a silky mouthfeel and nice acidity to match well with food. A delicious wine that balances the earthy characteristics and fruit perfectly. Also an awesome value.  Score: 9/10\n\t\nThe second wine is one of Chuck\u2019s picks and is a Spanish wine made from Tempranillo, Mazuelo (Carignan) and Garnacha (Grenache) grapes.  It\u2019s from Bodegas Ostatu, a small family winery from Samaniego, one of the fifteen villages of the Rioja region.\n\t\nBodegas Ostatu, Crianza, Rioja 2002 ($18.50) - Deep purple color with ripe raspberry, black cherry and spice on the nose; black cherry fruit flavors with white pepper, minerals, a thick mouthfeel and fine tannins.  Nice concentration and great balance make this a delicious wine in the fruit forward model I favor. Score: 9/10\n\t\nSo the best wine and best value go to Domaine Monpertuis, Cuvee Counoise 2003 the most complex wine of the tasting.  Thanks again to Dr Vino from a great theme and for Dana and Chuck for picking some killer values this time out.  \n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com | Audio comments: +01-206-33-WINE-9 (+01-206-339-4639)\n\nCopyright 2006 Acan Media, Inc.

Basically, he just asked us to pick up a bottle only selected by its label art and not any other factor such as producer, reputation, vintage or critic review. I thought it would also be interesting to pick up only wines from producers I am unfamiliar with.\n\nSo I went to the wine store and found my first selection right away from Nova Wines the producer of the famous Marilyn Merlot, the 2005 Norma Jeane Merlot.  The label is a stunning shot of the young Norma Jeane Baker in a bikini sitting on a large flower. It certainly commands attention alongside more modest labels.  It\u2019s a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Syrah from the Tallerico Vineyard in French Camp, California.  Here are my tasting notes:\n\nNova Wines, \"Norma Jeane\", Merlot 2005 ($10.50) - Clear ruby in color with explosive wild cherry and papaya aromas; simple wild cherry flavors with a hint of the tropical fruit on the finish.  Quite quaffable, but not up to the latest crop of Beaujolais Nouveau tasted on my last podcast.  Tasted at cellar temperature, but a bit better slightly chilled. Scores - Label: 10/10; Wine: 7.5/10\n\nMy second wine stood out from the rest on the shelf for it's minimalist typography and 3-dot esthetic. This wine is an Eric Soloman Selection, who seems to always have great typographical label art.  It is from a co-op of 15 wineries and growers in Portugal\u2019s Duoro valley and is a blend of old vines fruit from all 15 producers. Being a typographer from the pre-computer days, I really appreciate the clean use of sans-serif font and white space; a very elegant label that attracted my attention.\n\nLavradores de Feitoria, \"Tres Bagos\", Duoro, Portugal 2002 ($16) - Deep ruby color with aromas of blackberry, earth and spices; nicely concentrated blackberry fruit and black pepper flavors with dusty tannins and high acidity.  Another very good food wine and one of the best table wines from Portugal I have tried.  Scores - Label: 9.5/10; Wine: 8.5/10\n\nSo both wines take an honor this time; for best label art, Norma Jeane Merlot 2005 and the best tasting wine is the Lavradores de Feitoria, \"Tres Bagos\" 2002.\n\nThanks again to Derrick for the theme and I'll see you all next month.\n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com | Audio comments: +01-206-33-WINE-9 (+01-206-339-4639)\nCopyright 2005 Tim Elliott.

As fate would have it, the day this theme was announced I received a sample from a small winery for an upcoming show on Sangiovese.  The wine was made in a garage in a batch of just 84 cases, so I took this as a sign that this wine was meant to be featured this month.  The fact that it came from a winery that donates their profits to charity sealed the deal.  So, for the first time since I started participating in this event, I will feature just one wine: Humanitas, L\u2019Huile du Garagiste; a non-vintage red blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon made from Napa Valley fruit.  A sort of Super Tuscan, California-style.\n\nThe bottle is quite distinctive with the first U.S. commercial application of the Australian Zork closure that appears to be almost like a wax seal on the top.  After peeling back the plastic, it took a bit of work to get the closure off the bottle, but it was much better than a recent experience I had with a synthetic cork in a Chilean Carmenere.  So here are my tasting notes for this unique wine:\n\nHumanitas, L\u2019Huile du Garagiste, Napa Valley NV ($30/received as a sample) -  Deep ruby in color with complex aromas of raspberry, white pepper and earth; bright raspberry and black pepper flavors combine with noticeable, but supple, tannins and a long finish.  A nice balance between the fruit and tannin makes this a delicious wine now and one I will age for another few years to see what develops.  Score: 9/10\n\nI found this to be a very individualistic wine and wanted to get a bit more background on the winery and the winemaker, so I interviewed Judd Wallenbrock the winemaker, proprietor and head bottle washer of Humanitas.  If you listen to the podcast, you will hear our conversation about this wine and his cause.  I have placed an order for more of this wine and encourage you to check it out yourself.  It is not often that we can combine our passion for wine and charity at the same time.\n\nThanks again to Fatemeh of the Gastronomie blog for a great theme and for Judd to spend a part of his day with me today.  I\u2019m looking forward to the last WBW of 2005 next month.\n\t\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com | Audio comments: +01-206-33-WINE-9 (+01-206-339-4639)\nCopyright 2005 Tim Elliott.

So I first thought of a Spanish Pinot Noir I recently had at a tasting that really was different from my paradigm of Pinot from it\u2019s more famous appellations.  It was from Bodegas J Belda, their barrel fermented Pinot Noir from 2001. This wine was ruby in color with black cherry and oak aromas not unlike other ripe Pinot Noir, but the spicy dark berry fruit and hard tannins had me thinking more about the Rhone than Burgundy.  I scored this an 8.5/10 on my scale. I looked for a bottle of this wine for this event, but couldn\u2019t find one, so I asked for the most obscure Pinot from the hand picked stock of St. Paul\u2019s Solo Vino, my new favorite wine store here in the Twin Cities.  And obscure it was, but not from outside of France, it is from the Alsace region.  What, you say, from the land of Riesling, Pinot Blanc and Gew\u00fcrztraminer?  What on earth are they thinking?  Actually, Pinot Noir has a solid track record of producing interesting wines in the vineyards of Germany, so why not the cool climate, northern province of France? \n\nDomaine Hering, Pinot Noir, Alsace AC 2003 ($19) - Very light ruby color with salmon edges, almost like a rose; has strawberry aromas and raspberry and strawberry fruit flavors that finishes with nice balancing acidity.  An interesting and elegant expression of Pinot Noir, very close to the best Spatburgunder from Germany I have had in the past.  Score: 8.5/10\n\nMy second selection came from my northern neighbors here in America, from the Henry of Pelham Family Estate, their Pinot Noir, \u201cUnfiltered\u201d, from Niagara Peninsula, Canada VQA 2003 ($20 CAN) - Ruby in color with a salmon rim; strong black cherry aromas with raspberry fruit flavors with some light tannins. I found this wine to be quite enjoyable. Score: 8.5/10\n\nMy final selection is from the Southern Hemisphere, but not from Australia as I had originally intended.  Following the advice of new listener Graeme from the UK, I picked up a Kim Crawford, Pinot Noir from Marlborough, New Zealand 2004 ($12) - Bright ruby color with fresh Pinot fruit aromas of strawberry, raspberry and a bit of earth; raspberry and strawberry flavors, nicely balanced with a touch of vanilla.  Conventional Pinot in style, but very nicely done and a great value.  Score: 9/10\n\nBest of tasting: Kim Crawford, Pinot Noir 2004\nBest Value: Henry of Pelham Family Estate, Pinot Noir 2003\n\nSo this roundup reinforced that really good Pinot Noir can be made in many places outside of the regions for with it is famous.  All these wines are from cool climates, so I guess that is a common thread that might be useful in choosing wines to try.  But I do recommend the Pinot from Spain I mentioned earlier as a wine that is completely different from any Pinot you\u2019ve ever had.\nThanks to Jens for the theme and I\u2019ll see you next month for whatever the host dreams up for WBW 15.\n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com | Audio comments: +01-206-33-WINE-9 (+01-206-339-4639)\nCopyright 2005 Tim Elliott.

Instead of just selecting a varietal or wine region, she has given us a recipe to match a wine; in fact, the most challenging match I can imagine: wine with a chocolate cake.\n\nWhen announced, this sent me to the basic rule of thumb to match a sweet dessert with a wine of more sweetness, and chocolate with a very fruity wine of high alcohol.  All roads led to the great vintage wines of Porto.  Since I assumed most WBW participants to go down this road, I thought slightly differently.  First, in selecting a fortified wine from Clotilde\u2019s native France, the somewhat cult status Banyuls, and then with a big, ripe Zinfandel from my native state of California.  Since I am not well educated in the fortified wines of France, I trusted the advice of Solo Vino\u2019s experts, Robert and Chuck, to steer me to M. Chapoutier Banyuls from the 1998 vintage.  Similarly, I trusted the advice of listener Stephanie in suggesting I try Matt Cline\u2019s wines at Trinitas, made from ancient 120 year old vines in California\u2019s Contra Costa County.  My theory was that ripeness and high alcohol would lessen the perception of sweetness and the jammy ripeness of the old vine Zin would match with the richness of the cake better than wines that naturally have chocolate flavors, such as Merlot.  Here are my findings:\n\nBefore cake:\nTrinitas Cellars, Old Vine Zinfandel, Contra Costa County 2002 ($17.50) - Ruby color with a subtle blackberry, spice and cedar nose; bold blackberry fruit with some vanilla and dusty, but strong, tannins. Not as rich and extracted and I would have expected in a 15.5% wine.  Score: 8.5/10\n\nM. Chapoutier, Banyuls 1998 ($24 / 500 ml) - Light ruby color with tawny edges; earthy raison and spice aromas; very sweet entry with rich black cherry fruit and some orange peel.  Very much like a vintage Porto.  Delicious on its own, but looking forward to trying with the cake.  Score: 9/10\n\nI made the recipe with bittersweet chocolate and the rich, sweet flavors are sumptuous in this moist cake.  I thought that I possibly over sugared this, as the recipe did not specify whether the chocolate was sweetened or not, but it seems to be quite nice as it is.  Next time I might cut the sugar in half or more, given the sweetness of the chocolate.\n\nWith cake:\nTrinitas, Old Vine Zinfandel - The wine picked up a bit more aroma in the glass since the first tasting, now showing more sweet blackberry aromas with the cedar scents noted earlier; the flavors seemed to be toned down a few notches, with the tannins barely noticeable over the sweetness of the cake.  Quite interesting, but not a good match, I\u2019m afraid.  The wine seems to be overwhelmed by the sweetness of the cake.  Score: 8/10\n\nM. Chapoutier, Banyuls - This wine also picked up more aromas, now dominated by prune and orange peel; the sweetness of the wine seems less when matched with the cake, with very nice black cherry flavors and now just a suggestion of orange.  This is perfectly matched, but still garners the same 9/10 score (I might have given this a 93 on a 100 point scale).\n\nTwo days later, before cake:\nTrinitas, Old Vine Zinfandel \u2013 After 2 days of Vac-u-vin with very little headspace for air, the wine is much more open and aromatic, suggesting mandatory decanting or some more time in the cellar. Strong blackberry and spice aromas are present with a bit of oak; ripe blackberry and raspberry flavors dominate the palette, followed by pepper and a touch of, yes, sweetness.  Not the traditional, jammy-style but an undercurrent of fruit that finishes the wine quite nicely.  This elevates the wine to a delicious, 9 out of 10 on my scale.\n\t\nM. Chapoutier, Banyuls \u2013 Not much different in aroma than the last time, dried dark fruit and a bit of orange; very port-like flavors and a sweetness that is nicely balanced by acidity.  Very young now, but seems quite a bit more drinkable than a similarly aged vintage Porto.  Still a solid 9 out of 10.\n\nTwo days later, with cake:\nThe cake is still quite moist and rich, as I remembered it from 2 days before.  A bitter-sweet extravaganza of flavor...\n\nTrinitas, Old Vine Zinfandel \u2013 I really like the nose more and more on this wine, but the tannins of the wine and sweetness of the cake almost cancel out each other.  Still not a good match.\n\nM. Chapoutier, Banyuls \u2013 This remains a very nice match with the sweetness of the cake.  I really enjoy how the wine complements the cake and adds more dimension to the flavors.  It remains a solid 9 out of 10.\n\nSo the clear winner here is the Banyuls, not from its country of origin, but its level of sweetness (helped, no doubt from the level of alcohol and our perception of sweetness previously mentioned).  I\u2019m sure I would have come to the same conclusion had I chosen Porto or port-style wines from California or Australia, but it was nice to see a French wine come out on top this time.  \n\nAlthough this has been the most demanding Wine Blogging Wednesday to date, I\u2019ve had a great time researching and choosing different wines to try to stand up to a delicious recipe.  Thanks once again to Clotilde for hosting and conceiving such an excellent theme.  A high bar for those of us who will host this event in the future.\n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com | Audio comments: +01-206-33-WINE-9 (+01-206-339-4639)\nCopyright 2005 Tim Elliott.

Real Local.", "author": "winecast@gmail.com (Tim Elliott)", "summary": "When Lenn announced the theme for the first year anniversary edition of Wine Blogging Wednesday, I immediately fired up Google maps to pinpoint the locations of all the wineries in Minnesota.  Since I had already covered Minnesota wines recently on the show, I was concerned that the closest winery and vineyard, to abide by the theme of \"Drink Local. Real Local.\", was the Alexis Bailly Vineyard that I featured in Winecast 28.  As it happened, they are at 27.4 miles from my humble abode and recording studio.  The next winery on the list was over in Cannon River, a pleasant town of 3,877 people, that clocked in at 31.4 miles; close enough for this purpose, I rationalized, as I dispatched an email to Lenn asking for dispensation (which he kindly granted).  So for this month, I will cover the wines made at the aptly named Cannon River Winery.\n\nThe Cannon River Winery opened it's doors only last October, refurbishing a large downtown building that once featured a bowling alley.  The large space is nicely laid out with the winery and barrel aging cellar on one end and the tasting bar and gift store on the other.  The winery is owned by John and Maureen Maloney from the Twin Cities; they also have about 20 acres of vineyard land partially planted to French-American hybrid grapes in the neighboring town of Sogn.  Their winemaker is a Columbian expatriate with previous experience making wine in Ohio; sounds like quite a story that I will have to investigate further.\n\nAbout noon a couple of weeks ago, I arrived at the winery to taste through their line of local wines.  I was pleased to see an array of options on their website, that promised exotic varietals such as Edelweiss, St. Pepin, LaCrosse and Frontenac.  All cold-hearty, French-American hybrid grapes developed especially for surviving the harsh winters up here.  I also noted that they make wines from more familiar vinifera varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and my favorite, Zinfandel, but figured those grapes (best case), juice (most likely) and/or wines (hopefully not!) were trucked in from appellations further to our West.  I was greeted by a helpful woman who informed me that two of the four wines I was most interested in (i.e. the locally grown ones) had, \"sold out last weekend\".  Great, I thought, why didn\u2019t I make the trip earlier?!  Undeterred, I tasted the other two wines with these impressions:\n\n- Cannon River Winery, \"Lorraine's White\" NV ($12) - Made from locally grown LaCrosse and Riesling of unknown origin (CA is most likely).  Unfortunately, the woman helping me didn\u2019t know the percentages of the blend.  Clear in color with a tinge of yellow, pleasant peach nose, nice off-dry peach and green apple flavors that would have been fine for WBW 11. Enough acidity to complement light entrees or cheese.  Score: 7.5/10\n\n- Cannon River Winery, \"Minnesota Meritage\" NV ($16) - Made from 50% Frontenac grown at their vineyard with the balance equally blended with CA Merlot and Zinfandel.  Light ruby color with wild cherry aromas, mellow red berry flavors with a slightly tangy finish, an enjoyable blend that defies expectations given the grapes involved.  Score: 7.5/10\n\n\nYes, I did taste their other wines made from out of state grapes, but will not review those here as this is not how I interpreted Lenn's instructions.  The wines should be both made and (mostly) grown near your house to qualify.  So both of these wines are of good quality and a great accomplishment for the Maloney's on their first release.  I'll give both best of tasting and best value to Lorraine's White, as I thought this had a bit more interesting flavor profile than the Minnesota Meritage.  If you have a chance to visit the winery, which is the only place I know you can buy these wines, pick up a bottle of each (as I did).  This is a winery I will definitely visit again to taste their Edelweiss and St. Pepin-based wines and keep track of their progress.\n\nThanks to Lenn for a great theme to cap off the first year of Wine Blogging Wednesday.  I\u2019m looking forward to another great year and to hosting a future edition.\n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com | Audio comments: +01-206-33-WINE-9 (+01-206-339-4639)\nCopyright 2005 Tim Elliott.

I picked three from the wine store and one from the cellar to fill the bill. What I looked for was a bit of sweetness, but not enough to be confused with a candy bar.\n\nThe first selection is from Josef Friederich, a Deidesheimer Hofstueck Sp\u00e4tlese 2003 ($8.50) - From the Pfalz region of Germany, this wine is made from the Kerner varietal. Clear leaning toward straw in color, lean citrus nose, interesting herb, green apple and honey flavors with a dose of acidity and slightly mineral finish. Nicely off-dry and quite similar to Riesling in flavor. A good choice for a warm day on the patio that would benefit from some food. Score: 8/10\n\nMy second selection is from the Sokol Blosser Winery, their Evolution, \u201cLucky No. 9\u201d NV ($14) - A great label that plainly states it\u2019s \u201coff-dry\u201d flavors; I have wanted to find an excuse to pick up a bottle. Light straw color, peach and pear nose, pineapple and peaches with noticeable acidity make this a good choice with food. Seems dryer than the Deidesheimer Hofstueck Sp\u00e4tlese, but qualifies as off-dry I guess due to it\u2019s high acidity stealth flavor thing. Score: 8.5/10\n\nFurther investigation found this wine to be made from 9 grapes: Riesling, Pinot Gris, Muller-Thurgau, Muscat, Gewurztraminer, Semillon, Pinot Blanc, Sylvanner and Chardonnay. Damn, I would have guessed a bit of Viognier in this blend  Check out their website at: http://www.evolutionwine.com/\n\nThe next selection is from Beni di Batasiolo, the Moscato d\u2019Asti 2004 DOCG ($9) - The shelf stuffer said, \u201cperfect for the patio\u201d, so I thought it would be great for this off-dry event. I should have read the back label, which refers to it as, \u201cExcellent with all deserts.\u201d Oh well, it was open, so I had to taste anyway. In fact, I had a heck of a time extracting the cork from this baby and found out why once I poured my first glass. Nice lemony straw color with creamy bubbles, yes, bubbles. I have had many wines with spritz in my day, but this one rivals some low carbonated sparkling wine. The nose is classic muscat: melon and peaches. Very spritzy melon and peach flavors with enough sweetness to rot your teeth without going over the top (I\u2019m not going to drop \u201ccloying\u201d here  DISQUALIFIED as an off-dry wine, but quite nice in it\u2019s own right. Score: 8.5/10. Note: don\u2019t store these in a warm room or in your car for fear of explosion; I\u2019m serious.\n\nMy alternative selection (to make three for Winecast norms) is from the Snoqualmie Winery, their Columbia Valley, Chenin Blanc 2002 ($5) - Light straw yellow with a bit of green color, lean nose of apple and pear, green apple, peach and watermelon popsicle flavors which finishes off-dry. Pretty good, but one-dimensional. Score: 7.5/10\n\nBest of tasting: Sokol Blosser Winery, Evolution, \u201cLucky No. 9\u201d NV ($14)\nBest value: Josef Friederich, Deidesheimer Hofstueck Sp\u00e4tlese 2003 ($8.50)\n\nThanks to Beau at basicjuice for the theme and Lenn Thompson for the original inspiration (best wishes to Nena and you on Friday!). See you next time...\n\nFeedback: winecast@gmail.com | Audio comments: 206-202-4696\nCopyright 2005 Tim Elliott.

But \u201cwhite pinot\u201d? What\u2019s that all about?\nIt seems that our old red friend, the Pinot Noir, has mutated over the millennia and has produced another related white varietal most commonly known as Pinot Gris. Yes, yes, I know that \u201cgris\u201d translates to \u201cgrey\u201d but the juice is quite white even with extended skin contact. The problem with this variety is that is goes by so many names depending upon where it is grown that it is hard to know what you are drinking without a scorecard. A Google search turned up the following synonyms:\n\n* Pinot Grigio (Italy)\n* Pinot Beurot (Loire Valley, France)\n* Rul\u00e4nder (Austria and Germany, Romania, sweet)\n* Grauburgunder or Grauer burgunder (Austria and Germany, dry)\n* Grauklevner (Germany)\n* Malvoisie (Loire Valley, France and Switzerland)\n* Tokay d\u2019Alsace (Alsace) (currently being renamed due to EU regulations)\n* Auxerrois Gris (Alsace)\n* Fromentau (Languedoc, France)\n* Fromentot (France)\n* Fauvet (France)\n* Gris Cordelier (France)\n* Grauer M\u00f6nch (Germany)\n* Monemrasia\n* Crvena Klevanjka (Croatia)\n* Sz\u00fcrkebar\u00e1t (Hungary)\n\nYikes, that\u2019s quite a list! Another interesting point is that the style varies depending upon the region. This can range from the light and lean Pinot Grigio\u2019s from Italy to the more substantial full fruit Oregon style to the classic floral and silky Alsatian wines.\nFor this event, started with a wine I spied on the by-the-glass selection of the local eatery where I just finished dinner. It was a 2003 Pinot Grigio from Stella of the Umbria region in Italy. I found this wine to be almost clear in color with the slightest hit of straw and a lean fruity nose typical of the varietal. On the palette it had nice citrus and apple flavors, good acidity and a dry, slightly minerally finish. A very good start to this evening\u2019s festivities earning an 8.5/10 on my scale. A quick Google later I found this to be a fine value at only $6 a bottle.\n\nNext, I decided to pull a Pinot Grigio from California out of the cellar that a friend gave me last summer. It is from La Famiglia di Robert Mondavi of the 2002 vintage that retails for $15. This is another label from the prolific Mondavi family that was started in 1994 to, \u201ccelebrate their Italian heritage from California vineyards\u201d; as usual, brilliant marketing  The winemaker\u2019s notes reveal that this wine is a blend of 98% Pinot Grigio and 2% Tocai Friulano, the top native grape from Italy\u2019s Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. He also points out the fruit came from Monterey County (87%), the Los Carneros (7%), and 3% each from El Dorado and Santa Maria Valley. Thankfully, the wine did not see any oak and was not subjected to the rigors of malolactic fermentation, so I expected it to be full in fruit flavors with a nice dose of acidity making this a good match for shellfish (oysters, anyone?!). This wine was also shy on the color with a bit of the old yellow/green, but had a much more powerful citrus nose than the previous Grigio. Nice lemon and pear flavors and bracing acidity finish bone dry. A solid 8.5/10.\n\nPinot Blanc is a mutation of Pinot Gris that used to be widely planted in Burgundy. This was until the Appellation Controlee laws knocked out Pinot Blanc in favor of Chardonnay. The grape is most identified in France today with the Alsace region where it is the number 3 grape behind Riesling and Sylvaner. Pinot Blanc also has some identity issues, but they seem to be isolated to California where much of what is labeled Pinot Blanc is actually Melon de Bourgogne, also called Muscadet in France\u2019s Loire region. Like Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc is quite malleable to the hand of the winemaker, taking oak well so wines can be light and fruity to big and oaky. As with Chardonnay, I prefer my Pinot Blanc unoaked, so I chose a bottling from the reliable Trimbach of Alsace. It is their 2001 Pinot Blanc that is blended with a bit of Pinot Auxerrois and sells for about $15 a bottle. This wine is straw in color with a hint of green, has a lean citrus nose and with apple and nut flavors. Another bone dry wine with high acidity, it would be a natural with food. I found this wine to be delicious and earn a 9/10.\n\nSo what was learned in this tale of Two Pinots? That they are surprisingly similar in flavor and great food wines. I think I like the more elegant style of the Pinot Blanc, but as can be seen from my tasting notes, it was a close race. The best of tasting goes to the Trimbach Pinot Blanc 2001 with best value to the Stella Pinot Grigio 2003.\n\nThanks to Alice from My Adventures in the Breadbox for a great theme; I can\u2019t wait until the next installment!", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/81/27/84/812784df-7637-a6d6-fbf0-38f38b07f786/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/81/27/84/812784df-7637-a6d6-fbf0-38f38b07f786/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/winecast-aac/~5/ZcJnkWE7bxY/Winecast_20050608.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 73801606, "seriesTitle": "Winecast", "pubDate": 1118153736, "title": "Australia's Barossa Valley", "author": "winecast@gmail.com (Tim Elliott)", "summary": "Today\u2019s show is focused on the red wines of Australia\u2019s Barossa Valley.

It seems Sam\u2019s day job is not leaving much time for podcast listening, so here are the CliffsNotes with a few timecode stamps to help her sort out the audio:\n\n(0:00 \u2013 0:37) Introduction, theme music and show kickoff, thanking Sam for hosting WBW this month and the theme of ros\u00e9 wines. Ros\u00e9 is the \u201cRodney Dangerfield of wines\u201d; they get no respect. This is probably due to indifferent blends of red and white wines we have had being passed off as ros\u00e9, as well as the sticky, sweet white zinfandels we have been subjected to over the years. In fact, I have not had a proper ros\u00e9 or pink wine in a few years, so this theme was an excellent chance to check out three dry ros\u00e9 wines.\n\nBefore sharing my tasting notes, I spoke a bit about how ros\u00e9 wines are made (1:16). The first method is to crush red grapes and macerate the must for only a few hours to impart only a small amount of the pigment to the wine. Then the winemaking process is followed the same as used to make white wine. For some unknown reason, I failed to mention that the French call this process, \u201cvins gris\u201d, even though my notes clearly state this fact. The second method is called, \u201csaign\u00e9e\u201d or \u201cbleeding\u201d. This is where red wine is made, but a bit of the juice is drained off early in the winemaking process to concentrate the resulting red\u2019s flavors. The bled juice is then made into ros\u00e9 using the process followed to make whites.\n\nNext (2:17), I commented about the proper temperature to serve ros\u00e9 (50 - 54F, or 10 - 12C) and launched into my tasting notes:\nToad Hollow Vineyards, \u201cEye of the Toad\u201d, Dry Pinot Noir Rose 2004 ($12) - Clear pink, beautiful strawberry/watermelon nose, strawberry/cherry fruit, bone dry, nice finish; serve a bit warmer than regular rose to fully reveal it\u2019s aromas and flavors; I also like the whimsical, yellow plastic cork! Score: 8/10\n\nLes Vignerons de Montblanc, Syrah Rose, Vin de Pays des Cotes de Thongue 2003 ($9) - Rose center with nice pink edges, watermelon candy nose, nice flavor intensity of light red berries, dry and refreshing; another plastic cork! Score: 8/10\n\nCuvee Catherine, Rose d\u2019Anjou 2002 ($6) - Very light tawny red, light flowery nose, almost vegetal in flavor with bell pepper and cherry in a good way, off-dry, but not sweet, with a good dose of acidity; a bit bitter on the finish; drink ASAP as the wine is past it\u2019s prime. The only cork in the bunch. Score: 7.5/10\n\n(5:09) Best of tasting: Toad Hollow Vineyards, \u201cEye of the Toad\u201d, Dry Pinot Noir Rose 2004\n\nBest value: Les Vignerons de Montblanc, Syrah Rose, Vin de Pays des Cotes de Thongue 2003\n\n(5:21 \u2013 8:16) I then shared some final thoughts for regular Winecast listeners about sending in questions for an upcoming show, voting at Podcast Alley, Gmail and Yahoo! 360 invites and a poll I have open on my blog.\n\nThanks once again to Sam from Becks & Posh for the theme and her upcoming summary write-up this weekend. I hope this extended post helps save you a bit of time \n\nCheers!", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/81/27/84/812784df-7637-a6d6-fbf0-38f38b07f786/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/81/27/84/812784df-7637-a6d6-fbf0-38f38b07f786/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/winecast-aac/~5/0ZK2ZbrRJ8s/Winecast_20050511.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 73801606, "seriesTitle": "Winecast", "pubDate": 1115597520, "title": "The Big Three Reds", "author": "winecast@gmail.com (Tim Elliott)", "summary": "This weekend\u2019s podcast is focused on the, \u201cBig 3 Reds\u201d: Pinot Noir, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon presented in the \u201cvirtual tasting\u201d format.

I ended up picking 4 wines for tasting, all for $8 USD or less. Unfortunately, one of the wines was disqualified as it was a blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvugnon and Merlot; my full tasting notes of that wine are posted here.\n\nWhat was great about this theme was it forced me to look for things I normally pass by at the wine store and I would have otherwise never found any of these interesting wines:\n\n- Castellani, Negroamaro, Puglia, Italy 2003 ($6) - Deep garnet, dusty berry nose, simple, peppery berry flavors somewhat like Dolchetto, good rustic finish with moderate tannins, nice pizza or pasta wine, very good value, plastic cork!\nScore: 8/10\n\n- Castellani, Nero d\u2019Avola, Sicilia, Italy 2003 ($7) - Garnet, pleasant fresh berry nose, deep, simple black cherry flavors, no tannins to speak of, good \u201cquaffable\u201d drinking now, another plastic cork!\nScore: 7/10\n\n- Cortello, Estremadura, Portugal 2001 ($8) - Made from native grape Castelao (a.k.a. Periquita) and Argonez grapes; deepest garnet, lean berry nose, round plum flavors and silky mouth-feel, finishes a little bitter and funky but overall quite good.\nScore: 7.5/10\n\nBest of tasting and best value goes to Castellani Negroamaro 2003.
