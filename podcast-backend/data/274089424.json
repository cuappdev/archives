Investigating it as Superboy, the Boy of Steel is shocked to find an occupant inside that has a star chart and a medallion around his neck from Jor-El, his own father, about his apparent son. Believing that this person is a previously unknown and long lost brother, Superboy is disappointed to find that the occupant has amnesia. Taking him in with the Kents, they decide to name him Mon-El, based partially on the day of the week he landed on Earth (Monday) and on Kryptonian names. Pa Kent also sets Mon-El up with a civilian guise of Bob Cobb so that Mon-El can assume a civilian life in Smallville, as a brush salesman.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>However, Superboy beings to get suspicious of Mon-El's true nature, and begins to doubt his origins when he realizes the buckle on Mon-El's belt is not made of any Kryptonian metal, and Krypto doesn't recognize Mon-El. As a final test, Superboy tries to expose Mon-El to Kryptonite as the boy sleeps and is shocked that it has no effect.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The next day, after Mon-El tries to show up Clark for Lana Lang's affections, Superboy decides to trick Mon-El into \"revealing\" himself by orchestrating a Kryptonite meteor hoax while they're playing. To do so, Superboy paints lead meteors to resemble Kryptonite and throws them into space so that they land on Earth at the right time. Superboy is shocked to find that Mon-El is effected by the lead meteors just as Superboy would have been effected by real Kryptonite. This causes Mon-El's memories to return, and he reveals that his real name is Lar Grand, who was from the planet Daxam, and landed on Krypton just before it's destruction and befriended Jor-El before departing the planet, and that the crash really did cause him to have amnesia. As lead being the Daxarian's weakness, Mon-El is about to die, however Superboy comes up with a solution to save Mon-El's life, by sending him to the Phantom Zone until he can find a cure for Mon-El's lead poisoning</em>. - <a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Superboy_Vol_1_89\"><em><strong>via DC Wikia</strong></em></a></p>", "duration": "59:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/majorspoilers/LegionClubhouse003.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 274089424, "seriesTitle": "Major Spoilers Comic Book Podcast", "pubDate": 1488341420, "title": "Major Spoilers Podcast #718: Wolverine Evolution", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This week on the Major Spoilers Podcast: We take a look at Wolverine Evolution so you don\u2019t have to!

As the originator of the first sentient robot in literature (\"I, Robot,\" published in Amazing Stories in 1939 and predating Isaac Asimov's collection of the same name), Binder's effect on science fiction was profound. Within the world of comic books, he created or co-created much of the Superman universe, including Smallville; Krypto, Superboy's dog; Supergirl; and the villain Braniac. Binder is also credited with writing many of the first \"Bizarro\" storylines for DC Comics, as well as for being the main writer for the Captain Marvel comics. In later years, Binder expanded from comic books into pure science writing, publishing dozens of books and articles on the subject of satellites and space travel as well as UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Comic book historian Bill Schelly tells the tale of Otto Binder through comic panels, personal letters, and interviews with Binder's own family and friends. Schelly weaves together Binder's professional successes and personal tragedies, including the death of Binder's only daughter and his wife's struggle with mental illness. A touching and human story, Otto Binder: The Life and Work of a Comic Book and Science Fiction Visionary is a biography that is both meticulously researched and beautifully told, keeping alive Binder's spirit of scientific curiosity and whimsy.</p>", "duration": "1:07:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/majorspoilers/LegionClubHouse01.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 274089424, "seriesTitle": "Major Spoilers Comic Book Podcast", "pubDate": 1485925835, "title": "Major Spoilers Podcast #714: IT'S A FIFTH WEEK!", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This week on the Major Spoilers Podcast: It\u2019s a fifth week podcast!

Originally serialized in the pages of the seminal comic book Eightball throughout the mid-1990s, this quasi-autobiographical story (the name of one of the protagonists is famously an anagram of the author's name) follows the adventures of two teenage girls, Enid and Becky, two best friends facing the prospect of growing up, and more importantly, apart. Daniel Clowes is one of the most respected cartoonists of his generation, and Ghost World is his magnum opus. Adapted into a major motion picture directed by Terry Zwigoff (director of the acclaimed documentary Crumb), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p>\n\n<p>Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:podcast@majorspoilers.com\" title=\"e-mail the show!\">podcast@majorspoilers.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Call the Major Spoilers Hotline at (785) 727-1939.</p>\n\n\n<p>A big Thank You goes out to everyone who downloads, subscribes, listens, and supports this show.

His neighbors return the favors by keeping his abilities a secret. But when a newcomer alerts the media, a firestorm erupts, sending Huck on an adventure that will change everything. This brand-new series from writer MARK MILLAR and artist RAFAEL ALBUQUERQUE presents a comicbook unlike anything you've read before.

True pro wrestling fans know all the ups and downs of his career and everyone else knows him as an \u201880s pop culture icon, the lovable giant in The Princess Bride. But few know the true life story behind the legend, a story more incredible than anything that could be concocted for a Pay-Per-View special. This is the story Lion Forge Comics is bringing to fans in the authorized graphic novel biography, Andre the Giant: Closer to Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>Eisner-nominated writer Brandon Easton (ThunderCats, Marvel's Agent Carter) charts Andre\u2019s entire life story in an introspective first-person narrative he crafted with assistance from Andre\u2019s daughter Robin Christensen-Roussimoff. The book opens on the idyllic farm in the French countryside where Andre spent his childhood and steadily weaves through his amateur early days in the squared circle, his rise to fame in TV, film, and Vince McMahon\u2019s upstart WWF (now WWE), and the demons he collected along the way.\n<br />[rating:5/5]</p>\n\n<p>RODRIGO\n<br />The Art of Jose Gonzalez\n<br />Writer: David Roach\n<br />Art: Jose Gonzalez\n<br />For nearly two decades, Jose \"Pepe\" Gonzalez was hailed as the premier Vampirella artist, drawing the fiery vixen for Warren Publishing in the Seventies and Eighties. Renowned for bringing to life the most beautiful women the art world has ever seen, Gonzalez's career spans from drawing British romance comics to movie stars, book covers to commercial advertising, and, of course, personal commissions for loved ones and devotees. For the first time ever, author David Roach covers Jose's entire career, transcending his vast body of Vampirella work to explore the full breadth of the master's creations. Vampirella collectors and Jose Gonzalez fans rejoice, for the life-spanning retrospective you've been waiting for has finally arrived!

Blood which manifests itself in exceptional strength and physical mutation. Blood that earned him imprisonment in the Veresta Stadium, where pure-blooded humans force him to fight in gladiatorial games. He jumps at the prospect of freedom when a mysterious girl named Dara appears at his cell and offers him a chance at a new life in exchange for his help. Roan cares only for his freedom until a new player joins the game and threatens the very existence of humanity.

The paper is available online at Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Wold Newton pages, and as a chapter in Win Scott Eckert's (Ed.) Myths for the Modern Age book, published by MonkeyBrain Books.</p>\n\n<p>Coogan co-edited (with Randall William Scott) the Comic Art Studies newsletter and also set up the Comics Studies Email service to \"coordinate communication about comic scholarship.\"[6] The newsletter's motto was Comica Amica Nobicum (\"Comics Are Our Friends!\") and originated from the Russel B. Nye Popular Culture Collection, to \"facilitate communication about the Comic Art Collection at Michigan State University, and communication about public comics collecting and scholarship in general.\"</p>\n\nIn 2005, Coogan presented a paper titled The Definition of the Superhero\n<br />at the interdisciplinary Holy Men in Tights Superheroes Conference at the School of Art History, Cinema, Classics &amp; Archaeology (AHCCA), University of Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Our Superheroes, Ourselves</h2>\n<p>Superhero fans are everywhere, from the teeming halls of Comic Con to suburban movie theaters, from young children captivated by their first comic books to the die-hard collectors of vintage memorabilia. Why are so many people fascinated by superheroes?</p>\n\n<p>In this thoughtful, engaging, and at times eye-opening volume, Robin Rosenberg--a writer and well-known authority on the psychology of superheroes--offers readers a wealth of insight into superheroes, drawing on the contributions of a top group of psychologists and other scholars. The book ranges widely and tackles many intriguing questions. How do comic characters and stories reflect human nature? Do super powers alone make a hero super? Are superhero stories good for us? Most contributors answer that final question in the affirmative. Psychologist Robert J. Sternberg, for instance, argues that we all can learn a lot from superheroes-and what we can learn most of all is the value of wisdom and an ethical stance toward life. On the other hand, restorative justice scholar Mikhail Lyubansky decries the fact that justice in the comic-book world is almost entirely punitive, noting extreme examples such as \"Rorschach\" in The Watchmen and the aptly named \"The Punisher, who embrace a strict eye-for-an-eye sense of justice, delivered instantly and without mercy.</p>", "duration": "1:05:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/majorspoilers/msp629.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 274089424, "seriesTitle": "Major Spoilers Comic Book Podcast", "pubDate": 1433913234, "title": "Major Spoilers Podcast #628: Pirate Eye", "author": "Major Spoilers Podcast Network", "summary": "<p>This week on the Major Spoielrs Podcast: Arrrr, here be Pirate Eye from Action Lab Entertainment!

The idea is to have another movie in production featuring an all-male cast, with Channing Tatum set to produce and possibly star. While many of us are troubled by the boy vs. girl nature of franchise, and even more troubled that the Interwebz seems to be taking sides on who is going to \"win\", the idea that the original Ghostbusters (Egon, Peter, Ray, and Winston) have franchised their company to others is rather interesting.

In 1954, psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham wrote a scathing indictment of comic books called Seduction of the Innocent. Its central premise was that comics were the leading contributing factor to juvenile delinquency. (At the time, 90% of all children were reading comic books.) That same year, Dr. Wertham testified at special hearings on comic books at the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency in the United States. Comic books were on trial!</p>\n\n<p>Diagram for Delinquents captures the zeitgeist of late 1940s / early 1950s America and investigates how the funny books found themselves on the bonfire. Using expert interviews and never-seen-before historical photographs and films, Diagram goes further than any documentary to explore and understand the controversial figure at the center of this American tale: Fredric Wertham.</p>\n\n<p>The DVD (as well as a digital download version) is now available for purchase at the Sequart Store.\n<br />[rating:3.5/5]</p>\n\n<p><strong>MATTHEW</strong>\n<br />Savage Dragon #202\n<br />Story By: Erik Larsen\n<br />Art By: Erik Larsen\n<br />Cover By: Erik Larsen\n<br />Price: $3.99</p>\n\n<p>Stripped of his lightning powers, Malcolm Dragon finds that he can no longer rely on the one thing that kept him alive!

Located in the remote Nevada desert near the dry bed of Groom Lake, Area 51 is the most famous military installation in the world that doesn't \"officially\" exist. In Area 51, author Dwight Zimmerman and artist Greg Scott unravel the real history - minus the aliens and sci-fi movie plots - revealing in detail how for more than 60 years, the CIA, the U.S. Air Force, and aerospace company Lockheed Martin have all used Area 51 as a staging ground for test flights of experimental or highly classified aircrafts. Scott illustrates the Archangel-12 as well as follow-on aircrafts, such as the U-2, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, while author Zimmerman tells the history of how they sprang from the research and development conducted at Area 51.

Several gameplay elements were designed to increase the game's accessibility, such as a locking pistol, the supplementing of each team with weak AI bots for easier kills, and temporary power-ups. Respawn describes the game as bringing \"scale, verticality, and story\" to first-person shooter multiplayer gaming, incorporating elements traditionally used in single-player campaigns. The game uses Microsoft's cloud computing services to offload non-player activity to servers and optimize the home computer for graphical performance.</p>\n\n<p>[rating:4/5]</p>\n\n<p><strong>MATTHEW</strong>\n<br />Sex Criminals #5\n<br />Story By: Matt Fraction\n<br />Art By: Chip Zdarsky\n<br />Cover By: Chip Zdarsky\n<br />The best part of a new relationship is the first three weeks, right?

Better. Stronger. Faster. The original Six Million Dollar Man, Steve Austin was a man barely alive until the OSI turned him into the world\u2019s first Bionic Man. Now he and Oscar Goldman are the most effective team in National Security. But a rogue faction in the OSI is making a power play for that position with a new type of infiltration agent \u2013 one that is completely obedient and robotic. Can a soulless machine that wears Steve Austin\u2019s very face make the Six Million Dollar Man obsolete? For the 1st Time EVER! Fan favorite toy-line character Maskatron makes his Six Million Dollar Man debut and becomes a part of the classic television series mythology with a violent and terrifying purpose. And as Steve\u2019s world is threatened from within, his very actions unknowingly release an alien menace upon an unsuspecting world. Classic action, powerful science fiction, and a cast of characters from one of television\u2019s most original series combine to make The Six Million Dollar Man: Season Six a must have for comic fans!</p>\n\n<p>[rating:4/5]</p>\n\n<p><strong>MATTHEW</strong>\n<br />The Movement #10\n<br />Writer: Gail Simone\n<br />Artist: Freddie Williams II\n<br />Publisher: DC Comics\n<br />Guest-starring Batgirl!

More specific to this tale: Would we secretly want it to happen?\n<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Told through the perspective of an underground rapper named Reese, Max Bemis' gripping story explores a scenario in which we watch our modern society gradually evolve (or is it devolve?) into an evil empire.</p>\n\n<p>[rating:2/5]</p>\n\n\n<p>Major Spoilers Poll of the Week\n<br />This time of year I notice a lot of people switching jobs, quitting jobs, or simply looking for opportunities to move ahead in the company.

It first appeared in discrete two-to-four-page episodes, in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Metal Hurlant between 1976 and 1980, and later in the American version of the same magazine, Heavy Metal, starting in 1977. It was subsequently collected as a graphic novel in various editions.</p>\n\n<p>Mobius has explained that the story was improvised in a deliberately whimsical or capricious manner. For this reason, the story is at times (deliberately) confusing. The \"garage\" itself is actually an asteroid in the constellation Leo which houses a pocket universe.

This is the history of the era and the art it produced. The book looks at the pioneers of the comicbook and the comic's founding links with sleazy pulp magazines; the campaign for censorship; the fraught relationship between the comicbook artists and their publishers; how what they did was rarely recognised as art at the time - and of course the comics themselves.\n<br />[rating:3/5]</p>\n\n<p><strong>MATTHEW</strong>\n<br />CODENAME: ACTION #1 (of 5)\n<br />Chris Roberson (w)\n<br />Jonathan Lau (a) Jae Lee, Francesco Francavilla, Jonathan Lau, Johnny\n<br />Desjardins, Captain Action Spy cover (c)\n<br />5 regular covers will be shipped in equal ratios\n<br />FANS, ASK YOUR RETAILER FOR THE:\n<br />Captain Action photo retailer incentive cover\n<br />Jae Lee black &amp; white retailer incentive cover\n<br />FC \u2022 32 pages \u2022 $3.99 \u2022 Teen+\n<br />During the height of the Cold War, unknown forces scheme to heat up a global conflict.

But comics don\u2019t treat death as a permanent thing. For years readers have seen death become the revolving door in comics; a gimmick, a ploy to part the reader with the money, a sensational event that can be sensationalized across the pages of the few surviving mega newspapers across the country. In short death seems to have lost all meaning for the comic book reader.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://majorspoilers.com/2013/03/12/major-spoilers-death-of-the-week-death-death-and-oh-yes-death/\">LINK</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>\n<br />Tokyo Babylon It\u2019s 1991, the last days of Japan\u2019s bubble economy, and money and elegance run through the streets.

The first is the safe route, which means it takes 100 years or more to put a colony on the Moon, which is a good thing, because everyone knows the Moon blew up in 1999.  The other is to seek out strange new worlds, and make a buck or two by smuggling spice for the Hutts.  The second is a bit more reckless, but can lead to so much more in the end.

Which bring us to Ben Tennyson and Robby Reed.\u00a0 Both heroes, both with gizmos that allow them to literally dial in the hero/power they want.\n<br />Two kids. Two devices. One championship belt.\n<br />DIAL H FOR HERO\n<br />Dial H for Hero is a comic book feature published by DC Comics about a mysterious dial that enables an ordinary person to become a superhero for a short time, by selecting the letters H-E-R-O in order. Each time it is used, the dial causes its possessor to become a superhero with a different name, costume, and powers. These superheroes are usually new, but on one occasion the dial caused its user to become a duplicate of an existing superhero, Plastic Man. Some versions of the dial contain additional letters, allowing other kinds of transformations.\n<br />BEN 10\n<br />The franchise is about a boy who acquires a watch-like alien device called the Omnitrix (later the Ultimatrix) attached to his wrist that allows him to turn into alien creatures. In April 2008, Ben 10 (the original television series) was succeeded by Ben 10: Alien Force, which itself was succeeded in April 2010 by Ben 10: Ultimate Alien.\n<br />[poll id=\"216\u201d]</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.majorspoilers.com/major-spoilers-poll-of-the-week-pow-dialing-it-in-edition\">LINK</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>\n<br />Usagi Yojimbo Book 6 \u2013 Circles\n<br />Circles features the graphic-novel-length epic title story, in which Usagi returns to his native village only to find everything very different indeed. (The discovery that his mentor, whom he thought dead, is actually alive and kicking is only the first of the shocks that await him.) \u201cCircles\u201d is an epic adventure, a love story, and one of the most affecting Usagi stories ever. In addition to the 80-page \u201cCircles,\u201d this volume includes \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d \u201cThe Duel,\u201d and the hard-to-find \u201cThe Tangled Skein\u201d from Critters #38. Jam-packed with lethal sword battles alternating with humor, horror, suspense and slapstick, this beautifully crafted and exciting volume (with an introduction by Jeff Smith creator of Bone) is both an excellent starting point for new readers, and an absolute necessity for Usagi completists.

When contacted by \u201cBig D\u201d (voiced by Paul Frees) about criminal activities in Empire City, they became superheroes. Like the Monkees, the group\u2019s appearance (in their musician form) was based on 1960s pop star stereotypes, which included somewhat long hair, brightly colored (and matching) outfits, high-heeled boots, screaming female fans and, unlike the Monkees, no percussion or bass instruments.\n<br />The Mighty Heroes (1966)\u2028<br />The Mighty Heroes was an animated television series created by Ralph Bakshi for the Terrytoons company. The original show debuted on CBS, on Oct. 29, 1966, and ran for 1 season for 21 episodes. The series is set in Good Haven, a city that is continually beset by various supervillains.

Van Ness in Watchmen as Literature (McFarland, 2010). She pointed to the excerpt from Under the Hood in chapter 1 and the paperclipped note on its first page, \u201c\u2018We present here excerpts from Hollis Mason\u2019s autobiography, UNDER THE HOOD, leading up t the time when he became the masked adventurer, Nite Owl. Reprinted with permission of the author\u2019 (27). This \u2018we\u2019 is the novels only reference to the narrator\u201d (p. 61). This comment inspired me to track down the identity of the narrator and it led to a series of discoveries about the novel.</p>\n\n<p>Read through these clues and see if you can figure out why there is no need for a sequel to Watchmen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Moore and Gibbons build the sequel into the text?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n        <li>These clues assume that Watchmen has been published diagetically (diagetic = in the world of the story).</li>\n        <li>What does the diagetic publication of Watchmen imply about Veidt\u2019s status in 1986?</li>\n        <li>Who probably owns DC Comics in the world of Watchmen and what does that probable imply or indicate?</li>\n        <li>I.9.4. What do Under the Hood and Gladiator have in common? What book is missing from Hollis Mason\u2019s bookshelf? How is Hollis Mason\u2019s authorship of Under the Hood connected to the authorship/source of the diagetic Watchmen?</li>\n        <li>D1-1. Under the Hood excerpt. In the paperclipped note, who is \u201cwe\u201d, where is \u201chere\u201d, and how do they have the permission of the author, Hollis Mason, who is dead? Who has inherited Hollis Mason\u2019s copyright of Under the Hood.</li>\n        <li>IV.15. Who has access to this conversation between Hollis Mason and Dr. Manhattan after Mason\u2019s retirement?</li>\n        <li>D-6. Who would have the ability to get Kovac\u2019s arrest report and various childhood files? Or Malcom Long\u2019s notebooks?</li>\n        <li>VII.13-15. Who has access to the story of Dan and Laurie\u2019s failed lovemaking?</li>\n        <li>D-7. Why is \u201cBlood from the Shoulder of Pallas\u201d included? It doesn\u2019t reveal anything about the background of the characters. It doesn\u2019t supply any real information that contributes to an understanding of the larger story.</li>\n        <li>IX. Who has access to Jon and Laurie\u2019s conversation on Mars? This is a crucial conversation (more so than some of the invented conversations discussed below in the \u201cProblems\u201d section) because it explains why Jon returned to Earth and would therefore offer a real selling point for the book.</li>\n        <li>D-9. Who has access to Sally Jupiter\u2019s scrapbook?</li>\n        <li>D-10. Who could have taken a picture of Veidt\u2019s desktop, with calendar?</li>\n        <li>XI. Who has access to Veidt\u2019s discussions with Dan and Rorschach at Karnak?</li>\n        <li>XII. Who has access to the events at Karnak?</li>\n        <li>XII.20 What does the publication of Watchmen mean about Dan and Laurie\u2019s agreement to keep Veidt\u2019s plan secret?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Problems with this theory:</strong>\n<br />It seems unlikely that Moore and Gibbons intended this reading of Watchmen as they initially only planned 6 issues and originally intended to run letter pages after issue three and so included Under the Hood excerpts only as a placeholder until letter pages started. Moore originally planned to use MLJ\u2019s Mighty Crusader characters and so started the story with the death of the Shield. All of these arguments are versions of the intentional fallacy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy).\n<br />Watchmen was published in September 1986, so the turnaround time from October of 1985 is problematic, but not impossible.\n<br />Some of the depiction of the characters has to be declared fictional or speculative under this theory: All the Bernie/Bernard interaction at the newsstand, the Shea/Hira interaction on the island and the freighter, the police officers interaction in chapter 5 (and elsewhere), Godfrey and Seymour at the New Frontiersman, Veidt\u2019s interactions with his servants and his role in their deaths. But some of these interactions could have been recorded by Veidt in his bugging and so might have been found. And other interactions might have come out of Congressional testimony, other investigations, or interviews published as part of the coverage of the revelations of Veidt\u2019s role in the squid attack (such as the war room in chapter 10).\n<br />Likely the inclusion of Tales of the Black Freighter is symbolic, either on the part of the source or \u201cMoore\u201d and \u201cGibbons\u201d (the diagetic versions of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons). It\u2019s also likely that many of the other texts mentioned in the book (e.g. The Day the Earth Stood Still, \u201cThe Architects of Fear\u201d) are also symbolic.</p>", "duration": "1:02:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/80/9f/2c/809f2c71-0f06-0a24-c146-7071bef5f0f7/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/majorspoilers/msp343.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Comic Books", "Literature", "Movies", "Pop Culture", "Visual Arts", "watchmen", "dr. peter coogan", "dc comics", "comic book conventions", "comic book discussion", "comic book podcast", "humor", "alan moore", "theory", "major spoilers classified"]}, {"seriesId": 274089424, "seriesTitle": "Major Spoilers Comic Book Podcast", "pubDate": 1315982077, "title": "Major Spoilers Podcast #342: Legends of the Dark Knight: Venom", "author": "The Major Spoilers Crew", "summary": "<p><img alt=\"They never should have cancelled legends of the dark knight\" height=\"600\" src=\"http://www.majorspoilers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/msp342PICON.jpg\" title=\"Legends of the Dark Knight: Venom\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>This week on the show: Shoes from the future - TODAY!

Adams was inducted into the Eisner Award\u2019s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Harvey Awards\u2019 Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999.\n<br />John Lindley Byrne (born July 6, 1950) is a British-born Canadian-American author and artist of comic books. Since the mid-1970s, Byrne has worked on nearly every major American superhero. Byrne\u2019s better-known work has been on Marvel Comics\u2019 X-Men and Fantastic Four and the 1986 relaunch of DC Comics\u2019 Superman franchise. Coming into the comics profession exclusively as a penciler, Byrne began co-plotting the X-Men comics during his tenure on them, and launched his writing career in earnest with Fantastic Four (where he also started inking his own pencils). During the 1990s he produced a number of creator-owned works, including Next Men and Danger Unlimited. He also wrote the first issues of Mike Mignola\u2019s Hellboy series and produced a number of Star Trek comics for IDW Publishing.\n<br />CREATE!\n<br />[poll id=\"196\"]</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.majorspoilers.com/major-spoilers-poll-of-the-week-byrne-vs-adams-edition\">VOTE</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Trade Paperback of the Week</strong>\n<br />Fables Volume 01: Legends in Exile\u2028<br />Writer: Bill Willingham\u2028<br />Artist: Lan Medina\n<br />When a savage creature known only as the Adversary conquered the fabled lands of legends and fairy tales, all of the infamous inhabitants of folklore were forced into exile.

The book also addresses a wide range of prejudices and issues, but with a science-fiction twist; monsters, robots and fantasy creatures often face the bigotry and problems faced by real-world human minorities.\n<br />The series is noted for its comic-book references and visual \u201csight gags\u201d relating to the genre.

Jake\u2019s father\u2019s illness and subsequent death lead Jake to read his father\u2019s account of the early days after the change; this in turn allows Alanguilan to show the reader the often horrific sequence of events that followed chickenkind\u2019s sudden elevation to sapience.

His groundbreaking tenure on DC Comics\u2019 SWAMP THING set new standards for graphic storytelling and touched off a revolution in the medium that is still expanding today. Building on the title\u2019s framework of gothic horror with a remarkably intuitive narrative style and an unprecedented depth of characterization, Moore\u2019s vision was realized through the hauntingly beautiful artwork of such collaborators as Stephen Bissette, John Totleben, Dan Day and Rick Veitch. The result is one of comics\u2019 most enduring masterpieces.\n<br />Now, for the first time, Moore\u2019s entire run \u2014 including his never-before-reprinted debut issue \u2014 is available in archival hardcover editions. This first volume, collecting issues 20-27 of THE SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING, also features a foreword by famed horror author Ramsey Campbell and a new introduction by Swamp Thing co-creator and original series editor Len Wein.</p>\n\n<p>Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:podcast@majorspoilers.com\" title=\"e-mail the show!\">podcast@majorspoilers.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Music from this episode comes from Armin Brewer (intro) and James Kennison (closing) from the <a href=\"http://nobodyslistening.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nobody's Listening Podcast\">Nobody's Listening Podcast</a>.

All the characters are anthropomorphic animals (female characters are often much more anthropomorphized, though it varies depending on the animal.), their specific species reflecting their personality and their part in the story. For example, nearly all the policemen are canid, usually German Shepherds, Bloodhounds, Foxes or Scottish Terriers.\n<br />The strip is made with a rather dirty-realist outlook, a dark cinematic style and fairly clean, realistic lines. Coupled with the truly lavish and time-consuming drawing, done in watercolor, the strip appears very realistic indeed despite using animals. The quality of the drawing has improved noticeably throughout the series, with sharper, higher-quality colour and fewer grainy lines in later issues.</p>\n\n\n<p>Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:podcast@majorspoilers.com\" title=\"e-mail the show!\">podcast@majorspoilers.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Music from this episode comes from Armin Brewer (intro) and James Kennison (closing) from the <a href=\"http://nobodyslistening.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nobody's Listening Podcast\">Nobody's Listening Podcast</a>.

During his adventures, he encounters the warrior Pigts (whose religion reveres aardvarks) and the insane wizard Necross who turns himself into a giant stone Thrunk (a parody of The Thing). Most of the series\u2019 prominent characters are introduced (or at least mentioned) in these issues, including Elrod of Melvinbone; Lord Julius; Artemis (a.k.a. The Roach); and Jaka.

He\u2019s the one that sent along the Poll of the Week for this week, and I guess from the Skrull point of view, one might spend endless hours pondering the crazy beard look \u2013 especially if you are from a race that has more than enough reason to want to cover their chins.  Regardless of the mental state of our shape shifting friend, the big question remains\u2026\n<br />Who makes this look \"look\" good?\n<br />A) Dumbledore\n<br />B) Alan Moore\n<br />C) John Brown</p>\n\n<p>Get over to the Major Spoilers Website and vote.\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.majorspoilers.com/archives/24873.htm/\" target=\"_blank\">VOTE</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>MAJOR SPOILERS DISCUSSION: Surrogates: Flesh and Bone</strong>\n<br />\n<em>In a dark, downtown alley in Central Georgia Metropolis, a juvenile prank goes too far and a homeless man is killed. When the ensuing investigation reveals that the attackers aren\u2019t who they appeared to be, justice depends on the testimony of a single missing witness \u2013 a street snitch with a history of providing information to a cop named Harvey Greer. Harvey is placed on special assignment to track down the informant, but others have their own designs, including a wealthy socialite and an ex-con turned religious leader known to his followers as The Prophet. As days pass and anger among the anti-surrogate population grows, the city stands on a razor\u2019s edge. Will punishment be exacted in a courtroom or on the streets? Set fifteen years prior to the events of the original Surrogates graphic novel, Flesh & Bone sheds light on the past that binds the cast together. From the streets of Central Georgia Metropolis to the boardroom of Virtual Self, Inc., Flesh & Bone takes us on a journey through a city struggling to come to grips with its present. Not only a suspenseful thriller but also a cautionary tale, this book reminds us that tomorrow will be determined by the choices we make today.</em></p>\n\n<p>Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:podcast@majorspoilers.com\" title=\"e-mail the show!\">podcast@majorspoilers.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Music from this episode comes from Armin Brewer (intro) and James Kennison (closing) from the <a href=\"http://nobodyslistening.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nobody's Listening Podcast\">Nobody's Listening Podcast</a>.

Like a brutal accident, you can\u2019t watch but you can\u2019t turn away. The story follows an ex-preacher man, Jesse, who has become disgusted with God\u2019s abandoning of His responsibilities. So Jesse starts off into the wilds of Texas with his hitman girlfriend and new best friend (a vampire) to find God so that he can give Him a piece of his mind. Despite its superficial perversity, this book contains what may be the most moral character in mainstream comics. A cult hit in the making.

True, the day to day dangers exist, but no longer are the Guard soldiers, instead they are escorts, pathfinders, weather watchers, scouts and body guards for the mice who live among the territories. Many skills are necessary for the guard to keep the borders safe. They must find new safeways and paths from village to village, lead shipments of goods from one town to another and, in case of attack, guard against all evil and harm to their territories.\u201d They are not simply soldiers that fight off intruders; rather, they are guides for the common mice looking to journey without confrontation from one hidden mouse village to another. The Guard patrols borders, finds safeways and paths through dangerous territories and treacherous terrain, watches weather patterns, and keeps the mouse territories free of predators. They do so with fearless dedication so that they might not just exist, but truly live.</em></p>\n\n<p>Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:podcast@majorspoilers.com\" title=\"e-mail the show!\">podcast@majorspoilers.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Music from this episode comes from Armin Brewer (intro) and James Kennison (closing) from the <a href=\"http://nobodyslistening.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nobody's Listening Podcast\">Nobody's Listening Podcast</a>.
