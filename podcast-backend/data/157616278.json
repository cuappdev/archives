He has one of the most profoundly powerful stories about how to grow a complex (and regional) business using everything from social media to marketing automation. It has worked so well for him, that he went from selling swimming pools (which he still does) to helping other businesses understand how to leverage this amazing moment in time to grow a business (which he spends the bulk of his work time on). Marcus Sheridan is an incredible human being. Not just because of how he transformed River Pools And Spas into a thriving business during economically challenging times, but how he morphed that into The Sales Lion. Now, he's published his first business book, They Ask You Answer, in which he breaks down how inbound sales, content marketing and the digital channels can help your brand flourish. He's an amazing speaker and passionate entrepreneur. I count myself lucky that I can call him a friend as well.

You meet someone that you have always admired, and you become fast friends. I've been with my talent bureau for over a decade (hey Speaker's Spotlight). Each year they have a holiday party for staff, speakers and friends. I always have the best of intentions to go, but I've never been. This past December, I finally went. While standing in the darkish and loud office space, Neil Pasricha came over and introduced himself. I've known about Neil for a long while. I knew him as the hugely popular #1 bestselling author of The Book Of Awesome and The Happiness Equation. I knew him as one of the most popular TED speakers in the world. I knew him, because he used to work at Walmart in their leadership development division (and Walmart was a client of Mirum). I knew him as a very popular speaker on the topic of happiness, authenticity and living a life with meaning. Still, we never had the chance to connect - one-on-one and in our protein forms. Until now. Neil is also known for his blog (that started this all) called, 1000 Awesome Things.

Do you think that collaboration is over-rated? Would you rather spend time alone than out at a networking event?

Here's the good news: You are not alone... and if you are, there's nothing wrong with that. It turns out that some of our best thinkers and innovators are introverted.

Well, that was a pretty insane 2016, wasn't it? And, not just from a political standpoint (but, yes, that too). In an effort to change mindsets, think differently about 2017 and get some insights that may spark a change in your thinking, Seth Godin\u00a0agreed to come on the show, and talk about where he sees the world, where the opportunity lies and how to think about this coming year with optimism (or, as he calls it, realism). Seth just published a monster of a book. Yes, big ideas (that's what he does), but this time he packed it into an even bigger format. The book is hefty. What Does It Sound Like When You Change Your Mind is a huge collection of Seth's writing. 800 pages, over-sized, and over-weight. I'd call it a collectible coffee table book, but I'm worried it will crush the average coffee table to bits. As always, Seth is philosophical, practical and a ray of light and prosperity.

His best-selling book, The E-Myth, made me rethink everything (from a business and a motivational perspective). It also came at the perfect time... just as Twist Image (now Mirum) was starting to take shape. Originally published in 1995, and now available in fifteen languages, The E-Myth Revisited has become the indispensable handbook for millions of small business owners, franchisors, and entrepreneurs alike. Recently, Gerber continued publishing books like The Dreaming Room\u00a0(a book\u00a0that helps entrepreneurs practice a new approach to creative and strategic thinking) then Awakening The Entrepreneur Within\u00a0and now, Beyond The E-Myth. This is his simple (hard to do) eight-styes process to help entrepreneurs move to a place of working \"on\" the business instead of \"in\" it.

It's not just fake news. The entire media business is in a tailspin now. The last United States Presidential Election called into question what, exactly, is going on with journalism? Facts vs. opinions. Left side vs. right side. \u00a0Traditional media vs. the digital marketplace.The entire world of journalism is being called into question. Who is responsible for fake news? Who should pay for journalism? How do we navigate, in a world where our most trusted sources were a huge part of how slanted our perceptions of the world are? So many questions. My professional career started off in journalism (this was prior to becoming both a publisher and marketer), so yes, I have a soft spot for all things journalism. There are few who are looking at journalism and the new media with a sharper eye than Jay Rosen. I'm a huge fan. Rosen teaches journalism at New York University, where he has been on the faculty since 1986. He is the author of PressThink, a blog about journalism's ordeals in the age of the web, which he launched in 2003. In 1999, Yale University Press published his book, What Are Journalists For?, which was about the rise of the civic journalism movement. I was hoping that Jay could provide us with some insights on what happened and where we go from here. His answers will shock you.

The first part of this program has been focused on the theme of \"fascination.\" With that, our team connected with famed bestselling author, Julie Klam, at the InterContinental New York Barclay's Gin Parlour for a conversation about the power of fascination. Truthfully, I had nothing to do with this project, but jumped at the opportunity to have Julie on this show. I've been a fan of her work for a long time.\u00a0Julie Klam interned at Late Night with David Letterman and went on to write for the likes of Rolling Stone, Harper's Bazaar, and The New York Times Magazine.

She's the author of many narrative non-fiction books like Friendkeeping, Love At First Bark, You Had Me At Woof and Please Excuse My Daughter.

He's also a fellow marketing agency professional. He's been in the trenches as long as I have, and has been through it all. He's currently heading up his own content marketing agency called, The Tite Group. We don't just commiserate when we're together. We celebrate. We both feel extremely fortunate to be doing the work that we're doing. The similarities don't stop there. Ron Tite is a world class speaker on something he calls, The Experience Economy. He's a lover of all things stand-up comedy (he's, actually, a pretty great stand-up and improv artist as well). Most recently, Ron co-authored his first book (along with my friends at The Art Of Productions - Scott Kavanagh and Christopher Novais) called, Everyone's An Artist - How Creativity Gives You The Edge In Everything You Do.

Time sometimes forgets the name of those that we should never forget. It may be easy to point to a book or author as a form of inspiration. For me, I happened stumble upon a magical magazine in the early days called, Fast Company. That magazine got my engines going. It helped me to learn, think and imagine a better kind of business world. I still never miss a print issue, and will visit their website daily for more insights. Most know William C. Taylor (known to most as Bill Taylor), as an amazing speaker, journalist and author. Mavericks At Works and Practically Radical were not only bestsellers, but timely books that further pushed the boundaries of how great work can get done. Now, Bill Taylor is back is an awesome and powerful read titled, Simply Brilliant -\u00a0How Great Organizations Do Ordinary Things in Extraordinary Ways. He doesn't write about Amazon and/or Apple, but has searched out and dug deep into many organizations and industries that you would not suspect in a world where most believe that all innovation and ingenuity is coming from Silicon Valley. Many also don't realize that Taylor's other claim to fame, includes being the co-founder of Fast Company. He was, literally, there as our world of business changed and was bringing it forward to the rest of us. His insights are always welcome and refreshing.

Is there a formula to creating a winning brand? I used to think this was a silly notion. Similar to when a client wants to create something that goes viral. Then, back in 2010, I read an amazing book by Sally Hogshead called, Fascinate. To this day, it is one of the most thoughtful and actionable books on how to captivate an audience through the power of persuasion. After this book, Hogshead published another best-selling gem called, How The World Sees You. This book really inspired a new direction in how I create content, because of how it focused so deeply not on what I was trying to accomplish, but rather my perception as others define it. Throughout the years, Sally has become a dear friend. She is so much more than a best-selling business book author and world renowned speaker. In her second year of advertising, Sally won more awards than any other copywriter in the U.S., and was described as \"the most successful junior copywriter of all time.\" After working at Wieden + Kennedy and Fallon McElligott, by age 27 she'd opened her first ad agency, with clients such as Target and Remy Martin. Three years later, she opened the West Coast office of Crispin Porter + Bogusky as Creative Director/Managing Director. Most recently, she did something few authors dare to do. She went back and updated Fascinate. Not just by adding in a new chapter or foreword, but by doing a ton of new research and re-writing over half of the book. I thought the first version was next to perfect. This one? Well, let's just say that Sally nailed it. The new Fascinate is perfect.

It's her latest book, and a shift in how she wants to think about her personal brand and her business model.

He co-founded the magazine in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. He is also founding editor of the Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers' Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy, Out of Control (a graphic novel about robots and angels), The Silver Cord (an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools), and a personal favorite, What Technology Wants (from 2010).

Some know Ryan Holiday as a media strategist, while others know him as a PR machine. Others know him as a speaker, and some know him as a bestselling author. Recently, it seems, Ryan has decided to focus on being a thoughtful non-fiction writer. His efforts have been paying off. His latest book, Ego Is The Enemy, has quickly become a huge bestseller. His last book, The Obstacle Is The Way, exploded as well, as many professional athletes (especially in the NFL) latched on to his modern take on stoicism. It may not seem obvious, but Ryan is looking back on an ancient form of philosophy and modernizing it with amazing insights for people today. How did he make this happen? What do brands (and business professionals) need to know about this? It's important and it matters. What is holding us back? How do we think about ourselves, others and the work that we do? Are social media and technology making us the worst people possible? Ryan's first book was, Trust Me I'm Lying, and his second book was, Growth Hacker Marketing. He's also a contributor to the New York Observer and many more. Many people consider Ryan to be one of the brightest thinkers in business today. I agree.

These days, you can't throw a business professional down a flight of stairs without the words \"digital transformation\" tumbling out of their mouths. Every business, in every space (small, medium and large) is faced with how digital is transforming the very landscape of business today. When I think of digital transformation and what it takes, I think about David Rogers.\u00a0Recently, David published his latest book, The Digital Transformation Playbook. David is a Columbia Business School professor, brand strategist, and the founder of the Center on Global Brand Leadership's acclaimed BRITE conference on brands, innovation, and technology. Famed ad critic, Bob Garfield, said this about the book: \"Seldom have the effects of digital media on legacy industries and innovators alike been so succinctly and scholarly-ly explained. I won't much detail the Playbook, except to say it breaks down the five main areas of business turned upside down by digital revolution: customers, competition, data, innovation and value. Not to put too fine a point on it, everything we learned about these fundamentals since the Industrial Revolution has ceased to be true. To be even blunter, take Jack Welch's triumphalist bestseller from the old analog days and set it on fire; it is worthless. Rogers uses case histories to illustrate how and why the times they are a changing'. And more importantly, exactly how to adapt.\" David is also the author of The Network Is Your Customer, The Handbook On Brand And Experience Management, There's No Business That's Not Show Business, and many other pieces of research.

It's playful, fascinating and deeply relevant to those thinking about consumers and how to grow your business. Recently, she published a book titled, The Confidence Game, in an effort to unpack why we get fooled by others and how we deal with that when it happens. She's also the author of Mastermind - How To Thnk Like Sherlock Holmes (which came out in 2013).

It used to be that an individual could write a business book and leverage that medium to become an international celebrity. It still happens, just not as much as it used to. The barrier to entry has been lowered (almost anybody can write a book and self-publish it these days). The intrinsic value of writing a business book has changed as well (the entire book publishing industry is still in the midst of massive disruption). With that, many people - each and every day - try to write a bestselling book. Few will achieve what Nicholas Boothman has done with books like How To Make People Like You in 90 Seconds (or less), Convince Them in 90 Seconds (or less) and How To Make Someone Fall In Love With You in 90 Minutes (or less). He's not just a hugely popular author who has sold millions of books, appeared in every major news outlet and speaks all over the world, he's also using what he learned about creating compelling content and getting it published to teach the rest of us how to do it better (and make it work). Most recently, he published, How To Write A Saleable Book (in 10-minute bursts of madness), along with courses and seminars and more.

I'm not apologetic about my efforts, but I am well-aware that I hit the genetic lottery. Jack Myers is in a similar boat. He's the founder of Media Village and has written many books (including Virtual Worlds, Reconnecting With Customers, Adbashing and Hooked Up). Now, he's back with The Future of Men - Masculinity in the Twentieth Century. It's an important read, and an important conversation to have (no matter how uncomfortable the topic is in a world where women's equality, racial equality and more are still - sadly - issues that need to be resolved).

When it comes to innovation, one of the most provocative voices in the field is Michael Schrage. It may seem obvious to us now that innovation is when consumer's accept new products and services, but this wasn't always a commonly-held belief (until Michael brought it forward). Ever hear of rapid-prototyping? What about simulations and modelling to improve ROI on innovation investments? All of this thinking was brought into our world by Michael. A research fellow at the MIT Sloan School's Center for Digital Business, author of books like The Innovator's Hypothesis, Who Do You Want Your Customers To Become?, Serious Play, Shared Minds and more, he is a legendary business, innovation, technology and marketing mind. It has been said that no one knows more about how to maximize return on investment from innovation processes than Michael Schrage.

If you're not sure if you're focusing on what's important. You need to read that book. I don't even know how many copies of that book I have passed along to friends and colleagues.

All proceeds from the book went to the Malaria No More charity (and that was close to $500,000), while the book wound up hitting #2 on Amazon (plus, it was published on Seth Godin's The Domino Project imprint). Well, Michael does a lot more than publish books that become movements. He spends the bulk of his day running Box Of Crayons - a consultancy to help time-crunched managers do less good work and much more great work. Over the years, he's learned a thing or two. With that, he's back with a brand new book, The Coaching Habit, that has some thoughts on how we can get the best out of ourselves (whether we're coaching someone, coaching ourselves or getting coached).

The book is being described as a modern day approach to customer service. Jay says that customer service is the new marketing (a point we debate on this episode). Jay's\u00a0last business book was Youtility. And, as if that weren't enough, he turned his blog, Convince And Convert into a major publishing platform that features multiple voices along with ton of fascinating podcasts and more.

We have learned a lot in the past few years about what works in business. We have companies' valuations explode with massive growth. We've also re-invented the spaces that we work in. So, how has it all worked out?\u00a0Do open-floor plans really work, or do they make employees miserable? Are there companies which really put their employees' welfare first, and their clients second? \u00a0Are annual performance reviews really necessary? These are just some of the questions that Dr. David Burkus has been trying to answer. The culmination is his second book,\u00a0Under New Management: How Leading Organizations Are Upending Business as Usual. David is\u00a0a regular contributor to Harvard Business Review, Forbes, Psychology Today and 99U. When not speaking or writing, he's also an assistant professor of management at Oral Roberts University, where he teaches courses on organizational behavior, creativity, innovation, and strategic leadership.

Simply put: Douglas Rushkoff makes my brain hurt, because he is so smart. He recently published his latest book, Throwing Rocks At The Google Bus, and it will make your head spin too. All of our assumptions about disruption, the digital economy, unicorns, valuations, and how all of this technological innovation has evolved will be questioned. Not to be a contrarian for contrarian's sake, this Media Scholar also happens to understand the underpinnings of our economy, and it will startle you. The book acts as a warning and - as with everything he touches - it will make you think deeply. Rushkoff (for those who do not know) is the person responsible for coining terms like 'digital natives', 'social currency' and 'viral media'. If you've never heard of Rushkoff, he's the\u00a0winner of the Media Ecology Association's first Neil Postman award for Career Achievement in Public Intellectual Activity, he is an author, teacher, and documentarian who focuses on the ways people, cultures, and institutions create, share, and influence each other's values. He is Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at CUNY, technology and media commentator for CNN, digital literacy advocate for Codecademy.com and a lecturer on media, technology, culture and economics around the world.

To make it even better, it's a quick and simple read too. I was thrilled to see that Al is back with his second book,\u00a0Persuadable: How Great Leaders Change Their Minds to Change the World. It's a book for our modern world. We think that real leadership is about having a vision and driving it, at all costs. It turns out that times have changed.

Let's show some love. This guy... this Scott Monty guy. Long before he was Global Digital and Multimedia Communications Manager at Ford, he was a buddy. We spent countless years together - in our own corners - trying to figure out just how disruptive technology was going to be for marketing and communications professions. Prior to publishing the 500th episode of Six Pixels of Separation - The Mirum Podcast (last week), I asked on Facebook who might make a great guest, and Scott's name came up a few times. At first, I laughed because Scott and I have been friends for so long that I (wrongly) assumed he had been on the show (multiple times), but I soon realized that he had never been a guest. That's when I got embarrassed. Simply not acceptable. So, we're fixing it. And, we're showing Scott Monty the love, he rightfully deserves. Scott is a senior executive steeped in digital. He was ranked by The Economist as number one atop the list 25 Social Business Leaders and by Forbes as one of the top 10 influencers in social media, Alan Mulally, the CEO of Ford Motor Company, called him \"a visionary.\" Scott has been featured in hundreds of news and business publications in print and on the web, in dozens of books, and on a variety of mainstream media. If you're not signed up for his weekly newsletter, The Full Monty, you don't know what you're missing. In this episode, we look at the state of marketing and communications, and where it's all going.

I've been lucky to know Morgan for a few years, and was very thankful that he agreed to be my guest on the 500th episode.

I get to spend a lot of time with people that many business leaders would spend fortunes to connect with. Over the years, I've done my best to give back as well. Nothing is more fulfilling than speaking to students who are interested in business, innovation, technology and marketing. I happen to live in the same city as McGill University. Professor Karl Moore is not only an Associate Professor \u00a0at the Desautels Faculty of Management, but he is also on the faculty at Oxford. I've been lucky enough to call him a friend for a number of years, and to give back by speaking to the students at the university. He's frequently asks me to be a guest on his famed The CEO Series\u00a0radio show, as well as in his countless (and well-read) business columns for the likes of the Globe &amp; Mail and Forbes. Currently, he's in the midst of writing two books.

He is also the founder of the Center on Global Brand Leadership's acclaimed BRITE conference on brands, innovation, and technology. Garfield said: \"Seldom have the effects of digital media on legacy industries and innovators alike been so succinctly and scholarly-ly explained. I won't much detail the Playbook, except to say it breaks down the five main areas of business turned upside down by digital revolution: customers, competition, data, innovation and value. Not to put too fine a point on it, everything we learned about these fundamentals since the Industrial Revolution has ceased to be true. To be even blunter, take Jack Welch's triumphalist bestseller from the old analog days and set it on fire; it is worthless. Rogers uses case histories to illustrate how and why the times they are a changing'. And more importantly, exactly how to adapt.\" I got excited. I dug a little into Rogers and discovered a great presentation he gave at The Economist's Big Rethink CMO conference. It was fascinating. I invited Rogers to be a guest on the podcast, and he informed me that his new book will only be out in the middle of 2016. I didn't want to wait. Here's our conversation about the work he is doing, his last book (The Network Is Your Customer), and how he sees the current marketing industry.

The book was called \"a triumph of what might be called conversational philosophy... hilarious and humane\" by The New Yorker. Now, Misha is an expert on the subtle arts of negotiation and communication. His presence and work has been called transformative. He is also the host of Trampoline Hall, a lecture series which has sold out every show in its home city of Toronto since its inception, in 2001, and which has toured around North America.

Strategy. More than any other component in what makes a brand successful, strategy is at the core. What does a good strategist do? How is their work delivered, and then injected into a company? How do companies take that strategy and turn it into a valuable part of their culture. It seems like corporate mysticism. It is not. Great business leaders and thinkers like Peter Klein have the answer. It's not fake. It's a system. It's a way to think about business, the challenges it faces and how to overcome them. He co-authored the book, Think To Win -\u00a0Unleashing the Power of Strategic Thinking, to show the blueprint. He even brands the book like this: \"The entire book is an Executive Summary!\" It's an incredible read and Klein's experience as a\u00a0senior executive manager, corporate officer and high level consulting experience shines through.

I was searching for a book to ignite my creativity (or access new areas of thinking). A book that would help me think in a different way. I just wasn't \"feeling it.\" I turned to Seth Godin, and asked him what I should be reading. I think he was disappointed to learn that I had never heard of Lewis Hyde and his book, The Gift (which was published in 1983). It became the proverbial rabbit hole for me. I devoured The Gift, then moved on to Hyde's other books (Trickster Makes This World and Common As Air), and then became interested in the many articles written about him.\u00a0Hyde is a scholar, writer, critic of culture and teacher. He taught writing at Harvard University, and then he became the Luce Professor of Arts and Politics at Kenyon College in Ohio. Since 2006 he has served as the Richard L. Thomas Professor of Creative Writing at Kenyon, and a visiting fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center. Thinking he would never agree to a podcast, I took a shot... and here we are.

There's no doubt that digital has brought forward a myriad of ways to find, nurture and develop your professional life. Ways in which we can make money, do the work that matters to us, and distribute it on a global scale. Jeff Goins lives and breathes this world. His latest book, The Art of Work, not only helps people to lead the life that they were meant to lead, but also acts as another indicator of how Goins, himself, has grown his business in such a small period of time.

Some people come into our lives in the strangest of ways. I first heard of Jeffrey Hayzlett after his appearances on The Celebrity Apprentice. He was the CMO of the fledging Kodak company, and trying to re-invigorate the brand. His approach was larger than life. While the company did file for bankruptcy, he managed to transform that experience into his current brand of being a \"celebrity CMO.\" We would often run into each other on the speaking circuit, but I was profoundly humbled when, in his first business book, The Mirror Test, he named Six Pixels of Separation as one of his favorite books on digital marketing. From there, Jeffrey released, Running The Gauntlet, and - most recently - Think Big, Act Bigger. He is also the host and brains behind the C-Suite Network and more. A true provocateur and action-oriented business leader, you won't be surprised to hear his discuss everything from what brands are doing wrong today, to what he thinks of the Donald Trump brand, and whether or not having a tough-guy persona really works in business.

It's a busy world, and the push for a consumer to try something new is everywhere.\u00a0Gabriel Weinberg is the founder and CEO of DuckDuckGo. If you think you're in a competitive business, DuckDuckGo is a search engine that doesn't track you, but it's hard to compete in a Google world. Before entering the search world, Weinberg was the cofounder of Opobox, which was sold for $10 million. Now, a major book publisher is releasing a newer version of the book he co-authored titled,\u00a0Traction - How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth.\u00a0Originally, he self-published the first edition of Traction, and - using techniques from the book - managed to sell over 35,000 copies across three printings, now with 160+ 5-star Amazon reviews.

Living a happy and successful life is about the stories we tell ourselves.\" This is how I started a post back in 2010, after reading Donald Miller's book,\u00a0A Million Miles In A Thousand Years (at the recommendation of Chris Brogan). I loved the book and, long before it became en vogue to talk about content and storytelling for brands, I was seeking out new types of content to help brands tell better stories. Fast forward to the present moment. I received an email from Danny Iny asking if I had ever heard of Miller, because he had just attended The StoryBrand Marketing Workshop at thought that Miller would make an excellent guest for the show (thanks, Danny... you were right). How does a novelist become a marketing trainer? How does a novelist shift from writing books, to building a company that helps brands tell better stories? More importantly, how does a novelist - with little marketing experience prior to launching his company - get so many interesting kinds of businesses to become so much better at their marketing? What's his secret?

It's hard to deny that podcasting is really coming into its own as a media format. Everyone is jumping in. From amateurs to the biggest media companies in the world. I've been creating this podcast - on a weekly basis - since 2006. Almost a decade of shows. But, the first podcast that I ever appeared on, was the one from Donna Papacosta. At the time, I thought the format was a joke, but after spending time with Donna, I quickly felt that this might be the perfect channel for businesses to experiment with audio. Not to be another kind of radio, but to invent a new type of audio programming. Ten years later, and it is still evolving. I'm loving the podcasting value in relation to business. Donna runs a successful communications consultancy called, Trafalgar Communications. More recently, she co-authored the book, The Business Of Podcasting - How to Take Your Podcasting Passion from the Personal to the Professional, with Steve Lubetkin. This book is filled with some great insights on how to create a compelling show - from the tech behind it, to the story that's going to make it popular.

Die Empty came after his incredible debut, The Accidental Creative (also the name of his very popular podcast). Well, Todd is back with Louder Than Words, and it is a very important read (not just for creatives, but for anyone and everyone who is creating content). It's one thing to choose a platform. It's another thing to create content. For most individuals (and brands), they miss the mark. The reason? They don't really have a voice that resonates. It's not just about resonating in the moment, it's about developing and nurturing a voice that both works and is sustainable. Let's face it, it's not something easy to do, in a world where everyone is publishing so much content at a frenetic pace. Todd (and his book) are here to help.

With Steal The Show, Port is bringing together all of his skills in an effort to help business professionals present themselves better. While I've known Port's work since his first business book, most recently he has become an often-talked-about horse whisperer for very powerful speakers. Now, he's taken this master-class content and turned it into a book (and training platform).

When I think about what the Internet means to me and to business, I often think of David Weinberger.

I'm still amazed when I go back and read The Cluetrain Manifesto. I'm amazed by how much of it has come to pass. I'm amazed by how much of it is still happening. I wonder about how much more of it will be revealed in the coming years. Since then, Weinberger has stayed true to pushing his thinking around what the Internet is, and it's full potential. His other books, Small Pieces Loosely Joined, Everything Is Miscellaneous, Too Big To Know and his Cluetrain follow up (with Doc Searls), New Clues are all books that I continuously recommend to executives who are trying to grasp the impact of technology on society, culture and business.

Most recently, he published a smaller book titled, Rebalancing Society. Mintzberg also runs a business called, Coaching Ourselves. This organization is running - what looks to be - an incredible event called, Reflections (which takes place September 10th - 11th, 2015 in Montreal).

I can be old and cynical when it comes to building a personal brand. It used to be that digital media allowed all of us to present ourselves in a three-dimensional way. While that statement still stands true, we have a swath of people presenting themselves in really silly and unprofessionals ways online. Figuring out how to make a statement that is both authentic and professional can be a challenge in this Instagram world. Still, when it comes to people who really understand how to decode success, I trust Dorie Clark. Her first book, Reinventing You, was a fantastic read and she's back with Stand Out. In her latest book, Dorie tackles the super-huge challenge of how people (like you and I) can come up with breakthrough ideas that make us invaluable to the businesses that we work for. She also believes that this is the one (and potentially only) thing that will give us all the ultimate career insurance. With that, she is also a speaker and writer for Harvard Business Review and Forbes.

Most brands believe that this is an individual who can understand and implement better marketing automation solutions. I think that's short-sighted. For over a decade, I have watched Stephan Spencer become a true marketing technologist. This is someone who deeply understands how to use technology to make marketing better. Not a little better. Exponentially better. We first met in the early days of speaking at the Search Engine Strategies conferences. From there, Stephan went on to publish three seminal books on digital marketing (The Art of SEO, Google Power Search and Social eCommerce). After hearing him talk about the brand opportunities in the digital space, you will want to do two things: One, hire him (which isn't easy). Two, wonder how you can truly evolve your marketing team and think more lucidly (hint: have a notebook handy when you listen to this show).

Brands are in a very difficult predicament. It's not something that is easy to write, but it's true. Competition is fierce and it's getting more complicated, because the types of channels and messages that a brand can create has become boundless (thanks, digital marketing). With this digitization of everything, consumers continue to become more connected, empowered and educated. One might think that this means brands have new and improved opportunities to make connections. According to a McKinsey and Company article published this past February titled, Brand success in an era of Digital Darwinism, this is not the case. The research suggests that brands are losing their impact in a world of \"digitally jaded consumers.\" What's working? Good old fashioned word of mouth. Tom Asacker often sends me links to articles like this one. Just a link. They're usually worthy of a conversation, so this is it. Asacker is a branding expert (although, he prefers to think of his work as the business of belief). He is a well-respected author (The Business of Belief, Sandbox Wisdom, A Clear Eye For Branding and many more) and a friend.

Yes, those same little bricks that get jammed into our feet at two in the morning when we're trying to get a glass of water from the kitchen. Was someone making a joke? Was this serious art? A great piece of art does this. It moves you. Emotionally. Physically. It gets you thinking. After you experience it, you can't stop thinking about it. Delving online to discover who had created this piece - and if there was any more where that one had come from - you discover Nathan Sawaya. Sawaya was a corporate attorney in New York City, until he decided to leave that life to become a full-time artist working with LEGO bricks as his medium.

If ever there was a book written about what marketing \"could\" be, it would be The Cluetrain Manifesto. The book was published in 2000 and presented 95 theses organized around the Internet, culture, society and business (it also happens to be one of my my most loved books). Many point to this book as the genesis of social media. Many recite the infamous \"markets are conversations\" line from it. The truth is that many don't really understand the depth, value and insights that the book delivers. It's amazing to look at the content of this book - in 2015 - to see how much of it has come true... and how far we still have to go. It's something that two out of the four original authors have been thinking a lot about. Doc Searls and David Weinberger put together New Clues. It is 121 more theses authored for 2015. While, Rick Levine and Chris Locke opted out of taking another kick at the can, Searls and Weinberger provide much more fodder for all of us to think about.

We live in amazing times. We are both at the frontier of what is coming next and also in the midst of being connected like never before. We're seeing humanity develop, evolve and leverage technology to do amazing things. There are many pessimists, but Steven Kotler is an optimist... and a fascinating one, at that.\u00a0Steven Kotler is an American bestselling author, journalist, and entrepreneur. He is probably best known as the co-author (with Peter Diamandis of the X Prize fame) of Abundance and the recently released, Bold - How To Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact The World. With that, Steven has also written The Rise of Superman, A Small, Furry Prayer, West of Jesus, and The Angle Quickest for Flight. But, this conversation is really about his new book, Bold (also done with Diamandis). It's a fascinating look at why some of the world's most known billionaires are changing the world by doing something more than just making money. The book looks at their entrepreneurial spirit and attempts to decode their success, so that each of us can better understand what it takes to make it big.

I'm a total business book nerd. You knew that already. I do my best to read everything (literally). In the past few years, I have been (somewhat) disappointed in the genre. There has not been that many releases which have blown me away (and some of my peers). That being said, when the topic of business books does come up (which is frequent), the two books that always seem to get mentioned are,\u00a0Adam Grant's Give And Take (he has agreed to come on the show at some point soon) and Hooked by Nir Eyal. Eyal believes that there is sweet science in creating products and services that get a consumer \"hooked.\"\u00a0With a background in the video gaming and advertising businesses, Eyal spent a lot of time thinking about this - exact - topic, where he learned, applied (and often failed) at developing the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. This isn't about the creepy manipulation, but much more about what Eyal calls, \"healthful habits\" to grow business.

Back when I first started publishing music \u00a0magazines on the Internet (in the mid-nineties), there were few people writing about the power of the Internet from a business and marketing perspective. There were message boards and email lists... and that's where I first started reading the work of Bryan.\u00a0Now, Bryan Eisenberg is the co-author (along with his brother, Jeffrey Eisenberg) of the bestselling books, Call to Action, Waiting For Your Cat to Bark? and Always Be Testing. We have also shared the stage on numerous occasions, because Bryan is a professional marketing keynote speaker as well. He's done much than that. He is also the co-founder of the Web Analytics Association (now the Digital Analytics Association), serves as an advisory board member of Search Engine Strategies, the eMetrics Marketing Optimization Summit and several venture capital backed startup companies (like Bazaarvoice, Monetate, Nomi, TagMan, and more). Most recently, he launched a new startup called, IdealSpot, and a fascinating new book called, Buyer Legends - The Executive Storyteller's Guide.

It's fascinating to go through the updated version, because you can read what Don got (so) right... and (so) wrong (though it's not as much as you might think). His newly written thoughts - after every chapter - also points us further into the future. Don has been writing, speaking and consulting about technology being a business and global game-changer for over thirty years. He has authored (and co-authored) fifteen bestselling books, and is often the person who gets the calls from the CEOs of the biggest companies in the world (including many in Silicon Valley) to talk about where things are (probably) headed.

On Monday, January 26th, 2015 in Toronto, I will be taking part in a live public debate with Andrew Keen abut the value and merits of the Internet. The event will be moderated by GigaOm's Mathew Ingram and will act as a kickoff to this year's Advertising Week. It's strange to call this a debate, as there are many concepts that Andrew presents in his latest book, The Internet Is Not The Answer, that are important issues we all need to think about, and be prepared for. Still, Andrew believes that the Internet\u00a0has actually created \"an increasingly fragmented society, a digital echo chamber, in which people are more and more isolated from anyone, particularly those with different opinions and beliefs.\" I am much more bullish and hopeful as to what it is... and what it is becoming. Keen has long been a smart contrarian when it comes the over-exuberance that some people have for the Internet (I'm one of those excitable types). His books, The Cult Of The Amateur, Digital Vertigo, and now, The Internet Is Not The Answer have earned him the title, \"the Anti-Christ of Silicon Valley.\" It's a title that he feels comfortable with, so long as his thinking challenges what we think we know about technology, and whether it ultimately is good for us, as a society.

And, with that, he loves the idea that these customers can not only become loyal to a brand, but how they become willing brand influencers, publishers and word of mouth advocates... for free. But, it's not really free. The price of admission is for brands to be better (and often great), in a world where most brands still miss the mark.

If you're in the agency business, you know the new business development and pitching grind like no other. As we all know, pitching for new business is the lifeblood of any marketing agency. Winning the pitches... no matter how great of a closing record you may have, is such a strange thing. There is no real science as to why one great agency wins over another one, and it's not hard to find a litany of articles about how badly damaged the process is... and can be. From closed envelope pricing submissions to strange efforts by procurement to purchase agency services much in the same way that the company buys rubber bands. Still, the process must be understood, executed upon and mastered. Peter Levitan thinks he knows how to make it happen. After reading his book,\u00a0The Levitan Pitch - Buy This Book.

How do you make change? How do you take the time to think about what's next? What you're going to do? How you're going to do it? Does change come from a blog post? A tweet? A podcast? I'm lucky. Very lucky. I get to do things like this. I get to spend an hour with Seth Godin. While he likes to poke around at what's coming next, I get the chance to poke and prod him about the directions and ideas that he brings into our world. Seth Godin doesn't want to change you. Seth wants you to change yourself. He believes (and, I happen to agree with him) that books are one of the best ways to inspire people to make the changes necessary in lives for success. Seth just published his 18th book and - much like his personality - it's different. It's full color. It's in the size format of a magazine, but it's a book (even though, I jokingly called it a MagaBook on the show). It's called, What To Do When It's Your Turn (And It's Always Your Turn), and you won't find it in any bookstore. You also just can't buy one copy. It's all very... Seth Godin (I say that with complete peace and love). I am not going to list off his impressive accolades or past bestselling business books. It's Seth Godin. Just listen.

Some of us actually meant it, quit our jobs and went off to do other things. For others, we mutter these words beneath our breath or spout them off to family and friends on the weekend, but never really do anything to change our own, professional, situation. In June of this year, longtime marketing agency professional, Uwe Hook, did something about his unhappiness with agency life. After close to twenty years in the business, he quit his job and explained it all rather publicly in a Medium post titled, Why I quit my agency job. Several months later, DigiDay published a piece titled, Why Agency People Are So Unhappy, that \u00a0quoted Hook's piece along with other unhappy agency professionals. After reading both pieces, and others on the topic, I invited Uwe to share his thoughts. Ultimately, I don't fully understand these positions. I can empathize with the feelings, but I'm not sure I get why we would tag the industry as such, and to what benefit this serves? We should always strive ti be better and do better work, but I would much prefer the route of doing this in a positive and productive way.

This is the life of David Meerman Scott, who in marketing circles is probably best known for his bestselling business book, The New Rules of Marketing and PR (which, for many, is the bible for social media in the business world). While he recently issued his latest book, The New Rules of Sales and Service: How to Use Agile Selling, Real-Time Customer Engagement, Big Data, Content, and Storytelling to Grow Your Business, he found out that his previous book, Marketing The Moon, had been optioned by a documentary filmmaker. In this episode, we discuss David's desire to transition from a marketing author and speaker into the broader and larger space of sales and customer service (a trend that many marketing authors/speakers are following). We also look and how intrinsically connected sales, customer service and marketing have become. David is one of the most prolific writers and speakers out there. His new book challenges business to radically redefine how they connect with consumers (a topic that is near and to my heart as well).

Recently, Orleans created a Skillshare course (it's online and it's very cost-efficient) to explain her writing process. The course is called,\u00a0Creative Nonfiction - Write Truth with Style. I took it. I loved it. I wanted more. I reached out to Susan, and she was kind enough to agree to come on to the show. In studying her work - more and more - her content is supremely relevant to marketers today.

And yet, as we embrace a technology's gifts, we usually fail to consider what we're giving up in the process. Why would we bother to register the end of solitude, of ignorance, of lack? Why would we care than an absence had disappeared?&quot; This is the question that award-winning journalist at Western Living and Vancouver magazines, Michael Harris, began thinking about. If everything is always ringing, buzzing and vibrating in our pockets with some kind of alert, update or signal, are we able - as a society - to figure out what is a true signal and what is noise? Are we losing something special in a world where the is no absence because we're constantly connected to something? He wrote a book about it titled, The End Of Absence. Harris believes that we are, indeed, losing something as technology connects us more and more to information and one another. What do you think?

I love Tom Peters. I've declared it before and it's true. So, this is a total fanboy moment for me. A couple of weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to up the quality of conversation on this podcast. At the same time, I realized that there are a handful of my true idols that I've always either been scared or intimidated to ask to come on the podcast with me. I decided to make a list. Tom Peters was at the top. I never thought that he would ever agree. He responded almost right away. I've met him, in person, several times over the past decade. We've had some great chats. My level of respect for his thinking about business, marketing, and branding grows with every tweet, blog post, article and book that he writes. If you have never had the chance to see him present, you really should. He puts on a clinic in how to deliver a great presentation that oozes with big brains. Don't know who Tom Peters is? Really? Few people have shaped the idea of modern management more than he has over the last six decades. In 1982 he co-authored the seminal business book, In Search Of Excellence, which has been named one of the top three business books of the century by NPR. That's just the beginning of his accolades. For my dollar, he's changed almost everything I thought I knew about business through a series of books called The Reinventing Work Series 50List Books. The Project50 (thanks for turning me on to this, Andy Nulman) and The Brand You50 are the ones that have sent me deep down the rabbit hole of business non-fiction books. In 2003, I devoured Re-Imagine! Business Excellence In A Disruptive Age, and it still sits within arm's reach on my desk (one of the only books to do so). So, how is business doing in 2014? What does he think of personal brands, considering that he wrote the article, The Brand Called You, in Fast Company back in 1997 and - literally - ushered in the era of individuals as brands? We tackle it all and more.

I was walking through a bookstore while awaiting a dinner meeting, and I came across a book titled, Mistakes I Made At Work. Regrets... I've had a few. For the record, I believe that learning comes from setbacks and mistakes. That being said, it is often very difficult for the individual to get over themselves and their mistakes on their path to success. What do you think? How do some of the most successful people get over their mistakes to get to where they really want to be? Jessica Bacal thinks a lot about these questions. She's the director of the Wurtele Center for Work &amp; Life at Smith College, an independent women's college in Massachusetts with students from every state and from sixty countries around the world. The center's programs teach leadership skills, life skills, stress reduction and reflection. Jessica is also a writer for Huffington Post and The New York Times, so she decided to speak with twenty-five influential women to get their reflections on what they learned from some of their biggest mistakes and published the book, Mistakes I Made At Work. Jessica was hesitant to do this podcast with me. It turns out that her father is also my literary agent (I had no knowledge of this until well after I had put in the request to have her as a guest on the show). She was worried that I was just doing this to help out my literary agent. She was wrong :)&#160; Enjoy the conversation... \n\nHere it is: Six Pixels Of Separation - The Twist Image Podcast - Episode #428 - Host: Mitch Joel.\n\n\n  Running time: 57:42. \n\n  Please send in questions, comments, suggestions - mitch@twistimage.com. \n\n  Hello from Beautiful Montreal. \n\n  Subscribe over at iTunes. \n\n  Please visit and leave comments on the Blog - Six Pixels of Separation. \n\n  Feel free to connect to me directly on Facebook here: Mitch Joel on Facebook. \n\n  or you can connect on LinkedIn. \n\n  ...or on twitter.&#160; \n\n  Six Pixels of Separation the book is now available. \n\n  CTRL ALT Delete is now available too! \n\n  In conversation with Jessica Bacal.\n\n  Mistakes I Made At Work.\n\n  Wurtele Center for Work And Life at Smith College.\n\n  Follow Jessica on Twitter.\n\n  This week's music: David Usher 'St. Lawrence River'. \n\n  Get David's song for free here: Artists For Amnesty. \n\n\nDownload the Podcast here: Six Pixels Of Separation - The Twist Image Podcast - Episode #428 - Host: Mitch Joel.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/74/da/ff/74daff0f-e89b-b5cb-c37f-00664beea04a/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/74/da/ff/74daff0f-e89b-b5cb-c37f-00664beea04a/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.twistimage.com/podcast/mp3/SPOS_428_-_Jessica_Bacal.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Six Pixels of Separation", "Mitch Joel", "Twist Image", "Marketing", "Advertisement", "Communication", "Public Relation", "Social Media", "Management & Marketing"]}, {"seriesId": 157616278, "seriesTitle": "Six Pixels of Separation - Marketing and Communications Insights - By Mitch Joel at Mirum", "pubDate": 1410695109, "title": "SPOS #427 - The Future Of Work With Jacob Morgan", "author": "Mitch Joel <mitchjoel@gmail.com>", "summary": "Welcome to episode #427 of Six Pixels Of Separation - The Twist Image Podcast. It's not just the marketing of a business that fascinates me. It's everything about the future of work. This includes the actual physical office spaces that we use (and, yes, that could be at home, Starbucks or even in the tallest building of the financial district). How will teams be structured? What will the leaders of the future look like? Is Mark Zuckerberg the prototype of the CEO? It's these same thoughts that consume Jacob Morgan. So much so, that he recently published a business book titled, The Future Of Work - Attract New Talent, Build Better Leaders And Create A Competitive Organization. Jacob also wrote The Collaborative Organization in 2012 and advises many Fortune 1000 businesses on innovation and the future of work. So, if we live in a world where more and more people can start a business in their garage and sell a seven-person startup for billions of dollars, what does the future of work look and feel like?

When everybody is writing, it can be challenging to find good writing (let alone, great writing). Ann Handley is a great writer. Don't believe me? Just start reading her blog.

When people ask me about what it takes to be great at writing content (online or otherwise), I think of my dear friend, Ann. I was honored to be asked to write a blurb for her just-released book, Everybody Writes. If you're going to be writing anything (from a tweet or blog post to a book of your own), this is the book you want to read, study and leave right next to whatever it is that you will be typing on. If you lead marketing teams, you're going to want to pick up a few copy for those who are responsible for the words as well. Prior to Everybody Writes, she co-authored (with C.C. Chapman), Content Rules. She's also a columnist for Entrepreneur Magazine, and a very passionate person about the power and importance of content and words.

It was all about stand-up comedy. He was following my blog (which, kind of made me want to tidy the place up a little bit after knowing that), and he could tell that I am both a fan of standup comedy, and a student of the mechanics behind it. I love everything from how comedians develop jokes, to their biographies to documentaries about the art form, and even watching/listening to them being interviewed (yes, big fan of both Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee and Marc Maron's WTF Podcast). If you don't know James, he is a trader, investor, writer, and entrepreneur. His bio is an impressive one. He's an investor in Buddy Media (which sold to Salesforce.com for about $800 million) as well as bitly. His latest book is called, The Power Of No, and it's a great read. Also, if you're not following his blog, The Altucher Confidential, you don't know what you're missing. James and I begun a dialogue about how important understanding standup comedy can be for business success. And, after several email exchanges and back and forths, I convinced him to come on the show to discuss just how important standup comedy can be for business success. The point is that neither of us are comedians (we wouldn't even claim to be funny), but understanding and appreciating standup comedy is probably something that everyone in business should study, because we both feel that it was an important factor in our professional journeys.

Will hotels be competitive in a world of Airbnb? Will taxi companies adapt to Uber? Is every industry at risk of being disrupted by consumers and new startups who can connect, share and sell to one another in a much more efficient way because of mobile and connected technologies? Ultimately, what we're seeing is that new startups are efficient, and it's forcing brands to be efficient. Will they be up for the challenge? Just how dramatic is this evolution?

I have been in this business a long time. I was there before Google existed, and I watched the birth of search engine marketing as it's entire evolution to today. To think that brands still don't understand the power of performance-based marketing and look quizzically at marketing automation is astounding. As marketers, we've begged - for decades - to get better at knowing our consumers and being able to deliver a more personalized brand experience to them. And now... We have it. Here we are. I met Paul Roetzer a long way back. He had just opened his own performance based agency, PR 20/20. Since then, he became HubSpot's first agency partner and published two business book, The Marketing Agency Blueprint (2012), and the recently released, The Marketing Performance Blueprint.

Tom Asacker is responsible for a lot of what you read, hear and see at Six Pixels of Separation. We were introduced via a mutual business acquaintance well over a decade ago, and his presentation on the power of brands made me realize that marketing is much more than what an agency like Twist Image produces. We have to be able to communicate how we see, think and do marketing. Our message about the power of digital marketing has to be communicated beyond the four walls of our agency and client offices. Since then, we have become friends (and since then, I started blogging, podcasting, writing books, speaking and more), and I continue to be an admirer of his work, which includes books like, The Business of Belief, Sandbox Wisdom, A Clear Eye For Branding and many more. Most recently, Tom and I were sharing links via email on the choices, decisions that consumers make in this new environment. Tom believes at the root of every purchase is a depth of psychological mechanics that most marketers dismiss or ignore, and that's not something that technology can automate.

What do we really know about great ideas, creativity and where they come from? Over the years many people (much smarter than I) have looked at this topic in depth. Some prescribe to the idea that certain people are simply creative, while others are not. Some might say that being creative is a learnable skill. That may be tough for other people to swallow. David Burkus spends a lot of his time thinking about leadership, innovation and strategy. He started work on his first book, The Myths of Creativity - The Truth About How Innovative Companies Generate Great Ideas (which was recently published) upon leaving college, and believes that we tell each other a lot of stories about where creativity comes from... and they're mostly wrong. He contributes regularly in places like Harvard Business Review, Forbes, Psychology Today and 99U. When not speaking or writing, he's also an assistant professor of management at Oral Roberts University, where he teaches courses on organizational behavior, creativity and innovation, and strategic leadership.

Have you ever taken one of those personality tests? Some employers force people to take them (employees or recruits), while some of us come across them as we continue our journeys in life. Many of us take tests like this just to see if we're doing the work that we're supposed to be doing. Regardless, it's hard to argue that these test don't often pull out a thing or two about us that we may not have realized or paid enough attention to. Sally Hogshead is working on something similar... but different. In her latest business book, How The World Sees You, Sally proclaims that it's not about what you want to become, but how the people you interact with perceive you. Here's the thing: I'm typically skeptical about these sorts of efforts. I was blown away by the simplicity and accuracy that Sally has brought to this notion. In fact, since reading the book and doing the exercises, I've noticed a marked difference in my communication with people because I'm now filtering it by the outputs of How The World Sees You. Sally continues to be one of the most fascinating women in marketing today. He last book, Fascinate, dominated the scene for months, but Sally is much more than a best-selling business book author and speaker. In her second year of advertising, Sally won more awards than any other copywriter in the U.S., and was described as &quot;the most successful junior copywriter of all time.&quot; After working at Wieden + Kennedy and Fallon McElligott, by age 27 she'd opened her first ad agency, with clients such as Target and Remy Martin. Three years later, she opened the West Coast office of Crispin Porter + Bogusky as Creative Director/Managing Director.

Now, Moskowitz is pushing his work further with Stephen Rappaport (a former executive for the Advertising Research Foundation and business book author).

Bob Knorpp may be best known for his stunningly fun podcast on the advertising business known as The Beancast, but he also has a deep passion for the world of innovation (along with that, he is a regular contributor to Ad Age). In the past short while, famed author, educator and thought leader, Clayton Christensen, came under fire after his seminal book, The Innovator's Dilemma, got picked apart by a widely spread article in The New Yorker titled, The Disruption Machine, by Jill Lepore. There has been plenty of discourse (online and otherwise) about this topic. Christensen even took to the pages of BusinessWeek to clarify the comments and add more color to the arguments. Ultimately, what we learn is that disruption and innovation are complex models that often don't sit well in the way that businesses have been built. On this show, Bob and I discuss the merits of both sides of the argument, what it means to marketers and how businesses are able to grow and thrive in a world that is seemingly more disruptive than ever before.

I had heard of Jason SurfrApp before, only that wasn't his name. The last time I had heard of him, his name was Jason Headsetsdotcom (not kidding). That right, Jason had done this before. He had legally changed his last name to the highest bidder... and he had done it again. Call it a stunt. Call it unconventional, but Jason has a knack for this kind of marketing... or entrepreneurship (depends on how you slice it). He created IWearYourShirt, a company that used sponsored t-shirts to promote businesses on social media and turned it into a million dollar business (not a typo). He took the same approach to the recent publishing of his business book, Creativity For Sale. Frustrated by the landscape of book publishers and book agents, Jason self-published and raised over $75,000 through sponsorships in the book before a single word was written or a single copy of the book sold. If you know anything about book advances and business book sales numbers, that's not a bad amount (at all). The Unmarketing hero, Scott Stratten, took to Facebook to record a video about how personalized Jason's pitch to Scott was. Stratten's video was so compelling that I invited Jason to talk about how he sees marketing, and what stunts look like in a world with so much noise.

He's written many successful business books (Return On Influence, The Tao Of Twitter, Born To Blog and Social Media Explained) and brings a wealth of real life experience to the discussion. We look at the many revolutions that the Internet has brought to marketing, and jam on some ideas as to where this might all be going.

I have been a fan of the social media management platform, Sprinklr, for some time. Ragy Thomas leads the organization and he has had an illustrious career in the digital marketing space. This past week, Sprinklr held an event in Toronto (of which I was one of the speakers) and the line-up of brands that attended are a testament to how strong of a platform they have developed. Ragy is not just a social media technologist, he also had a huge impact on the world of email marketing. Prior to founding Sprinklr, he was president of Epsilon Interactive, a division of the world's largest marketing services company. During his tenure as president, Ragy led his division of Epsilon through rapid growth to approximately $100 million in annual sales worldwide spread across 11 countries. His prior start-up experiences include email marketing companies Advaya and Bigfoot Interactive, where he was the Chief Technology Officer. Advaya was sold to Bigfoot Interactive in 2001. Bigfoot Interactive was sold to Epsilon in 2005 for over $120 million. His insights on digital marketing, technology and start-ups are profound and relevant to every marketer.

When I got my first opportunity to speak in front of a large audience, I wasn't sure where to turn for more professional public speaking and presentation skills training. Many names of individuals and organizations were thrown my way, but one name that kept rising to the top was Nick Morgan. I immediately purchased his book, Give Your Speech, Change The World, and it did - in fact - change my world and perception of what a presentation is really all about. Then came Working The Room follow by Trust Me. I eagerly bought and devoured them all. Thankfully, Nick jumped into social media and started blogging over at Public Words. Why all of this attention on his work? In the marketing world, the best ideas don't always win. One of the main reasons is because they're not presented well (in essence, a poor presentation can kill the best of ideas). That's not just specific to the marketing industry, but all aspects of life. Being a great presenter is a core capability of success. Sadly, most people ignore it. In his latest book, Power Cues, Nick dives deeper into neuroscience and how the smallest of indicators (from voice to body language to more minor nuances affect success. It's a fascinating read from a fascinating mind.

When people ask me what is the main skill required for success in life, I think of one thing: being able to present an idea in a cogent way. When I think of people who understand the dynamics and intricacies of giving great presentations (and telling better stories), I think of Nancy Duarte. Along with running one of the most prestigious agencies, Duarte, for helping brands to create better presentations by crafting better stories, Nancy is also the author of several amazing books including, Slide:ology, Resonate, and the HBR Guide to Persuasive Presentations. Nancy has a new book out and it's called, Slidedocs... oh, and it's free. A slidedoc is a hybrid of a presentation and richer content mixed together so that you're reading (like a book) but enjoying it, because it's more visual. I think Nancy is on to something. Slidedocs can either be the perfect leave behind or a whole new way to publish books. Either way, me likes and I wanted to dig into the topic deeper.

He also wrote books like Social Media 101 and Google Plus For Business. What some people may not know, is that he is also the cofounder of the PodCamp new media conference series, and has spent over sixteen years trying to help others understand technology, media and how to create a more human/humane kind of business. Now, he's publishing all kinds of stuff, creating events, teaching and more. He has an online magazine called, Owner, and just launched a really smart book called, The Freaks Shall Inherit The Earth.

I have an aversion to those in wealth management. That being said, I have many friends in the space and I'm thankful for the professional help I have received to date from some very smart people. Here's where that aversion comes from: in my early years of networking, I would find myself at Chamber of Commerce-like cocktail events, and I felt like the people who were the most annoying in these scenarios were the wealth management people. They would &quot;work the room&quot; and fling out business cards like ninja stars at any body in their way. Derek Coburn is a wealth management guy, but not &quot;one of those guys.&quot; We met a while back when he invited me to present the concepts in CTRL ALT Delete to his networking group, Cadre. Most recently, he decided to tackle the issue of networking and better connecting with individuals through a business book called, Networking Is Not Working.

I first heard the voice of Eric Schwartzman over a decade ago as a contributor to the For Immediate Release podcast. I was always impressed with how he managed to score some major industry leaders for his still-running podcast, On The Record...Online. Since then, Schwartzman has built an impressive resume of communications consulting to business, global nonprofits, the US Military, US Federal government agencies and foreign governments. He's also the best-selling coauthor of Social Marketing To The Business Customer, the first book devoted exclusively to B2B social media communications. But that's not all. He's also an entrepreneur. He sold his first startup, iPressroom, to private investors in 2010 and just recently launched, Comply Socially, which helps employers manage risk and scale engagement on social media with online training. Businesses and individuals are being put to task for things that they post online, now Schwartzman is helping public companies (mostly) both unlock the productivity gains of social media communications, while protecting individuals from misrepresenting brands or violating the law. It's a pretty fascinating business for a time that finds every individual as media channel unto themselves.

Back in 2000 (yes, way back then), I read a book that made me rethink everything that I thought I knew about marketing. It was called, The Anatomy of Buzz, and it was written by Emanuel Rosen. Long before we were all talking about social media, viral videos, content marketing and more, Rosen was busy studying what makes people do the things that they do. You find a &quot;best marketing books ever&quot; list and not see The Anatomy of Buzz on it. Rosen, a former marketing professional, considers himself a writer, researcher, teacher and speaker. I'm fortunate because, over the years, Emanuel and I have become friends. In 2009, he looked again at what makes people talk about brands and wrote, The Anatomy of Buzz Revisited. Now, he's back with a fascinating business book called, Absolute Value (that he co-wrote with Itamar Simonson). It has been getting incredible reviews... and for good reason. In this book, Emanuel wonders about the value of brands, marketing and advertising in a world where information is everywhere, available in real-time and spin becomes, increasingly, more difficult from brands to pull off.

For the 400th episode of this podcast series, I wanted to have a serious and in-depth conversation with someone who I consider to be one of the brightest minds when it comes to digital, media and technology. That's Douglas Rushkoff. The timing could not have been more perfect, because he is back with a new documentary that recently aired on Frontline titled, Generation Like. You will be doing yourself a huge disservice if you don't take the time to watch it (it's streaming for free online). Rushkoff's latest book is called, Present Shock, and he has ten-plus other best-selling books on new media and pop culture (including: Program Or Be Programmed, Life Inc., Cyberia, Media Virus, Playing the Future, Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism, Get Back in the Box: Innovation from the Inside Out and Coercion, winner of the Marshall Mcluhan Award for best media book). He does tons of teaching and public speaking, but also makes time to produce and write documentaries like Generation Like (along with The Merchants of Cool,&#160; The Persuaders, Digital_Nation). If that weren't enough, Douglas Rushkoff has written two series of graphic novels for Vertigo called, Testament and A.D.D.. I'm always honored that he takes the time to have these types of conversations with me, and we decided to deep dive into some of the bigger themes of this documentary, and what it means to society, as a whole. Lastly, thank you very much for listening to my podcast. I put out these shows, because having these conversations make me better (and hopefully smarter)&gt; The fact that thousands of people - every week - enjoy them right along with me is a true privilege. I'm not one to celebrate milestones and the like, but thank you for being a part of my journey to discover.

What do you do for a living? How many times have you been asked that question? If you don't have a nine-to-five job, but are currently trying to build a life that includes some semblance of meaningful work, that question gets even more difficult to answer. It's less about the work that you do, the community that you serve and how you connect with people online and much more about how all of these pieces now come together to create a meaningful life. Few understand the intricacies of this like Pamela Slim. In 2005, she started the Escape From Cubicle Nation blog that quickly spawned a massive bestselling business book of the same name. The award-winning author, business coach, speaker and martial artist (yes, don't mess with her!), recently released her second book, Body Of Work, that is less of a book and much of a workbook around prodding people to question their work and to find points of connection that will - hopefully - help them define, develop and nurture a career that is more meaningful. This ability to understand and develop one's own story is the crux of Body Of Work. It's an important read.

I spent some time last year at HubSpot's inbound marketing summit in Boston. It was, without a doubt, one of the most exciting marketing events I had attended in a long time. You could feel the excitement in the air, as more and more national brands began to embrace the power of building relationships and figuring out new ways to market their products and services. It was a stellar line-up of presenters, and I found myself quite taken aback by a spoof of the ABC reality TV show, The Bachelorette, that the company executives were performing live on stage. It turns out that Brooks Forester, who was a contestant on the ninth season of the reality televisions series, made a very newsworthy exit from the show when it was down to the wire. It also turns out that Brooks works in the inbound marketing space and wasn't just there to be the comedic relief for the Hubspot folks, but was actually going to discuss some of the marketing lessons that he learned while being on the show (and the aftermath). In those few days, we connected and decided that - when he was prepared - we could our own, little, &quot;The Bachelor reveals all...&quot; about marketing, being a reality television celebrity and what comes next. He's a super-kind individual and I hope you enjoy the conversation...&#160;&#160; \n\nHere it is: Six Pixels Of Separation - The Twist Image Podcast - Episode #394 - Host: Mitch Joel.\n\n\n  Running time: 42:19. \n\n  Please send in questions, comments, suggestions - mitch@twistimage.com. \n\n  Hello from Beautiful Montreal. \n\n  Subscribe over at iTunes. \n\n  Please visit and leave comments on the Blog - Six Pixels of Separation. \n\n  Feel free to connect to me directly on Facebook here: Mitch Joel on Facebook. \n\n  or you can connect on LinkedIn. \n\n  ...or on twitter.&#160; \n\n  Six Pixels of Separation the book is now available. \n\n  CTRL ALT Delete is now available too! \n\n  In conversation with Brooks Forester.\n\n  The Bachelorette.\n\n  This week's music: David Usher 'St. Lawrence River'. \n\n  Get David's song for free here: Artists For Amnesty. \n\n\nDownload the Podcast here: Six Pixels Of Separation - The Twist Image Podcast - Episode #394 - Host: Mitch Joel.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/74/da/ff/74daff0f-e89b-b5cb-c37f-00664beea04a/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/74/da/ff/74daff0f-e89b-b5cb-c37f-00664beea04a/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.twistimage.com/podcast/mp3/SPOS_394_-_Brooks_Forester.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Six Pixels of Separation", "Mitch Joel", "Twist Image", "Marketing", "Advertisement", "Communication", "Public Relation", "Social Media", "Management & Marketing"]}, {"seriesId": 157616278, "seriesTitle": "Six Pixels of Separation - Marketing and Communications Insights - By Mitch Joel at Mirum", "pubDate": 1390138448, "title": "SPOS #393 - Content Shock With Shel Holtz And Mark W.

Here is the definition of Content Shock from Mark W. Schaefer: &quot;Content Shock is the emerging marketing epoch defined when exponentially increasing volumes of content intersects our limited human capacity to consume it.&quot; In short, it's getting more and more expensive and difficult for brands to create content in a world where consumers have a finite time to consume it all. Do you believe in this or do you not? Schaefer presented this theory (something I have blogged about on countless occasions with my own spin) on his Grow Blog earlier this month. That blog post has since generated over 300 comments and tons of diverse feedback. Shel Holtz (famed communications professional and one of the voices behind the long-running podcast, For Immediate Release - The Hobson And Holtz Report) took exception to the theory of Content Shock in a blog post titled, Six Reasons There Will Be No Content Shock. It felt like this could be a very interesting three-way debate. I hope it doesn't disappoint.

When it comes to technology evangelism, it's hard not to think about people like Shel Israel and Robert Scoble. Together, these two co-authored the book, Naked Conversations - How Blogs Are Changing The Way Businesses Talk With Customers, back in 2006. The book was prescient, and was key in helping brands to better understand the power of blogs and how to actually implement a lot of the thinking that came out of The Cluetrain Manifesto (widely regarded as the starting point of social media). Today, these two journalists, bloggers, authors, tweeters, online publishers (and more) are back with their second book that they've done together titled, Age Of Context - Mobile, Sensors, Data And The Future Of Privacy. The Internet is no longer just a more interactive screen than television. It is everywhere. Technology is moving from screens to devices and that's going to change everything. From connected dishwashers to being able to monitor every nuance of our personal health in real-time. These are both interesting times and confusing times. The Age Of Context breaks down these movements, what they mean and why businesses (and individuals) need to start paying attention to them.

His other books, UnMarketing and The Book of Business Awesome / The Book of Business UnAwesome were both business bestsellers and QR Codes Kill Kittens is on the same track. What you will quickly learn about Scott is that he cares... deeply... about consumers getting everything they paid for and businesses that can deliver on their promises. He wants businesses to be better. And, that's always a good thing. He's become a close friend and advocate for all things Six Pixels of Separation over the years. Along with being a bestselling author and in-demand speaker, he is also doing two very interesting podcast series.

This past week, he published his third business book, Jab Jab Jab Right Hook (following on the heels of Crush It and The Thank You Economy), that deep-dives into what works for brands in the social media channels. He's someone who knows. With over one million Twitter followers and millions of views for his many different YouTube and video podcast productions, most brands should be paying attention to how he does it. There's so much more to say, but it's probably better (and more interesting) to hear it directly from Gary's mouth.

Every so often, I get the chance to dive deep into a topic that is of huge (and personal) interest to me. This is one of those episodes. Roy Peter Clark is widely regarded as &quot;America's writing coach.&quot; He has a stated desire to create &quot;a nation of writers.&quot; He has taught writing to everyone from children to Pulitzer authors at the infamous The Poynter Institute - a school for journalism and writing in Florida. His books are &quot;must-haves&quot; for anyone who is a writer (or for those who have a desire to write). I own almost all of them, including Writing Tools, Help! For Writers (which is also a great mobile app) and his latest, How To Write Short. While some might confuse his latest book as a &quot;how to write for the Twitter era,&quot; it is so much more than that. He has more honors from the writing and academic world than I could ever list here, but let's just say that to spend some time with someone who is so highly regarded in the writing world, is a pretty cool thing. So, if you tinker with words, have a desire to be a better writer or toil over what to tweet, this episode is for you.

True story: when we first started Twist Image back in 2000, I wasn't sure how we were going to get any new clients. I started reading books, attending seminars and doing anything I could to up my game in regards to sales and selling. At every turn, the name Jeffrey Gitomer kept creeping up. From his amazing (and free!) e-newsletter, Sales Caffeine (which I still read religiously), to seminal books like The Sales Bible. Back then, he was offering up teleseminars (like Webinars, but over the phone). They weren't that expensive, but I would still order them, invite a bunch of people over to my office, and we would all split the fee as a way to save some money. I'm sure Jeffrey didn't allow that, but I didn't have the money so I got resourceful. Since then, Jeffrey has continued to pound out bestselling business books at a frenetic pace and it's a crazy world that allows me to also call him a friend. Most recently, he published Jeffrey Gitomer's 21.5 Unbreakbale Laws of Selling - Proven Actions You Must Take To Make Easier, Faster, Bigger Sales... Now And Forever (now that's a title!). As part of the book launch, Jeffrey invited me to add some bonus material for those who would purchase the book on launch day. We recorded this conversation as a that bonus content. Thankfully, Jeffrey was kind enough to allow me to release it now that the launch phase of the book has subsided. I'm thrilled to share this with you.

Is the future of marketing going to be owned by engineers and hackers? Brands like Uber, AirBnB, Dropbox, Instagram and many more Silicon Valley startup darlings have built magnificent and defendable brands without any of the traditional advertising fare and relying only on word of mouth within the social media channels as a form of awareness and validation. It would lead some traditional marketing practitioners to wonder if these brands have uncovered the true secret to viral marketing, or if there is something much more substantive underneath the hood? There has been a lot of attention on the idea of Growth Hacking. Some call it Growth Hacker Marketing. That is the title of Ryan Holiday's latest business book. These Growth Hackers are engineers, coders and entrepreneurs who don't know (or follow) the traditional marketing path (because it's not something they have studied or practiced). They don't sit in the marketing department or have optics into the CMO's office. Instead, these people spend their entire day testing acquisition strategies and leveraging technologies like split A/B testing, web analytics and social listening tools to get people to try, share and loyally use their products and services. Holiday (who is also the author of Trust Me I'm Lying: Confessions Of A Media Manipulator) took some time to discuss this new form of marketing and what it all means.

Tom Peters is widely regarded as the individual who brought the concept of personal branding to the masses in a cover story for Fast Company magazine back in 1997 titled, The Brand Called You. This moment started many ancillary businesses as individuals started to become personal branding consultants. This multiplied and grew in magnitude once social media became pervasive. Suddenly, everyone could be a media producer and a content creator (for free and with access to a global audience). What we wound up with was a bunch of suspicious individuals and a fleet of snake oil salespeople. Thankfully, we have people like William Arruda who get it right. He writes, he speaks but most importantly, he does the real work. He doesn't just talk about personal branding as a way to build his own brand, he teachers leaders and major organizations about the merits of investing in people and helping those people to be their best. I've been following his work for close to a decade, so it was a pleasure to finally get him on the podcast.

One of my business partners at Twist Image is an advertising industry veteran. He helped build one of the most well-regarded agencies in Canada for well over a decade. When we first met (over a decade ago), he half-joked that it's surprising how many highly-intelligent individuals would like to be a part of such a miserable industry. Like I said, he was half-joking. People love Mad Men and it's not just because of the fashion. It was a crazy time when brands were looking for all kinds of edge over their competitors and these newly-formed ad agencies were just making stuff up as they went along. It was crazy times. George Parker was lucky enough to have entered the industry back then. He lives to tell the tales. For over thirty years, he worked in the creative department for agencies all over the work. He wrote a monthly column for AdWeek for close to a decade and has been a contributor for Ad Age, Business Insider, Quartz and more. Currently, he is still an advertising consultant, blogs regularly at AdScam (which is hilarious and brilliant) and he writes books (his most-recent being, Confessions Of A Mad Man). He is free to speak his mind and he doesn't hold back (so, this one of NSFW).

It is, without question, one of the best book titles on creativity that I have ever come across. It is called, Die Empty - Unleash Your Best Work Every Day, and the&#160; excellent content within the book lives up to the title. Too many people confuse &quot;art&quot; with &quot;creativity,&quot; and Todd has an incredible knack for explaining how creativity needs to permeate everything that we do in our work. We expect creativity or moments of genius to hit us like random bolts of lightning, Die Empty is a practical and powerful roadmap that will put a process against your creativity (you need to work it - each and every day). What's the point of dying with your creativity trapped between your ears? Todd has been on the podcast before (SPOS #259 - Accidentally Creative With Todd Henry) and now he is back to talk about Die Empty.

Marc Ecko is one of the most fascinating people that I have ever met. I was asked to interview him live and onstage in Toronto earlier this year. I knew that he was the creative and fashion genius behind Eck\u014d Unltd. (which has become a billion dollar fashion and lifestyle company). I also knew that his marketing antics have been well documented (remember the tagging of Air Force One?). I figured that I was going to meet an older gentleman in their late fifties (like a Tommy Hilfiger or Kenneth Cole type of persona). It turns out that Ecko and I are almost the exact same age (I need to start working harder!). Ecko is still semi-actively involved in the multiple fashion brands that he created (Eckored, Marc Ecko Cut &amp; Sew and Zoo York), but spends the bulk of his current time working on Complex Media. As if that's not enough, he is one of the most generous philanthropists out there, and recently released a stunning business book called, Unlabel - Selling You Without Selling Out. He is, simply put, an amazing individual who is very real, practical and friendly.

Peter Coughter was last on the podcast over a year ago to discuss his amazing book, The Art of the Pitch - Persuasion and Presentation Skills That Win Business (you can listen to that episode right here: SPOS #296 - The Art Of The Pitch With Peter Coughter). To this day, I consider it the seminal book for marketing and communications people who need to better understand how to pitch creative ideas in a very complex world. Things continue to evolve and change. Each and every day, we see the importance of presentation skills increasing. Personally, I believe that the ability to present is core to an individual's success (from personal to professional development). Coughter was President of Siddall, Matus &amp; Coughter Inc., one of the most respected advertising and communications agencies in the Southeast. His agency won tons of industry awards and recognition. Today, he is a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, and a consultant to advertising agencies on how to win the pitch.

Back when book publishers had no bearings on the future of book publishing, let alone as an amazing place for authors and book publishers to connect with fans, Michael Hyatt was paying close attention. He would, eventually, leverage social media to better connect himself, the authors he worked with and the book publishing company that he helped push to tremendous success to embrace all things digital. Hyatt is the former Chairman and CEO of Thomas Nelson Publishers (one of the largest book publishing companies in the U.S.), and he's also the author of the bestselling business book, Platform - Get Noticed in a Noisy World. He's taken his impressive knowledge of how to build a serious platform and turned it into something called, Platform University.

He's currently Partner of Customer Strategy at Altimeter Group, a research based advisory firm started by Charlene Li (Groundswell and Open Leadership). I've been following Jeremiah (and admiring him) since his days at Forrester Research and was one of the earlier readers/fans of his blog, Web Strategist. In June of this year, he launched his latest research report called, The Collaborative Economy. This is how Owyang explains it: &quot;Right now, customers are sharing media and ideas on social technologies, in the near future, they'll use similar technologies to share products and services, which will cause a ripple of impacts far more disruptive than what we've seen before.&quot; Think about Uber, AirBnB and even Netflix. A world where we share stuff... not own it (a space that has been blossoming since the social Web was first introduced). I spent an afternoon with Owyang a few weeks back in Menlo Park (but we recorded this conversation prior to that). He's got a great mind for business, technology and marketing.

There are certain people and brands who know how to manipulate the media. Not in a nefarious or evil way (those kinds exist as well). They manipulate the media to draw multiple layers of attention to their causes, products, brands and services. While young in age, Ryan Holiday seems to have a knack for driving attention to things like fashion brands and authors unlike any other. You could call him a PR professional, but his seminal book, Trust Me I'm Lying: Confessions Of A Media Manipulator, was not only a bestselling book, helped garner Holiday a ton of attention but nurtured his title as, Media Manipulator. He's worked with American Apparel, Tucker Max, James Altucher and many others. In this chat, Ryan talks about the difference between a publicity stunt (a moment in time) to creating something that makes people say, &quot;do you remember when...&quot; (something legendary).

This is a big week for Montreal. We have the Just For Laughs comedy festival in town (full disclosure: Twist Image built the Just For Laughs website). It's the place where anybody and everybody involved in the business of comedy converge on this city for galas, one-off shows and parties. In the past few years, comedy has latched on to new media in a big way. From comedians using Twitter to connect more directly to the wild success of Funny or Die. We have seen comedians like Louis CK leverage new media to truly build a direct relationship with his fans, to celebrities like Joan Rivers (In Bed With Joan) and Jerry Seinfeld (Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee) turning to Web-only programs. I think that Marc Maron is to thank for a lot of what we're seeing these comedians do. Since 2009, he has been producing his podcast, WTF With Marc Maron. The show is produced twice a week and features in-depth conversations with comedians and other entertainers that deep dives into their craft and life. He's had a who's who of the industry join him. The success of his podcast has furthered his stand-up comedy career, led to a bestselling second book, Attempting Normal, and his TV show, Maron (broadcasted on IFC) just got picked up for another season. I sat down with Maron, this past Friday (prior to a live recording of his own, WTF With Marc Maron).

I have known Tom Asacker for close to a decade. How smart is he? Whenever someone attempts to define what a brand truly is or what branding means, his name comes to mind. Yes, that powerful. One of his earlier books, A Clear Eye For Branding, is still a regular read for me when I feel like branding is becoming something fuzzy, once again. His most recent book, The Business Of Belief, is another smart, short book that is deep and long in wisdom. Tom Peters called this book, &quot;profound,&quot; and Seth Godin called it, &quot;a little book with a big idea.&quot; For my dollar, Tom writes passionately and intelligently about business, branding and marketing.

Yes, it's deep stuff, but it is told in a very fun and compelling way (no dry academic fodder here!). Alter is an assistant professor of marketing and psychology at NYU's Stern School of Business and psychology department. His research focuses on the intersection of behavioral economics, marketing, and the psychology of judgment and decision-making. He's also an all-around nice guy.

If you could choose one media channel to create and own, in the year 2013, would it be a blog? Personally, I still think that blogging is as fresh and powerful of a publishing medium as it ever has been. I also think that it is still very nascent in terms of opportunity for brands to create compelling content in a unique voice. Yes, I'm a die-hard evangelist for the platform, but it would not drive me to write a book about it. Well, it did for Mark W. Schaefer. If you're a frequent listener of the podcast, you know that Mark is a regular guest, insightful marketing professional (and professor) and passionate communicator about how marketing has changed. He's already written two very successful business books (Return On Influence and The Tao Of Twitter). In February, he published his latest book, Born To Blog -&#160; Building Your Blog For Personal And Business Success One Post At A Time, with co-author Stanford A. Smith. Mark wasn't an early adopter to blogging, but he is living proof that it is never too late to enter the fray and share. His blog, Grow, is not only immensely successful, but has community engagement that is off the charts. Take a listen to this show and decide for yourself if blogging could well be the &quot;next big thing&quot;... again.

When I was a kid, I got into martial arts. Along with taking a more traditional form of Kung Fu, I stumbled into training on a fairly regular basis with Tony Blauer. Tony's approach was always very different and eclectic. Instead of focusing on forms and traditions, he believed in doing the physiological things that your body could best do (use what works, toss the rest). On top of that, the majority of his training (which you could say is a mixture of self defense, street fighting and close quarter combatives) spent a good chunk of the time talking about how we react and deal with our fear on a psychological level. How the vast majority of confrontations are not won or lost by the physical part, but rather in the mind... long before the fight ever happens. Having worked with Tony for years, there was a time when I was a certified coach in his system and would teach classes and seminars with him (and on his behalf). None of the training that I have done with Tony has ever left me. I think about it daily and apply the vast majority of his thinking to my work - with each and every passing day. I was thankful that Tony agreed to come on the show and talk about fear, managing confidence, performance and more. Since those days, Tony has moved to San Diego and is currently one of the world's leading close quarter combative instructors who has worked with everyone from civilians, military and law enforcement to UFC champions and celebrities. A celebrity in the world of martial arts, Tony is one of the smartest human beings I have ever had the pleasure of calling a true friend.

In a world of automated advertising - which is quickly taking the lion's share of media dollars (see Facebook and Google advertising as a starting point) - where does the humanity of advertising - as we have known it - come into play?

There's a new book in town about marketing, advertising and where it all needs to go. The book is called, Can't Buy Me Like, and it was co-authored by advertising critic extraordinaire, Bob Garfield and Doug Levy. For 25 years, Advertising Age ran Garfield's column, AdReview. In short, it was a must-read. Currently, he's writing for MediaPost and The Guardian along with co-hosting the NPR weekly program On The Media.\u00a0 Plus, his past books, The Chaos Scenario and And Now A Few Words From Me are must-reads if you work in this industry. Levy is an agency guy. We first became friends while attending the TED conference. He is currently the founder and CEO of MEplusYOU (formerly known as imc2) an agency that focuses on brands and how they build authentic and sustainable relationships. Both Garfield and Levy hopped on Skype to talk about their new work and the new ways in which brands should be marketing.

He worked at Apple before handling e-commerce for Dell, from there he went on to lead marketing at Bazaarvoice and he's currently a founder at Mass Relevance. Mass Relevance has been making a lot of noise lately with intense growth as the company leverages real-time social media activity to helps brands create unique social experiences. If that last line confused you, don't panic, Sam is here to explain it all. The changes in the digital marketing landscape have been dramatic in the past decade and the opportunities for brands to rethink how they connect and inform consumers has changed right along with it. It's no surprise that Mass Relevance is seeing the meteoric growth that they're experiencing and Sam's insights should inspire you to think differently about how you can best market your brand in these digital channels.

If you ask veteran marketing professional, Ken Segall, what made Apple so great, he can sum it up in two words: insanely simple. It's also the title of his recent business book, Insanely Simple. As a writer, Segall has worked at many agencies over the years and worked with Steve Jobs from the &quot;Think Different&quot; to iMac days and beyond. It wasn't just a lesson in simplicity from Jobs that inspired Segall, but rather an ethos that he hopes to drive through all organizations who are willing to listen.

There are marketing legends and then there are people like Don Peppers and Martha Rogers.

They invented the term one-to-one marketing to &quot;illustrate the importance of treating different customers differently.&quot; In 1993 they founded their own consulting company, Peppers &amp; Rogers Group, to help brands understand the ever-changing world of the consumer, the power of data, CRM, the customer revolution and how to make marketing more effective. They released their tenth business book, Extreme Trust (about the new dynamics of competition), in April of 2012 and, it is my honor that they both agreed to come on the podcast.

I have a love/hate relationship with LinkedIn. I love the business of LinkedIn and their business model (this was validated earlier in the week, when LinkedIn in posted some impressive quarterly earnings). I love the way the online social network has maintained its stature as the preeminent business network for professionals. I hate the fact that I find the user experience challenging (I'm never quite sure what to do when I head over there). I hate the fact that people don't understand the true value of LinkedIn and this means that spammers roam free and unpunished. Beyond that, it's also somewhat of a challenge when a brand asks about what their play should be on LinkedIn. It's a treasure chest of information for headhunters and a valuable destination for anyone in business. Nobody knows this better than Viveka von Rosen. von Rosen is widely regarded as one of LinkedIn's premier evangelists for individuals and corporations. She is also author of the bestselling business book, LinkedIn Marketing An Hour Day. LinkedIn is a fascinating environment, and it's one that brands and marketers need to pay close attention to.

My first thought, when I heard about the book, Think Like Zuck by Ekaterina Walter, was, &quot;wow, I can't believe Mark Zuckerberg actally let someone inside his domain to study him and write a book about it!&quot; I had a true sense of excitement over this business book. It turns out that Ekaterina Walter not only didn't have that kind of privileged access, but never even interviewed him for the book. Before you skip this episode or think that the book title is misleading, take a deep breath and dive on in. Walter is a social innovator at Intel. She is a regular contributor to Mashable, Fast Company, Huffington Post, and other publications. Along with that, she spent a long while researching not only Zuckerberg but his management style.

Seth Godin is an institution. Normally, in this short paragraph, I do my best to introduce the guest on each episode of the podcast. It would be an insult to Seth Godin to even attempt to try that here. Instead, I'll refer you over to a blog post I wrote on April 26th, 2012 titled, Dear Seth Godin. Beyond Seth being a true inspiration and digital mentor to me, I was watching with bated breath his Kickstarter launch of The Icarus Deception (you can see the project here: The Icarus Deception on Kickstarter). We had many back-and-forths over email, but I was adamant about not having this conversation until after I read his latest business book from cover to cover. As soon as I was close enough, we connected and what you are about to hear is our chat about his latest book, his work and where he's going with everything. I also have three extra copies of The Icarus Deception that I am going to give away to the first three people who correctly answer in the comment section below the name of the musical artist that inspired the title of this podcast episode.

When the Harvard Business Review posted the article, Marketing Is Dead, by Bill Lee, my heart sunk. I wrote my own, passionate, rebuttal to this ridiculous claim (you can read it right here: Marketing Is Dead). Lee's post generated a lot of attention and over six hundred comments. I wasn't alone in the rebuttals and, since the post went live in August of 2012, there is still conversation about the issue. I reached out to Lee, who is not just a contributor to the Harvard Business Review, but the head of the Customer Reference Forum and the author of, The Hidden Value Of Customers.

I've got a bit of guilt about the recording of this podcast. I tend to record as many shows as possible, stock them up and then release them as I can. In the rush of things a few months back, I wound up recording more shows that I usually do. Tom Webster (aka BrandSavant) is Vice President of Strategy for Edison Research, most widely-known as the sole providers of U.S. Election exit polling data to all major media outlets. In the race up to the last U.S. presidential elections, I know how swamped Tom was, but he agreed to be on my show to help promote another project he has called,\u00a0 The Social Habit, that looks at social media research. So, what you're getting is a podcast that was recorded before Barack Obama took office for a second term. That being said, none of the content we discussed was time-sensitive. Lastly, Tom is both incredibly smart, insanely funny and has a dry sense of sarcasm (or, a man after my own heart). In short, it was a total pleasure to finally have him on the show.

In full disclosure, I was most interested in speaking with Gray after reading The Connected Company and did not even realize that he was also the author of Gamestorming. The truth is that social media has changed more than the marketing part of business (hence, the burgeoning term, &quot;social business&quot;).

There are few people that fascinate me as much as Tim Ferriss. He's young (35 years old), has two bestselling books (The 4-Hour Workweek and The 4-Hour Body) and a soon-to-be third one (The 4-Hour Chef). If that weren't enough, he is also an angel investor and advisor for companies like Facebook, Twitter, StumbleUpon, Evernote, Uber and many others. If you're not impressed by that, Tim also holds a Guinness Book of World Records record in tango dancing and won a Chinese kickboxing championship. Like I said, he's an impressive young man, and that's not even scratching the surface on his bio. Currently, he's trying to prove the book retail business wrong by releasing his newest book, The 4-Hour Chef - The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life, on Amazon's publishing imprint (which many of the major retailers have refused to carry).

There are few kinder people than Mark Miller. I had the pleasure of meeting Mark many years ago at my first TED conference. I didn't know anyone (and this can make it kind of awkward) and Mark was always kind, welcoming and willing to invite anyone and everyone into a conversation. I think I leaned on that kindness more than I should have at that first event, and over the years I would look forward to running into him at every TED. Mark is the author of three excellent books on leadership titled, Great Leaders Grow (his latest), The Secret Of Teams and The Secret. With each of these books, Mark worked (at varying levels) with Ken Blanchard (master author of books like, The One Minute Manager, Who Moved My Cheese?, Raving Fans and many more). I had been chomping at the bit to chat with Mark about his thoughts on what it takes to be a great leader. Mark is also the Vice President of Organizational Effectiveness at chick-fil-a. Our chat finally happened and the timing was, somewhat awkward. Chick-fil-a had created a firestorm when their COO, Dan Cathy, made several public statements about his thoughts on same sex marriage. Being who I am, I had to ask Mark about this as well. For the record: I am all for two things: happiness and peace. If two people want to be together and love each other, I don't care who they are (or what they are), so long as they are adding more happiness and peace to the world. This podcast (and the blog) are never political, so I did my best to navigate the issue. I hope I both didn't let any of the regular listeners down while, at the same time, respecting and honoring my friendship and admiration for the way Mark thinks about business and leadership.

When was the last time you read a non-fiction business book and laughed out loud? There have been instances where I have smiled, perhaps had an occasional chuckle. The last business book that really made me laugh out loud was Luke Sullivan's Hey Whipple, Squeeze This. I came to Bob Hoffman in a very different way. I had heard about this blog, The Ad Contrarian, for some time, but a headline in DigiDay really caught my attention. The article was called, The Ad Contrarian's Reality Check. And, this is what Hoffman said: &quot;The biggest myth is that the digital ad industry knows what the hell it's talking about. Almost every 'expert' and 'industry leader' who has made predictions about digital advertising over the past 10 years has turned out to be wrong. They told us interactivity would make advertising more effective and engaging. It hasn't. Consumers have shown no inclination to interact with online advertising. They told us traditional advertising was on the way out. Anyone who believes this must have slept through the Olympics. They told us that the DVR was going to devastate the effectiveness of TV advertising. Studies have shown it has had little to no effect on consumer purchasing behavior. They told us the PC and the television were going to converge. They haven't. They have have had a parade of social media miracle cures that were going to 'change everything' -- blogs, podcasts, widgets, YouTube, Facebook, games, Twitter, LinkedIn, FourSquare, Pinterest, QR codes and, of course, now content. Mostly they have turned out to be over-hyped, marginally-to-moderately effective marketing tools that have not been game-changers, as advertised. The digital ad industry is unreliable at best, and irresponsible at worst.&quot; Ouch. You can imagine how hungry I was for more. I reached out to Hoffman and asked if he would be a guest on the podcast. He agreed. I also bought both of his books, The Ad Contrarian and 101 Contrarian Ideas About Advertising. His books were sharp and hilariously funny. I may not always agree with everything Hoffman says, but his content is well worth digging into as his experience and expertise in the advertising industry cannot be denied. Ultimately, if you just want to laugh about how industry evolves, the books are worth the price of admission.

A while after that, Hugh McGuire (PressBooks and author of Book: A Futurist's Manifesto) was telling me that Kukral was using his PressBooks platform to publish all kinds of business books. I finally met Kural in person at Content Marketing World earlier month, and he explained that he's now in the business of helping people publish their own books.

When you publish a book called, Social Media Is Bullshit, it is bound to get some attention (and, some dirty looks, I'm sure). B.J. Mendelson (also known as Brandon) doesn't hold any punches in this book. He says that, &quot;we live in a world where it's far easier to make money telling people how to get rich using the Internet than it is to actually get rich using it.&quot; Is Brandon wrong? It's not so cut and dry. On one hand, we do live in a world where any one individual can get a whole bunch of followers and suddenly proclaim themselves as some kind of wizard, but - on the other hand - it's hard to imagine that Brandon would have been as attractive to a traditional book publisher if he didn't have close to 800,000 followers on Twitter. Which, in and of itself, is a part of the issues and challenges that we discuss in this episode. Ultimately, the truth may come when Brandon shuts down all of his social media outposts, and can still sell books and create a viable business without them.

Chapman: if it weren't for him (and Joseph Jaffe), there would probably not be a Six Pixels of Separation podcast. The co-author (with Ann Handley) of Content Rules is one of the pioneers in podcasting, and he has had a pretty incredible career in new media. He still works on Digital Dads and is about to release a brand new book called, Amazing Things Will Happen. It's an interesting time for C.C. This book is not about new media. It's a book he wrote for his children to read when they get older and start thinking about their own professional careers. Along the way, he realized that others might benefit from his perspectives on success, motivation and doing your best to be the best. There's one other thing you need to know about C.C.

After spending a few days at Content Marketing World, this past week, my head is still spinning over the myriad of opportunities that brands have when it comes to creating better relationships with customers.

He is also the author of The Marketing Agency Blueprint - The handbook for building hybrid, PR, SEO, Content, Advertising, and Web firms. We wound up having a fascinating conversation about how to grow a digital marketing business while making a personal brand scalable. We both questioned whether or not this was even possible. Beyond that, he was kind enough to introduce me to his latest project, Net Marketing Score - an online tool to help marketing agencies better qualify potential clients.

Banner advertising took hold in 1994. By 1998, I was deeply involved in the online advertising space. If you thought selling digital marketing through to the c-suite is hard in 2012, imagine what it was like back in 1998. It's hard to believe that it was 14 years ago. While I was active in the digital marketing space prior to getting involved in online media, it was fascinating trying to sell those banner ads back in the day. I remember people like Bryan Eisenberg, Joseph Jaffe, Tom Hespos and Cory Treffiletti being active back then too. Cory is currently the SVP of Marketing at BlueKai and a weekly contributor to MediaPost. More recently, Cory published his first book, Internet Ad Pioneers: The Stories Of The Unsung People Behind The Birth And Growth Of The Internet Ad Industry (Volume 1). I was honored that he asked me to be a part of this business book, and it's a great read for those of us who remember that time like it as yesterday. I was surprised that Cory hasn't been on the podcast before, and I'm thrilled that he agreed to play along this time.

Beyond that, he also wrote a contentious blog post titled, Is there anything new in blogging? No (I even responded over here: What's Next? It's You). As we frequently have debates and deep-dives on topics here at the Six Pixels of Separation Podcast, we felt that we could delve deeper into what blogging means in 2012 and how it can (and should evolve). It turns out that we're not the only ones who are thinking about the evolution of blogging and publishing. The day after we recorded this conversation, Twitter founders, Biz Stone and Ev Williams, announced the launch of Medium (and place where they hope to rethink the publishing through a new platform). Is blogging old news or is it still brand spanking new and in need of some evolution?

Will businesses ever get it right? Will they ever be able to please all of their customers all of the time. It's doubtful. While social media has put every company on the spot in terms of having to respond and do the right thing, not a day goes by when someone doesn't have a complaint that is blasted on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and beyond. What's a brand to do? On top of that, if we have customers complaining all of the time and everywhere, does it create a level of noise where, ultimately, there is no brand impact because of the sheer volume? It's something that Scott Stratten has been looking at (and taking part in) for some time. He blasted out of the marketing gates by gaining a massive following on Twitter (currently approaching 130,000 loyal followers). He converted that popularity into a best-selling business book, UnMarketing - Stop Marketing. Start Engaging, and a speaking career. More recently, he launched his second book, The Book of Business Awesome / The Book of Business UnAwesome. As with everything Scott does, it involves humor and personal stories of how businesses are getting it right and getting it woefully wrong (you can flip the book upsidedown to choose your awesome or unawesome adventure).

Julien Smith (co-author of Trust Agents with Chris Brogan and the author of The Flinch) was downright mad at me. We have lunch on a frequent basis and we're constantly slamming ideas and names at one another. It makes for a lively conversation. The other week, he was downright disgusted with me because I had never met Chris Guillebeau. Chris is the author of The Art Of Non-Conformity - Set Your Own Rules, Live The Life You Want And Change The World and the recently published, The $100 Startup - Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future, which became an instant bestseller. Along with that, he's the co-organizer of what is quickly becoming one of the &quot;go to&quot; events for those trying to create a remarkable life in a very conventional world called, World Domination Summit (which took place at the beginning of this month in Portland, Oregon). This idea of non-conformity and unconventionalism is a theme that binds Chris' life. He's about to turn 35 and complete his personal journey of visiting every country on earth (out of close to 200, he has a mere 8 to go). While he's never had a &quot;day job,&quot; he seems to be doing just fine owning, operating and executing on many micro-businesses. He explains that his entrepreneurial history has ranged from importing coffee from Jamaica, search engine optimization in its early days, Google Adwords and Adsense arbitrage, to building a small publishing company while volunteering in Africa. He now writes and sells a product he calls, Unconventional Guides. Simply put, he's a fascinating individuals with many business lessons that we could all learn from.

We first connected in 2008 when his book, Branding Only Works On Cattle, came out because we share the same editor and publisher (Grand Central Publishing - Hachette Book Group). He then went on to write the book, Bright Lights &amp; Dim Bulbs and then Histories Of Social Media. He's back with another book titled, Tell The Truth - Honesty is Your Most Powerful Marketing Tool (which he co-authored along with Sue Unerman - Chief Strategy Officer of MediaCom, a WPP agency).

Now, with the ubiquity of smartphones and mobile connectedness, it has never been easier to share with the world our each and every move (look no further than Facebook's one billion dollar acquisition of Instagram). And we're publishing our lives. All of the time - in text, images, audio and video - for the world to see. In fact, it's happening more and more with each and every passing day. Why are we doing all of this self-tracking? It's a topic that has fascinated Nora Young for a long while. The founding host and producer of CBC's Definitely Not The Opera and the current host of Spark (a radio show and podcast about the intersection of technology and culture - and it's one of my personal favorites) spent this past year digging deeper into self-tracking and what this means about our society and who we are. The culmination of her work is the recently published book, The Virtual Self - How Our Digital Lives Are Altering the World Around Us. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of being a guest on Spark on multiple occasions, so it was a lot of fun to turn the tables and interview Nora.

Heather Lutze has been a part of many digital revolutions (she used to work at Yahoo) and is now the head of the Findability Group. I had the pleasure of seeing Heather speak many years ago on the basics of search engine optimization and search engine marketing, and I was taken by her logical and non-technical way of getting a very nascent audience to grasp (what was then) some fairly new ways of thinking (she also had so many tips and tricks that I found myself jotting down a bunch of cool info too). If you're still struggling with how to get found in the search engines, her first book, The Findability Formula - The Easy, Non-Technical Approach to Search Engine Marketing, is a great place to start. More recently, Lutze released her second book, Thumbonomics - The Essential Business Roadmap to Social Media &amp; Mobile Marketing.

How does creativity happen? Does it take a lot of time? Can brilliant creative just happen? What inspires creativity? Who is a creative? These are the questions and thoughts that we all engage and connect with as Marketing professionals in one way, shape or form at multiple times during our careers. We often lament the creatives as those who get to play all of the time or go to movies and grab coffees waiting for that moment of inspiration. Scratching beneath the surface, we begin to realize that those who we would hail as being the most creative are usually very hard and complex workers. It's a topic that is near and dear to the heart of Julie Burstein. In 2000, Julie created Studio 360 with Kurt Anderson for Public Radio International. It was a show that looked at creative people through in-depth conversation. Her first book, Spark - How Creativity Works, was one of those books that I just could not put down. Currently, she is the host of Pursuit of Spark - a Podcast that continues the conversations she started with her book, Spark. I had the pleasure of watching Julie present at this past TED conference and she was kind enough to spend some time with me, after her presentation, to discuss the topic of creativity and work.

I picked up the business book, The Art of the Pitch - Persuasion and Presentation Skills That Win Business, by Peter Coughter and could not put it down. My agency, Twist Image, was in the midst of a massive new business pitch and the book happened to fall into my lap at the perfect time. I devoured and loved the book. I learned a ton about the new business pitch process, and Coughter does a fantastic job of reframing what, exactly, needs to happen when a company pitches. The good news is that we won the business. The better news is that Coughter agreed to have a chat with me about his book and how to win new business. For over twenty years, Coughter was President of Siddall, Matus &amp; Coughter Inc., one of the most respected advertising and communications agencies in the Southeast. His agency won industry awards and recognition from places like the American Marketing Association, One Show, Clios, Communications Arts, and many others. Today, he is a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, and to support his teaching habit, he spends a lot of time on the road working with organizations - from all walks of life - helping them to learn how to sell their ideas better.

The answer is not as obvious as it used to be. From choosing the right services to offer and finding the proper pricing structure, to being able to clearly identify your services to your clients and potential clients, it's a complex business to build and (sometimes) an even harder business offering to sell to clients. Paul Roetzer grapples with this - each and every day - as he builds his own marketing agency, PR 20/20, by trying to use a very different model. The Cleveland-based marketing professional has a deep affinity for inbound marketing and new pricing models, which he shares in his first business book, The Marketing Agency Blueprint - The handbook for building hybrid, PR, SEO, Content, Advertising, and Web firms. We dig deep into some of the tougher questions, and as you will hear, it doesn't always end with a definite answer, but with more questions and more experimentation (in the great tradition of entrepreneurship).

When I got my first offer to speak in front of a large audience, I wasn't sure where to turn for more professional public speaking and presentation skills training. Many names of individuals and organizations were fed my way, but one name that kept rising to the top was Nick Morgan. I immediately purchased his book, Give Your Speech, Change The World, and it did - in fact - change my world and perception of what a presentation is really all about. I eagerly bought his other book, Trust Me, and have become not only a fan of his every move (which isn't as creepy as it sounds), but also of his Blog, Public Words. In the marketing world, the best ideas don't always win. One of the main reasons is because they're not presented well (in essence, a poor presentation can kill the best of ideas). Being a great presenter is a core capability of some of the most respected business leaders and marketing professionals we've seen to date. Nick Morgan knows how to get you there. Just take a listen.

As each year passes newer and more impressive forms of content marketing become available to brands. Social Media acted as a massive catalyst for this. We now live in a world where any business (or individuals) can publish their content - in text, images, audio and video - instantly (and for free) for the world to enjoy. The big question is this: is the world enjoying all of this branded content? Producing relevant and timely content is (and will continue) to be one of the biggest challenges and opportunities for brands as more and more clutter occurs. There's no one better than Joe Pulizzi to help us navigate through the noise. Pulizzi is the founder of the Content Marketing Institute and SocialTract.

Is there any value in getting a degree in Marketing in this day and age?

How has the digitization and New Media changed the way we educate our students about Marketing? Pushing this further, how are Marketers doing from the perspective of Marketing professors? Kenneth Wong is one of the leading marketing educators in the world. He holds the title of Associate Professor and Distinguished Professor of Marketing at Queen's School of Business and sits on the board of directors (with me) at the Canadian Marketing Association.

Why do most PR pitches suck? For the most part it has to do with the fact that they are either not focused or there is no relationship between the PR professional and the media outlet.

They very fabric of what it means to be a communications professional is changing, adapting and morphing. Leading this charge/change is Gini Dietrich. Gini Blog at Spin Sucks, is the founder and CEO of Arment Dietrich and is co-host of the very popular PR Podcast, Inside PR. As if that weren't enough, she has begun to create and launch products at Spin Sucks Pro and is about to launch a book called, Marketing In The Round, that she co-authored with Geoff Livingston.

Are you ready for some tough love? I often find that that brands have millions of questions about sales and marketing, but most of them are thinly veiled complaints about how they don't have the time or budget to make a lot of the strategies and tactics come to life. It becomes that much more depressing when you start uncovering that few brands are doing the bare bone basics well (if at all). Marcus Sheridan (known to many as The Sales Lion) brings a dash of motivational content coupled with a healthy helping of reality-based concepts that will make some of the most seasoned Marketers smack their heads with a, &quot;why am I not doing this!&quot; kind of motion.

This is our 19th conversation (or, as I like to affectionately call it, Across The Sound 19.20). Can great creative happen fast or does great creative take time? Can great creative be paid for in hours (the traditional agency model) or is better to be paid for value?

Best-selling business book, author, David Meerman Scott (author of The New Rules of Marketing &amp; PR, Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead, World Wide Rave, Real-Time Marketing &amp; PR, etc...) just launched his latest book, Newsjacking - How to Inject your Ideas into a Breaking News Story and Generate Tons of Media Coverage, in digital format only, with a major book publisher (Wiley), for under eight dollars. How did he do it? He launched it on the same week as Amazon's Kindle Fire in the hopes of capturing some exposure. It's something that brands have been doing forever, but now everyone can take part in (so long as they truly understand the opportunities and how to do it with class and expertise).

This is also episode #40 of Media Hacks. Joining me for this chat is C.C. Chapman, Hugh McGuire and Julien Smith. In a world of unconferences, crowdsourcing and Social Media, it's surprising how many people struggle with the messages coming out of the Occupy Wall Street movement. If anything, it is a testament to everything that has been built in these online channels for the past decade. In this episode, we look at the media, the messages and how - in a world of media fragmentation - we can't be freaked out when people's messages become fragmented as well. This is not so much about politics as it is about the media, messages and the social implications of power and publishing. As with all episodes of Media Hacks, some of the language is not safe for work (blame Julien).

If you've been playing along at home, you'll know that a frequent guest on the show (and one of the Media Hacks co-host) is Hugh McGuire. Along with starting one of the most interesting open source projects, LibriVox (for audio books based on books in the public domain), Hugh also works on book and publishing start-ups. He's currently got iambik and PressBooks rolling, but hasn't stopped there. Just recently, he launched a new book (which he co-edited with Brian O'Leary) for O'Reilly called, Book: A Futurist's Manifesto. The book publishing industry is going through dramatic change and digitization. With that comes some fascinating lessons for marketers and marketing.

Do you know what the ultimate question for your business is? The evolution of customer service and brand loyalty is a topic that has captured the imagination of Fred Reichheld for over twenty years. In 1996, the Bain Fellow published his first book, The Loyalty Effect: The Hidden Force Behind Growth, Profits, and Lasting Value. Recently, Reichheld (along with co-author, Rob Markey) published a newly updated version of his 2006 seminal book, The Ultimate Question (now titled, The Ultimate Question 2.0). So, in case you were wondering, the ultimate question is: &quot;How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?&quot; A businesses ability to not only understand the answer to this question, but to benchmark their success, led Reichheld to create and champion the Net Promoter Score System - which companies (the world over) now use to define how much love their consumers have for them. It was an honor that Fred agreed to take part in this chat.

When one person, a MacBook computer and an iPad can create a multi-million (or multi-billion!) dollar business, it changes the face of business as we know it. This evolution of business has given rise to a nation of startups. The challenge is that resources are still tight, they are being developed on razor sharp budgets and everyone is trying to figure out how to become the next Mark Zuckerburg or Steve Jobs. The reality is that most people will fail. Thankfully, many entrepreneurs have walked this path before, and they are sharing how to think and build a modern startup. One of the latest innovations is the concept of The Lean Startup that was created by Eric Ries. In the past little while, Eric published his first book on the topic, The Lean Startup. Now, whether you're starting a new business or thinking desperately about innovation within a bigger organization, the concepts that Eric talks about are fascinating.

Think about some of the most iconic bands in the history of rock n' roll. It can be anybody and everybody from U2 and the Grateful Dead to KISS and AC/DC. While the guitar riffs stick in our brains like gum on hot cement, there's something more powerful happening beneath the surface: these rock bands are all amazing brands. The true embodiment of a great brand can be defined by seeing the cult-like affection that raving fans have for their favorite bands. This concept pushed music industry veteran, Steve Jones, to write the book, Brand Like A Rock Star. The truth is that most brands probably don't emote the same kind of feelings that some of our most favorite rock bands give us, but there are some key lessons that every brand can learn from our favorite brands.

Seth Godin is more than a Marketer's Marketer, he's quickly becoming a major book publisher that is making the other major book publisher's nervous. He threatened to re-invent the book publishing business earlier this year with The Domino Project (powered by Amazon) and, with close to ten titles already released (all of the best-sellers), he has yet to disappoint. It turns out, that publishing other business book authors has also inspired him to write even more. His latest book, We Are All Weird, is a blunt look at the end of mass media and what this all means to marketers still scrambling to save traditional advertising (hint: it ain't pretty). As usual, Seth is insightful, funny and always provocative (part of the reason each and every one of his own books are consistent best-sellers).

My professional career started off in Journalism (this was prior to becoming both a Publisher and Marketer), so yes, I have a soft spot for all things Journalism. There's also an important link between Journalism and Marketing. There are few who are looking at Journalism and the New Media with a sharper eye than Jay Rosen. I'm a huge fan. Rosen teaches journalism at New York University, where he has been on the faculty since 1986. He is the author of PressThink, a blog about journalism's ordeals in the age of the Web, which he launched in 2003. In 1999, Yale University Press published his book, What Are Journalists For?, which was about the rise of the civic journalism movement. In July 2006 he announced the debut NewAssignment.net, his experimental site for pro-am, open source reporting projects. The first one was called Assignment Zero, a collaboration with Wired. A second project was OffTheBus with The Huffington Post, for which he served as co-publisher with Arianna Huffington.

How far would you go to get something done? Derek Sivers was an independent artist trying to sell his CDs online back in 1998. None of the big online retailers of music would sell his music. He wasn't on a major label and he wasn't a &quot;known&quot; entity. Instead of sulking about it, Sivers went out, bought a book on Web programming, turned to page one and started to figure out - on his own - how to build a website and integrate it with a merchant account. This led to creation of CD Baby - which quickly grew to become the largest seller of independent music and artists in the world. In 2008, Sivers sold CD Baby for $22 million. Most recently, he released his first business book, Anything You Want, on Seth Godin's The Domino Project book publishing imprint. It's an amazing and candid look at what it takes to create a great company (and it's a powerful story for all Marketers to hear). This past week, I published the Blog post, Anything You Want, and some of the quote were culled from this chat with Sivers.

They're currently authoring their tenth business book, Extreme Trust (about the new dynamics of competition). My jaw nearly hit the floor a month back when Don left a comment on my Blog (it was one of those, &quot;gee, maybe I should pay more attention to what I publish if thought-leaders like Don Peppers are reading me!&quot;).

Here's a confession: I'm a procrastinator. My favorite saying used to be: &quot;if it weren't for the last minute, nothing would get done.&quot; But that all changed back in 2003 when I read Steven Pressfield's book, The War Of Art. I had known Pressfield as a fiction writer (his best-known work, The Legend Of Bagger Vance, was also a huge Hollywood hit), but as the buzz began surrounding The War Of Art, I not only found myself devouring that book, but being able to look at how I create content in a very different light. People often ask me where I find the time to write books, Blog posts, articles, etc... while still growing Twist Image and having time for a personal life. Well, here's another confession: I internalized and acted on many of things Pressfield talks about in The War of Art. Last week, Pressfield dug deeper into what holds us back from the work we were meant to do by releasing a new business book, Do The Work! (which also happens to be the second release on Seth Godin's new publishing company, The Domino Project). Do The Work! is a quick read and it's more like a manifesto than a work of non-fiction. I was thrilled that Pressfield agree to spend some time talking about creativity and conquering whatever it is that is holding us back.

I've never been one for acknowledging anniversaries in the digital channels (things like x amount of blog posts, podcasts or how many followers I have on Twitter). To be honest, I'm not even sure that having 250 episodes of a Podcast is all that big of a deal or something worth noting (I'm not keeping count - just having fun having weekly conversations about Marketing with some of the smartest people on the planet). Thankfully, Mark W. Schaefer over at Grow thought it was something worthy of mentioning and came up with the idea of interviewing me for this 250th episode. Admittedly, I was hesitant at first, but figured it could be fun to have the tables turned or to turn this episode a little upside down. Mark has become a good friend over the past while (and we have yet to meet in our &quot;protein forms&quot;!). It was a fun chat all about Marketing and the revolution that has taken place with some thoughts on the evolution as it continues to change.

Currently, Schafer is the CEO and Founder of Deep Focus - an engagement and innovation marketing agency. Prior to founding Deep Focus in 2002, Schafer was VP of the New Media division of Miramax Films. Named a &quot;Media Maven&quot; by Advertising Age and one of Adweek's \"Young Ones\", Ian has been featured in Wired, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and many more publications. We've been friends for a while and realized that on the eve of sharing the stage at the upcoming Socialize event by Media Bistro in New York City (March 31st - April 1st, 2011), it is high time that we recorded a conversation about Marketing, and how companies should strive to get more out of it.

Rather than take a handsome advance from a major book publisher, the best-selling business book author (each of his 13 published books have been best-sellers and collectively have been translated into more than 30 languages), published his latest effort, Poke The Box, on his own book publishing imprint, The Domino Project (powered by Amazon).

Mullen was recently celebrated as the #3 agency of the year of Ad Age's Agency A-List. Their work with clients like Zappos and Jet Blue has not only been innovative for it's traditional mass advertising, but because of how the agency works in a completely integrated fashion.

Schaefer from the Grow Blog that covered topics like the power of Klout and the evolution of Marketing, Communications and Blogging in 2010. We even pushed out into the coming year and discussed creativity, analytics and what might be in store for Social Media. The Skype line that we connected on sounded great and I used Audio Hijack Pro to capture the conversation (as I always do). It lasted about 45 minutes and I thought it was the perfect bowtie ribbon on a great year of Podcasting.\n\nBut then...\n\nWhen I went to record the show tonight (intro, outro, music and shownotes), something truly strange happened. The audio on Mark's side was perfect, but my voice came out about two octaves lower and to make matters even stranger, there was a delay on my side of the conversation, so I would hear dead air, Mark then speaking to something I was saying and then my voice coming in after. In all of my years of Podcasting, I am stumped. I don't think it was Skype and I'm baffled as to how Audio Hijack Pro could have messed up the audio recording in this manner.\n\nIt really does suck.\n\nI've missed a couple of shows over the years, and I tend to not publish/talk about it, but this really upset me, mostly because I now feel like I wasted Mark's valuable time (especially during the holiday season when we were both taking some well-deserved time off). It also sucks, because the content was great and I really wish you could hear it, but it's just not listenable.

These two have been producing shows since January 2005 (they're close to publishing episode #575!). They are - without question - pioneers in the business Podcasting space, and Hobson's perspective on all things Social Media and Communications illustrate both his experience and passion for the space.

This past summer, Andy Nulman reclaimed his past and went back to running the world famous Just For Laughs comedy festival.

Hardwick is a regular host on G4 TV's Attack of the Show, he is also the host of Wired Science TV and has his own awesome Podcast titled, Nerdist (which you should definitely listen to and subscribe to).\u00a0 We recorded a conversation during the festival, and then my digital recorder broke.

Back then (less than two months ago), Facebook did not have 500 million users, nor had they announced Facebook Places and there were no Facebook Credits. A lot of our conversation was around the topic of how to use Facebook as a Marketing engine, and Chris was pretty upfront that by the time the book had been published, there was no such thing as the &quot;like&quot; button as well.

This is also episode #34 of Media Hacks. Hugh McGuire (Book Oven, Bite-Sized Edits, LibriVox), Julien Smith (co-author of Trust Agents, In Over Your Head) and I met for a sushi lunch and decided to record the latest episode of Media Hacks. We all agree that we love the ambient background noise (even the music) that comes from recording live - we hope you do too. We're not sure if it was the green tea or the sashimi that brought us down the rambling topics we cover, but it sure was heavy, intense and required most of us to get some fresh air right after recording. In this episode we look at everything from publishing, privacy, data and location to anonymity, net neutrality, circumcision (not a typo) and the future of media. The biggest thought: it's getting hard to opt-out of the online world and perhaps we have to review our own perceptions of ourselves.

We have been friends for many years (and constantly joke about how often we wind up connecting in airport lounges across North America). She's not just a mass media personality either, her highly popular Podcasts, Web Nation and Command N are must-have pieces of content.

The conversation floated between mass media versus Social Media to looks at everything from how Old Spice is leveraging the convergence of the two, to why both Clay Shirky and Nicholas Carr have new business books that are well-worth reading (even though they both don't agree with one another). We also attempt to tackle the conversation over content and its value (re: pricing model) in our current society, and many other hacking media topics.

Welcome to transmedia. \n\n  Are we a part of pop culture or nerd culture... or is pop culture now nerd culture? \n\n  Please excuse us for the eating and chewing sounds... it is what it is. \n\n  We should all follow a backpack. \n\n  It's not about mass media... it's about communities of interest. \n\n  The impact of Clay Shirky's new book, Cognitive Surplus. \n\n  Some things cross into the mainstream but most stuff does not. \n\n  Packaging rather than content. \n\n  The easier to digest the more the mass populous hops on it. \n\n  The types of people who use Twitter and how it plays out. \n\n  The brilliance of Twitter lies in its constraints. \n\n  Nicholas Carr and his new book, The Shallows, and Clay Shirky's Cognitive Surplus. \n\n  We're starting to see/hear/read the splinters in Internet culture and how it plays out with Social Media. \n\n  Is Google Making Us Stupid? - The Atlantic. \n\n  Who else goes to the bathroom to check their iPhones all of the time? \n\n  Welcome to the age of rapid social anxiety growth. \n\n  Good calories - Bad calories (while Julien is eating a mish mash). \n\n  Moving to the asynchronous life of book reading - fully digital. \n\n  You can do this with the iBook, Kindle and/or Kobo app for your mobile. \n\n  Also make sure to grab both Readability and InstaPaper. \n\n  The way we write and read changes. \n\n  What the Dickens? \n\n  We need to divide the culture from the business model. \n\n  Books do not need to so big anymore. The constraint is there to support the business not the content. \n\n  This is not essential to the culture. \n\n  Can we homogenize the content? \n\n  What media gives more depth - a Blog or a business book? \n\n  What is the best way to do something vs. the best way to make money (or whatever else you're trying to accomplish). \n\n  We need to break free or experiment more with content. \n\n  A Blog is more powerful and deep way to explore content than a book is - this will scare publishers. \n\n  What mass media can learn from The Grateful Dead. \n\n  Does the mass amount of content devalue the content? \n\n  Put a pay-wall up for everything: what would you pay for monthly access to Blogs? \n\n  You Are Not A Gadget by Jaron Lanier. \n\n  Finland makes broadband Internet access a human right. \n\n  The supply and demand of information and where the money goes. \n\n  We all do have the resources to create media and content.

Twitter is now Times Square. \n\n  I rant about why banner advertising really messed up New Media. \n\n  What is the Internet as a media channel?

Do you question the value of Twitter? Do you still wonder if all Twitter does is help you know when people you don't care about are having pizza? Do you think there is a value for businesses to use Twitter? What about Twitter as a Marketing channel? Does it work? Can it work? If anyone would know the answers to these questions, Scott Stratten would. Stratten has well over 50,000 followers on Twitter (@unmarketing) and this had led to a very successful career in consulting, speaking and writing. Currently, Scott is promoting his first business book (named after his Twitter handle and consulting company), UnMarketing - Stop Marketing. Start Engaging (due out in early September).

There are only a few authors out there who I feel compelled to read, consume, ingest and meditate on everything they do. Jeffrey Gitomer is one of the very few. When we started re-focusing Twist Image back in 2002, it was Gitomer's book, The Sales Bible (and his entire Little [insert color here] Book Of... series), that really pushed me to think differently about everything from sales and marketing to personal branding and networking. The impetuous to Blog and launch the Montreal Business Book Review were ideas based on Gitomer's writing (he's a huge proponent of establishing oneself as a recognized authority). All of his books are business best-sellers and he is also one of the most thought-provoking and entertaining public speakers around. He is a legend and it is a true honour to have him on the show.

Few people have set the intertubes on fire as much as Gary Vaynerchuk. It's the story that legends are made of. Starting out with a very real/human video Podcast called, Wine Library TV, Vaynerchuk converted his families' New Jersey liquor store into a passionate brand by connecting the many Social Media channels (and turned millions of dollars in profit along the way). In being a very raw and candid online personality, the popularity of Wine Library TV turned Vaynerchuk into a household name. He's currently promoting his first business book (a New York Times best-seller), Crush It, while launching his own marketing agency, Vayner Media. Along with that, he's become a serial entrepreneur launching many unique projects and investing in online start-ups like Gowalla (and others). His passion is as intoxicating as the wine he sells. Vaynerchuk is a personal branding juggernaut as well (he has over 800,000 people following him on Twitter). In this episode we discuss the new marketing landscape, the realities of the new marketplace, personal branding, the future of Facebook, if brands can win with Social Media, and the biggest question: can he scale it?

Scratch that, Hogshead is one of the most fascinating person in Marketing today. It then makes perfect sense that her latest book is titled, Fascinate, and it explores the seven universal triggers for persuasion and captivation (it also happens to be one of the best business books to have come out this year). But Hogshead is much more than a best-selling business book author and speaker. In her second year of advertising, Sally won more awards than any other copywriter in the U.S., and was described as \"the most successful junior copywriter of all time.\" After working at Wieden + Kennedy and Fallon McElligott, by age 27 she'd opened her first ad agency, with clients such as Target and Remy Martin. Three years later, she opened the West Coast office of Crispin Porter + Bogusky as Creative Director/Managing Director.

The book took off like a wildfire and still sits at the top of most business and marketing books best-seller list. The success of this book led to a re-release (with lots of rewrites and updated content) as a second edition - which hit the stores a few months back. In between updating that business book best-seller, Scott also wrote another book about Social Media titled, World Wide Rave, and he's currently publishing many other authors under the publishing banner, The New Rules of Social Media Series, along with his publisher, Wiley.

This is also episode #26 of Media Hacks. The Ninja (aka Christopher S.

What happens to the brand? How trusted is the personal brand of the individual? Along with that we graze through a bunch of topics from mobile and iPhone apps to the pending launch of the iPad. We even take a sneak peek at where C.C. Chapman won't be during SXSW (hint: it's in line waiting to get into parties) and have a chat about the power of email for Marketers (and where it's going), plus lots more.

The debate was inspired by the AdWeek article, The New Social Gurus, which also focused on how Jaffe's company, Crayon, was recently acquired by Powered. The article made some very &quot;interesting&quot; points, which I commented on in this Blog post: Social Media Gurus - That Old Chestnut. Aaron Strout (CMO of Powered at Blogger over at Citizen Marketer 2.1) acted as moderator/referee/voice of reason.

Chapman, Hugh McGuire, Julien Smith and me tackle everything from the language we use to augmented reality. It's a lively debate about our new world as we all seem to grapple with how to make a Podcast something more and something different than just another radio show. We also look at how mobile and online social networks are quickly becoming one as more and more gaming-type components get added to the fray.

Weinberger is one of four co-authors of the seminal Marketing and Business book, The Cluetrain Manifesto (which was recently released in a 10th Anniversary format). He is also the author of two other amazing books about Marketing, Business, the Internet and the future titled, Small Pieces Loosely Joined, and, Everything Is Miscellaneous. He's been on the Six Pixels of Separation Podcast a couple of times in the past, and always provides enlightening insights into consumers and why they do things (or why they don't).

Penn, Julien Smith and myself (with the exception of Hugh McGuire) - converged in New York City for the Web 2.0 Expo (and Web 2.Open). Wednesday night after dinner, we all met up at the Roger Smith Hotel (in Julien's chambers) and recorded the following rambles, tangents, swear words and non-relevant-to-marketing conversations. That being said, it got interesting, we wavered, we switched, we debated and we made a ton of inside jokes. In the end, the conversation looks at the audience, the new media and those swimming in the deep end of it all.

It is not a standard episode of the Podcast, but something very different. This is a conversation with the thriller novelist, J.C. Hutchins. As Marketers, it's important to listen and learn from people like Hutchins. He's an individual who always wanted to be a published author and nothing was going to get in his way. So, after tons of rejection, he took Marketing matters into his own hands, embraced the online channel (specifically Social Media) and started building community, audience and interest in his words. The result has been nothing short of spectacular, and hearing Hutchins share his story will definitely get you thinking differently about what you do everyday to connect consumers to your products, services and brands.

First off, let me say that the audio quality of the phone call is pitiful in this Podcast. I don't know why this is happening, but whenever a call is recorded through my M-Audio MicroTrack, it is giving off a high-end buzz. If someone knows how this can be fixed, please let me know. That being said, I think this conversation is worth enduring the high pitch sound for. I was lucky enough to get The Woz - Steve Wozniak - on the phone for a conversation about business, technology, education and thoughts about how to change the world. He needs little (to no) introduction as Wozniak is - literally - one of the few people who has changed how our society operates. Along with Steve Jobs, he created Apple. From launching the first personal computer to being a Tetris champion, Wozniak also authored the book, iWoz along with being on a past season of the ABC hit television series, Dancing With The Stars. He is currently the Chief Scientist for Fusion-IO and is a very generous Philanthropist.

I wanted to have a conversation about media and what's happening in these new channels with some of the people I consider friends and that I admire. Here is the first strike at it. The core group is Chris Brogan, C.C. Chapman (Managing The Gray), Hugh McGuire, Christopher S. Penn (Financial Aid Podcast - Marketing Over Coffee), Julien Smith and myself. Whenever we decide to record, there may be all of these people, only some of us, and other guests as well (only time will tell). This week, we've got Brogan and Smith on the horn. Four more things: 1. there is some colourful language in this conversation, so it is not work-safe. 2. This show does not have it's own name yet, so it will be housed here. We'll see how it goes. 2.

The subculture of hacking came into broad daylight in early 2000, &quot;when the websites of CNN, Yahoo, E*Trade, Dell, Amazon, and eBay ground to a halt for several hours, causing panic everywhere from the White House to suburbia and around the world. After two months and hundreds of hours of wiretapping, the FBI and RCMP staged a late-night raid to apprehend the most wanted man in cyberspace &#8212; a 15-year-old kid, Mafiaboy. Eight years later, Mafiaboy, a.k.a.Michael Calce, has ignored requests from every major media outlet in North America and has not told a word of his story &#8212; until now. Using his experience as a cautionary tale, Calce and award-winning journalist Craig Silverman also take the reader through the history of hacking and how it has helped make the internet the new frontier for crime in the 21st century.&quot; That's how the book, Mafiaboy, is described on the website. Here's the conversation I had with Mafiaboy (Michael Calce) and his co-author, Craig Silverman, this past week.

From 35,000 feet in the air, here's my first PlaneCast (hat tip to Joseph Jaffe). It was a crazy week from performing on stage at the Power Within in Halifax with Tony Robbins in front of 5,000 people to jetting off to the TED Conference in Monterey, California. I'm heading into NYC for a little break (ok, there are some meetings involved), but I did not want to miss an episode, so I recorded from the plane. I'd say, &quot;please excuse the sounds,&quot; but I think this type of recording is what makes Podcasting so much fun, different and cool. As a gift for making you endure the sounds of cabin pressure and my dry throat, I also tossed in an incredible conversation I had, in person, with none other than Seth Godin (author of Purple Cow, Meatball Sundae and Small Is The New Big - to name a few). As always, Seth demonstrates why he is the number one most requested speaker on Marketing, and why his books are constant best-sellers and instant classics.

There is no doubt that this is now, officially, my favourite Podcast of the year. I get to turn this show over to you - the community - to share your thoughts on the year that was and the year ahead. I was blown away by the diverse voices that took part in this Yuletide Log episode. There are men and women from all over the world, but even more fascinating is that there are more than a few who are not even Marketing, Communications or Advertising professionals - just people listening and learning. That's probably the highest level of praise one can hope for. I received a few additional audio comments post-recording which I will play in the coming weeks - so, if you're interested, you can still add your thoughts and commentary to the community. Here's how. Allow me to take this last opportunity to wish you and yours a very Happy Holiday and a healthy and safe New Year. I'll also direct you over to the Twist Image Holiday Greeting - Share 2007. In the meantime, let the show play in the background as you take a break to celebrate with your family and loved ones.

Yesterday I was listening to Across The Sound Episode 33 with CC Chapman (from Accident Hash, The U-Turn Cafe and Managing The Gray) and I just decided to go for it. I emailed CC and he pointed me toward CastBlaster. I watched the demo, downloaded the trial version and hit record.\n\nSo, here it is - the pilot episode of Six Pixels Of Separation - The Podcast. Six Pixels Of Separation has been a keynote presentation I have given over the past few months and is the working title for my yet-to-be-written book.\n\nBelow are show notes from this pilot episode of Six Pixels Of Separation. Let me throw some caution up front: \n\n- This is my first attempt at Podcasting and I'm putting it out there in the spirit of \"what the heck.\"\n- It was recorded live, in one-shot, with no editing.\n- CastBlaster in trial format only allows you to record a maximum of ten minutes (that's why I talk a little faster at the end).\n- I'm not a fan of the intro or outro music - I was just playing around. My business partner, Mick Kanfi, will be creating some cool theme music (coming soon).\n- This episode is \"powered by\" and not \"presented by\" CastBlaster.\n- I should have faded out the music at the end.\n\nSix Pixels Of Separation - The Podcast - Pilot Episode - Show Notes:\n\n- Running time: 9:20.\n- Welcome to Six Pixels of Separation - The Podcast.\n- Brief bio on Mitch Joel.\n- Thanks to Joseph Jaffe and CC Chapman.\n- Recap of CMA - Canadian Marketing Association - National Convention and Trade Show. \n- Mentions: Kevin Roberts, Max Lenderman, Joseph Jaffe, Bill Sweetman and One Degree.\n- Why Six Pixels Of Separation? \n- Montreal Business Book Club.\n\nI have yet to set-up the feed and post the Podcast to iTunes, etc..., so the only way to hear it is to download it from this location (you can try a right-mouse-click and save): Six Pixels Of Separation - The Podcast - Pilot Episode - Host: Mitch Joel.\n\nAs with everything, your comments, feedback and help is appreciated.
