Mockingly, \nOn coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths; \nA swan-like form invests the hidden thorn; \nFills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall, \nMaugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gate \nA tapering turret overtops the work. \nAnd when his hours are numbered, and the world \nIs all his own, retiring, as he were not, \nLeaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art \nTo mimic in slow structures, stone by stone, \nBuilt in an age, the mad wind's night-work, \nThe frolic architecture of the snow.\n\nReading \u00a9 Classic Poetry Aloud, 2008.", "duration": "126", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://classicpoetryaloud.podOmatic.com/enclosure/2014-01-07T02_02_08-08_00.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["classicpoetryaloud", "classic", "poetry", "aloud", "english", "literature", "poems", "podcast", "poem", "reading", "listening", "to", "spoken", "word", "ralph", "waldo", "emerson"]}, {"seriesId": 254921943, "seriesTitle": "Classic Poetry Aloud", "pubDate": 1387441962, "title": "619.

\nOr at the casement seen her stand? \nOr is she known in all the land, \n    The Lady of Shalott? \n\nOnly reapers, reaping early \nIn among the bearded barley, \nHear a song that echoes cheerly \nFrom the river winding clearly, \n     Down to tower'd Camelot: \nAnd by the moon the reaper weary, \nPiling sheaves in uplands airy, \nListening, whispers \"'Tis the fairy \n    Lady of Shalott.\" \n\nPart II. \n\nThere she weaves by night and day \nA magic web with colours gay. \nShe has heard a whisper say, \nA curse is on her if she stay \n    To look down to Camelot. \nShe knows not what the curse may be, \nAnd so she weaveth steadily, \nAnd little other care hath she, \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nAnd moving thro' a mirror clear \nThat hangs before her all the year, \nShadows of the world appear. \nThere she sees the highway near \n    Winding down to Camelot: \nThere the river eddy whirls, \nAnd there the surly village-churls, \nAnd the red cloaks of market girls, \n    Pass onward from Shalott. \n\nSometimes a troop of damsels glad, \nAn abbot on an ambling pad, \nSometimes a curly shepherd-lad, \nOr long-hair'd page in crimson clad, \n    Goes by to tower'd Camelot; \nAnd sometimes thro' the mirror blue \nThe knights come riding two and two: \nShe hath no loyal knight and true, \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nBut in her web she still delights \nTo weave the mirror's magic sights, \nFor often thro' the silent nights \nA funeral, with plumes and lights \n     And music, went to Camelot: \nOr when the moon was overhead, \nCame two young lovers lately wed; \n\"I am half-sick of shadows,\" said \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nPart III. \n\nA bow-shot from her bower-eaves, \nHe rode between the barley-sheaves, \nThe sun came dazzling thro' the leaves, \nAnd flamed upon the brazen greaves \n    Of bold Sir Lancelot. \nA redcross knight for ever kneel'd \nTo a lady in his shield, \nThat sparkled on the yellow field, \n    Beside remote Shalott. \n\nThe gemmy bridle glitter'd free, \nLike to some branch of stars we see \nHung in the golden Galaxy. \nThe bridle-bells rang merrily \n    As he rode down to Camelot: \nAnd from his blazon'd baldric slung \nA mighty silver bugle hung, \nAnd as he rode his armour rung, \n    Beside remote Shalott. \n\nAll in the blue unclouded weather \nThick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather, \nThe helmet and the helmet-feather \nBurn'd like one burning flame together, \n    As he rode down to Camelot. \nAs often thro' the purple night, \nBelow the starry clusters bright, \nSome bearded meteor, trailing light, \n    Moves over still Shalott. \n\nHis broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; \nOn burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; \nFrom underneath his helmet flow'd \nHis coal-black curls as on he rode, \n    As he rode down to Camelot. \nFrom the bank and from the river \nHe flash'd into the crystal mirror, \n\"Tirra lirra,\" by the river \n    Sang Sir Lancelot. \n\nShe left the web, she left the loom, \nShe made three paces thro' the room, \nShe saw the water-lily bloom, \nShe saw the helmet and the plume, \n    She look'd down to Camelot. \nOut flew the web and floated wide; \nThe mirror crack'd from side to side; \n\"The curse is come upon me,\" cried \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nPart IV. \n\nIn the stormy east-wind straining, \nThe pale-yellow woods were waning, \nThe broad stream in his banks complaining, \nHeavily the low sky raining \n    Over tower'd Camelot; \nDown she came and found a boat \nBeneath a willow left afloat, \nAnd round about the prow she wrote \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nAnd down the river's dim expanse-- \nLike some bold se\u00ebr in a trance, \nSeeing all his own mischance-- \nWith a glassy countenance \n    Did she look to Camelot. \nAnd at the closing of the day \nShe loosed the chain, and down she lay; \nThe broad stream bore her far away, \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nLying, robed in snowy white \nThat loosely flew to left and right-- \nThe leaves upon her falling light-- \nThro' the noises of the night \n    She floated down to Camelot: \nAnd as the boat-head wound along \nThe willowy hills and fields among, \nThey heard her singing her last song, \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nHeard a carol, mournful, holy, \nChanted loudly, chanted lowly, \nTill her blood was frozen slowly, \nAnd her eyes were darken'd wholly, \n    Turn'd to tower'd Camelot; \nFor ere she reach'd upon the tide \nThe first house by the water-side, \nSinging in her song she died, \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nUnder tower and balcony, \nBy garden-wall and gallery, \nA gleaming shape she floated by, \nA corse between the houses high, \n    Silent into Camelot. \nOut upon the wharfs they came, \nKnight and burgher, lord and dame, \nAnd round the prow they read her name, \n    The Lady of Shalott. \n\nWho is this? and what is here? \nAnd in the lighted palace near \nDied the sound of royal cheer; \nAnd they cross'd themselves for fear, \n    All the knights at Camelot: \nBut Lancelot mused a little space; \nHe said, \"She has a lovely face; \nGod in his mercy lend her grace, \n    The Lady of Shalott.\" \n\n\n Reading \u00a9 Classic Poetry Aloud, 2008.", "duration": "480", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://classicpoetryaloud.podOmatic.com/enclosure/2013-10-12T03_58_16-07_00.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["alfredlordtennyson", "classicpoetryaloud", "lady", "podcast", "poem", "poetry", "reading", "shalott", "spokenword", "tennyson", "verse"]}, {"seriesId": 254921943, "seriesTitle": "Classic Poetry Aloud", "pubDate": 1381481057, "title": "578.

either side the river lie\n Long fields of barley and of rye,\n That clothe the wold and meet the sky;\n And thro' the field the road runs by\n              To many-tower'd Camelot;\n And up and down the people go,\n Gazing where the lilies blow\n Round an island there below,\n              The island of Shalott.\n\n Willows whiten, aspens quiver,\n Little breezes dusk and shiver\n Thro' the wave that runs for ever\n By the island in the river\n              Flowing down to Camelot.\n Four gray walls, and four gray towers,\n Overlook a space of flowers,\n And the silent isle imbowers\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n By the margin, willow-veil'd\n Slide the heavy barges trail'd\n By slow horses; and unhail'd\n The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd\n              Skimming down to Camelot:\n But who hath seen her wave her hand?\n Or at the casement seen her stand?\n Or is she known in all the land,\n              The Lady of Shalott?\n\n Only reapers, reaping early\n In among the bearded barley,\n Hear a song that echoes cheerly\n From the river winding clearly,\n              Down to tower'd Camelot:\n And by the moon the reaper weary,\n Piling sheaves in uplands airy,\n Listening, whispers \"'Tis the fairy\n              Lady of Shalott.\"\n\n\n              Part II.\n\n There she weaves by night and day\n A magic web with colours gay.\n She has heard a whisper say,\n A curse is on her if she stay\n              To look down to Camelot.\n She knows not what the curse may be,\n And so she weaveth steadily,\n And little other care hath she,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n And moving thro' a mirror clear\n That hangs before her all the year,\n Shadows of the world appear.\n There she sees the highway near\n              Winding down to Camelot:\n There the river eddy whirls,\n And there the surly village-churls,\n And the red cloaks of market girls,\n              Pass onward from Shalott.\n\n Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,\n An abbot on an ambling pad,\n Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,\n Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,\n              Goes by to tower'd Camelot;\n And sometimes thro' the mirror blue\n The knights come riding two and two:\n She hath no loyal knight and true,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n But in her web she still delights\n To weave the mirror's magic sights,\n For often thro' the silent nights\n A funeral, with plumes and lights\n              And music, went to Camelot:\n Or when the moon was overhead,\n Came two young lovers lately wed;\n \"I am half-sick of shadows,\" said\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n\n              Part III.\n\n A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,\n He rode between the barley-sheaves,\n The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,\n And flamed upon the brazen greaves\n              Of bold Sir Lancelot.\n A redcross knight for ever kneel'd\n To a lady in his shield,\n That sparkled on the yellow field,\n              Beside remote Shalott.\n\n The gemmy bridle glitter'd free,\n Like to some branch of stars we see\n Hung in the golden Galaxy.\n The bridle-bells rang merrily\n              As he rode down to Camelot:\n And from his blazon'd baldric slung\n A mighty silver bugle hung,\n And as he rode his armour rung,\n              Beside remote Shalott.\n\n All in the blue unclouded weather\n Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,\n The helmet and the helmet-feather\n Burn'd like one burning flame together,\n              As he rode down to Camelot.\n As often thro' the purple night,\n Below the starry clusters bright,\n Some bearded meteor, trailing light,\n              Moves over still Shalott.\n\n His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;\n On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;\n From underneath his helmet flow'd\n His coal-black curls as on he rode,\n              As he rode down to Camelot.\n From the bank and from the river\n He flash'd into the crystal mirror,\n \"Tirra lirra,\" by the river\n              Sang Sir Lancelot.\n\n She left the web, she left the loom,\n She made three paces thro' the room,\n She saw the water-lily bloom,\n She saw the helmet and the plume,\n              She look'd down to Camelot.\n Out flew the web and floated wide;\n The mirror crack'd from side to side;\n \"The curse is come upon me,\" cried\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n\n              Part IV.\n\n In the stormy east-wind straining,\n The pale-yellow woods were waning,\n The broad stream in his banks complaining,\n Heavily the low sky raining\n              Over tower'd Camelot;\n Down she came and found a boat\n Beneath a willow left afloat,\n And round about the prow she wrote\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n\n\n And down the river's dim expanse--\n Like some bold se\u00ebr in a trance,\n Seeing all his own mischance--\n With a glassy countenance\n              Did she look to Camelot.\n And at the closing of the day\n She loosed the chain, and down she lay;\n The broad stream bore her far away,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Lying, robed in snowy white\n That loosely flew to left and right--\n The leaves upon her falling light--\n Thro' the noises of the night\n              She floated down to Camelot:\n And as the boat-head wound along\n The willowy hills and fields among,\n They heard her singing her last song,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Heard a carol, mournful, holy,\n Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,\n Till her blood was frozen slowly,\n And her eyes were darken'd wholly,\n              Turn'd to tower'd Camelot;\n For ere she reach'd upon the tide\n The first house by the water-side,\n Singing in her song she died,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Under tower and balcony,\n By garden-wall and gallery,\n A gleaming shape she floated by,\n A corse between the houses high,\n              Silent into Camelot.\n Out upon the wharfs they came,\n Knight and burgher, lord and dame,\n And round the prow they read her name,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Who is this? and what is here?\n And in the lighted palace near\n Died the sound of royal cheer;\n And they cross'd themselves for fear,\n              All the knights at Camelot:\n But Lancelot mused a little space;\n He said, \"She has a lovely face;\n God in his mercy lend her grace,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\"\n\n\nFirst aired: 2

Through the park\nVoices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,\nVoices of play and pleasure after day,\nTill gathering sleep had mothered them from him.\n\nAbout this time Town used to swing so gay\nWhen glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees\nAnd girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,\n\u2014 In the old times, before he threw away his knees.\nNow he will never feel again how slim\nGirls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,\nAll of them touch him like some queer disease.\n\nThere was an artist silly for his face,\nFor it was younger than his youth, last year.\nNow he is old; his back will never brace;\nHe's lost his colour very far from here,\nPoured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,\nAnd half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,\nAnd leap of purple spurted from his thigh.\nOne time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,\nAfter the matches carried shoulder-high.\nIt was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,\nHe thought he'd better join. He wonders why . . .\nSomeone had said he'd look a god in kilts.\n\nThat's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,\nAye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,\nHe asked to join. He didn't have to beg;\nSmiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.\nGermans he scarcely thought of; and no fears\nOf Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts\nFor daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;\nAnd care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;\nEsprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.\nAnd soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.\n\nSome cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.\nOnly a solemn man who brought him fruits\nThanked him; and then inquired about his soul.\nNow, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,\nAnd do what things the rules consider wise,\nAnd take whatever pity they may dole.\nTo-night he noticed how the women's eyes\nPassed from him to the strong men that were whole.\nHow cold and late it is! Why don't they come\nAnd put him into bed? Why don't they come?\n\nFirst aired: 8 November 2009\n\nFor hundreds more poetry readings, <a href=\"http://www.classicpoetryaloud.com\">visit the Classic Poetry Aloud index</a>.\n\nReading \u00a9 Classic Poetry Aloud 2009", "duration": "217", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://classicpoetryaloud.podOmatic.com/enclosure/2009-11-07T08_58_19-08_00.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["classicpoetryaloud", "poetry", "poem", "verse", "podcast", "reading", "spoken", "wilfred", "owen", "war", "disabled", "first"]}, {"seriesId": 254921943, "seriesTitle": "Classic Poetry Aloud", "pubDate": 1257072857, "title": "509.

\n   Only this and nothing more.\" \n \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December \nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. \nEagerly I wished the morrow;\u2014vainly I had sought to borrow \nFrom my books surcease of sorrow\u2014sorrow for the lost Lenore, \nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore: \n   Nameless here for evermore. \n \nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain \nThrilled me\u2014filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; \nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating \n\"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door, \nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door: \n   This it is and nothing more.\" \n \nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; \nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, \nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, \nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"\u2014here I opened wide the door:\u2014 \n   Darkness there and nothing more. \n \nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, \nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; \nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, \nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\" \nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore:\" \n   Merely this and nothing more. \n \nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, \nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. \n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice; \nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore; \nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore: \n   'T is the wind and nothing more.\" \n \nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, \nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. \nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; \nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door, \nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door: \n   Perched, and sat, and nothing more. \n \nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling \nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\u2014 \n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven, \nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore: \nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\" \n   Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\" \n \nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, \nThough its answer little meaning\u2014little relevancy bore; \nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being \nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door, \nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, \n   With such name as \"Nevermore.\" \n \nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only \nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. \nNothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered, \nTill I scarcely more than muttered,\u2014\"Other friends have flown before; \nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\" \n   Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\" \n \nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store, \nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster \nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore: \nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore \n   Of 'Never\u2014nevermore.' \n \nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, \nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;

Time driveth onward fast,  \nAnd in a little while our lips are dumb.  \nLet us alone. What is it that will last?         \nAll things are taken from us, and become  \nPortions and parcels of the dreadful past.  \nLet us alone. What pleasure can we have  \nTo war with evil? Is there any peace  \nIn ever climbing up the climbing wave?         \nAll things have rest, and ripen toward the grave  \nIn silence\u2014ripen, fall, and cease:  \nGive us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.  \n  \nV\n\nHow sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,  \nWith half-shut eyes ever to seem         \nFalling asleep in a half-dream!  \nTo dream and dream, like yonder amber light,  \nWhich will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;  \nTo hear each other\u2019s whisper\u2019d speech;  \nEating the Lotos day by day,         \nTo watch the crisping ripples on the beach, \nAnd tender curving lines of creamy spray;  \nTo lend our hearts and spirits wholly  \nTo the influence of mild-minded melancholy;  \nTo muse and brood and live again in memory,         \nWith those old faces of our infancy  \nHeap\u2019d over with a mound of grass,  \nTwo handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!  \n  \nVI\n\nDear is the memory of our wedded lives,  \nAnd dear the last embraces of our wives         \nAnd their warm tears; but all hath suffer\u2019d change;  \nFor surely now our household hearths are cold,  \nOur sons inherit us, our looks are strange,  \nAnd we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.  \nOr else the island princes over-bold         \nHave eat our substance, and the minstrel sings  \nBefore them of the ten years\u2019 war in Troy,  \nAnd our great deeds, as half-forgotten things.  \nIs there confusion in the little isle?  \nLet what is broken so remain.         \nThe Gods are hard to reconcile;  \n\u2019Tis hard to settle order once again.  \nThere is confusion worse than death,  \nTrouble on trouble, pain on pain,  \nLong labor unto aged breath,         \nSore task to hearts worn out by many wars  \nAnd eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.  \n  \nVII\n\nBut, propped on beds of amaranth and moly,  \nHow sweet\u2014while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly\u2014  \nWith half-dropped eyelids still,         \nBeneath a heaven dark and holy,  \nTo watch the long bright river drawing slowly  \nHis waters from the purple hill\u2014  \nTo hear the dewy echoes calling  \nFrom cave to cave thro\u2019 the thick-twined vine\u2014         \nTo watch the emerald-color\u2019d water falling  \nThro\u2019 many a woven acanthus-wreath divine!  \nOnly to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,  \nOnly to hear were sweet, stretch\u2019d out beneath the pine.  \n  \nVIII\n\nThe Lotos blooms below the barren peak,         \nThe Lotos blows by every winding creek; \nAll day the wind breathes low with mellower tone;  \nThro\u2019 every hollow cave and alley lone  \nRound and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.  \nWe have had enough of action, and of motion we,         \nRoll\u2019d to starboard, roll\u2019d to larboard, when the surge was seething free,  \nWhere the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.  \nLet us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,  \nIn the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined  \nOn the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.         \nFor they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl\u2019d  \nFar below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl\u2019d  \nRound their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world;  \nWhere they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands,  \nBlight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands,         \nClanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands.  \nBut they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song  \nSteaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,  \nLike a tale of little meaning tho\u2019 the words are strong;  \nChanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,         \nSow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil,  \nStoring yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;  \nTill they perish and they suffer\u2014some, \u2019tis whisper\u2019d\u2014down in hell  \nSuffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,  \nResting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.         \nSurely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore  \nThan labor in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar;  \nO, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more. \n\nFirst aired: 6 December 2007\n\nFor hundreds more poetry readings, <a href=\"http://www.classicpoetryaloud.com\">visit the Classic Poetry Aloud index</a>.\n\nReading \u00a9 Classic Poetry Aloud 2008", "duration": "806", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://classicpoetryaloud.podOmatic.com/enclosure/2008-11-29T13_52_22-08_00.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["classicpoetryaloud", "poetry", "poem", "poems", "reading", "recital", "lotos", "eaters", "alfred", "lord", "tennyson", "drugs"]}, {"seriesId": 254921943, "seriesTitle": "Classic Poetry Aloud", "pubDate": 1227778322, "title": "370.

hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul,\n                (Victorious song, death\u2019s outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering song,\n                As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night,\n                Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy,\n                Covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven,\n                As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,)\n                Passing, I leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves;\n                I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring,\n                I cease from my song for thee;\n                From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\n

          The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\n                And the tallying chant, the echo arous\u2019d in my soul,\n                With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe,\n                With the lilac tall, and its blossoms of mastering odor;\n                With the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird,\n                Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep\u2014for the dead I loved so well;\n                For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands...and this for his dear

     The Lady of Shalott.\n\n By the margin, willow-veil'd\n Slide the heavy barges trail'd\n By slow horses; and unhail'd\n The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd\n              Skimming down to Camelot:\n But who hath seen her wave her hand?\n Or at the casement seen her stand?\n Or is she known in all the land,\n              The Lady of Shalott?\n\n Only reapers, reaping early\n In among the bearded barley,\n Hear a song that echoes cheerly\n From the river winding clearly,\n              Down to tower'd Camelot:\n And by the moon the reaper weary,\n Piling sheaves in uplands airy,\n Listening, whispers \"'Tis the fairy\n              Lady of Shalott.\"\n\n\n              Part II.\n\n There she weaves by night and day\n A magic web with colours gay.\n She has heard a whisper say,\n A curse is on her if she stay\n              To look down to Camelot.\n She knows not what the curse may be,\n And so she weaveth steadily,\n And little other care hath she,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n And moving thro' a mirror clear\n That hangs before her all the year,\n Shadows of the world appear.\n There she sees the highway near\n              Winding down to Camelot:\n There the river eddy whirls,\n And there the surly village-churls,\n And the red cloaks of market girls,\n              Pass onward from Shalott.\n\n Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,\n An abbot on an ambling pad,\n Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,\n Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,\n              Goes by to tower'd Camelot;\n And sometimes thro' the mirror blue\n The knights come riding two and two:\n She hath no loyal knight and true,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n But in her web she still delights\n To weave the mirror's magic sights,\n For often thro' the silent nights\n A funeral, with plumes and lights\n              And music, went to Camelot:\n Or when the moon was overhead,\n Came two young lovers lately wed;\n \"I am half-sick of shadows,\" said\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n\n              Part III.\n\n A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,\n He rode between the barley-sheaves,\n The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,\n And flamed upon the brazen greaves\n              Of bold Sir Lancelot.\n A redcross knight for ever kneel'd\n To a lady in his shield,\n That sparkled on the yellow field,\n              Beside remote Shalott.\n\n The gemmy bridle glitter'd free,\n Like to some branch of stars we see\n Hung in the golden Galaxy.\n The bridle-bells rang merrily\n              As he rode down to Camelot:\n And from his blazon'd baldric slung\n A mighty silver bugle hung,\n And as he rode his armour rung,\n              Beside remote Shalott.\n\n All in the blue unclouded weather\n Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,\n The helmet and the helmet-feather\n Burn'd like one burning flame together,\n              As he rode down to Camelot.\n As often thro' the purple night,\n Below the starry clusters bright,\n Some bearded meteor, trailing light,\n              Moves over still Shalott.\n\n His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;\n On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;\n From underneath his helmet flow'd\n His coal-black curls as on he rode,\n              As he rode down to Camelot.\n From the bank and from the river\n He flash'd into the crystal mirror,\n \"Tirra lirra,\" by the river\n              Sang Sir Lancelot.\n\n She left the web, she left the loom,\n She made three paces thro' the room,\n She saw the water-lily bloom,\n She saw the helmet and the plume,\n              She look'd down to Camelot.\n Out flew the web and floated wide;\n The mirror crack'd from side to side;\n \"The curse is come upon me,\" cried\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n\n              Part IV.\n\n In the stormy east-wind straining,\n The pale-yellow woods were waning,\n The broad stream in his banks complaining,\n Heavily the low sky raining\n              Over tower'd Camelot;\n Down she came and found a boat\n Beneath a willow left afloat,\n And round about the prow she wrote\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n\n\n And down the river's dim expanse--\n Like some bold se\u00ebr in a trance,\n Seeing all his own mischance--\n With a glassy countenance\n              Did she look to Camelot.\n And at the closing of the day\n She loosed the chain, and down she lay;\n The broad stream bore her far away,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Lying, robed in snowy white\n That loosely flew to left and right--\n The leaves upon her falling light--\n Thro' the noises of the night\n              She floated down to Camelot:\n And as the boat-head wound along\n The willowy hills and fields among,\n They heard her singing her last song,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Heard a carol, mournful, holy,\n Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,\n Till her blood was frozen slowly,\n And her eyes were darken'd wholly,\n              Turn'd to tower'd Camelot;\n For ere she reach'd upon the tide\n The first house by the water-side,\n Singing in her song she died,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Under tower and balcony,\n By garden-wall and gallery,\n A gleaming shape she floated by,\n A corse between the houses high,\n              Silent into Camelot.\n Out upon the wharfs they came,\n Knight and burgher, lord and dame,\n And round the prow they read her name,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\n\n Who is this? and what is here?\n And in the lighted palace near\n Died the sound of royal cheer;\n And they cross'd themselves for fear,\n              All the knights at Camelot:\n But Lancelot mused a little space;\n He said, \"She has a lovely face;\n God in his mercy lend her grace,\n              The Lady of Shalott.\"\n\n\nFirst aired: 2

hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,\n                                To drink there.\n                                \n                                In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree\n                                I came down the steps with my pitcher\n                                And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough before me.\n                                \n                                He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom\n                                And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the\n                                  edge of the stone trough\n                                And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,\n                                And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,\n                                He sipped with his straight mouth,\n                                Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,\n                                Silently.\n                                \n                                Someone was before me at my

do,\n                                And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,\n                                And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a  moment,\n                                And stooped and drank a little more,\n                                Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth\n                                On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.\n                                \n                                The voice of my education said to me\n                                He must be killed,\n                                For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.\n                                And voices in me said, If you were a man\n                                You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.\n                                \n                                But must I confess how I liked him,\n                                How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough\n                                And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,\n                                Into the burning bowels of this earth?\n                                \n                                Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?\n                                Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?\n                                Was it humility, to feel so honoured?\n                                I felt so honoured.\n                                \n                                And yet those voices:\n                                If you were not afraid, you would kill him!\n                                \n                                And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,\n                                But even so, honoured still more\n                                That he should seek my hospitality\n                                From out the dark door of the secret earth.\n                                \n                                He drank enough\n                                And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,\n                                And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,\n                                Seeming to lick his lips,\n                                And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,\n                                And slowly turned his head,\n                                And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,\n                                Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round\n                                And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.\n                                \n                                And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,\n                                And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered farther,\n                                A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into\n                                  that horrid black hole,\n                                Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,\n                                Overcame me now his back was turned.\n                                \n                                I looked round, I put down my pitcher,\n                                I picked up a clumsy log\n                                And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.\n                                \n                                I think it did not hit him,\n                                But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in\n                                  undignified haste,\n                                Writhed like lightning, and was gone\n                                Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,\n                                At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.\n                                \n                                And immediately I regretted it.\n                                I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!\n                                I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.\n                                \n                                And I thought of the albatross,\n                                And I wished he would come back, my snake.\n                                \n

                    \n                                And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords\n                                Of life.\n                                And I have something

past.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n<b>The Raven </b>\nby Edgar Allan Poe (1809 \u2013 1849)\n\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, \nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\u2014 \nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, \nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \n\"'T is some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door; \n   Only this and nothing more.\" \n \n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December \nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. \nEagerly I wished the morrow;\u2014vainly I had sought to borrow \nFrom my books surcease of sorrow\u2014sorrow for the lost Lenore, \nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore: \n   Nameless here for evermore. \n \n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain \nThrilled me\u2014filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; \nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating \n\"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door, \nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door: \n   This it is and nothing more.\" \n \n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; \nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, \nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, \nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"\u2014here I opened wide the door:\u2014 \n   Darkness there and nothing more. \n \n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, \nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; \nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, \nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\" \nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore:\" \n   Merely this and nothing more. \n \n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, \nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. \n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice; \nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore; \nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore: \n   'T is the wind and nothing more.\" \n \n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, \nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. \nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; \nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door, \nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door: \n   Perched, and sat, and nothing more. \n \n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling \nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\u2014 \n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven, \nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore: \nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\" \n   Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, \nThough its answer little meaning\u2014little relevancy bore; \nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being \nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door, \nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, \n   With such name as \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only \nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. \nNothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered, \nTill I scarcely more than muttered,\u2014\"Other friends have flown before; \nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\" \n   Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store, \nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster \nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore: \nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore \n   Of 'Never\u2014nevermore.' \n \n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, \nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door; \nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking \nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore, \nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore \n   Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing \nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; \nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining \nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er, \nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er \n   She shall press, ah, nevermore! \n \n\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer \nSwung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. \n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee\u2014by these angels he hath sent thee \nRespite\u2014respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\" \nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore.\" \n   Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil! \nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, \nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted\u2014 \nOn this home by Horror haunted\u2014tell me truly, I implore: \nIs there\u2014is there balm in Gilead?\u2014tell me\u2014tell me, I implore!\" \n   Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil! \nBy that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore, \nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, \nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore: \nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore!\" \n   Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\n\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting: \n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! \nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! \nLeave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door! \nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\" \n   Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\" \n \n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting \nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; \nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, \nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor: \nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor \n   Shall be lifted\u2014nevermore!", "duration": "531", "imageUrlLg":

their bare heads and dewy temples play;\nWhile some with feebler heads and fainter hearts,\nDeplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts:\nThen shall I dare these real ills to hide\nIn tinsel

other mates;\nBy such examples taught, I paint the Cot,\nAs Truth will paint it, and as Bards will not:\nNor you, ye poor, of letter'd scorn complain,\nTo you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;\nO'ercome by labour, and bow'd down by time,\nFeel you the barren flattery of a rhyme?\nCan poets soothe you, when you pine for bread,\nBy winding myrtles round your ruin'd shed?\nCan their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower\nOr glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?\n\nLo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o'er,\nLends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor;\nFrom thence a length of burning sand appears,\nWhere the thin harvest waves its wither'd ears;\nRank weeds, that every art and care defy,\nReign o'er the land, and rob the blighted rye:\nThere thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,\nAnd to the ragged infant threaten war;\nThere poppies nodding, mock the hope of toil;\nThere the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil;\nHardy and high, above the slender sheaf,\nThe slimy mallow waves her silky leaf;\nO'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade,\nAnd clasping tares cling round the sickly blade;\nWith mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,\nAnd a sad splendour vainly shines around.\nSo looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn,\nBetray'd by man, then left for man to scorn;\nWhose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose,\nWhile her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;\nWhose outward splendour is but folly's dress,\nExposing most, when most it gilds distress.\n\nHere joyous roam a wild amphibious race,\nWith sullen woe display'd in every face;\nWho, far from civil arts and social fly,\nAnd scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.\n\n\nhttp://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/crabbe/essay1.html\n\nAbout George

garden's end. \nThe sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet \nDelayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit \nAround the radiant fireplace, enclosed \nIn a tumultuous privacy of storm. \n \nCome see the north wind's masonry. \nOut of an unseen quarry evermore \nFurnished with tile, the fierce artificer \nCurves his white bastions with projected roof \nRound every windward stake, or

stars are high.\nOne day I was thinking how if a man fell from that lofty pole\nHe would rush through the water toward me till his image was scattered by his splash,\nWhen suddenly a train rushed by: the brazen dome of the engine flashed:\nthe long white carriages roared;\nThe sun veiled himself for a moment, and the signals loomed in fog;\nA savage woman screamed at me from a barge: little children began to cry;\nThe untidy landscape rose to life: a sawmill started;\nA cart rattled down to the wharf, and workmen clanged over the iron footbridge;\nA beautiful old man nodded from the first story window of a square red house,\nAnd a pretty girl came out to hang up clothes in a small delightful garden.\nO strange motion in the suburb of a county town: slow regular movement of the

Lotos-Eaters </b>\n\nby Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809 \u2013 1892) \n  \n  \n\u201cCourage!\u201d he said, and pointed toward the land,  \n\u201cThis mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon.\u201d  \nIn the afternoon they came unto a land  \nIn which it seemed always afternoon.  \nAll round the coast the languid air did swoon,         \nBreathing like one that hath a weary dream.  \nFull-faced above the valley stood the moon;  \nAnd, like a downward smoke, the slender stream  \nAlong the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.  \n  \nA land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,         \nSlow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;  \nAnd some thro\u2019 wavering lights and shadows broke,  \nRolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.  \nThey saw the gleaming river seaward flow  \nFrom the inner land; far off, three mountain-tops,         \nThree silent pinnacles of aged snow,  \nStood sunset-flush\u2019d; and, dew\u2019d with showery drops,  \nUp-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.  \n  \nThe charmed sunset linger\u2019d low adown  \nIn the red West; thro\u2019 mountain clefts the dale         \nWas seen far inland, and the yellow down  \nBorder\u2019d with palm, and many a winding vale  \nAnd meadow, set with slender galingale;  \nA land where all things always seem\u2019d the same!  \nAnd round about the keel with faces pale,         \nDark faces pale against that rosy flame,  \nThe mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.  \n  \nBranches they bore of that enchanted stem,  \nLaden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave  \nTo each, but whoso did receive of them         \nAnd taste, to him the gushing of the wave  \nFar far away did seem to mourn and rave  \nOn alien shores; and if his fellow spake,  \nHis voice was thin, as voices from the grave; \nAnd deep-asleep he seem\u2019d, yet all awake,         \nAnd music in his ears his beating heart did make.  \n  \nThey sat them down upon the yellow sand,  \nBetween the sun and moon upon the shore;  \nAnd sweet it was to dream of Fatherland,  \nOf child, and wife, and slave; but evermore         \nMost weary seem\u2019d the sea, weary the oar,  \nWeary the wandering fields of barren foam.  \nThen some one said, \u201cWe will return no more;\u201d  \nAnd all at once they sang, \u201cOur island home  \nIs far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam.\u201d         \n  \nCHORIC SONG\nI\n\nThere is sweet music here that softer falls  \nThan petals from blown roses on the grass,  \nOr night-dews on still waters between walls  \nOf shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass;  \nMusic that gentlier on the spirit lies,         \nThan tir\u2019d eyelids upon tir\u2019d eyes;  \nMusic that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.  \nHere are cool mosses deep,  \nAnd thro\u2019 the moss the ivies creep,  \nAnd in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,         \nAnd from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.  \n  \nII\n\nWhy are we weigh\u2019d upon with heaviness,  \nAnd utterly consumed with sharp distress,  \nWhile all things else have rest from weariness?  \nAll things have rest: why should we toil alone,         \nWe only toil, who are the first of things,  \nAnd make perpetual moan,  \nStill from one sorrow to another thrown;  \nNor ever fold our wings,  \nAnd cease from wanderings,         \nNor steep our brows in slumber\u2019s holy balm;  \nNor harken what the inner spirit sings,  \n\u201cThere is no joy but calm!\u201d\u2014  \nWhy should we only toil, the roof and crown of things?  \n  \nIII\n\nLo! in the middle of the wood,         \nThe folded leaf is woo\u2019d from out the bud  \nWith winds upon the branch, and there  \nGrows green and broad, and takes no care,  \nSun-steep\u2019d at noon, and in the moon  \nNightly dew-fed; and turning yellow         \nFalls, and floats adown the air.  \nLo! sweeten\u2019d with the summer light,  \nThe full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,  \nDrops in a silent autumn night.  \nAll its allotted length of days         \nThe flower ripens in its place,  \nRipens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil,  \nFast-rooted in the fruitful soil.  \n  \nIV\n\nHateful is the dark-blue sky,  \nVaulted o\u2019er the dark-blue sea.         \nDeath is the end of life; ah, why  \nShould life all labor be?  \nLet us alone. Time driveth onward fast,  \nAnd in a little while our lips are dumb.  \nLet us alone. What is it that will last?         \nAll things are taken from us, and become  \nPortions and parcels of the dreadful past.  \nLet us alone. What pleasure can we have  \nTo war with evil? Is there any peace  \nIn ever climbing up the climbing wave?         \nAll things have rest, and ripen toward the grave  \nIn silence\u2014ripen, fall, and cease:  \nGive us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.  \n  \nV\n\nHow sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,  \nWith half-shut eyes ever to seem         \nFalling asleep in a half-dream!  \nTo dream and dream, like yonder amber light,  \nWhich will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;  \nTo hear each other\u2019s whisper\u2019d speech;  \nEating the Lotos day by day,         \nTo watch the crisping ripples on the beach, \nAnd tender curving lines of creamy spray;  \nTo lend our hearts and spirits wholly  \nTo the influence of mild-minded melancholy;  \nTo muse and brood and live again in memory,         \nWith those old faces of our infancy  \nHeap\u2019d over with a mound of grass,  \nTwo handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!  \n  \nVI\n\nDear is the memory of our wedded lives,  \nAnd dear the last embraces of our wives         \nAnd their warm tears; but all hath suffer\u2019d change;  \nFor surely now our household hearths are cold,  \nOur sons inherit us, our looks are strange,  \nAnd we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.  \nOr else the island princes over-bold         \nHave eat our substance, and the minstrel sings  \nBefore them of the ten years\u2019 war in Troy,  \nAnd our great deeds, as half-forgotten things.  \nIs there confusion in the little isle?  \nLet what is broken so remain.         \nThe Gods are hard to reconcile;  \n\u2019Tis hard to settle order once again.  \nThere is confusion worse than death,  \nTrouble on trouble, pain on pain,  \nLong labor unto aged breath,         \nSore task to hearts worn out by many wars  \nAnd eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.  \n  \nVII\n\nBut, propped on beds of amaranth and moly,  \nHow sweet\u2014while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly\u2014  \nWith half-dropped eyelids still,         \nBeneath a heaven dark and holy,  \nTo watch the long bright river drawing slowly  \nHis waters from the purple hill\u2014  \nTo hear the dewy echoes calling  \nFrom cave to cave thro\u2019 the thick-twined vine\u2014         \nTo watch the emerald-color\u2019d water falling  \nThro\u2019 many a woven acanthus-wreath divine!  \nOnly to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,  \nOnly to hear were sweet, stretch\u2019d out beneath the pine.  \n  \nVIII\n\nThe Lotos blooms below the barren peak,         \nThe Lotos blows by every winding creek; \nAll day the wind breathes low with mellower tone;  \nThro\u2019 every hollow cave and alley lone  \nRound and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.  \nWe have had enough of action, and of motion we,         \nRoll\u2019d to starboard, roll\u2019d to larboard, when the surge was seething free,  \nWhere the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.  \nLet us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,  \nIn the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined  \nOn the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.         \nFor they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl\u2019d  \nFar below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl\u2019d  \nRound their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world;  \nWhere they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands,  \nBlight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands,         \nClanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands.  \nBut they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song  \nSteaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,  \nLike a tale of little meaning tho\u2019 the words are strong;  \nChanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,         \nSow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil,  \nStoring yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;  \nTill they perish and they suffer\u2014some, \u2019tis whisper\u2019d\u2014down in hell  \nSuffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,  \nResting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.         \nSurely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore  \nThan labor in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar;  \nO, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more.", "duration": "806", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/50/e6/60/50e6602a-e7dc-72e8-a366-3081b864b025/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://classicpoetryaloud.podOmatic.com/enclosure/2007-12-06T16_22_15-08_00.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["classic", "poetry", "aloud", "english", "literature", "poems", "spoken", "word", "alfred", "lord", "tennyson"]}, {"seriesId": 254921943, "seriesTitle": "Classic Poetry Aloud", "pubDate": 1196836618, "title": "The Old Familiar Faces by Charles Lamb", "author": "Classic Poetry Aloud", "summary": "<img alt=\"itunes pic\" src=\"http://assets.podomatic.net/ts/8f/62/80/classicpoetryaloud/1400x1400_720401.jpg\" /><br />Lamb read by Classic Poetry Aloud:\nhttp://www.classicpoetryaloud.com/\n\nGiving voice to the poetry of the past.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n<b> The Old Familiar Faces </b>\nby Charles Lamb (1775\u20131834)\n \nI have had playmates, I have had companions, \nIn my days of childhood, in my joyful school-days - \nAll, all are gone, the old familiar faces. \n\nI have been laughing, I have been carousing, \nDrinking late, sitting late, with my bosom cronies -  \nAll, all are gone, the old familiar faces. \n\nI loved a Love once, fairest among women: \nClosed are her doors on me, I must not see her - \nAll, all are gone, the old familiar faces. \n\nI have a friend, a kinder friend has no man: \nLike an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly;

  \nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells   \nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more,   \nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees,   \nUntil they think warm days will never cease;   \nFor Summer has o'erbrimm'd their clammy cells.   \n   \nWho hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?   \nSometimes whoever seeks abroad may find   \nThee sitting careless on a granary floor,   \nThy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
