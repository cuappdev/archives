Having grown up in West Virginia and ultimately settling in North Carolina after stints in Los Angeles and Atlanta, Mary shares her experiences of sharing a marriage and family with another woman in the South. We discuss coming out of the closet, the difference between southern cities vs. rural areas, and how draconian parental rights laws affected her family directly. A moment that should have been sacred to her family became a reminder of how backwards things are. It is a story that sincerely and deeply affected all three of us.
