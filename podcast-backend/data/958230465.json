How Logan made his way into the\u00a0wonderful world of venture capital?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2.) So as young chap entering the industry, I would love to hear how you have gone abut trying to build your brand and identity? What are the key personal marketing strategies for you? How important do you think the brand of the VC is? How do you address the juxtaposition of branding and marketing yourself and battery?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3.) How does Logan approach the deal sourcing aspect of the job? What is his approach to this vital thesis?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3.) Moving to more financial matters I want to address both the seed end and the later stage end of the market today. So starting with the seed funding environment, in recent years we have seen a massive drop in the cost of company creation in conjunction with a large rise in seed funding,. What is the effect of this for you as a Series A-B investor, potentially located in what some may call the funding gap?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">4.) You are very much located in the B2B space, d I am intrigued wht kind of ARR do you look for at the stage you are investing and what price point per customer do you believe allows for that ARR metric to be hit within a reasonably short amount of time?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">5.) Moving to the later stages of the market I have seen in a slide of yours from the past that you stated that more institutional investors have made their way into the private markets and startups are staying private longer. You followed up by staying that this is a win win for all? Why do you think that is? Does it not mean later stage VCs are priced out of rounds due to the inflow of public money? Does it not mean later stage startups attain inflated valuation that will only lead to a down round at follow on or IPO?</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Items Mentioned In Today's Episode:</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Logan's Fave Book:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141030917/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;linkCode=as2\" target=\"_blank\">Gang Leader For A Day</a></p>\n<p><strong>Logan's Fave Blog Or Newsletter:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://dan primack term sheet\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Primack: Term Sheet</a></p>\n</div>\n<div>As always you can follow\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJvvSDkdnJAhXF1RoKHScDDbgQFgg2MAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Ftwentyminutevc%3Flang%3Den-gb&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcygppyqTNaiuOUOohQIk-Qg-1jQ&amp;sig2=9e1TPlGzfvKeoqsDfS2u-Q&amp;bvm=bv.109910813,d.d2s\">The Twenty Minute VC</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7sYiRkdnJAhWDqxoKHdr_BfEQFggfMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fharrystebbings%3Flang%3Den-gb&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6KlmFwsIYJkOKRioQuLqGOR0U0w&amp;sig2=Vy0pyYGMg-z0QN61GR7Irw&amp;bvm=bv.109910813,d.d2s\">Harry</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jloganbartlett\" target=\"_blank\">Logan</a>\u00a0on Twitter here!</div>\n<div>If you would like to see a more colourful side to Harry with many a mojito session, you can\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK3-qVntnJAhUDhhoKHbAvDRsQFggfMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fhstebbings1996%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtFYDxBhu0dYWDcFHs06UosnBKzQ&amp;sig2=zn8Xi3s7obc7PQxYfGshNg&amp;bvm=bv.109910813,d.d2s\" target=\"_blank\">follow him on Instagram here!</a></div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>The Twenty Minute VC is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.leesa.com/products/leesa-mattress?utm_source=the-twenty-minute-vc&amp;utm_medium=podcast-ad&amp;utm_campaign=the-twenty-minute-vc&amp;utm_content=all&amp;utm_term=general&amp;referrer=vc\" target=\"_blank\">Leesa</a>, the Warby Parker or TOMS shoes of the mattress industry.

Say the startup really is going well and they are looking to scale and hire, we always hear we need a world beating, world class X?

According to Mattermark, White Star have 38% of your portfolio in mobile, so what are Christians\u00a0views on the evolution of mobile?

Christian\u00a0recently wrote an article: \u2018Hiring For The Future Of Your Company\u2019, so what does he really mean by this?

How did Marvin make his move into technology and the investing game?</p>\n<p>2.) How was Marvin's time at Yahoo? How did Marvin see the company change over the 10 years he was there? How do you feel your position at Yahoo equipped you for 500 Startups?</p>\n<p>3.) So coming from 10 years at Yahoo you could have had your pick of VCs to join. What was it about 500 that attracted you and why do you believe this very early stage is the biggest opportunity to exploit?</p>\n<p>4.) 500 has now ironically invested in 1000+ startups, leading me to ask, what is the admissions process like and what Marvin's\u00a0criteria at 500 for investment decisions? What are the key metrics you look at?</p>\n<p>5.) How does Marvin respond to the notion that investing with 500 Startups removes the talent of investing through the spray and pray method?</p>\n<p>6.) Now 500 Startups has recently raises an new $85m fund, alongside a new fund of $30m for Japan, $10m for South East Asia and a $10m fund for Thailand. So firstly, does this prove that the 500 model is successfully scaling? What does the future hold for 500? Where do you see the most innovation and progress?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Items Mentioned In Today's Episode:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marvin's Fave Book:</strong><a
