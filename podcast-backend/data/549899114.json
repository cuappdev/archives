It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Mark Schaefer, a prolific blogger, author, and speaker. He's written Social Media Explained, The Content Code, and The Tao of Twitter. He's also been a frequent guest on this podcast. His newest book is\u00a0KNOWN: The Handbook for Building and Unleashing Your Personal Brand in the Digital Age.\n\nMark shares how to position yourself as a thought leader.\n\nYou'll discover the four things it takes to become known.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nThought Leadership\nHow Mark Became Known\n\nBefore Mark launched his business, he was\u00a0a global director of ebusiness at a Fortune 100 company. He had won a bunch of awards and had seven patents, a big global team, stock options, and a company car. After he left that job to start his business,\u00a0Mark realized everything that he was known for at his previous company no longer mattered.\u00a0He thought he was known, but he wasn't.\n\nAs Mark grappled with being the go-to guy for nothing, he learned the only thing that matters in terms of your online presence is to be known. Being known isn't about being\u00a0famous, but having\u00a0an appropriate digital presence to help you achieve your goals.\n\n\n\nMark says that building expertise and becoming known is a process. Nine years ago, as Mark\u00a0started to teach and write for his own business, he struggled. Like everyone else, he started at the bottom. For instance, when Mark\u00a0started blogging, he didn't know anything about it. Later on, Mark wrote a book about\u00a0blogging.\u00a0When he\u00a0started consulting, he knew very little about it, but now he consults for\u00a0big companies.\n\nMark emphasizes that to start, you don't have to be an expert. You only\u00a0need to be open and willing to learn continuously.\n\nI ask Mark what helped him become known again in the second phase of his career as he was building his own business. Mark says his goals, one of which was\u00a0speaking at Social Media Marketing World, helped, but enjoying\u00a0the journey was also important because\u00a0becoming known takes time.\n\nMark says some people set milestones that\u00a0unknowingly let\u00a0other people validate their work. However, as he was interviewing known people for his recent book, they often mentioned the positive impact they have on others. Mark believes this sense of mission is\u00a0important because\u00a0it defines who they are from within and motivates them as they put in the time necessary to become\u00a0known.\n\nListen to the show to discover how many years it takes to become known.\n\nWhat Prompted the Book\n\nMark explains the two seeds that led to him write\u00a0KNOWN.\n\n\n\nAs research for his last book, The Content Code, Mark interviewed\u00a0Jay Baer.\u00a0They debated whether just anybody can become known or if you\u00a0need a certain \"it\" factor.\u00a0For three and a half years, this question stayed with Mark and he began wondering whether\u00a0becoming known involved a process that he could define.\n\nThe other seed, Mark explains, came from his\u00a0conversations with\u00a0consulting clients. People from all over the world ask Mark questions like, \"How do I get in a position where I can write a book someday?\" \"How do I get in a position where I can be a speaker someday?\" \"How do I get appointed to a board?\" \"How do I attract more clients in my industry?\" \"How do I become regarded as a voice of authority?\"\n\nMark found himself giving the same answer over and over again: \"To do that, you have to be known.", "duration": "41:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-239-17-03-03.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1487934005, "title": "Video Blogging: How to Create Consistent YouTube Content", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you create videos to promote your business?\n\nHave you considered starting a regular video blog?\n\nTo explore vlogging, I interview Amy Schmittauer.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Amy Schmittauer, an online video expert. She founded Vlog Boss Studios and regularly produces awesome content for her YouTube channel, Savvy Sexy Social. She's also the author of the brand-new book, Vlog Like a Boss: How to Kill It Online with Video Blogging.\n\nAmy explores how video blogging can help your business.\n\nYou'll discover what you need to start your own video blog.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nVlog Like a Boss\nWhat Is Vlogging?\n\n\n\nThe term\u00a0vlog builds off the word blog, and a vlog is simply a blog in video form. In a vlog, you can share\u00a0anything you might do in a blog post, such as\u00a0a tutorial\u00a0or a story from your life.\n\nConsistency is best for vlogging. If you post a\u00a0vlog here and there, you won't gain much traction. Amy says most vlogs that do well have a regular schedule.\n\nI ask Amy about how using YouTube for vlogging is different from the\u00a0other ways people use YouTube. Amy says the purpose of a\u00a0vlog is to\u00a0help people discover you. Videos that may be suitable for YouTube but that don't help people discover you, such as\u00a0a product commercial or an introduction to your company, don't make great\u00a0vlog posts. To be discovered, think of the users who are searching\u00a0for a concern, a specialty, or the answer to a question. Think about what\u00a0a potential customer or audience member might want to know, create a video about the topic, and upload it to YouTube.\n\nListen to the show to discover Amy's thoughts about vlogging on mobile apps like Snapchat and Instagram, which have\u00a0video and social.\n\nAmy's Vlog\n\nWhen Amy launched\u00a0Savvy Sexy Social, she was just getting started as a social media marketer. She thought teaching people the best way to do things on social media would\u00a0to attract an audience and potential clients. She wanted her vlog to be informative and fun. She didn't want social media to feel like a chore.\n\nTo juggle her content marketing with her client work, Amy says she scheduled her vlog posts to appear three days a week\u00a0but she created the week's videos\u00a0all in one day. She would pick three topics (which could be an app, a product, or a general social media tip), record the videos\u00a0sitting in front of her bookshelf, and then edit and schedule them for\u00a0the rest of the week.\n\nAmy emphasizes\u00a0that people didn't have to know who she was to find her videos via search. They just needed to have a question about a\u00a0topic in her videos. For instance, Amy created\u00a0a video about\u00a0a hack to make tweets a little longer. She thought the topic was something new that people didn't know much about, and the video became one of her popular vlog posts. The video's headline\u00a0focused on the Twitter tip but the video also introduced viewers to Amy.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJRp22IXqXY\n\nAmy shares the simple vlog format she used for a long time. She introduced her topic, delivered information about the topic that her viewers would value,\u00a0and gave\u00a0an actionable item that would give them results right away. Then she wrapped\u00a0up with, \"By the way, I'm Amy. Hope you can subscribe and stay tuned.\"\n\nIn the last year, Amy says she's\u00a0been having fun with her format so her community could get to know her a little more personally. For instance, throughout\u00a0January, she documented the journey of\u00a0launching a book. This approach was more of a lifecasting vlog, but her audience was learning through Amy's experience.", "duration": "41:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-238-17-02-24.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1487329228, "title": "How to Use Facebook Ads to Boost Your Best Content", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use Facebook ads?\n\nHave you considered creating Facebook ads from your top-performing organic posts?\n\nTo explore how to identify and boost your best Facebook content, I interview Larry Kim.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Larry Kim, the founder and chief technology officer for WordStream. He's a frequent blogger, pay-per-click expert, and social advertising ninja.\n\nLarry explains how to improve the performance of your best content with Facebook advertising.\n\nYou'll discover how to budget for Facebook ads.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nHow to Use Facebook Ads to Boost Your Best Content\nLarry's Backstory\n\nLarry's company, WordStream, does search engine and social media advertising, and Larry believes\u00a0that it's important for businesses to do both types.\n\nFor instance, B2B software companies build new features, functions, and solutions that nobody is searching for yet. However, with\u00a0social ads, these businesses can\u00a0target people who are likely to buy their software based on demographics, interests, or behaviors.\n\nUnlike an individual advertiser who has data about only one business, Larry is able to spot trends and patterns in online advertising because WordStream manages approximately $1 billion of ad spending across Facebook, Bing, and Google and runs thousands of campaigns for different clients. WordStream analyzes all of these campaigns to figure out data such as the typical cost per click and typical engagement rates.\n\nListen to the show to discover the percentage of WordStream's clients using Facebook advertising.\n\nHow Algorithms Work\n\nTo understand the algorithms, Larry says it's important to think about the context in which your ad appears. (Our conversation focuses on Facebook, but Larry says the same is true for ads on Twitter and other social media platforms.) When you sponsor or promote a post, you're one of\u00a0thousands or even millions of companies going after the same audience. Larry explains that the Facebook algorithm is designed to handle that volume in a way that keeps Facebook engaging for users so they come back.\n\n\n\nTo determine which posts to show users and how much to charge the advertiser, Larry believes\u00a0that the algorithm looks at many different factors, but the main one is engagement (clicks, likes, comments, or shares). A post with low engagement has an engagement rate of 1% to 2%. (Only 1 or 2 people out of 100 engage with the post.) A high-engagement post has a rate of 10% to 15%, and the average is around 2.5% to 3%.\n\nLarry emphasizes that Facebook doesn't want users' news feeds filled with ridiculous updates that no one cares about.\u00a0A\u00a0company trying to promote garbage content with\u00a0low engagement rates will be dinged with very few ad impressions. The ad might not even be\u00a0shown. If the ad\u00a0does show, the click-through rate\u00a0will be expensive (a few dollars per click versus a few cents).\n\nThe reverse is also true. Facebook rewards companies that promote interesting content by showing their ads and charging only\u00a0pennies\u00a0per click.\n\nListen to the show to hear Larry's thoughts about how engaging ad content needs to be compared to organic content.\n\nUnicorns\n\nBecause algorithms reward engaging content, Larry believes that the winning advertising strategy is simple: promote your unicorns. These outlier\u00a0posts do spectacularly well. They get\u00a0three\u00a0to five times more traffic than the average post and are among the top 1% to 3% of your most engaging content.\n\nFor instance, a unicorn post might have a 20% engagement rate,", "duration": "47:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-237-17-02-17.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1486724440, "title": "Instagram Stories: How to Create Engaging Stories", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use Instagram?\n\nWondering how Instagram stories work?\n\nTo explore how to craft Instagram stories for business, I interview Sue B. Zimmerman.\nInstagram Stories\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Sue B. Zimmerman, an Instagram marketing expert who helps businesses and marketers take their Instagram marketing to the next level. She's the author of the Instagram Strategy Guide ebook and a regular speaker at Social Media Marketing World.\n\nSue shares how a number of businesses are creating engaging Instagram stories.\n\nYou'll discover several techniques to improve your own Instagram stories.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nInstagram Stories\nWhy Marketers Should Consider Instagram Stories\n\nSue started using Instagram Stories as soon as the feature rolled out in 2016. She still uses Snapchat, but she says now she mostly relies on Instagram Stories. She says pulling together content to tell a story is creative work, similar to scrapbooking.\n\nSue recommends that you develop a thread that keeps people engaged in your\u00a0story from start to finish. Also, create\u00a0Instagram stories with content that's original to Instagram, rather than duplicating content from other platforms.\n\n\n\nSue says Instagram stories have three main benefits:\n\n \tFirst, Instagram stories direct followers to\u00a0your actual Instagram feed, where your posts are always available. (Instagram stories disappear after\u00a024 hours.)\n \tStories that are entertaining and engaging give your followers a quick and easy way to consume your content.\n \tEngagement is important to the new algorithm that determines what people see in their Instagram feed. Because Instagram stories boost engagement with your Instagram posts, they improve your chances of\u00a0showing up at\u00a0the top of people's news feeds.\n\nListen to the show to discover when Sue\u00a0still uses Snapchat instead of Instagram Stories.\n\nInstagram Stories and Posts\n\nWe talk about the highly produced content that marketers often feature on their Instagram feeds, and Sue says high production value is not necessary for Instagram stories. Sue shares a few examples of businesses that\u00a0use Instagram stories in creative ways. These businesses create stories\u00a0that are different from the content in their regular Instagram feeds.\n\nFor example, Jenny Schatzle,\u00a0who owns a gym in Santa Barbara, uses Instagram stories to let people know when she's starting new sessions.\u00a0Her stories are more like ads, which is a completely different approach than her regular\u00a0posts on Instagram.\n\nSue has also seen companies with products (such as shoe company M.Gemi) use stories to feature sales and direct people to their Instagram feeds.\n\n\n\nSue notes that\u00a0marketers use text differently on Instagram posts and stories. The more successful accounts on Instagram typically\u00a0include the text in the description, not on the photo itself, so people connect\u00a0with\u00a0the experience of the product or service that the photo depicts. However, in an Instagram story, text can add value. People who don't have the volume turned up in the story can read the text on the video or the photo.\n\nI ask how Instagram Stories has changed the way people interact with content on Instagram. Sue shares a few changes she's noticed since the release of Instagram Stories and the algorithm change.\n\nAlthough she's been posting less frequently on Instagram, Sue\u00a0gets more engagement with her posts over a longer period of time. She attributes that engagement to having active\u00a0Instagram stories. People discover Sue through\u00a0her stories, which provide value.", "duration": "46:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-236-17-02-10.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1486119653, "title": "Mobile Local Marketing: Reaching the Mobile Customer", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have a local business?\n\nWant an effective way to market to people who are near you?\n\nTo explore how to reach your customers with mobile marketing, I interview Rich Brooks.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Rich Brooks, author of The Lead Machine: The Small Business Guide to Digital Marketing. He's also host of The Agents of Change podcast and The Agents of Change Digital Marketing Conference.\n\nRich explores how local businesses can use mobile marketing to deliver relevant messaging to their customers.\n\nYou'll discover how to combine mobile marketing with social media.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nMobile Local Marketing\nThe Importance of Mobile\n\nIn 2017, every business should focus\u00a0on mobile, Rich says, especially businesses with\u00a0physical locations and a local audience.\n\nMobile is important because\u00a0people always have their devices by\u00a0their side. For example, when Rich takes his daughter to volleyball practices\u00a0in different towns, he uses Waze on his phone to get directions. Then after dropping her off, he goes to Yelp to find a coffeehouse or asks Google or Siri to find the nearest supermarket so he can go shopping. While he waits in line, Rich explores Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram; plays a game; or reads a news article.\n\n\n\nBecause\u00a0people are always on their phones,\u00a0local businesses can attract customers\u00a0who are looking\u00a0for information on the go and making immediate decisions. If those people are in your area, you can capture their business with a strong mobile presence.\n\nListen to the show for more about how potential customers use mobile.\n\nMobile Offers and SMS Messages\n\nTo engage people on mobile, Rich says you can create mobile offers, which are being redeemed at 10 times the rate of old print coupons.\n\nMobile offers take many forms. You can run a Facebook campaign on mobile, promote\u00a0an\u00a0offer that's available on a mobile device, or tell people they can download a deal onto their phones and show it at the counter. Another option is SMS text messaging.\n\nRich explains that SMS offers\u00a0work a lot like email marketing.\u00a0For example, a pizzeria can send people discounts. A massage therapist near Rich\u00a0gives customers who opt into SMS text messages first dibs on appointment times that open up\u00a0due to last-minute cancellations.\n\nTo send SMS marketing messages, you start by finding\u00a0an SMS marketing vendor in your area. These vendors work similarly to email marketing vendors, such as\u00a0MailChimp, Constant Contact,\u00a0AWeber, and\u00a0smaller local players. Your vendor assigns you a short code and customers opt into your SMS messages by texting that code and confirming they want to receive your messages. Rich says a pizza restaurant might tell customers,\u00a0\"Text Pizza to 004400.\"\n\n\n\nAfter you're set up to send messages, you can start building your SMS marketing list. Rich emphasizes that people will sign up to receive messages only if you offer an incentive for signing up. For a pizza business, that incentive might be\u00a0a dollar off, a free topping, or free delivery.\u00a0Rich suggests promoting your SMS list\u00a0on your social media profiles, website,\u00a0flyers, and\u00a0product\u00a0packaging\u00a0(such as pizza boxes).\n\nRich says you can expect a smaller but more engaged audience for your SMS messages. Fewer people will opt in, but right now those who do are much more likely to look at their text\u00a0messages immediately. Rich predicts that engagement with SMS messages may drop off if people become overwhelmed with text messages, but says that currently SMS is still fairly new and can be a boon to a local business.", "duration": "43:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-235-17-02-03.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1485514832, "title": "Content Marketing Success: Why Answering Questions Sells", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want more sales?\n\nIs content marketing a part of your strategy?\n\nTo explore how to create content that sells, I interview Marcus Sheridan.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He's known as \"The Sales Lion,\" and is the author of the brand-new book, They Ask You Answer: A Revolutionary Approach to Inbound Sales, Content Marketing, and Today's Digital Consumer.\n\nMarcus explores how to market and sell with content.\n\nYou'll discover how the right content can overcome buyers' fears.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nContent Marketing Success\nMarcus' Story\n\nMarcus began learning about content marketing during the 2008 market crash. Within 48 hours, his swimming pool business, River Pools, lost a quarter of a million dollars after five clients pulled their deposits. By January 2009, three consultants had suggested filing for bankruptcy. However, if Marcus filed, he and his partners would lose their homes and their\u00a016 employees would lose their jobs.\n\nMarcus knew he had to generate more trust, traffic, leads, and sales than ever, and he had no money to do it. So he looked at the Internet. Marcus\u00a0read all about inbound marketing, content, and blogging. He learned that\u00a0addressing\u00a0his prospects'\u00a0questions, issues, fears, worries, and concerns on the business\u00a0website\u00a0could help the\u00a0business be successful.\n\nIn March 2009, Marcus told\u00a0his two business partners that\u00a0the company needed to live by a new philosophy: \"They Ask. You Answer.\" Marcus brainstormed all of the questions he'd ever been asked and found that the major questions were often ones businesses don't like to answer online.\n\nCommitted to the new philosophy, however, Marcus began writing blog posts about customers' questions, including the good, the bad, and the ugly. The company became\u00a0committed to answering questions more consistently and transparently than anybody in their space.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to discover how this new approach transformed the website's\u00a0traffic, leads, and sales.\n\nOnline Content Overload\n\nNow that many websites have taken the same approach to content that Marcus did, I ask Marcus what advice he would give to any business owner\u00a0concerned that approaches\u00a0to website content have changed.\n\nMarcus says he's really bothered when businesses assume they shouldn't share their philosophies or content because they think everything\u00a0has already been said. Those businesses are letting other people in their industry create the content.\n\nBusiness leaders also think they shouldn't share content because their content isn't amazing. Marcus disagrees and notes\u00a0that initially his writing and video content were\u00a0bad.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Holly Homer, a professional blogger whose Kids Activities Blog helps parents discover fun things to do with their kids. Her Facebook page (Quirky Momma) has more than 3 million fans.\n\nHolly shares how she's cultivated a thriving community using Facebook.\n\nYou'll discover how Holly uses Facebook Insights to develop her content.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nFacebook Community Development\nThe Importance of Community\n\nCommunity is the key to performing well in the algorithm-driven world of Facebook.\n\nTo serve the community of Kids Activities Blog and the Quirky Momma Facebook page, all of the content focuses on the people who make up that community. Those people are mostly moms (plus the occasional dad, grandparent, or teacher) who are looking for something to do with their small children and survive the day.\n\nWhether that content is a video, picture, or saying, it needs to help the community and\u00a0bring people closer together.\n\n\n\nWhen Holly began blogging 10 years ago, the community developed\u00a0via\u00a0comments on\u00a0her personal blog, June Cleaver Nirvana, as well as comments she made on her friends' blogs. A popular blog post might attract 300 visitors and 150 comments. Holly recalls that commenting made this community visible and close-knit.\n\nWhen social networks came along, Holly says she had to relearn how to establish community, so she steered the conversation from\u00a0comments onto Facebook because that's where comments and engagement were happening. She had to tell her community where she would be engaging and eventually turned off the comments on her blog.\n\nFacebook Live changed Holly's community again. She says she can now talk directly to her fans, but Facebook Live allows her to have more of a two-way\u00a0conversation and be a participant rather than the center of her community.\n\nListen to the show to hear Holly's advice for maintaining a community as social media changes.\n\nFacebook Insights\n\nHolly is a bit of an analytics geek and uses Facebook Insights learn about her community and what they like. With Facebook Insights, Holly can learn what common traits her community shares (they're typically moms with small children), where they live (mostly the United States and Australia), when they're online, and what they do online.\n\nHolly says she can also see what types of content her community likes (such as photos, links, or videos) and even what kinds\u00a0of links or videos attract the most engagement. What Holly\u00a0learns in Facebook Insights helps her decide what type of content brings her community together.\n\n\n\nIn Facebook Insights, Holly says she mostly focuses on the magical orange bar. This bar\u00a0shows each post's reach in comparison to other content for that day or other content on the page. (You find the orange bar by clicking\u00a0More under the list of posts to get a whole page of posts\u00a0and then looking in the fifth column.)\n\nHolly says her team knows that if the orange bar is short, don't repeat that content. If the orange bar is long, try to figure out how to repeat the performance of that successful content. For Holly, a short orange bar doesn't mean that the proverbial algorithms didn't like some content. It means her fans didn't like the\u00a0content.\u00a0She says every single interaction on your page is a vote for more of that content.", "duration": "45:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-233-17-01-20.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1484305204, "title": "Building a Business on the Back of Interviews", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you interview people for your blog or podcast?\n\nWant to discover different ways to repurpose those interviews?\n\nTo explore how he built his business through expert interviews, I interview Nathan Chan.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Nathan Chan, the founder, CEO, and publisher of Foundr Magazine, a paid digital magazine that profiles well-known entrepreneurs. He's built a huge following of\u00a0almost 1 million Instagram fans and 300,000 email subscribers.\n\nHe's also launched a new book, Foundr V1.0: Everything you need to know about starting and building a successful business, from the world's most influential entrepreneurs.\n\nNathan shares his interviewing process.\n\nYou'll discover how Nathan used expert interviews to build his business.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nBuilding a Business on the Back of Interviews\nThe Start of Foundr\n\nIn 2013, Nathan was working in IT support at a travel company. He loved the company culture, but the work wasn't a fit. As he searched\u00a0for something more fulfilling to do, he noticed that the major business magazines, of which he was a fan, were difficult\u00a0for him to relate to. His life wasn't like the lives of\u00a0the people on a\u00a0Forbes\u00a0billionaire list.\n\nNathan started his magazine with\u00a0about\u00a0$3,000 and a goal of filling the\u00a0gap between major business magazine content and entrepreneurs like himself.\u00a0He wanted to speak to\u00a0aspiring young entrepreneurs (he was 26 years old at the time) and provide in-depth content about what it takes to build a successful business.\n\nNathan says that podcasts inspired this\u00a0vision for his magazine, too. Podcasts were becoming increasingly popular, featured stories about relatable people, and could cover a topic in depth.\n\n\n\nFour months into producing the magazine, Nathan and his startup magazine faced\u00a0a major roadblock. A large business magazine sued Nathan's\u00a0startup magazine for trademark infringement. Luckily, Nathan says, the rebranding of the magazine resulted in the name Foundr, which is a better fit.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about how\u00a0Nathan responded to the lawsuit by\u00a0improving the\u00a0magazine's branding.\n\nThe Business Model\n\nFoundr has three main sources of revenue: magazine subscriptions, the membership site, and courses.\u00a0The magazine subscription is $2.99/month or $21.99/year\u00a0and is available through the iTunes and Google Play stores. Across monthly and yearly subscriptions, Foundr has\u00a020,000 monthly readers.\n\nOn the Foundr\u00a0membership site, subscribers have access to\u00a0premium content, an online\u00a0community, and exclusive training. In addition to the main revenue sources, Foundr includes a\u00a0bit of sponsorship and advertising.\n\nListen to the show to discover the similarities between what Nathan and I do.\n\nNathan's Interviewing Process\n\nNathan has interviewed successful entrepreneurs including Richard Branson, founder of Virgin; Steve Case, founder of AOL; Arianna Huffington, founder of Huffington Post; Gary Vaynerchuk; Barbara Corcoran; Tim Ferriss; Robert Herjavec; Jessica Livingston, founder of Y Combinator; and others.\n\nMuch of Nathan's interview preparation involves his day-to-day reading about and listening to the topics, brands, and people Foundr covers. He regularly\u00a0looks at\u00a0Facebook, reads what's happening in TechCrunch and Mashable, and follows podcasts to see what they're doing and whom they're interviewing. To help find guests, he looks for people who have\u00a0books coming out or otherwise\u00a0need press.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Brian Fanzo, a tech evangelist who specializes in live video. He's the founder of iSocialFanz and host of the FOMOFanz podcast.\n\nBrian explores live video, where it's headed, and how it can help your business.\n\nYou'll discover whether to use Facebook Live or Periscope if you're just getting started.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nLive Video and Marketing\nWhat Live Video Means for Business\n\nWhether yours is a small business, a brick-and-mortar store, or an ecommerce company, you need to shrink the distance between yourself and your customer, Brian explains. Live video is much more than a marketing play because it shrinks that distance by humanizing your brand and business.\n\nLive video is also the gateway to technologies such as\u00a0augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality\u00a0(VR), which Brian believes will be huge by 2020. To embrace AR and VR, he says, companies and\u00a0brands will need to have a live video strategy already in place.\n\nHe says today's consumers want you to convince them that you can be trusted, that you're a resource, are invested in them, and can understand them. They don't want to be marketed or sold to; they want to engage and have a conversation with you. Businesses need to spend time\u00a0building rapport, a relationship, and trust with their audience, and live video is a great vehicle for that.\n\n\n\nWith regard to building trust, Brian believes the most valuable statement anyone can make on live video is, \"I don't know.\" If a brand admits they don't know something on live video, it adds validity to what they do know. (When you're stumped, you can also ask audience members to send you a message on Twitter or Facebook, and say you'll have your product manager get back to them.)\n\nListen to the show to hear more about the strategy behind using live video to break down barriers with your audience.\n\nGetting Started With Live Video\n\nBrian says that according to Cisco, 79% of Internet traffic in 2020 will be video. Nowhere did anyone say that's going to be great video, good video, or live video, Brian continues. However, he believes most brands are thinking about video.\n\nMany people think live video is scary because they picture themselves on the video. Brian has to remind them that the best live videos are often made\u00a0when you're celebrating customers and employees. And if your live video brings people access they can't get anywhere else, the camera doesn't even need to be on you.\n\nFor example, say you use live video to interview a client, a customer, or a celebrity while they're in the office. As\u00a0the person behind the camera, you can watch the comments for questions and decide which are important enough to ask the guest.\u00a0With these kinds of live videos, all of the scary elements of being on air are taken away.\n\nListen to the show to discover my process for doing\u00a0live videos.\n\nInnovative Examples of Live Video\n\nBrian says Cisco has done an amazing job\u00a0with their\u00a0We Are Cisco\u00a0campaign.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Pat Flynn, the founder of SmartPassiveIncome.com, a website dedicated to helping people start businesses.

On the blog, Pat shared how he'd built his business, things he wished he would have done, and mistakes he made.\n\nIn October 2008, he\u00a0started including income reports (how many products he sold and how much money he made), not to show off but to provide inspiration. Pat believes that by\u00a0keeping people in the loop of his activities and leading by example, others benefit from his knowledge.\n\n\n\nOver time, the Smart Passive Income blog became more about experimenting with new tactics, documenting, and sharing what Pat\u00a0learned along the way. Pat says that's how he became known as the crash test dummy of online business.\n\nBack in 2008, if you had told Pat that he would be a leader in this space, he says he would have laughed. He didn't think that was what he wanted. Now Pat is owning the role, trying to lead by example and starting a movement of authentic entrepreneurship.\n\nListen to the show to hear Pat explain more about crash test dummies.\n\nNurturing Fans in the Early Days\n\nWhile\u00a0Pat got a lot of encouragement via the comments on his blog for the first couple of years, he never thought of those commenters as fans. Then in July 2010, he started his podcast. Later that year, strangers came up to him at a conference and chatted like they were old friends. Nobody at the conference mentioned his blog.\n\nPat thinks his fans connected more through the podcast rather\u00a0than his blog because they viewed the podcast as\u00a0more real.\u00a0He explains that the written word\u00a0gives you a feel for who a person is, but a podcast puts you in the ears of your listeners. For listeners,\u00a0the feeling is similar to being part of\u00a0a conversation.\n\nPat says he's very much himself on air, and shares personal tidbits in each episode to help his audience relate to and connect with him.\u00a0For example, at the beginning of every show, Pat's voiceover guy John Melley (who does our intros in a different accent) reads a random fun fact about Pat. For example, \"Here's your host. He's a Sagittarius who loves long walks on the beach: Pat Flynn.\" or \"Here's your host. He was an 11-pound, 12-ounce baby.\"\n\n\n\nPat says he once met a woman at a conference who told him she loved his show and randomly added, \"When I had my baby, he was also a giant.\" That\u00a0small fact immediately connected them, because she could relate.\n\nWhen you share fun little facts about yourself, Pat notes, people can find something they have in common with you and decide to follow you. This isn't true only for podcasts; the same thing can happen on your blog or your video channel.\n\nListen to the show to discover Pat's thoughts on using\u00a0video versus a podcast to connect with people.\n\nBeing Yourself", "duration": "51:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-230-16-12-30.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1482490824, "title": "Advanced Blogging: How to Make Your Blog Serve Your Business", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have a blog?\n\nWant to supercharge your content and increase email subscribers?\n\nTo explore advanced techniques for improving blog content, collecting more email addresses, and promoting products and events, I interview Darren Rowse.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Darren Rowse, one of the world's leading experts on blogging. He's the founder of two popular blogs: Digital Photography School and ProBlogger. He also co-authored the book ProBlogger and hosts the ProBlogger podcast.\n\nDarren shares\u00a0how he learned to better serve the needs of his readers.\n\nYou'll discover how Darren uses portal pages and what goes into creating them.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nAdvanced Blogging\nDetermine What Type of Content to\u00a0Create\n\nDarren started by writing what he was excited about in the moment, and he believes\u00a0that's a great place for\u00a0bloggers to start because their writing comes across as passionate. However, for bloggers to build expertise in a niche, he notes, they\u00a0need to put more thought into it. Darren says there are two parts to achieving that outcome.\n\nFirst, you need to understand the people who read your blog and what their needs are. Ultimately, Darren's content ideas come from the conversations he has with readers; this determines what he writes about.\n\nSecond, you should develop before and after avatars. The before avatar represents who his readers are when they come to the blog, and the after avatar represents who he wants his readers to become. Use your avatars to fill in what your readers need to move\u00a0from the before avatar to the after avatar, he explains.\n\nFor example, readers first come to the Digital Photography School blog because they don't know how to use their cameras to full potential. The \"after\" readers have full creative control of their cameras, along with the confidence, knowledge, and technical skills to get out of automatic mode and take their photography to the next level. Give them\u00a0what they want and sell them what they need.\n\nFor example, readers who come\u00a0to Darren's blog to get photography tips realize they need more help when they\u00a0return from\u00a0vacation and discover their photos didn't reflect their journey. His\u00a0ebook, A Guide to Captivating Travel Photography: Transcending Travel, delivers\u00a0the things they didn't realize they didn't know, such as tips to help lift their photos.\n\n\n\nDarren used this exercise for the first time in 2006, and came up with 200 things his blog readers needed to know. Those notations became the\u00a0first 200 posts on the site.\n\nListen to the show to discover how Darren uses what he knows about what people need to collect email\u00a0subscribers, attract Facebook fans, sell products, and more.\n\nDevelop an Editorial Strategy\n\nDarren shares the nine different elements he and his team work through each year to figure out their editorial strategy.\n\n \tVoice: Is your content more\u00a0conversational, teaching, or storytelling?\n \tEvergreen vs. Time-sensitive Content: What's the proper ratio? Darren's photography blog leans more toward evergreen, but he notes others may need to create more\u00a0time-sensitive content.\n \tIntent: Is your aim to inform, inspire, educate, or interact? Darren's blogs focus on information and education, but mix in inspirational and interactive\u00a0content here and there. As an example of content created to\u00a0drive interaction, Darren says Digital Photography School does a challenge post\u00a0each week in which they prompt readers to take photos using a specific technique and then share the photos in the comments.", "duration": "42:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-229-16-12-23.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1481886024, "title": "How Snapchat and Periscope Can Grow a Business", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want to use Snapchat for business?\n\nWondering how to incorporate your brand into live stories?\n\nTo explore how to use Periscope and Snapchat for business, I interview John Kapos.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Even though he was told he's \"too old\" for Snapchat, he decided to take a chance.\n\nJohn, a self-described early adopter, started on Facebook and then got involved with\u00a0Instagram. While he felt Instagram was cleaner, nicer, and crisper, he\u00a0loved the functionality of Snapchat. For example, it let him\u00a0do a video and include titles, add music, and so on.\n\nIn\u00a0the beginning, John posted photos of customers and chocolate, as well as videos of him introducing himself and making treats.\n\nIn one of those early promos, he posted a picture and told his followers to screenshot it and then come in for a free hot chocolate. Two people did just that, and John shares that he's had as many as 60 people come to the store in response to a similar promotion.\n\n\n\nNow, John explains, his Snapchat stories all have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and all have a tie to chocolate. Each story also has a call to action such as Come to Perfection Chocolates, Come to the website, Come to meet me, or Be part of the party.\n\nFor example, a\u00a0Snapchat promotion of his Star Wars chocolate products\u00a0began with an image of Han Solo\u00a0and the text, \"I'm in a dilemma.

However, John doesn't think that should make a difference, and shares that he's helped a dentist create funny stories that make children want to come and see him, and a mechanic in New Zealand build a story around how to change a tire.\n\nJohn reiterates that anyone can create stories with any product, they just have to step out of the box.\n\nFor example, he explains,\u00a0spotting a large chocolate Easter egg in his store inspired a Snapchat video\u00a0about two chocolate rabbits that mated to produce a 10-pound chocolate egg, out of which came a\u00a0white chocolate elephant.\n\n\n\nJohn also creates\u00a0stories about his characters, Johnny Chocolate, a chocolate 'dealer'; Johnny's bodyguard, Frankie; and Johnny's drag-queen girlfriend, Vanilla Chocolate.\n\nListen to the show to hear what happened when John set out to prove he could go a week without using chocolate in his snaps.", "duration": "39:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-228-16-12-16.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1481281216, "title": "The Social Media Examiner Story: From Blog to Conference", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Wonder how the Social Media Examiner blog got started?\n\nInterested in how we grew a live conference from an online publication?\n\nTo share the evolution of Social Media Examiner and Social Media Marketing World, Ray Edwards will interview me.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

I started covering social media and how it\u00a0could be used to generate more leads for white papers.\n\nSubsequently, I reached out to Copyblogger and MarketingProfs, and wrote some articles for them. The turning point came\u00a0after\u00a0I sent a LinkedIn request to Ann Handley, chief content officer for MarketingProfs, and she asked if I was on Facebook.\u00a0After opening\u00a0a Facebook account, I was immersed in a different world.\n\n\n\nThen, I went to a small conference in San Diego and met Paul Colligan, Warren Whitlock\u00a0(co-author of Twitter Revolution), and Mari Smith.\n\nAs a result, I decided to do an online conference under my white paper business. (Up to that point I did teleclasses, where people would pay $39/month to hear me interview people like Bob Bly, Peter Bowerman, and\u00a0others in the copywriting world.) I sold a couple of hundred tickets for the Copywriting Success Summit, more than I ever had for my teleclasses, and the conference was all done via webinars.\n\nThis led to doing the Social Media Success Summit, for which we sold around 700 tickets.\n\nI felt I was onto something, so I searched domain names at GoDaddy, found SocialMediaExaminer.com, and immediately registered a trademark.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak at BlogWorld and MarketingProf's B2B Summit in October 2009. Deciding that would be the time to launch, I hustled to build Social Media Examiner and reached out to all of my friends, asking if they would write one article a month until it didn't work for them anymore.\n\n\n\nI officially launched Social Media Examiner on October 12, 2009.\n\nListen to the show to learn which connections Ray and I share from the early days of social media.\n\nA Focus on Quality Content\n\nWhen\u00a0we launched, blogs were opinion outlets and I wanted to be a resource. That's why we're known for how-to content and why our tagline is still \"Your guide to the social media jungle.\" I knew if we could create content with a certain level of depth or richness to it, it would be smart in the long run; each of our articles is at least 1,000 words long.\n\nAnd we've invested heavily in the quality of our content. We've always had at least two or three, and sometimes up to five, editors working on all of the articles and we put at least $1,000 into development for each article. Our vision statement is, \"All we serve is quality and we serve all with excellence.\"\n\n\n\nI've been in this business for seven years, and almost everyone who started in this space has\u00a0moved on.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Sunny Lenarduzzi, a video marketing expert. Previously she was a TV news reporter and the host of the Social Update from Hootsuite. Now she produces regular videos focused on social media, creates online courses, and helps her clients find success with YouTube.\n\nSunny Lenarduzzi shares insights from creating her own business on YouTube.\n\nYou'll discover how to use social media to drive traffic to your YouTube channel.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nHow to Grow a Business With\u00a0YouTube\nSunny's Story\n\nSunny has a background in traditional media (broadcasting, television, and radio), but fell in love with social media in the early days of Facebook and Twitter.\n\nShe started an online magazine and after building the\u00a0brand organically using YouTube and other social media platforms, she ended up with\u00a0a social media consulting business.\n\nWhen Sunny noticed she was routinely getting the same questions from her clients (such as how to build a Twitter following or how to use Instagram video), she started using YouTube FAQ to record and send the answers to clients. Her first video tutorial\u00a0now has almost\u00a080,000 views.\n\nToday, her channel (started in March 2015) has amassed over 60,000 subscribers and 3.8 million video views.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D7qmseGz6o\n\nListen to the show to learn more about how Sunny came to partner with Hootsuite on the Social Update.\n\nThe Path Between\u00a0YouTube Videos and Business\n\nIt's all the about email addresses. The biggest thing to remember, Sunny says, is that YouTube is a social media platform. She reminds listeners that social media algorithms change and you can't always rely on social media reach to get your message out. That's where an email list comes in, and she notes that YouTube is vital to growing your email list.\n\nFor example, Sunny created a tutorial on How to Get More Views on YouTube, in which she offers a free YouTube SEO checklist. Every week, she gains about 200 email subscribers from that one video.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LokwDpM1wnc\n\nSunny explains\u00a0the importance of helping your videos rank on page one\u00a0of Google and YouTube search, and shares that\u00a0the first 24 hours of a video's life are vital in determining where the video will rank. For this reason, when she has a new video, she spends that first day driving people directly to the video on YouTube.\n\nSunny credits getting ranked on the first page of Google or YouTube search results with the\u00a0growth of her business over\u00a0the past year. People found her videos when they were searching for help on certain topics such as how to use Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, etc.\n\nAnswering questions related to these topics introduces her to potentially thousands of new people a day, and capturing the email addresses of those people grows her potential customer database.\n\nSunny shares that she uses a customized Leadpages link, designed in the same branding as her website, to collect her leads.\n\n\n\nSunny says to\u00a0create your freebie based on what you eventually want to sell. Make it a guide, a checklist, or an ebook.\n\nIf writing isn't your strong suit, there are other options to use for the freebie, such as audio training or short video courses.

She left school and moved\u00a0home.\n\nJasmine knew she didn't want to go back to law school and decided to give photography a try. For Christmas, her husband gave her her first digital camera and she started her wedding photography business. When her\u00a0business exploded that first year, it helped her identify as an entrepreneur.\n\nJasmine joined Instagram six years ago but says\u00a0she used it\u00a0haphazardly\u00a0until just\u00a0a few years ago. When she\u00a0learned how to use Instagram strategically as a\u00a0marketing vehicle for her business, it was a game-changer.\u00a0Since then, she's been named one of the top 10 wedding photographers\u00a0and one of the most influential photographers, which she believes is due to her varied and intentional use of Instagram and other social media platforms.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to discover\u00a0more of\u00a0Jasmine's backstory and why she believes she was called to live a passionate life.\n\nWhy\u00a0Instagram Works for Selling\n\nJasmine shares one of her favorite quotes from author Simon Sinek, \"People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.\" In her opinion, there's no better platform than Instagram to showcase why you do something.\n\nShe believes Instagram's powerful storytelling components give you the ability to make customers loyal before a purchase has been made.\u00a0If you can tell a powerful story in fewer than 87 characters (the caption limit), along with a photo that matches and elevates the storytelling component, you'll win at Instagram.\n\nListen to the show to learn what Jasmine says makes Instagram different from other platforms.\n\nHow to Get Seen\u00a0on Instagram\n\nIt's no secret that people are seeing the effects of the Instagram algorithm on their visibility in the news feed, and that's why Jasmine says it's more important to build an audience of\u00a0the right kind of followers than to collect followers just to increase your numbers.\n\nVisibility in the news feed\u00a0comes from having engaged followers who care about your business, leave comments and likes, tag their friends, and share your posts. An account\u00a0with a lot of followers who aren't engaged won't be indexed high by the algorithm. This results in fewer people seeing that account's posts, which then results in fewer people liking and commenting.\n\n\n\nSo, all things being equal, if one account has 200 followers and another has 2,000 followers, and each account routinely gets 20 likes and two comments, the account with fewer followers is more likely to be seen, because it's\u00a0perceived as more relevant.\n\nTo build an audience of\u00a0the right followers, Jasmine suggests creating an ideal client profile. Figure out where your ideal client is\u00a0on Instagram and why, she says. Then figure out how to serve the people\u00a0who follow you.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Yaro Starak, a blogging expert who specializes in helping people turn their blogs into profitable businesses. He's the author of the ebook\u00a0Blog Profits Blueprint. Yaro also is an expert in building automated email sales funnels.\n\nYaro shares what you need to know to build successful email sales funnels that sell for you.\n\nYou'll discover how to create a successful automated email sequence.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nEmail Sales Funnels\nYaro's Backstory\n\nYaro discovered blogging in 2004 after someone suggested he start a blog for his editing company. While many\u00a0bloggers were spending a lot of time writing content, Yaro knew of people who generated $30,000 using\u00a0email.\n\nTo avoid becoming one of those bloggers who was trapped writing 20 posts a day and to automate the sales process for his course, Yaro built what he now calls a blog sales funnel.\n\n\n\nHe\u00a0set up a series of blog posts to go to his email newsletter once a week for 52 weeks. Then at intervals throughout the email delivery process, he would include a sales message for his course. Yaro notes that it took him six months to write a year's worth of messages, so he recommends starting smaller.\n\nHe's spent the last few years building and perfecting his process.\n\nListen to the show to discover when and why Yaro first went online.\n\nHow an Email Sales Funnel Works\n\nEmail sales funnels deliver sequenced pieces of content\u00a0to anyone who\u00a0opts in, Yaro explains. When automated, those emails (autoresponders) let marketers deliver trust, educate, and sell their product on autopilot.\n\n\n\nBusinesses have customers at different levels of interest, he points out. Some people are ready to buy a $30 ebook but aren't ready to invest $1,000 in a course. Some want to purchase everything you offer, while others just want to explore your free information.\n\nAfter you set up an email sales funnel, it automatically meets the needs of all of those different people. As each person goes through the email sequence and various product offers, they\u00a0self-select to enter the next sales level.\n\nYaro now markets\u00a0a range of ebooks, his membership site, and a flagship course. Because he set up a range of email sequences to market each one, he's free to spend his time blogging and doing podcasts.\u00a0When someone new discovers\u00a0him via a blog post or a podcast, his sales funnel automatically goes to work.\n\nListen to the show to hear Yaro discuss\u00a0the old-school way of doing email newsletters.\n\nExamples of Successful Email Funnels\n\nYaro shares that he uses an event-based direct selling launch sequence, similar to that of the Jeff Walker school of marketing, to sell his flagship course. The launch\u00a0includes a series of free videos and a free copy of his Blog Profits Blueprint report. At the end of the launch, he delivers an offer\u00a0to join his course.\n\nTo automate that process, he's set up an email sequence that's triggered when someone visits his site and opts to receive a copy of the Blog Profits Blueprint report. Once people opt in, they receive\u00a0a series of video trainings over three weeks via an automated email sequence. On the fourth week, he invites people to enter his course.\n\nComparing the two processes, Yaro says it's not necessarily changing the way you sell; it's applying automation to create a more hands-off business process.", "duration": "48:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-224-16-11-18.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1478862008, "title": "Facebook Live: Fuel All of Your Content With Live Video", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you broadcast on Facebook Live?\n\nWant to discover how to use your videos to create more content?\n\nTo explore why Facebook Live is a path to success for creators, I interview Chalene Johnson.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Since\u00a0that time, she's done many videos and discovered\u00a0the more she relaxed, the better she could connect with her audience, whether it was for fitness or business.\n\nChalene first broadcast live on Periscope in the summer of 2015. She\u00a0remembers it well because it was also the day she was hacked. Chalene stresses there's no correlation between the two events. You can listen to Episode 158 of this podcast for the backstory.\n\nWhen she\u00a0got early access to Facebook Live, Chalene\u00a0went live\u00a0and applied what she'd learned on Periscope.

The calendar is set\u00a0around the promotion of the Virtual Business Academy, the Marketing Impact Academy, and Smart Success. Eighty percent of the content for each\u00a0Live broadcast relates to the upcoming\u00a0promotion, so it attracts the people interested in the related product. Currently, she's promoting Smart Success.\n\n\n\nChalene aims to go live a couple of times each week. She's noticed that the longer she broadcasts, the better the video does in terms of reach and live viewers. Often, she plans\u00a0to go live\u00a0for 15 minutes but ends up broadcasting for\u00a0an hour.\n\nChalene's Live prep starts when she wakes up at 5:45 AM. She spends the first hour of her day in learning mode focusing on a certain topic. She then finds a way to relate what she's studying to the product she's promoting.\n\nFor example, since\u00a0she's studying the neuroscience behind behavior, discipline, and habits, she'll do a\u00a0Live broadcast about developing good habits, which ties into her promotion of Smart Success.\u00a0To prepare, Chalene writes down a proposed title, five bulleted discussion points, and any research or stats she wants to reference.\n\n\n\nShe describes how to start a broadcast and in which order to share information.\n\nIn the first 10 seconds, tell people what you're talking about and why they need to stay tuned.", "duration": "54:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-223-16-11-11.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1478253649, "title": "Conversion Optimization: How to Split Test Your Way to Success", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Want to get more leads and subscribers?\n\nHave you considered optimizing your opt-in forms?\n\nTo explore conversion rate optimization for your online forms, I interview Chris Dayley.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

The company he worked for was trying to figure out how to monetize their\u00a0traffic because they were having a hard time getting visitors to convert.\n\nBecause no one at the company knew about conversion rate optimization, Chris picked it up as a pet project.\n\nWhen he first proposed to test some changes to the site design, there was a lot of pushback from the site designers. After he ran his first round of tests, some of the pages began to see 10% to 15% lifts in conversion.\n\nHe fell in love with finding out how\u00a0seemingly small changes could have a big impact on user behavior.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to hear the company's initial reaction to testing and the results they got from it.\n\nConversion Rate Optimization and Why It Matters\n\nChris explains that\u00a0conversion rate optimization is a scientific way to figure out what your audience wants to see on your website in order to convert, and he notes that it should be half of any digital marketer's focus.\n\nDriving traffic is only half the battle. While he used to assume that if he drove good traffic to a site, it was going to convert, years of testing have shown\u00a0that a large portion of your audience won't convert unless you give them the experience they're seeking.\n\n\n\nConversion rate optimization is a way of testing different concepts and ideas on your site to find out what your audience actually wants to see.\n\nListen to the show to discover why we use conversion rate optimization at Social Media Examiner and the effect it's had on our marketing.\n\nWhere to Start Testing Opt-in Forms\n\nWhen doing form optimization, whether it's opt-in, lead generation, or checkout forms, the first things to look at are imagery, color, and font sizes. Make sure your form stands out in contrast to the page and that the image or lack of image is helping your users, Chris says.\n\nChris recommends trying different variations of images, and to make sure the concepts are different, aren't distracting, and add some context to the offer.\n\nFor example, in Social Media Examiner's previous pop-up, there was no image, even though our provider\u00a0OptinMonster\u00a0and\u00a0other web-based form providers such as\u00a0LeadPages\u00a0allow you to include\u00a0an image. Chris recommended testing an image of the cover\u00a0of the actual product on offer, a graphic representation of the title, and an icon representation\u00a0(shown in the image below.)\n\n\n\nThe icon came out as the winner by a long shot!\n\nWhen asked about how many elements to test at a time, Chris advises different approaches for different projects. There are basically four elements in an opt-in form: the\u00a0headline, content, a potential image, and a button to opt in. With so few elements, each one\u00a0will\u00a0have a huge role in the conversion rate, and it's easy to separate them out and test them one at ...", "duration": "42:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-222-16-11-04.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1477648853, "title": "360 Video for Marketers: What You Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Have you tried producing 360 video?\n\nWant to discover how to create immersive, sharable 360 video?\n\nTo explore how marketers can use 360 video, I interview Ryan Anderson Bell.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

From there, Ryan went\u00a0from\u00a0playing with the big ball of GoPros to more finished, all-inclusive products, like the Samsung Gear 360's two\u00a04K cameras.\n\nhttpv://youtu.be/TckqNdrdbgk\n\nHe's now a 360 filmmaker, trying to define how to tell a\u00a0story and convey a message through the medium (whether that's from a personal or brand perspective).\n\nListen to the show to hear our memories of virtual reality in the 1990s.\n\nWhy Marketers Should Consider 360 Video\n\nRyan explains that being an early adopter of 360 video means you're going to understand the language before the public does. Marketers can use that\u00a0language to connect with intimacy and empathy.\n\nYour brand can have an impact on the masses in a way that's not been done before, because in a 360 video, the\u00a0experience you provide in your message is more\u00a0real to the viewer. You can share scale and scope with a canvas that's so big, it takes over everything.\n\nListen to the show to learn\u00a0my perspective on the benefits of 360 video for marketers.\n\nWhat You Can Do With 360 Video\n\nWhen asked for real-world examples of uses for 360 video, Ryan points to HBO's showcase of\u00a0Westworld at TechCrunch Disrupt\u00a0this year, and TOMS\u00a0Shoes' Virtual Giving Trip\u00a0last year. Both used 360 video to immerse the viewer in an experience.\n\nhttpv://youtu.be/jz5vQs9iXCs\n\nRyan agrees that restaurants can show what the kitchen atmosphere is like during prime time, and events or conferences can share all kinds of experiences in 360. He goes on to share that real estate agents can even use a 360\u00a0real estate app\u00a0from Zillow\u00a0to showcase properties for sale or rent.\n\nCauses such as\u00a0ERASE\u00a0Child Trafficking documentary can also take advantage of 360 video to share different narratives from the perspectives of characters in the film.\n\nListen to the show to hear more about Ryan's documentary.\n\nWhere to Publish 360 Video\n\nWhile there are some small places like Zeality or Oculus where you can publish 360 video, Ryan says the best platforms for marketers are likely YouTube and Facebook.

Her blog, JennsTrends.com, has placed in our top social media blogs three years in a row. She also wrote an ebook called,\u00a0How to Run a Successful Instagram Ad.\n\nJenn explores the differences and similarities between Facebook and Instagram ads.\n\nYou'll discover how you can succeed with Instagram ads.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nInstagram Ads\nHow Jenn Got Into Instagram\n\nJenn admits she was a late adopter of Instagram and started on the platform just a few years ago. She held off because, like many people, she felt she didn't have time for another\u00a0social media platform.\n\nEventually, Jenn\u00a0decided she needed to understand Instagram marketing for her blog, so she set up an account, tried\u00a0it out, and fell in love with the community engagement on Instagram. People are active on it and you can instantly create relationships.\n\nThat's when she decided to make Instagram\u00a0a focus.\n\n\n\nJenn uses Instagram primarily to build the brand around her blog.\u00a0Every time she has a new blog post, she shares it on Instagram. People who follow her see a new blog post, and then click through to read it.\u00a0You can find her on\u00a0Instagram under\u00a0@Jenns_Trends.\n\nListen to the show to discover the other reason why Jenn loves\u00a0Instagram.\n\nFacebook Ads Versus Instagram Ads\n\nFacebook ads and Instagram ads are\u00a0very similar, Jenn explains. In fact, Instagram ads are run through Facebook's Business Manager. Therefore, you can't run an ad on Instagram unless you're connected to your Facebook Ads account.\n\nIt's easy\u00a0to get started with Instagram ads if you've done Facebook ads because both ad types use the same dashboard. There are some differences, however. For example, Instagram doesn't feature the total number of targeting options that Facebook offers.\n\nThere are also differences in terms of ad image\u00a0design.\u00a0For instance, while graphic-type images with bright colors, contrast, and certain text features perform well\u00a0on Facebook, people on Instagram prefer\u00a0natural, organic-looking photos. For that reason, Jenn cautions against running identical ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\n\nShe says that a properly designed and targeted Instagram ad blends in with organic posts, and shouldn't stand out as an ad.\n\nBecause the average Instagram user likes\u00a0photos that place him or her into an environment, Jenn cautions against creating an ad that features your product on a shelf, in a box, or on a flat white background. Instead, place your product in the hands\u00a0of a model or in a scenario that's relevant to the brand or your target audience.\n\nDo you offer a service?\u00a0Don't say,\u00a0\"Here, get this today.\" Instead, create\u00a0something relatable to\u00a0the person who would purchase\u00a0it.\n\nAlthough there's no limit to text on Instagram (like the 20% rule on Facebook, which is going away), it doesn't mean you want to include a lot\u00a0of big, bright text.\u00a0You want your ad to be very photo-centric. You want to promote a high-quality, well-lit, properly focused and formatted image that stands out and represents your brand.\n\nListen to the show to hear what will happen if you run the same ad on both Facebook and Instagram.\n\nInstagram Ad Features\n\nInstagram ads are\u00a0distinguished from organic posts with text that says \"Sponsored\" in the top-right corner.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview AJ Wilcox, a LinkedIn ad expert.

In addition to managing accounts, AJ also specializes in LinkedIn ads training.\n\nAJ explores the different types of ads available on LinkedIn.\n\nYou'll discover what B2B marketers need to know about advertising on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\n\nHow AJ Got Into LinkedIn Ads\n\nAJ is a long-time digital marketer who started\u00a0out doing search engine optimization (SEO) and Google AdWords.\n\nAbout four years ago, a company in Utah recruited AJ. On his first day, he laid out his plans for SEO, pay per click, and social media to the CMO. She gave him the go-ahead\u00a0and also informed him that the company had started a\u00a0pilot program with LinkedIn ads.\n\n\"See what you can do with it,\" she said.\n\nAJ replied, \"absolutely,\" and then turned around and started laughing to himself. He felt like a veteran at digital marketing, yet\u00a0had never heard of LinkedIn ads. He jumped into the platform\u00a0to learn about it to try to keep the egg off his face.\n\n\n\nWithin about two weeks, one of the salespeople\u00a0approached AJ, telling him how much they loved the leads they'd been getting. When\u00a0AJ discovered through\u00a0Salesforce that\u00a0the leads were\u00a0all sourced from LinkedIn, he realized there was something to it.\n\nListen to the show to hear how AJ started his business,\u00a0B2Linked.\n\nWhy Consider LinkedIn Ads?\n\nAJ explains that while Facebook's and LinkedIn's ad platforms are very different, they share the same principles. That means that if you have something nailed on Facebook, it will probably work well on LinkedIn and vice versa.\n\nWhile AJ\u00a0doesn't run Facebook ads for his clients, when he's\u00a0compared similar campaigns from Facebook to LinkedIn, he's found his conversion rate on LinkedIn to be about double that of Facebook. Plus, the sales teams have told him the LinkedIn leads are much higher quality than the ones from Facebook.\n\nLinkedIn is\u00a0by far the best for B2B targeting, he continues. You can target by job title, seniority, company, skills, specific group membership, geography, and years in business; information people aren't putting on Facebook.\n\n\n\nAJ shares what he believes\u00a0are the\u00a0two best uses\u00a0of LinkedIn ads. Number one is\u00a0recruitment and the other is promoting B2B products and\u00a0services such as\u00a0an SaaS company\u00a0(software as a service). Those businesses\u00a0charge a substantial ongoing rate ($6,000 to $7,000 per month) for access to their software and have a lifetime value of more than\u00a0$15,000.\n\nIf you have a lifetime value of under $15,000, AJ cautions, make sure your funnel and your processes are really ironed out on Facebook first, because LinkedIn's cost per click (CPC) is much higher than Facebook's.\n\nListen to the show to discover how to calculate lifetime value.\n\nThe Ad Types\n\nWhen you go to LinkedIn.com/ads\u00a0and start a self-service account, you'll have access to two different ad units.\n\n\n\nAJ explains the first type\u00a0is\u00a0text ads. These ads appear in the right sidebar of the\u00a0LinkedIn homepage (on desktop)\u00a0and you'll\u00a0often see three\u00a0ads there.\n\nAccording to AJ, text ads have a low click-through rate because most people are banner-blind to them. If four people click on them out of every 10,000 times they're viewed, you're doing great, he says.", "duration": "36:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-219-16-10-14.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1475834441, "title": "Influence and Persuasion: New Insights From Robert Cialdini", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want to persuade more people to become customers?\n\nWondering what the latest science on influence and persuasion has to say?\n\nTo discover new ways to prepare people for a sale, I interview Dr. Robert Cialdini, author of Influence and Pre-Suasion.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

It was written for consumers so they could\u00a0recognize and resist these strategies when used in an\u00a0unwelcome way.\n\n\n\nThe initial response to the book was so mild that the\u00a0publisher called back the promotional and publicity funds for promoting the book, Robert recalls.\u00a0They told him\u00a0it would be like \"throwing money down a pit.\"\n\nWhat happened to change things?\n\nRobert explains that times changed. The idea of evidence-based decision-making began to dominate the business world, and\u00a0Influence provided a compendium of evidence on what factors influence people. About three or four years after publication, the book skyrocketed to bestseller levels, where it's\u00a0stayed ever since.\n\nThere were two sources of information for the book. To see what was especially successful in moving people toward a sale, he looked at research literature from the behavioral sciences, marketing, psychology, communication, management, and other fields.\n\nHe\u00a0also looked beyond the research literature and began infiltrating all of the training programs he could get access to\u00a0in the areas of\u00a0sales, marketing, recruiting, fundraising, etc. This let him\u00a0see what the professionals were using to train and he gleaned information from those experiences.\n\nWhile he expected consumers to be the audience for Influence, it was actually embraced by the business community first. They wanted to know, scientifically, which factors incline people toward yes, and how to\u00a0include those factors in messages, marketing campaigns, and more.\n\nThe\u00a0interest in harnessing the most powerful practices and procedures for creating change led Robert to write his\u00a0new book, Pre-Suasion. It's designed for people\u00a0who want to become more influential.\n\nListen to the show to discover how I was introduced to Robert's work.\n\nPre-Suasion\n\nRobert thinks the ideal audience for Pre-Suasion is people who want to increase the extent to which their messages successfully move\u00a0people in their direction. While this includes\u00a0salespeople\u00a0and marketers, it's\u00a0also for people who want\u00a0to be more influential inside their families, network of friends, charity boards, etc.\n\n\n\nRobert says that\u00a0while\u00a0Influence\u00a0covers what to build into a message to get agreement, Pre-Suasion describes the process of gaining agreement with a message before it's sent. The process may seem like some sort of magic, but it's not.

However, she explains that when users are on social media, whether it's Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or another network, they're constantly bombarded with a ton of\u00a0messages.\n\nWhen marketing on social media, you have to compete with distractions that may\u00a0take your audience away in seconds; however, an email list is a great way to cut through the noise and create\u00a0a central hub for\u00a0your business.\n\n\n\nYour email marketing and\u00a0social media need to go hand in hand, though. Not everybody will open up your email (a good average open rate is 20%). However, the people\u00a0who do open your emails are typically your best customers and repeat buyers.\n\nListen to the show to hear why I think it's so difficult to get exposure\u00a0on social media.\n\nContent for List Building\n\nContent types have changed over time. Over the last year, Amy has found that\u00a0one of the best ways to grow an\u00a0email list is through blog posts that offer content upgrades.\n\nFirst write a blog post with valuable information that people will want to share; for instance, a post in which\u00a0you list five\u00a0ways to do something. Then inside that blog post, include a content upgrade\u00a0(a freebie) that\u00a0readers can get after they click a button and give you their name and email address.\n\nFor example, Amy has\u00a0a\u00a0blog post on\u00a0myths about\u00a0doing webinars and what to do about them. The content upgrade she offers shares\u00a0rookie mistakes most people make with webinars.\n\n\n\nA couple of years ago, it was okay if your website had one option for people to\u00a0sign up for the newsletter.\u00a0Now, she says, you need\u00a0to have a few different ways people can join\u00a0your email list.\u00a0Amy\u00a0explains you can pique their interest in different ways.\n\nShe might have three or four blog posts with different content upgrades, as well as some opt-in or\u00a0lead pages\u00a0with a freebie that she sends\u00a0traffic to directly by sharing a URL during a Facebook Live\u00a0video.\u00a0Amy also uses this strategy with her podcast, which is her number-one lead generator; the content she creates in Facebook Lives and her blog posts are her next best lead generators.\n\nListen to the show to discover Social Media Examiner's offer to get people to subscribe.\n\nDriving People to Your Content\n\nWhile there are paid options\u00a0(like Facebook ads) to get people to your content (so they'll subscribe),\u00a0there are also free ways to drive traffic. One of Amy's favorite ways is with video.\n\nFirst, she jumps on Facebook Live with an agenda. She'll talk about a topic, teach, give great value, and answer live questions. Then if she has a freebie that's related to a\u00a0topic, she'll end with, \"Make sure to go check out...\" and give a simple URL.

Most often this means Facebook, but could also include Instagram, Pinterest, or Snapchat. However, Twitter can go either way. It has a community of a few hundred million passionate people\u00a0and is\u00a0the place to connect with the\u00a0media.\n\nNeal explains how he did\u00a0A/B testing for a client with Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter ads that revealed it's more difficult to grow organically on Facebook than on Twitter.\n\nA\u00a0majority of the budget was spent growing their Facebook community, while a smaller portion was dedicated to building a smaller Twitter community. After a few months, the Twitter audience had grown 30% to\u00a040% (with no additional budget), but the Facebook audience wasn't growing because of the way EdgeRank works.\n\nNeal discusses the two different types of social networks for businesses: networks such as\u00a0Facebook and LinkedIn where you can't engage with others as your business, and networks like Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat that let you engage as your business. On the latter type, your company can do a lot more organically than it can from your Facebook or LinkedIn company page.\n\n\n\nIf you've been putting all of your\u00a0advertising eggs into one social media platform basket, Neal suggests doing A/B testing to explore other possibilities.\n\nTwitter has a lot of benefits, one of which is connecting with mass media and journalists\u00a0since\u00a0it's where people go to find news. Neal says that after three and a half months of primarily advertising and marketing on Twitter, The Dr. Oz Show reached out to feature his client.\n\nListen to the show to hear more about the power of Twitter for live events.\n\nThe Difference Between Twitter and Facebook Ads\n\nWith both Twitter and Facebook, you advertise on the networks' real estate. On Facebook, ads appear in the news feed, and on desktop in the right-hand frame. Based on his and other Facebook marketers' experience, Neal thinks placing ads in the timeline is best. Comparatively, ads\u00a0on the right-hand side don't seem as effective.\n\n\n\nOn Twitter, ads only appear in\u00a0the timeline, just like\u00a0on Facebook mobile, and \"Promoted\" appears in the tweet box.\n\n\n\nNeal shares two things he finds\u00a0interesting about Twitter advertising.\n\nFirst, since advertising space\u00a0on Facebook and the newer networks is in high\u00a0demand, there's less\u00a0supply. That means it's more expensive to advertise on these networks. Because Twitter has\u00a0a lot more ad inventory available to promote products and services, Neal believes it's a little more cost-effective.\n\nSecond, Neal finds Facebook ads are always changing, and the interface can be very complex. In comparison, the Twitter dashboard and ad interface make it easy to create ads.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Vincent Ng, president of MCNG Marketing and author of Pinterest to Profits with Pintalysis. Vincent helps businesses succeed with Pinterest marketing and visual social media.\n\nVincent explores Pinterest promoted pins.\n\nYou'll discover what's new with promoted pins.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nPromoted Pins\nAt a basic level, Vincent says, promoted pins are Pinterest advertising. As\u00a0you scroll through your Pinterest feed and see \"Promoted by\" on a pin, that means it's advertising. He notes that any pin you want to promote must be a public pin, and says you can even promote something you've repinned!\n\nWhat's New With Promoted Pins?\n\nPinterest recently announced promoted video pins,\u00a0which, at the moment, are specifically for users on mobile. These\u00a0pins show an\u00a0animated GIF and lead you to a full video when you click on them.\n\nWhat's really cool, Vincent shares, is that you can put up to six additional pins below the video on your promoted pin for no extra cost. The six additional pins display like a carousel under the video, and you can use them to promote the product in the video or share additional information about it.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufVJ3oqpQQ8\n\nWhile video pins currently send users to third-party players like YouTube to view the video promoted in the pin, Pinterest is working on its own native video player, which will be rolled out to everybody soon. Once available, people will be able to\u00a0upload videos directly to Pinterest.\n\nListen to the show to hear what\u00a0video lengths Vincent has seen\u00a0on Pinterest.\n\nWhat Can You Do With Promoted Pins?\n\nVincent says you can reach a large audience\u00a0with\u00a0promoted pins, and that Pinterest allows you to create ad campaigns based on three main\u00a0business goals: awareness, engagement, and traffic.\n\nBrand awareness campaigns let you promote your pin to an audience and you pay based on a thousand\u00a0impressions. With engagement campaigns, you're charged every time someone taps and enlarges your pin, repins your pin, saves your pin, or\u00a0clicks your pin. During traffic campaigns, you pay for\u00a0every click-through on your pin.\n\n\n\nVincent says the great thing about promoted pins is that you pay only for the direct promotion, meaning that\u00a0if a user\u00a0clicks on someone's share of your promoted pin, that\u00a0click is\u00a0free for you.\u00a0In fact, Pinterest says users get\u00a0an average of 30% free engagement when they conduct promoted pin campaigns.\n\nWhich type of campaign is the most cost-effective?\u00a0Vincent says that\u00a0he agrees with Pinterest peers Alisa Meredith and Jeff Sieh, who both find the cost-per-click campaigns offer the best bang for your buck\u00a0versus\u00a0engagement campaigns.\n\nWhy? About 80%\u00a0of Pinterest users access the app\u00a0on mobile, so they'll\u00a0enlarge your pin to get a better look at your product. If it's not what they want, they don't necessarily click through.\n\nVincent says it's also possible to run split tests with\u00a0promoted pins\u00a0because each campaign type\u00a0provides the same level of metrics. After you run your test, go to your advertising dashboard and export the data\u00a0to see\u00a0which campaign type is a more cost-effective option\u00a0for your business\n\n\n\nPinterest also offers promoted pin users\u00a0robust targeting capabilities, Vincent says, including by keywords and interests.\n\nPinterest users are asked to follow five interests when they sign up,", "duration": "39:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-215-16-09-16.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1473415206, "title": "Starting a YouTube Channel: How to Achieve YouTube Growth", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have a YouTube channel?\n\nWant to optimize it to get more subscribers?\n\nTo explore how to build and grow a YouTube channel, I interview Tim Schmoyer.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

It's where your videos reside. For example, Tim's videos are on YouTube.com/videocreators, and\u00a0when people are looking for his videos, they know that's where to find them.\n\n\n\nA YouTube channel can be focused on a topic, but it doesn't have to be, Tim says. It could also revolve around a belief, a person, etc. He stresses\u00a0that your YouTube channel should be very specific to target a specific group of people and deliver a very specific value.\n\nListen to the show to discover who comprises the demographic on YouTube.\n\nCommon Mistakes\n\nPeople make three big mistakes on YouTube.\u00a0First, many feel like they need a high-end production team and fancy equipment. Tim says you can grow a very successful channel with basic equipment.\n\nYour smartphone may\u00a0be sufficient, depending on the type of content you want to make, the audience you want to reach, and the image you want to present for your brand. Start with what you have, and possibly invest in a lens for your camera and an external microphone to clip into your phone.\n\nSometimes, a full production studio works against you, because the people have a different content focus and expect higher quality.\u00a0YouTube viewers, on the other hand, are very forgiving of a shaky handcam\u00a0if the value of the content is high.\n\n\n\nSecond,\u00a0people don't pay\u00a0enough attention to the titles and thumbnails of their videos. Most of your YouTube traffic will come from related videos, suggested by YouTube, when users\u00a0are viewing other content; an\u00a0enticing title and thumbnail drive those clicks.\n\nTim says a lot of the top YouTube creators he\u00a0knows spend just as much time, if not more, developing their title and thumbnail than they spend on the actual content.\n\nStart with your title and thumbnail in mind before you start shooting the video. This enables\u00a0you to\u00a0capture the thumbnail you need. For example, a video about how to look better on stage needs a\u00a0thumbnail that portrays that; it\u00a0could be as simple as a\u00a0picture of a crowd of people with a spotlight on the main focal point on stage.\n\nIf you shoot the video first and figure out the title later, the opening may not\u00a0quite connect to the title until two and a half minutes into the video.\n\n\n\nThe third mistake people make is taking too long to hook viewers. Tim says that when someone clicks your video, you have 15 seconds maximum to relate to the title and thumbnail. That way, viewers feel like\u00a0they're getting the value they were e...", "duration": "47:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-214-16-09-09.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1472810417, "title": "Facebook Split Testing: How to Make Your Ads Better", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you run Facebook ads?\n\nHave you tried split testing?\n\nTo explore different ways to split test your Facebook ads so you can refine your ad campaigns, I interview Andrea Vahl.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

She says that as she was learning how to use Facebook and Twitter, she didn't see a lot of articles that were entertaining and explained things step by step.\n\nSo\u00a0Andrea decided to use one of her improv comedy characters to make an entertaining, fun, and useful blog. She chose\u00a0Grandma Mary,\u00a0and dubbed her a \"social media edutainer.\"\n\nAccording to Andrea, Grandma Mary gets a little cranky about social media. The character is\u00a0the voice of people who are frustrated with having to learn social media. Grandma Mary explains social media in an endearing,\u00a0engaging, and understandable way.\n\n\n\nAndrea started her blog about nine years ago, and when\u00a0the parent company of the wine business folded, she made the blog her side gig. It grew substantially (she had a lot of Twitter followers and Facebook fans), which led to the book deal for her to co-author of the Facebook Marketing All-in-One for Dummies series with Phyllis Khare and Amy Porterfield.\n\nToday, Andrea still blogs about Facebook, does Facebook consulting, runs ad campaigns for clients, and more.\u00a0It's her full-time business and she gets to speak and train on Facebook all over the world.\n\nListen to the show to discover\u00a0which\u00a0two loves Andrea combined when she created Grandma Mary.\n\nWhat You Can Split Test\n\nAndrea explains that the concept of\u00a0split testing Facebook ads\u00a0involves keeping things constant, while changing one thing about the ad at a time. That way, you'll easily be able to tell which variable contributed to the better-performing Facebook ad results. Then you can stop the ads that aren't performing, continue running the ones that are, and hopefully get your click price and cost lower and lower.\n\nFor example,\u00a0if you split test an ad to 1,000 people, 500 would see one version and 500 would see another. Then you\u00a0compare the results. The hope is that you learn what works and what doesn't so larger audiences can be reached.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Andrea says, you can split test all kinds of keywords, which go into the Interests area.\u00a0For instance,\u00a0if someone lists jogging as an interest in a profile, and you use that keyword in the Interest area of your Facebook ad, your ad will get shown to that person.\n\nYour ad could also be shown to people who have liked\u00a0pages that are related to jogging, such as types of jogging clothing or shoes.\n\nYou can also test\u00a0all kinds of demographics. For example, say you want to reach people who are 35 to\u00a055, live in a certain city, like certain things, and maybe own a home. There are all kinds of demographics targeting you can put in your ads to reach your perfect prospect.\n\nFor Interests, Andrea suggests using general keywords like \"jogging\" and \"running,\" versus specific pages like Runner's World or Nike\u00a0shoes.", "duration": "41:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-213-16-09-02.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1472205623, "title": "Video Production: How to Create Quality Videos Quickly", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you create videos for your fans and followers?\n\nWant to improve the quality?\n\nToday, Roberto Blake is with us to\u00a0explore how quality videos are produced.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He says animation wasn't in the cards, so at about 14 or 15 years old he\u00a0switched to video and was\u00a0producing online video as a hobby for about\u00a0six years before YouTube existed.\n\nRob says he didn't join the\u00a0YouTube craze when it first launched, and shares that changed around the time he left corporate life for entrepreneurship.He'd already been running a blog to help\u00a0creative professionals (designers, artists, web design), and found\u00a0it was easier to answer questions and provide tutorials with\u00a0video than it was to write and re-write the same email replies or blog comments over and over again.\n\nRoberto notes that\u00a0if\u00a0business people use video to address commonly expressed customer pain points, they're essentially buying back some of their\u00a0time; it makes things easier on everyone.\n\nHow did Roberto decide to turn video into a business? He'd been making ad revenue on the blog side\u00a0and wanted to scale his existing freelance business. As he focused more on teaching web and graphic design, rather than social media marketing, he decided producing video content was faster than organizing his thoughts around screen captures and stills.\n\nPlus, Roberto believes that, if he's going to teach someone how to use\u00a0Adobe Premiere Pro,\u00a0a full-screen video tutorial like the one below is\u00a0more helpful than\u00a0still images and walls of text.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxkXrPzEGtI\n\nListen to the show to learn more about Roberto's early experience working with a wedding videographer.\n\nWhy Video is so important today\n\nRoberto explains that one of the easiest and most practical ways for people to learn is through video, because they can see a process. Even when the video isn't based on a demonstration, like with software tutorials, there's value in seeing another human being; reading that person's micro-expressions and mannerisms can help cut the learning curve.\n\nRoberto remembers growing up watching Bob Ross, Reading Rainbow, and\u00a0VideoSmarts,\u00a0a program in the 1980s that helped children with memorization games, learning concepts, and reading. He notes that if individuals and businesses take advantage of educating via video, and make it engaging, fun, and informative, they'll find their content resonates with people.\n\nListen to the show to discover my personal connection to early training DVDs.\n\nWhat to Do Before Recording\n\nWhether you're\u00a0using\u00a0a smartphone or a DSLR camera, one thing Roberto recommends\u00a0before recording\u00a0is to check the environment. Look for and remove any distractions from the background. For example, if there's noise from cars driving by you can change your location. If there's a part of your office that needs to be cleaned, you can tidy up.\n\nHe also says you should think about the context of your background.

Before that, he ran a publishing company. Essentially, his\u00a0business background got hijacked by his writing career. When he went back into business, he started a conference company.\n\nAlthough he sold millions of memoirs, not many people attended his conferences. Donald\u00a0figured out the conference\u00a0invitation was too vague. His message was not pointed, understandable, or accessible. It didn't hit a perceived need, so\u00a0nobody could figure out why they should come.\n\nDonald needed to simplify his message so people would say, \"I need that. I'm going to show up. I'm going to buy it.\"\u00a0To do that, Donald created a framework based on the elements of story. Since he studied story to write books and screenplays for more than a decade, he knew story\u00a0was the most powerful tool to compel the human brain.\n\nHe\u00a0took the seven most popular elements in every story, the seven\u00a0things that happen in Tommy Boy, Star Wars, Bridget Jones's Diary, The Hunger Games, Moneyball, and The King's Speech, and put it all on a whiteboard. Donald discovered how to\u00a0filter\u00a0his marketing messages through this seven-part framework.\n\n\n\nApplying this framework, the\u00a0conference grew from 350 people to 970 people to 1,200 people to 2,000, through\u00a0word of mouth. People finally understood what he\u00a0had to offer, Donald says. This evolved into\u00a0StoryBrand. They let the conference company go\u00a0because StoryBrand took off from there.\n\nDonald\u00a0has worked with more than 2,000 companies, helping them\u00a0clarify their message. They all struggle with the same thing.\u00a0They don't know how to talk about what they do, since they're too close to it.\n\nStory is based on 2,000-year-old formulas that have been refined over time, Donald explains.

Donald says that's a question that people like Christopher Booker, Robert McKee, and Joseph Campbell have all tried to answer.\u00a0Donald thinks story comes from within. People\u00a0self-identify as the hero in a story that's trying to accomplish something and overcome challenges.\n\n\n\nPeople believe intuitively that some things come together that would create a climactic or obligatory scene that will resolve the conflict in their\u00a0life.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Josh Elledge, a consumer advocate and founder of SavingsAngel.com, a site dedicated to consumer savings. He's a weekly syndicated newspaper columnist and has made more than 1,000 TV and radio appearances. Josh is also the founder of UpendPR.com and host of the Savings Angel Show.\n\nJosh explores how to connect with traditional media influencers.\n\nYou'll discover how to develop and build relationships with media via Twitter.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nHow to Connect With Traditional Media Influencers\nJosh's Story\n\nOut of high school, Josh joined the United States Navy and became a journalist. He says it was a great way\u00a0for an 18-year-old to participate in producing video news stories for the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nAbout 9 1/2 years ago, Josh started a membership-based website called\u00a0SavingsAngel. SavingsAngel pursues their mission to end hunger, lack, and need in communities\u00a0by helping\u00a0consumers cut their grocery bills in half; Josh's company charges customers $3.99/week.\n\nSince he had no money for advertising, he was forced\u00a0to look for other ways to get exposure.\u00a0Josh shared the mission of SavingsAngel with every media influencer he could get to pay attention to him. His outreach\u00a0wasn't about promoting SavingsAngel to make a lot of money, it was about finding a way to work with others to achieve what he wanted to do in his area.\n\n\n\nWith\u00a0print publications, Josh\u00a0knew to ask for remnant space, or the\u00a0unsold ad space publications typically fill by running ads for themselves. Josh suggested an alternative to 20 media outlets; they could do a revenue share based on a 1/4- or 1/8-page ad. Several of those outlets made suggestions and he quickly learned what was possible.\n\nFor\u00a0radio, Josh developed a segment in which he shares the best 3 to 5 grocery deals in the area (he currently lives in Orlando, Florida). This segment has now become his syndicated newspaper column. He's also been doing a TV segment for the last 5 1/2 years. It's a very popular segment. He gets great feedback on it, and his local FOX\u00a0affiliate absolutely loves the content he provides each week.\n\nListen to the show to hear what Josh did after the Navy and before he started SavingsAngel.\n\nWhat Marketers Need to Understand About Traditional Media \n\nJosh explains that it's very important to understand that you're asking the media to give you publicity and to take a chance on you. You have to pitch them with a great concept for education or entertainment content as part of a segment or in a news story.\n\nPR is all about the long game. It's incredibly important not to use\u00a0any kind of sales language. This opportunity is not about you selling your thing. Josh says the media will\u00a0be sensitive to you trying to sell to their audience. If you try, you won't be invited back, or\u00a0worse yet you could be blacklisted.\u00a0Trust that the\u00a0influencer will credit you, and give them the space to do that. It's okay for you to mention your brand in passing, but it's absolutely not okay to give calls to action.\n\nWhat is the long game with PR? Become the reliable source and subject-matter expert that the media contact can go back to time and again.\u00a0Josh says he has been quoted in the Chicago Tribune close to a dozen times and has done his TV segment on FOX 35 close to 300 times.", "duration": "45:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-210-16-08-12.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1470391207, "title": "Customer Advocacy: How to Get People to Talk About Your Company", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are your customers advocates for your brand or business?\n\nWant to improve customer satisfaction and advocacy?\n\nTo find out how to turn customers into advocates, I interview Joey Coleman.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He's a customer advocacy consultant and coach who has worked with Hyatt Hotels, NASA, and Zappos. Joey's also a frequent keynote speaker and leads workshops on the customer experience and the customer journey.\n\nJoey explores what it takes to turn a customer into an advocate.\n\nYou'll discover the phases that lead to advocacy.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nCustomer Advocacy\nJoey's Story\n\nJoey has had an eclectic career. After college and law school, he did business consulting before working as\u00a0a criminal defense attorney in the courtroom for many years. Then he taught executive education courses\u00a0and\u00a0ran a division of a promotional products company.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, Joey started his own brand experience and design firm. This led him to speak on stages all over the world, talking about how to create remarkable experiences that take someone from being a one-time customer to a customer for life.\n\nIn each of his careers, Joey says, success hinged on two things. First, an understanding of human psychology (why people believe what they believe and why they do the things they do). And second, an ability to use\u00a0that understanding to\u00a0persuade people to take a certain course of action, whether it's a sales pitch, brochure, website, infographic, piece of evidence introduced in the courtroom, or a closing argument.\n\nLooking back, his entire career has been all about the experience; meaning the experience someone is currently having and how to make it better.\n\nWhile marketing firms build ad campaigns, branding agencies design logos, and graphic design firms execute the visuals, Joey looks at\u00a0brand experience and how all of the different elements of a\u00a0business work together.\u00a0Experience is the\u00a0through-line that connects everything.\n\nListen to the show to discover how the name of Joey's business, Design Symphony,\u00a0represents\u00a0brand experience.\n\nWhy Customer Advocacy Matters\n\nJoey thinks customer advocacy is really the end goal for most organizations. It happens when you reach the point where your customers are such big believers in who you are\u00a0and\u00a0what you do that they become your external sales force. Customers drive\u00a0new business and increase the amount of business they do with you because they've become such raving fans, they can't help themselves. They advocate zealously for you and your business.\n\n\n\nJoey shares a brief overview of the history of business.\n\nIn the 1980s, he explains, a movement came out of Japan that became known as the Total Quality Management\u00a0approach to business. It was all about reducing product defects to as close to zero as possible. Out of this came things\u00a0like Six Sigma Black Belt, as well as\u00a0a general belief that when you buy something, it's going to work.\n\nThe 1990s were all about Just-in-Time manufacturing. For example, companies like\u00a0Dell\u00a0shortened the supply chain through building things on demand. As a result, the computer giant could\u00a0dramatically control inventory, while at the same time push prices lower. Companies started to succeed based on being the lowest-priced player in the game, while at\u00a0this higher level of quality.\n\nIn\u00a0the 2000s, it became all\u00a0about the Internet era. Businesses built\u00a0websites and could make everything available globally 24/7.\n\nThen in the 2010s, everything that happened over the past three decades came together.", "duration": "44:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-209-16-08-05.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1469786419, "title": "Twitter Analytics: How to Know if Your Twitter Marketing Works", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you review your\u00a0Twitter Analytics?\n\nWant to use them to improve your Twitter marketing?\n\nIan Cleary is with us to explore what you can learn from the data provided in\u00a0Twitter Analytics.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Ian Cleary, a social tech expert. His blog, RazorSocial.com, placed in our Top 10 Social Media Blogs four years in a row. He also founded the RazorBlazers Club, a community for marketers who want to monetize with social media.\n\nIan explores how you can use Twitter Analytics to take your Twitter marketing to the next level.\n\nYou'll discover great third-party analytics tools.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nTwitter Analytics\nCore Twitter Analytics on the Home Tab\n\nIan explains that once your account is 14 days old, you can access the free analytics provided by Twitter\u00a0by going\u00a0to Analytics.Twitter.com\u00a0on your desktop.\u00a0You'll start off with an overview on the Home tab, from which you can\u00a0drill down to\u00a0view data on tweets, audiences, video analytics, and more.\n\n\n\nOn the Overview screen, you'll see the total number of impressions for all of your tweets. Impressions are the actual number of people who saw your\u00a0tweets on their Twitter timeline, by visiting your profile, or in a search. For instance, they may have clicked on a hashtag and your tweet was listed.\n\nIan wonders whether Twitter is able to access all of the information for tweets displayed in third-party tools (Hootsuite, Sprout Social, etc.). He goes on to say that even though the data is never going to be 100% accurate, it will give you a gauge\u00a0to see if your impressions are going up or down each month.\n\nProfile Visits\u00a0is the total number of people who visited your profile on\u00a0mobile and desktop combined. This number is\u00a0important, Ian explains, because when you pin a really good tweet to the top of your Twitter profile, you\u00a0have an idea of how many people have seen it.\n\nFor example, if Ian's\u00a0profile shows\u00a017,000 visits, that means\u00a017,000 people have\u00a0seen his\u00a0pinned tweet, which is an opt-in to download a lead generation guide. He uses this tweet to build email subscribers from people visiting his Twitter profile.\u00a0It's a simple thing, but it's the equivalent of having a big opt-in at the top of your website.\n\n\n\nMentions show how often your Twitter username is mentioned on other people's profiles. For example, the number of people who\u00a0shared your content and mentioned your Twitter name will show up there.\n\nWhile they're not clickable, the\u00a0mountain graphs you see under each data label give you an idea of whether that data set is increasing or decreasing at a glance. For example, you can see if your impressions are going up or down over the course of the month. Or you can check the Followers graph to see if your audience is growing or diminishing.\n\n\n\nThe Top Tweet\u00a0section of the Overview screen\u00a0shows you\u00a0your\u00a0best tweet over the last 28 days and\u00a0the number of impressions and\u00a0retweets on it.\u00a0Ian explains that you want to see what your\u00a0most popular tweets\u00a0are, so\u00a0you can turn them\u00a0into evergreen tweets to\u00a0share regularly. There's no point in retweeting content that's not resonating with your audience.\n\nThe Top Mention section shows you when someone else shared a piece of your content and mentioned your name, and it did really well.\u00a0The Top Follower is your follower who is followed by the most people. If someone with a large following has followed you, and he or she is relevant to your audience, pay attention to and start interacting with that person, Ian suggests.", "duration": "41:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-208-16-07-29.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1469181600, "title": "Facebook Ad Changes: What Marketers Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you run Facebook ads?\n\nAre you familiar with the latest changes?\n\nTo explore a number of recent changes to Facebook that will impact all advertisers, I interview Jon Loomer.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Jon Loomer, a marketing expert who specializes in Facebook advertising. Jon is host of the Social Media Pubcast and blogs at JonLoomer.com.\n\nJon explores Facebook ad changes and what you need to know.\n\nYou'll discover updates to the 20% text rule, custom audiences, and more.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nFacebook Ad Changes\nThe 20% text rule change\n\nJon explains why\u00a0the 20% rule was created and says that until recently, any Facebook ad image with more than 20% text would be rejected. The text ratio was measured by placing a grid over the image and if there was text in more than 5\u00a0out of the 25 boxes, it was\u00a0considered over the 20% text limit.\n\nSince\u00a0Facebook has abandoned\u00a0the rule, advertisers can have as much text as they\u00a0want in their image. However, the more text in the\u00a0image, the less reach it will receive and\u00a0the more it will cost to run such an ad.\n\nNow, when you upload an image to the Text Overlay tool, Facebook will rate the image as:\u00a0OK, Low, Medium, and High.\n\n\n\nFacebook is general about the guidelines, Jon explains, but there is no longer a grid. Basically,\u00a0zero text means it's OK,\u00a0and\u00a020% text is considered Low. However,\u00a0if you compare Facebook's\u00a0example for 20% to the actual 20% rule, it's actually a little bit more than 20%.\n\nFacebook says if you have been following the 20% rule until now, you probably won't see any changes. However, Jon thinks the system for detecting the text is a little buggy, although it's still early on. For instance, he talks about an\u00a0image of\u00a0nature that was flagged for having text.\n\nJon says the best approach is to test it. Experiment with little or no text in your images, and compare the results.\u00a0You'll need to determine what text you absolutely need.\n\nThe logo is another potential issue since not all logos are created equal. Jon's logo has never been flagged. However, sometimes they detect it and sometimes they don't.\n\n\n\nMany\u00a0advertisers and users love memes and big call-to-action text, and now they can boost them. Jon says you probably need to do a manual bid and bid really high to get that ad seen, but you never know. It may be extremely effective.\n\nListen to the show to discover\u00a0whether the text scale is at play on organic posts.\n\nFacebook custom audiences\n\nJon is a big fan of Facebook\u00a0custom audiences, which is creating audiences of people who have visited your website. It's powerful since these people already\u00a0know who you are. However, Jon explains, there is a weakness in those audiences.\n\nAll\u00a0audiences aren't created equal. In an audience of people\u00a0who have\u00a0visited your site over the last 180 days, some visited once, others\u00a0visited 50 times. Some people bounced after three\u00a0seconds and don't even remember being there, while others\u00a0have spent hours on your site. Until recently, you couldn't differentiate the two.\n\nWith\u00a0the new website custom audiences' advanced feature, you can create an audience based on frequency. For instance, base it on how many times someone has\u00a0visited your website or performed one specific action, such as a purchase or a\u00a0registration.\n\nNow, when Jon promotes his blog posts, instead of targeting all\u00a0of his website visitors from the last 180 days, he focuses only on those who visited at least three times. The quality and the cost per website click have been much better.", "duration": "47:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-207-16-07-22.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1468576805, "title": "Live Video: Creative Ways to Do a Live Show on Facebook", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you broadcast live video?\n\nHave you considered hosting a regular show on Facebook Live?\n\nTo discover creative ways to use Facebook Live, I interview Lou Mongello.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

In 2007, when Ustream became a lot more accessible, he decided\u00a0to give it a try.\n\nLou recalls\u00a0the first night he did a\u00a0live stream. He'd told his wife he was going to\u00a0try it out and would\u00a0be back in 10 minutes. Six hours later, he was still online with a couple of hundred people who were watching, chatting, and engaging. Since then, he's been broadcasting live video every week.\n\nBetween his\u00a0weekly shows and any\u00a0ad hoc episodes, Lou believes he's done close to 1,000 shows to date.\n\n\n\nLou says he moved\u00a0from Ustream\u00a0to\u00a0Livestream, then was a day-two\u00a0Meerkat user and a day-one\u00a0Periscope user.\n\nHe thought Periscope was the best of the bunch until he\u00a0got his account verified by Facebook and received early access to\u00a0Facebook Live. Lou simulcasted his show, using two different devices to\u00a0compare the quality, engagement, and viewer experience of the two broadcasts. Very quickly, in late 2015, he let people know he was moving\u00a0off of Periscope\u00a0and going all-in on Facebook Live.\n\nListen to the show to discover what Lou loves about the growth of live video.\n\nHow Lou uses\u00a0Facebook Live\n\nLou does a live broadcast\u00a0show every week. Most episodes\u00a0are done\u00a0from his home studio, and topics range\u00a0from the\u00a0week's most recent Walt Disney World news and\u00a0simple Ask Me Anythings (AMAs) and Q&amp;As to\u00a0showing off things in his collections.\n\nHe says his\u00a0in-studio shows are more\u00a0about the conversation, while the offsite shows (such as when he goes to a Disney park, on a cruise, etc.) are about conveying the\u00a0experience.\n\nWatch & chat with me LIVE! Let's talk Disney, and Ask Me Anything! #tw\n\nPosted by Lou Mongello on Wednesday, June 29, 2016\n\nFor his Wednesday discussions of Walt Disney World news, Lou talks about what's going on, and also makes the audience part of the broadcast. If a new restaurant is opening, an\u00a0attraction is coming, or something is changing, he flips it around to make it a question. For example, he'll ask, \"What do you guys think?\" or \"What's your favorite place to eat on property?\"\n\nWhatever you talk about drives engagement, Lou continues. He always has\u00a0questions in his head to initiate a conversation, and instead of asking a question, letting people respond, and moving on to the next question, he reads every\u00a0response in the comments so he can further the conversation with people.\u00a0Lou stresses that it's important to acknowledge individuals during a live broadcast, because when someone's name is called, it means a lot to them.\n\n\n\nHis AMA episodes allow the audience to ask him questions that are\u00a0personal, business-related, or relate to\u00a0an upcoming Disney trip.\u00a0Lou tries to go through questions as quickly as possible, and\u00a0normally does a lightning round at the end. He'll do\u00a0two minutes of rapid-fire questions and answer as many as he\u00a0can.", "duration": "46:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-206-16-07-15.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1467972011, "title": "Smartphone Video Excellence: How to Film Like a Pro", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you record videos with\u00a0your smartphone?\n\nWant to make them look really\u00a0professional?\n\nTo talk about how to do video like a pro from your smartphone, I interview Justin Brown.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He began to create highlight videos from the\u00a0footage of\u00a0boats flipping, people falling out, and other exciting occurrences, and found that he enjoyed editing high-paced action video. From there, Justin pivoted into\u00a0doing underground mine training videos.\n\nJustin\u00a0broke into extreme sports through an\u00a0interview with professional big wave surfer\u00a0Mark Visser. Justin ended up working closely with Mark and\u00a0producing his documentary TV series: Justin filmed Mark\u00a0surfing JAWS in Hawaii at 2 AM, solo skydiving, and\u00a0throwing jet skis out of a plane to surf remote locations. It was full-on action sports video.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jfM1Vsl70k\n\nSomewhere along the line, Justin found that he was more interested in teaching people to create their own video content, rather than shooting the video for them.\u00a0The goal at\u00a0Primal Video, which launched last year,\u00a0is to\u00a0help people get up to speed with video, allowing them to magnify\u00a0their results by removing any barriers or excuses they have around creating videos for themselves.\n\nListen to the show to hear more about Justin's career transition.\n\nLighting\n\nJustin says\u00a0there are a few simple elements that will help you\u00a0create a professional-looking video using your smartphone. Proper lighting, he says, will dramatically increase the quality and professionalism of your video, no matter the situation.\n\nThere are a couple options for lighting when capturing videos with your smartphone. One is to\u00a0to use a rig mount with a light on it to\u00a0illuminate your subject in the same way you would with a DSLR camera. Another option is to use a desk lamp or the lighting in your office\u00a0or\u00a0studio.\n\nThe key\u00a0is to use whatever you have to light up\u00a0the person presenting the content (maybe that's you); make sure that person is lit well, and if you have the time and the ability, you can also light up the background.\n\nThe goal is\u00a0to have an even light across your entire face, so people can connect with you. Some shadow is good, because it creates depth on the face and you can see some\u00a0details, but harsh shadows aren't ideal.\u00a0If bright light is coming in through a window that's in your shot, do your best to reduce it by closing the curtains, shutting the doors, or lighting up the other side of your face to balance that light.\n\n\n\nWhen you film with a smartphone, you typically have three scenarios: selfie-style with you holding the phone yourself, someone using their phone to film you,", "duration": "45:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-205-16-07-08.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1467367218, "title": "Twitter Chats: How Marketers Can Benefit From Twitter Chats", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you participate in Twitter chats?\n\nWant to discover how to get the most out of them?\n\nTo explore how marketers can benefit from Twitter chats, I interview Madalyn Sklar.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Madalyn Sklar, a Twitter marketing expert. She's host of the Twitter Smarter podcast and hosts a weekly Twitter chat at #TwitterSmarter. She blogs about Twitter at MadalynSklar.com.\n\nMadalyn explores the power of Twitter chats and how to benefit from them.\n\nYou'll discover tools to make marketing with Twitter chats easier.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nTwitter Chats\nMadalyn's story\n\nMadalyn had been doing online marketing for a long time, and when social media came about she was hooked. Twitter was her favorite,\u00a0because the 140-character limit forces you to be concise.\n\nShe shares that\u00a0whenever she\u00a0traveled to different events and conferences, she asked people what was their favorite platform and why. She was amazed at how many people said they didn't like or understand Twitter.\n\nAs a result,\u00a0she went on a mission: to help people become Twitter Smarter. She began using the hashtag\u00a0#TwitterSmarter as she developed online classes and eventually launched\u00a0Twitter chats.\n\nListen to the show to discover how Madalyn and I first crossed paths.\n\nWhat's a Twitter chat?\n\nThe most simple description of a Twitter chat is a group of people coming together on Twitter for about an hour each week to have a conversation that revolves around a pre-determined hashtag. As long as people include\u00a0the hashtag in their tweet, they're part of the conversation.\n\n\n\nIt's a great way to meet lots of like-minded people, as well as receive\u00a0and give advice, Madalyn explains.\u00a0She\u00a0encourages people to learn from her chats, but also to chime in and share their own expertise.\n\nA common approach, the one Madalyn takes, is to host a\u00a0guest who does a Q&amp;A for each Twitter chat.\n\nListen to the show to hear my analogies to Twitter chats.\n\nWhy participate?\n\nMadalyn says that last year, she made it her mission to participate in as many Twitter chats as possible. She confides\u00a0that it's not been easy; it takes effort to be a regular participant in\u00a0several hour-long chats each week.\n\nTwitter chats are great for helping you\u00a0connect and network with people.\n\nFor example, when\u00a0Madalyn\u00a0started going to\u00a0#MediaChat, she\u00a0didn't know anybody. She started to connect with people and ended up having a side conversation with Matt Diederichs from Hootsuite,\u00a0which is one of her favorite platforms for scheduling tweets.\n\nLater on, she hosted Matt as a guest on her podcast and her Twitter chat.\n\nSide conversations are a common occurrence during Twitter\u00a0chats, Madalyn adds. You're still actively participating and using the hashtag, but you're also creating a small community within the big community.\u00a0It's a great way to make valuable, strong connections.\n\nListen to the show to hear why Madalyn refers to Twitter chats as \"cocktail parties.\"\n\nWhere to find Twitter chats\n\nMadalyn finds that it works best\u00a0to run a Google search for your\u00a0topic and \"Twitter chat\" in Google search. Another option is to type in \"Twitter chat,\" and you'll find some directories.\n\n\n\nSince directories aren't always reliable or up to date, Madalyn also recommends looking\u00a0for chats on Twitter (you can identify them by the repetitive hashtag). Once you dip into a chat, you'll hear about others. She says you can also find out about specific chats in Twitter bios, because many times hosts will mention them there.", "duration": "43:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-204-16-07-01.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1466762423, "title": "Facebook Instant Articles: How to Get Started", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Have you seen Facebook Instant Articles?\n\nAre you curious about how to publish them?\n\nTo discover how to get started using Facebook Instant Articles, I interview Leslie Samuel.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode, I interview Leslie Samuel, a blogging expert who runs BecomeABlogger.com. He's also the host of the Learning With Leslie podcast and the head of training for the Social Media Marketing Society.\n\nLeslie explores the benefits and challenges of Facebook Instant Articles.\n\nYou'll discover what you need to know to get started with this new feature.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\n\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nFacebook Instant Articles\nWhat Are Instant Articles?\n\nA relatively new feature,\u00a0Facebook Instant Articles\u00a0offers publishers\u00a0content-hosting directly on Facebook, so users get a better mobile experience. If you're on the Facebook mobile app and you see an article\u00a0with a lightning bolt at the top right of the open graph image, it's the\u00a0Facebook Instant Articles version.\n\n\n\nWhen you click through to read that content, it loads very quickly because you're not leaving Facebook to go to another\u00a0website.\n\nListen to the show to learn about some special features you can add to Facebook's Instant Articles.\n\nBenefits for Bloggers\n\nFacebook has more than\u00a01.65 billion users. Chances are, if you're trying to reach someone, they're on Facebook.\n\nOne problem Facebook solves with Instant Articles is eliminating slow page-load times.\u00a0According to a study by Kissmetrics, if a website takes longer than 3 seconds to load, more than 40% of those\u00a0users\u00a0will abandon it. Instant Articles makes content available very quickly.\n\nOther benefits include great user experience. Leslie adds that some of the interactive elements help the articles really stand out.\n\n\n\nSince\u00a0Facebook seems to reward those producers whose\u00a0content keeps people on Facebook longer, such as live broadcasting, I ask Leslie about Facebook's\u00a0monetary benefits for\u00a0those who\u00a0choose to advertise.\n\nLeslie explains that if you use\u00a0Facebook's Audience Network, you can do a revenue share. You keep 70% of the revenue generated\u00a0from ad clicks. It's kind of like AdSense within your instant articles.\u00a0Leslie\u00a0doesn't see it\u00a0as a huge benefit, because you can do that on your website with AdSense or other networks. However, Facebook makes it easy to use ads within your instant articles.\n\nAccording to\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0as of right now, they're not giving instant articles preferential treatment. However,\u00a0the Facebook algorithm strives to show\u00a0people the best content quickly. So, if more people click through to instant articles, Leslie can see the algorithm naturally giving preferential treatment to this content.\u00a0Plus, Facebook will show content that gets\u00a0a lot of\u00a0engagement to more of the people who like your page.\n\nFacebook's desire to get users to spend more time on their platform gives content creators\u00a0a\u00a0unique opportunity. Leslie says that in the past, if people\u00a0put up\u00a0engaging images or videos and\u00a0others shared them like\u00a0crazy, they\u00a0would get\u00a0additional reach.\n\n\n\nWith this\u00a0control over content, ads, and links, a business could use\u00a0that reach to benefit their\u00a0brand and business, grow an\u00a0email list, promote products, and more. For instance,\u00a0put a link to an email opt-in form at the end of an instant article.\n\nLeslie believes that smart marketers using Facebook as a primary marketing platform will figure out how to take advantage of the benefits of instant articles to\u00a0get\u00a0users into their system.\n\nLeslie discusses the\u00a0difference between\u00a0Facebook Notes\u00a0and\u00a0Instant Articles,", "duration": "40:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-203-16-06-24.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1466157607, "title": "How to Get Your Videos to Perform in Search", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you create YouTube videos?\n\nWant to get them seen?\n\nAmy Schmittauer is here to help you discover how to\u00a0get your videos to rank in search.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

That derails\u00a0your focus. The most important thing is to recognize the platform and deliver a product that will be welcomed in the context of that situation, whether it's Snapchat, Instagram, Vine, or YouTube.\n\nHow you would present a video on YouTube is very different than how you would present a video on Facebook, especially since you want to create something\u00a0successful for a\u00a0specific environment.\n\nThere's one exception\u00a0to keep in mind. An influencer who wants to build a Snapchat portfolio needs\u00a0to find a way to retain that material (a place to put it to be rewatched), since it will expire in 24 hours.\n\nIf you create content on YouTube, it may make sense to edit\u00a0in footage from Instagram, Snapchat, a live stream, or something else to give a little context. However, a Snapchat story, uploaded in its original form\u00a0to YouTube, will not\u00a0do as well as it would on the original platform.\n\n\n\nSomeone took a bunch of Zach King's Vine videos, strung them together, and put them on Facebook and YouTube, which\u00a0caused him to\u00a0explode. So I asked Amy if material from Facebook Live could easily go up on YouTube. She said it could, but the platforms are still different environments.\n\nFacebook\u00a0Lives aren't\u00a0always as fun on playback, she explains. Also keep in mind that if you get on Live and are just sitting there, going through some sort of programming or curriculum, and talking to comments, it's going to drag on. It doesn't matter if it's 10 or 30 minutes, it won't be fun for anyone on YouTube to watch in a replay.\n\nIf you broadcast\u00a0with more intention (for example, mention big news that just happened) and possibly\u00a0reference a couple of comments here and there (but stay focused), that may be a good repurposing opportunity for YouTube. You want the audience to\u00a0feel like they're having a similar experience to when it was live.\n\nAmy says Facebook and YouTube are about the same in terms of uploading. You take a produced piece of content, upload it, and put it out to the audience subscribing to that channel, whether it's a YouTube page or Facebook page or profile.\n\nHowever, when people\u00a0watch a video on YouTube, it's an intentional move. They have\u00a0to go to a video and click Play. Then the\u00a0audio and video immediately begin.\n\n\n\nOn Facebook, and now on Instagram, posted\u00a0videos are put in the viewers'\u00a0faces. When people\u00a0scroll though their\u00a0feed, they may or\u00a0may not see it\u00a0and they may or may not click the Play or Audio buttons to watch and listen. Plus, the audio on Facebook goes on\u00a0when the viewer clicks it, so they could start listening at any point\u00a0in\u00a0the video.\n\nViewers\u00a0go through a different\u00a0thought process before\u00a0they decide\u00a0to watch a video on either one\u00a0of these platforms.\n\nListen to the show to learn why\u00a0you want to put videos of similar le...", "duration": "40:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-202-16-06-17.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1465552840, "title": "Influencer Marketing: What You Need to Know to Get Started", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Does your company work with influencers?\n\nWant to incorporate influencers into your marketing?\n\nTo discover what you need to know about influencer marketing, I interview Lee Odden.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

You're essentially working with people who are really famous in an industry. The idea is to create an affinity for the brand for however that celebrity is known, and to reach the audience that celebrity has been able to attract.\n\nLee adds that people still have the idea that if they convince famous people to talk about their company, then they'll be famous too.\n\nThe reality is that, today, especially in the world of social media, people are empowered to follow their passions to create, curate, connect with others, and attract a following. This allows people\u00a0to create their own influence. Everyone is influential about something, Lee says.\n\nNot just famous people can be part of your influencer marketing program. An influencer can be an\u00a0employee like \"Ted in engineering,\" who has a blog with 5,000 subscribers. Or, it could be that person with a million followers. It could even be customers who are advocating for you every chance they get. When you work with people who have subject matter expertise and an active network, you can advance your brand goals in some really powerful ways.\n\n\n\nOn platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat, there's a whole category of people called creators. They\u00a0have various levels of celebrity, influence, or network size, and have\u00a0anointed themselves as experts. There are marketplaces where brands can go and literally shop for a tweet, an Instagram image, product placement in a YouTube video, etc. For companies in the business of paying to play, it's a good fit.\n\nThere are also brands that want to develop relationships with people who are truly thought leaders in their industry, or up-and-comers. They want to develop relationships, because they have an affinity for each other and have things\u00a0their common audiences care about.\u00a0There's no right or wrong, but it's important when setting expectations to know what you're going to get out of it.\n\nWhat is the\u00a0distinction between a celebrity and a thought leader? Lee brought up an expression he borrowed from Scott Monty, \"brandividual.\" This is someone truly invested in developing his or her own brand, except they're an individual. These professional influencers write books, give keynotes, and do all sorts of amazing things.\n\nLee adds it's an important distinction to make between someone who is exclusively focused on being well-known and someone who is a true thought leader.\u00a0He's\u00a0not saying a brandividual can't be a thought leader. A\u00a0thought leader is someone expressing original thought. They're creating content based on intelligence, experimentation, and observations.\n\nBrian Solis is a great example of a thought leader, Lee says. In addition to being really good at promoting himself, Brian is constantly experimenting. He does research. He interviews. And then collects, analyzes, and interprets the data. His experiments\u00a0and experiences help form the thought leader con...", "duration": "44:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-201-16-06-10.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1464948010, "title": "Launch Strategy: A Case Study in How to Move People to Action", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you planning to release\u00a0a book, podcast, or other product?\n\nWant to make your launch a success?\n\nTo discover how he launched his latest bestselling book,\u00a0I interview Michael Hyatt.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He's also the host of the This Is Your Life podcast and he blogs at MichaelHyatt.com.

Since\u00a0everyone talks\u00a0about digital books, you'd think physical books are obsolete, Michael says. The truth is ebooks are only 25% of the market; the other 75% are physical books. Publishing only in digital format would mean missing the vast majority of the potential market.\n\nFurthermore, as of now, you don't really have a chance to reach any of the major bestsellers lists unless you publish a traditional book, he adds. The New York Times has an ebook bestsellers list, but those are really only for digital editions of physical books. You also don't have much chance of getting any major media unless you publish a physical book, because most of the gatekeepers in traditional media want to see a print book.\n\n\n\nFinally, an ebook doesn't have the same cultural authority as a traditional hardcover book.\u00a0There are a lot of reasons to write a book, but Michael doesn't know of anything that can give you more authority in your niche than having a published book. An ebook is better than nothing, but it's not as good as a traditionally published hardcover book, he says.\n\nThere are other benefits to being a bestselling author. If you're a speaker,\u00a0you can be introduced with that moniker. It also enables you to\u00a0increase the\u00a0prices of whatever you're selling and helps with distribution.\n\nThere's a limited amount of shelf space in conventional bookstores. They are risk-averse in what they order, because they get stuck with books they can't sell. Even though they can return unsold books to the publisher, it's just a hassle, he says. Once your book gets on the bestsellers list, the retailers that didn't initially order your book have to have it all of a sudden.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about Michael's 35-year background in publishing.\n\nAbout Living Forward\n\nMichael says Living Forward is about creating a life plan. Michael wanted to help people stop drifting through life, become intentional, and start designing the outcomes they want. He learned these things when he started working with an executive coach around 2000.\n\n\n\nAfter he became a divisional manager at Thomas Nelson, Michael\u00a0and his team were working like crazy to build up the division. They got to number one in 18 months, but the cost was life balance.\u00a0When Michael\u00a0told\u00a0his friend, author John Maxwell, that he was looking for a\u00a0coach, John introduced him to Daniel Harkavy, the CEO of Building Champions. Daniel became his coach for a decade, as well as\u00a0a good friend. One of the first things Daniel taught Michael was how to create a written life plan.\n\nHis life plan was so transformational that Michael\u00a0began to write about it on his blog.

She discovered the power of Instagram at her\u00a0Cape Cod retail store, which she ran for six years. After\u00a0she started using Instagram, her sales increased significantly, and she realized she needed to teach other business owners how to have that kind of success. Last summer,\u00a0she closed the store to focus on\u00a0growing her online business.\n\nSue first discovered Instagram through her twin daughters. They were scrolling through Instagram one day\u00a0and not\u00a0paying attention to her, so she asked what they were up to.\u00a0They said, \"Mom, we're on Instagram. Don't get on it, because then you're going to start teaching it.\"\n\nPay attention to your teenagers, Sue adds, because they're setting the next mobile trend.\n\n\n\nInstagram\u00a0is growing very quickly. At the time of this recording, it has\u00a0400 million\u00a0users and\u00a0Sue believes they'll\u00a0soon announce they're at 500 million active users. They project it to be one billion in three years.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about Sue's retail store on Cape Cod.\n\nWhat's new with Instagram\n\nSue explains several new Instagram features.\n\nFirst, you can now send direct messages from an Instagram comment via mobile. When you open up Instagram and\u00a0see a post you want to send privately to your team, just click on the arrow to the left of the comment and send it as a direct message. All you have to do is @mention the person you want to see it.\n\nDirect messaging is one of the most underutilized features of Instagram, Sue believes. A lot of people don't use direct messaging\u00a0for their business.\u00a0For example, when you see something that reminds you of a client or someone you want to collaborate with, you can easily send it to them as an idea without having to publicly post on that feed.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the desktop has had a lot of great updates.\n\nLooking at the desktop version of Instagram, you'll see\u00a0three icons on\u00a0the right-hand side.\u00a0Click on the\u00a0explore button that looks like a compass,\u00a0and Instagram suggests people for you to discover, based on your activity. In the middle, click on the heart icon to\u00a0see notifications. The icon on the far right goes to your profile.\n\nPlus you can now comment from\u00a0the desktop, which is something people have wanted to do for a very long time.\n\n\n\nOn the far left, clicking on \"Instagram\" takes you to the home feed, so you can easily scroll through it\u00a0on your\u00a0desktop.\u00a0Sue says she doesn't use the desktop much, unless she's using\u00a0Iconosquare. Additionally, she notes that you can't upload photos from your desktop unless you use an app like Later.\n\nSue also shares a couple of things people need to know about video.\n\nFirst,\u00a0video on Instagram is now up to 60 seconds, which is great for people who really want to give demonstrations, do\u00a0behind-the-scenes content, or announce their podcasts with video teasers.", "duration": "45:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-199-16-05-27.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1463738408, "title": "Content Creation Hacks: How to Quickly Produce Valuable Content", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you create content for your business?\n\nLooking for an easier way to make your content work for you?\n\nDiscover easy ways to create and repurpose your content, courtesy of Nick Westergaard.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Nick Westergaard, host of the On Brand Podcast and chief brand strategist at social and content agency Brand Driven Digital. Nick is also the author of Get Scrappy: Smart Digital Marketing for Businesses Big and Small.\n\nNick explores easy ways to create quality content.\n\nYou'll also discover how to repurpose recent and historical material.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nContent Creation Hacks\nNick's story\n\nWestergaard Advertising began\u00a035 years ago in Iowa when Nick's\u00a0father and now business partner started what was a small, general, traditional advertising agency. Nick had worked with brands\u00a0in the early days of online marketing, specifically\u00a0for\u00a0educational publishing companies when digital really started to grow.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, Nick started moonlighting\u00a0as a freelancer\u00a0for the family business. Eventually he would come in\u00a0as\u00a0a partner. In addition to changing the kind of work Westergaard Advertising specialized in, they morphed into brand-driven digital to\u00a0help organizations build better brands online through social media and content marketing.\n\n\n\nNick's book, Get Scrappy, came from a phrase he found himself saying\u00a0often.\u00a0Nick does a lot of public speaking, and says it was\u00a0one of those experiences where he\u00a0quickly dashed off a title for a new speech. Then when it came time to write it, the\u00a0topic took root and excited him. Plus, he was able to draw on work he did with clients of all shapes and sizes.\n\n\"Get Scrappy\" was a common thread.\u00a0Whether it's an entrepreneurial startup, solo small business, medium-sized business, or a larger marketing team, everybody's looking to get scrappy \u2013 to do more with less.\n\nFor instance, Nick talks about working\u00a0with nostalgic brand\u00a0Schwinn Bikes, and how it's\u00a0easy to think of them as a big brand, but they're really a small,\u00a0scrappy team at the headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin. Nick talked\u00a0with them about this idea of getting scrappy.\u00a0Schwinn's\u00a0social media manager\u00a0Samantha Hersil\u00a0summed it up best.\n\n\"We could all use a few people and a few dollars more,\" Hersil said.\u00a0That's really at the heart of the book.\n\nListen to the show to discover\u00a0how Nick's business has changed over the last 10 years.\n\nWhy marketers object to creating content\n\nContent is a tricky animal, Nick explains, so it takes a\u00a0content marketing mindset. Some of the obstacles marketers\u00a0encounter are from lack of a sound content strategy.\n\nThe\u00a0Content Marketing Institute\u00a0reports that\u00a0many people fly\u00a0blind when it comes to content strategy. It's both an obstacle and an internal objection, because companies\u00a0are just jumping on the content marketing\u00a0bandwagon.\n\nBoth in terms of social channels and content, Nick thinks it's easy to fall into the trap of what he calls \"checklist marketing.\" Marketers do everything they\u00a0hear about: they have a presence on every network, create every form of content, and so forth. Nick thinks if people instead develop a strategy with a business objective, their\u00a0content will be better aligned with their business.\n\n\n\nContent\u00a0used to be driven by the written word, Nick explains. As people scoot up to that podcasting microphone and hit the Record button with video, they get scared. There's a ripple effect, as well.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Tom Webster, vice president of strategy and marketing at Edison Research and co-host of the Marketing Companion podcast. Tom is a specialist in consumer behavior and media consumption.\n\nTom will explore his brand-new research from The Infinite Dial, focused on Snapchat and podcast adoption.\n\nYou'll discover reasons to embrace Snapchat and podcasting for\u00a0your business.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nSnapchat Growth\nAbout the study\n\nResearch from\u00a0The Infinite Dial\u00a0series dates back to\u00a01998, according to Tom, and it's the longest-running study on digital habits, behaviors, and consumption. They have trending graphs for areas, such as Internet radio, that go back to 1998. Plus, they've measured all kinds of behaviors and patterns in relation to consumption of audio, video, social, and mobile. Tom has been involved with the study and has been\u00a0the voice of the studies on webinars since 2004.\n\n\n\nWhen the series started in 1998, it was focused more on digital audio. While today's brands and streaming audio like Pandora and Spotify\u00a0weren't around back then, there were plenty of others. For example there was Broadcast.com, which Mark Cuban sold to Yahoo,\u00a0NetRadio, Spinner, AOL\u00a0Radio, and lots of other fledgling brands, Tom explains. The survey was a\u00a0means to track them and put them in their place in the universe.\n\nAs behaviors started to migrate to various media (as opposed to the text-driven medium that it had been previously), The Infinite Dial\u00a0started tracking that too. Over the years, they added podcasting, social media, and so on. Essentially, if people\u00a0do it online, The Infinite Dial is interested in measuring how it's consumed.\n\nThe Infinite Dial's goal was always to create the survey of record in the various fields covered, so they spend nearly six figures in hard costs on mobile and landline telephone sampling to make a study that's random, representative, and projectable to the United States population.\n\nTom\u00a0loves coming out with new facts every year that corroborate what he sees people do online.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about the survey sampling and why they survey via telephone.\n\nPodcast growth\n\nOne of the things Tom\u00a0loves about doing survey research is that although it reflects the current state of America, it typically lags behind what the digerati think. It can lag by quite a bit, he says, but if it's a real thing, it eventually gets there.\n\n\n\nThe Infinite Dial added podcast\u00a0tracking back in 2007. Two years ago, before Serial\u00a0popularized podcasting, research showed that 15% of Americans 12+ listened to a podcast in the past 12 months. While that's a huge number (tens and\u00a0tens of millions of Americans),\u00a0it\u00a0had been growing steadily, but not exponentially.\n\nPodcasting inched\u00a0up from 9% in 2008 to 11% to 2009. And to 12% in 2010. For a short time, podcasting plateaued before jumping to 15% in 2014. After\u00a0Serial came out, there was enormous advertiser, brand, and insider interest in podcasting. Listenership\u00a0went from 15% in 2014 to 17% in 2015. In 2016, podcast listening has\u00a0surpassed\u00a021% already. That's a 24% increase year over year in the percentage of Americans who listened to a podcast.\n\n\n\nThe Serial effect didn't happen immediately, Tom continues, although it made\u00a0people a lot more aware of the on-demand content out ther...", "duration": "40:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-197-16-05-13.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1462528848, "title": "Social Media Visuals: How to Easily Create Visuals Without a Designer", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use visuals in your social media?\n\nWant tools and tips to help you create images?\n\nTo discover how to create great social media visuals when you're not a designer, I interview Donna Moritz.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Donna Moritz. Donna is a visual marketing expert, and her blog Socially Sorted\u00a0was recognized as one of Social Media Examiner's Top 10 Social Media Blogs in 2015 and 2016.\n\nDonna\u00a0will share why social media marketers should care about visuals.\n\nYou'll discover what to consider\u00a0before you design images for social media and learn about new tools to help you.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nSocial Media Visuals\nWhy care about visuals?\n\nBecause the news feed is so busy\u00a0these days, Donna explains, marketers need to do everything they can to capture attention. She says visuals catch that attention and typically\u00a0drive users\u00a0to take some sort of action because visuals support an emotional connection.\n\nDonna points out that the fastest-growing channels such as Periscope and Snapchat are highly focused on visual content, as are Instagram and Pinterest. She also notes that traditional platforms Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter are giving more attention to visual content and users are\u00a044% more likely to engage with content that contains pictures.\n\n\n\nVideo is also on the rise, Donna adds. Socialbakers research shows that brands are now uploading more video directly to Facebook than YouTube, and about 80% of all video engagement is coming from Facebook native video. And that's before Facebook Live is really being measured.\u00a0Plus, she says,\u00a0110 years of video footage is watched on Periscope\u00a0every day.\n\nAccording to the Content Marketing Institute, out of a range of priorities for content creators, visual content is in the top three.\n\nVisual content is\u00a0a very important topic because it works. Marketers just need to find out where to start and how to produce and use images\u00a0efficiently.\n\nListen to the show to discover the current standard image format and how image sizes have changed.\n\nGetting started with images\n\nBefore you start to design images, Donna says you\u00a0need to think about what types of visual content\u00a0get shared well on which platforms. Content that's effective on Facebook might be different from what works on Instagram, which might be different from\u00a0Twitter.\n\nShe's seen people get overwhelmed trying to do visual content on every platform, and advises that it's better\u00a0to focus on visuals for one particular platform at a time. She also cautions that you shouldn't\u00a0jump into visuals on a new platform until you have systems in place for visuals on the one before it.\n\nDonna shares her Visual Content Blueprint, which is five elements to help you\u00a0create images that work.\n\n\n\nFirst, decide what the image is going to be in regards to what works on the targeted platform (more on this later).\u00a0Then consider\u00a0the call to action. It\u00a0could be asking for more connection or engagement (likes or comments), driving more\u00a0shares or click-throughs, or a combination.\n\nNext,\u00a0think about your landing content (where people arrive when they click through or share). Will people\u00a0get\u00a0more information, blog content, a free download, or something else of value?\n\nAfter that, make sure users\u00a0are achieving some sort of goal. Do you want them to sign\u00a0up for something, read a blog post, or stay on your website?\n\nDonna recommends that every image be able to stand alone. That way, if something is pinned or shared out of context, people will still understand what you're offering and how to get it.", "duration": "46:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-196-16-05-06.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1461924014, "title": "Google AMP: What Bloggers Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Have you heard of Google AMP?\n\nWant to know how it will impact your blog?\n\nTo discover more about Google AMP and the future of blogging, I interview Leslie Samuel.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Leslie Samuel, who runs BecomeABlogger.com, where he teaches people how to blog with purpose. He's also host of the Learning With Leslie podcast and head of training for Social Media Examiner's Social Media Marketing Society.\n\nLeslie will explore Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project and what it means for bloggers.\n\nYou'll discover how to install Google AMP and related plugins on your WordPress blog.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nGoogle AMP\nWhat is Google AMP\n\nGoogle AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages, and is\u00a0a collaboration with a number of tech companies. Its goal is to improve the performance of websites on mobile devices, which in turn improves user experience.\n\nKissmetrics did a study, which found that 40% of mobile users leave a page if it doesn't load in three seconds. When that happens,\u00a0these\u00a0users don't see the publisher's ads, products, services, or events.\u00a0AMP pages\u00a0load 10 times faster and use 10 times less data.\n\nPlus, when people\u00a0view a website\u00a0on\u00a0a mobile device, pop ups (such as ads and opt-in boxes) take\u00a0up the entire page. There's such a small amount of real estate on a smartphone, the pop-ups\u00a0really inhibit\u00a0the user experience.\n\nGoogle has already started placing\u00a0Google AMP pages above non-Google AMP pages to mobile users in search. If you\u00a0do a search\u00a0for any popular topic, like politics, on your smartphone, only sites that have accelerated mobile pages enabled will show up in the top stories section.\n\n\n\nThis is just the beginning. In the future AMP will be even more wide-spread.\n\nListen to the show to learn how the Facebook Instant Articles feature is similar to Google AMP.\n\nPros and cons of AMP\n\nIn addition to the benefit of\u00a0preferential treatment in search, AMP's faster load times should decrease website\u00a0abandonment and increase content consumption.\n\nBefore discussing\u00a0the cons, Leslie noted\u00a0one thing in terms of how AMP is\u00a0set up.\n\nWhen someone clicks on an AMP enabled\u00a0article on their mobile device, \"/amp\" is added to the URL, essentially creating a second link. (For example, a\u00a0Social Media Examiner article with\u00a0AMP would have the URL\u00a0socialmediaexaminer.com/ARTICLE-TITLE/amp.) There are now two links:\u00a0the original link\u00a0from the desktop article and the second from mobile (with /amp at\u00a0the end), which is what Google will show above\u00a0the initial\u00a0version.\n\n\n\nThe AMP project is able to speed up websites because it strips away a lot of the unique elements, such as style sheets and JavaScript, that make a\u00a0website look and function in a specific way.\n\nAMP sites have specific standard dimensions, and elements\u00a0such as\u00a0sidebars, headers and comments are\u00a0gone. However, there is still a lot you\u00a0can do with design, Leslie explains. For instance, you can change fonts and colors, add a logo, and more. It just\u00a0will not be as extensive as what you have on your website.\n\nArticles with AMP show a single\u00a0column that holds both\u00a0text\u00a0and\u00a0images, so people won't see anything you promote\u00a0in the masthead and sidebar on your regular, desktop website.\u00a0Leslie says while the AP version of some sites may\u00a0not be as advanced as the desktop experience, they still look pretty nice. For example, The Washington Post has a\u00a0simple top with their\u00a0logo. Then,\u00a0when you scroll down, you see other posts, social media links, and so on.", "duration": "45:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-195-16-04-29.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1461319243, "title": "Pinterest Tactics: How to Grow Your Pinterest Following and Your Traffic", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you post on Pinterest?\n\nWant to shake up your strategy?\n\nTo discover what, how, and when to post on Pinterest, I interview Jeff Sieh.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Jeff Sieh, founder of ManlyPinterestTips.com and host of the Manly Pinterest Tips podcast. Jeff also oversees Social Media Examiner's Pinterest account.\n\nJeff will explore proven tactics to grow your following and your website traffic with Pinterest.\n\nYou'll discover what's new with Pinterest, including promoted pins.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nPinterest Tactics\nWhat's new with Pinterest\n\nAfter about a year and a half of testing, the do-it-yourself option for promoted pins (Pinterest's ad product) is now available to all small businesses in the United States. Features include a bulk editor, so you can add\u00a0a lot of pins at once, and more forms of targeting.\n\nFor example, there were only 30 possible interests to target when promoting a pin, and\u00a0now there are 420; instead of targeting someone interested in men's clothing, you can be as specific as\u00a0men's shoes.\n\nPinterest\u00a0also added keyword targeting, so you can combine interest and keyword targeting. It's a great way to find a\u00a0specific audience when you promote a product or blog post.\n\n\n\nPromoted pins are just like regular pins, only you pay to have them seen by more people. They perform just as well as, if not better than, organic pins.\n\nThe promoted pins in your feed are based on your interests and activity\u00a0on Pinterest. They also take some off-site data, collected for Pinterest's ad partners.\u00a0In your home feed, you will see suggested for you or sponsored by pins. If you don't want to see something, tap the X beside it and click on Hide this Pin. Pinterest uses that feedback to make sure you see relevant, promoted pins in the future.\n\nMore people see your\u00a0promoted pins. Plus,\u00a0you get\u00a0an extra 20% boost, because you only pay for the\u00a0first click. For instance, let's say\u00a0Jeff promotes a pin that points\u00a0back to his website, and you\u00a0click on it and repin it. Then, someone else pins it from your\u00a0board to their account. Jeff does\u00a0not pay for the secondary repins. He only pays for that first one.\n\nWhen I asked Jeff about entry level price points, he\u00a0says he\u00a0thinks you have to start with at least $1 a day. Jeff has seen results by spending $5 a day, and believes it's worth testing,\u00a0especially with the new targeting features, to see how much traffic you can get to your website.\n\nPinterest\u00a0also has\u00a0customer targeting, which allows you to upload your email addresses.

He asked\u00a0Parker to send him his textbooks when he was finished with them\u00a0because he\u00a0wanted to see what they were\u00a0teaching his son to prepare him for Hollywood, the most competitive storytelling place in the universe.\n\nOne of the screenwriting books was\u00a0Save the Cat! by Blake Snyder. Blake,\u00a0who Park says\u00a0sold more family-oriented screenplays in the 1980s than anybody else,\u00a0had a prescription\u00a0for\u00a0the 15 beats to a story.\n\nAccording to Blake, a\u00a0screenplay needs to be the same number of pages as the weight of a jockey\u00a0(110), and Blake could\u00a0tell you on each page (within a page or two) what needed to happen. Although it sounds formulaic, it\u00a0worked very well for Blake and many other writers, Park adds, and the approach fascinated him.\n\n\n\nWhen Park was\u00a0introduced to the work of\u00a0Joseph Campbell,\u00a0America's foremost mythologist, he noted\u00a0how\u00a0Blake had adapted Campbell's\u00a0The Hero's Journey, or\u00a0what\u00a0Joseph called the monomyth, a 17-step process for\u00a0story structure.\n\nDuring the time\u00a0Park was reading through The Hero's Journey, he was\u00a0looking at a brand strategy plan and\u00a0realized he was already\u00a0following this story structure with his plan.\u00a0Park wondered what would happen if\u00a0he was\u00a0intentional about it.\n\n\n\nPark boiled down\u00a0the steps of\u00a0the Hero's Journey to 10 steps for\u00a0business, and used it to guide the creation of\u00a0content to tell a story that would\u00a0make a difference. To Park's amazement, it worked, so he\u00a0fine-tuned it into what he calls the Story Cycle, a process that can be\u00a0used for everything from high-level brand strategy to the creation of a 30-second TV spot.\n\n\n\nIn the social media world, you just have a small blip\u00a0of time to communicate a story. Park explains\u00a0that you can get that story across if you follow the three fundamental principles of the three-act play: start with\u00a0a setup, introduce conflict, and resolve it.\n\nHe shares that if you can do it in a 6-second Vine video, you will have connected with the deep reaches of your audience's\u00a0minds.\n\nListen to the show to learn about Park's background in music, as well as\u00a0his comparisons between music and\u00a0story.\n\nWhy marketers should care about stories\n\nPark believes that stories are people's\u00a0superpowers, and says\u00a0the brain is hardwired to constantly search for them. Humans\u00a0can go weeks without eating and days without drinking, but only roughly 35 seconds without their\u00a0brains scanning the\u00a0environment to create meaning out of what they see.\n\nPark explains how while one\u00a0son was studying film and Park was studying what Hollywood knows about story structure,", "duration": "43:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-193-16-04-15.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1460109659, "title": "The Art of Persuasion: How to Craft Words That Sell", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do your words sell?\n\nWant to sharpen your copywriting skills?\n\nTo explore the art of persuasion and why it's important to social marketers, I interview Ray Edwards.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He's host of The Ray Edwards Show.

His grandmother loved to read Weekly World News and The National Enquirer, and\u00a0Ray's favorite part of those tabloids was the fascinating, full-page articles that were peppered with information about books and courses that were available\u00a0for\u00a0purchase.\n\nThose stories had headlines like, \"Turn Your Mind Into a Mental Magnet That Attracts Friends, Power, Love, and Money\" and \"How Modern Chinese Medicine Helps Burn Disease Out of Your Body, Using Nothing More Than the Palm of Your Hand.\" Ray later\u00a0learned these were not articles; they were full-page ads written by Eugene Schwartz, who\u00a0was \"a genius with direct-response copy.\"\n\nDuring his career in radio, Ray studied direct-response copywriting and marketing, and used them as his secret weapon in the business. While others\u00a0were cranking\u00a0out commercials and ad copy to fill 30- or 60-second spots, Ray wanted to get money into advertisers' businesses. That way they would keep doing business with the station and he could keep his job.\n\nIn the early 2000s, radio started changing because of the Internet. People could take their favorite songs with them, which\u00a0eliminated the\u00a0things that annoy people about radio stations: static, commercials, and DJs.\n\nRay recalls paying\u00a0$1,200 to go to a group meeting at Seth Godin's office in New York. (This was before Seth\u00a0was as\u00a0big as\u00a0he is now, but after he had written Permission Marketing and Unleashing the Ideavirus.) Ray figured Seth could offer\u00a0\"marketing wizardry\" about how to fix the\u00a0radio stations, but Seth's advice to Ray was\u00a0to figure out\u00a0what\u00a0to do after\u00a0he\u00a0was out of the radio broadcasting industry.\n\n\n\nRay realized everything\u00a0he'd learned about marketing, persuasion, and selling in an entertaining and palatable way would transfer to the Internet. He hung out his shingle and has been working as an Internet copywriter\u00a0since 2005.\n\nListen to the show to discover which client (and handler) Ray and Mike had in common.\n\nThe importance of persuasive content\n\nMarketers need to write so people will buy not only products, but also\u00a0ideas. You want people to read your\u00a0blog posts to\u00a0the end, comment on or share them, or write about them. Ray explains that you know you're writing persuasively when other people are writing about your posts.\u00a0You're the generator of the conversation, not only\u00a0a participant.\n\nHe says that at it's core, copywriting is the science and craft of persuasion in communication. Whether you're\u00a0talking, writing a blog post, doing an interview, recording a podcast, or posting on Snapchat, every communication\u00a0is\u00a0persuasion.\n\nListen to the show to learn\u00a0why Mike feels this topic is so important.\n\nRay's system for persuasion\n\nBecause\u00a0everyone is present\u00a0on the social media playing field, you have to be persuasive\u00a0and stand out.", "duration": "46:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-192-16-04-08.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1459504834, "title": "Blog Comments Revisited: Why Major Bloggers Are Turning Comments Back On", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have comments enabled on your blog?\n\nHave you ever turned them off?\n\nTo discover why big bloggers turned their comment systems back on, I interview Michael Hyatt and Brian Clark.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Michael Hyatt and Brian Clark. Michael is author of Platform and co-author of the new book, Living Forward: A Proven Plan to Stop Drifting and Get the Life You Want. He's also an avid blogger at MichaelHyatt.com and host of the This Is Your Life podcast. Brian is CEO of Rainmaker Digital, founder of Copyblogger, host of the Unemployable podcast, and evangelist for the Rainmaker Platform.\n\nBack in May 2014, I had Mark Schaefer and Tim McDonald (who was with Huffington Post) on the show to talk about the trend of big blogs shutting down their comments.\u00a0This was spurred by a controversial post from Copyblogger entitled, \"Why We\u2019re Removing Comments on Copyblogger\" from March 2014. In January 2015, Michael Hyatt published, \"I\u2019ve Pulled Comments from My Blog-Here\u2019s Why.\"\n\nMichael and Brian will explore why the initial decision to remove comments was made and why those comments are now back.\n\nYou'll also discover tips for how to grow your email list.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nBlog Comments Revisited\nWhy Brian shut down comments\n\nBrian starts by saying he is not the one who made the decision to shut down or bring back blog comments. He left that up to his editorial team.\n\nOn Copyblogger, a lot of the article\u00a0feedback shifted\u00a0to social media, while the product development feedback had\u00a0moved\u00a0over to their customer base. As you mature as a company, you really start listening to your existing customers, as opposed to those \"out in the wild,\" Brian explains. At the time, they had 150,000 customers and their strategy was to pay more attention to them.\n\nPart of the\u00a0decision to remove comments (not discussed in the post by Sonia Simone, who ultimately made the decision with input from the editorial team) was\u00a0a situation Brian\u00a0calls the six-month class of current commenters.\n\nWhen you publish a marketing blog, other marketers use commenting as a traffic strategy.\u00a0You'd have six months of the same people showing up, leaving comments: some stupid, some thoughtful. Then they'd move on and a new group of people would come into the comments.\n\n\n\nThe practical reasons for removing comments were the shift to social and to eliminate spam. It's a big deal to moderate comments and have the editorial team spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out whether something is spam or legitimate.\n\nCopyblogger's experiment to remove comments lasted\u00a0for over a year.\n\nListen to the show to learn why\u00a0Brian left comments on their podcast network, Rainmaker.fm.\n\nWhy Michael shut down comments\n\nMichael says his reasons for shutting down comments on his blog were similar to Brian's.\u00a0Additionally, Michael noticed the number of comments per post had been going down for some time, so he decided to do a little research.\n\nHe discovered that in 2011, he averaged\u00a0about 195 comments per blog post. Then in 2012, while his traffic went\u00a0up, his comments dropped to an average of 179. Traffic went up again in 2013, and the average number of comments went down to\u00a0114.\u00a0In 2014 blog traffic was up 74% over the previous year, but the average number of comments had dropped down to about 62 per post.\n\n\n\nMichael adds he read Greg McKeown's book,\u00a0Essentialism,\u00a0and thought he had to\u00a0pare\u00a0stuff back.\n\nThe final straw for Michael, who was and is using Disqus as his commenting platform,", "duration": "47:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-191-16-04-01.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1458900027, "title": "Facebook Ads Strategy: How Marketers Need to Alter Their Techniques", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use Facebook ads?\n\nWant to learn the latest strategies?\n\nTo discover what's changed with Facebook ads and how to get better results, I interview Rick Mulready.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He did everything from banner and\u00a0video ads\u00a0to\u00a0search and\u00a0text advertising. Rick got into Facebook ads around 2010, while still in the corporate world.\n\nThis was when\u00a0Facebook was making a name for itself as a social platform, when small businesses\u00a0could post on their\u00a0pages and people would see it, and\u00a0when Facebook started to allow\u00a0business to advertise.\n\nRick loved Facebook advertising. He saw the power in it, and taught himself as much as he could. He started running campaigns for entrepreneur friends while still in corporate, and the rest is history.\u00a0Rick left his job at the end of 2012 and has been specializing in Facebook ads ever since.\n\n\n\nFor the first couple of years, Rick focused on social media in general. He hosted\u00a0the Inside Social Media podcast, where he interviewed the heads of social media from some of the biggest brands around the world. That was great, yet Rick still gravitated\u00a0toward the Facebook ad side.\n\nIn January 2015, Rick started the Art of Paid Traffic podcast, where he\u00a0covers Facebook advertising and everything else to do with paid traffic such as YouTube ads, copywriting, landing pages, metrics, analytics, and so on. It's a combination of case studies, interviews with experts, and solo shows.\n\nListen to the show to learn why only big businesses could really\u00a0utilize Facebook ads in 2010.\n\nHow Facebook Ads has evolved\n\nA lot has changed in Facebook advertising \u2013 such as targeting \u2013 over the past year or so, Rick says. For instance, you can upload your email list and create a targeted audience out of them. Also, you can retarget people coming to your website or a landing page.\n\nWhen most people think of targeting, they think of interest targeting, which is targeting fans of another page or somebody in their\u00a0space. Facebook has recently\u00a0rolled out detailed targeting. Before, if you wanted to target fans of Social Media Examiner or Entrepreneur Magazine, you\u00a0could only do one or the other. Now, you\u00a0can set up ads to target people who have an interest in Social Media Examiner and Entrepreneur Magazine.\n\nTo\u00a0take it a step further, you can\u00a0exclude an audience. For instance, target fans of Social Media Examiner and Entrepreneur magazine, but exclude people who like Inc. Magazine. It's a much more\u00a0detailed subset of that audience.\n\n\n\nWhen Facebook reported its Q4 earnings, they basically said\u00a0their\u00a0customer is not the advertiser. While\u00a0they're making money off of advertising, their customers are the 1.5 billion Facebook users. Facebook recognizes that without these users, they won't have people coming to advertise on the platform. Therefore,\u00a0Facebook is protecting the user experience. They want to make sure advertisers think of\u00a0value first to take care of Facebook users.\n\nWhile you can still run an ad to an opt-in or registration page,", "duration": "40:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-190-16-03-25.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1458295240, "title": "Periscope: How Your Business Can Benefit From Live Video", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you broadcast on Periscope?\n\nWant to use it to connect with and grow\u00a0your audience?\n\nTo discover how to use Periscope for your business, I interview Kim Garst.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

So, while in a pedicab heading over to that night's Social Media Marketing World networking event, she did a quick scope with\u00a0Donna Moritz.\n\n\n\nKim's second Periscope came about a month later, when she was covering an event. One of the keynotes was Ashton Kutcher and she\u00a0decided to open up her phone, broadcast the keynote, and see what happened.\u00a0Although Kim had very little Periscope experience and a nearly nonexistent audience on the platform, a few people tuned in and left comments.\n\nHer third Periscope was the\u00a0most eye-opening because that's when Kim realized she could use the platform for business. She had Syed Balkhi on a webinar and decided to live broadcast it to her Periscope audience\u00a0by putting her\u00a0phone on her computer screen and holding a mic up to the sound source.\n\nKim\u00a0shares that with no prep, she simply opened up her phone, typed in the webinar title, and invited people to tune in. More than\u00a0200 people watched the broadcast.\n\n\n\nKim soon realized Periscope\u00a0could be an amazing medium \u2013 not just to deliver content, but also to connect with people.\n\nListen to the show to hear why Kim believes live-streaming is the beginning of Web 3.0.\n\nPeriscope strategy\n\nKim shares that one strategy she's capitalized on is leveraging Periscope to create multiple pieces of content. She comes up with one or two blog topics for the week, writes down bullet points and research she wants to reference, and then gets on Periscope and speaks her blog content.\n\nFor example, if the topic is 10 Ways to Do X,\u00a0she'll jot down the 10 ways and talk through them during the scope. When she's through, Kim sends the recording out for transcription. When the transcription comes back to her, she has a blog post. Kim then\u00a0takes that same scope material\u00a0and turns it into 50+ additional pieces of content.\n\n\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on how she does that, Kim explains that when people talk,\u00a0certain nuggets of information they share\u00a0are\u00a0what she refers to as \"tweetable moments.\"\n\nShe pulls those nuggets out of her scopes and turns them into\u00a0visual content, straight-up text tweets or Facebook page posts, or even a\u00a0SlideShare. Kim stresses that there are tons of ways to create multiple pieces content from talking it through on Periscope.\n\n\n\nKim shares the benefits of speaking her blog posts and how she uses the feedback people give her inside her scopes to see if she missed anything she needs to cover in the written post.\n\nKim tries to keep her Periscopes short, sweet, and actionable,", "duration": "44:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-189-16-03-18.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1457694054, "title": "How Gary Vaynerchuk Turned a Video Series Into a Popular Book", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use videos to enhance your brand?\n\nWant to find ways to grow your business?\n\nTo discover how he created a video series that exploded his personal brand and his business, I interview Gary Vaynerchuk.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

At 14 years old, he started working for his dad bagging ice for $2 an hour\u00a0and by his third day on the job was plotting how to open 4,000 wine stores.\n\nAlthough\u00a0a lot of people think Wine Library TV grew his\u00a0business, Gary clarifies that he'd been in business for over a decade and built a $50 million+ operation before he started\u00a0Wine Library TV\u00a0and talking about marketing.\n\nGary launched Wine Library TV on February 1, 2006, which was\u00a0less than a year after YouTube had been created. He says that while the show didn't really pop until the summer of 2007, he felt there were enough comments\u00a0to make it worthwhile. He notes that\u00a0Ze Frank and Rocketboom\u00a0were also\u00a0making some\u00a0noise around the same time.\n\n\n\nGary's patience paid off and when he ended up on the Conan O'Brien Show, Lifehacker, TechCrunch, and Diggnation, everything exploded.\n\nListen to the show to discover how and when Gary discovered he was good at being a personality.\n\nThe start of #AskGaryVee\n\nDuring the summer of 2014, D Rock\u00a0(David Rock) emailed Gary, asking to\u00a0make a film about him. Gary\u00a0agreed\u00a0and before the film even aired, Gary asked David\u00a0to work for him full time doing video content.\n\nThen on a random day a year and a half ago, Gary invited\u00a0David and Steve Unwin from his\u00a0editorial team into his office\u00a0to shoot\u00a0the\u00a0first episode of #AskGaryVee, in which Gary answered\u00a0random questions people asked him on Twitter.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76d0lQiCqNI\n\nWhen asked how the format for the show came about, Gary shares that he felt his keynotes were stagnating because he was telling the same story over and over. To get out of that rut, he started pushing event organizers to let him add a Q&amp;A component to his presentations.\u00a0For example, during\u00a0a 45-minute keynote, he would do 30 minutes of speech and 15 minutes of Q&amp;A.\n\nGary believes his ability to answer\u00a0any question about business, social media, technology, or branding off the cuff is what separates him from other speakers.\n\nGary realized he didn't need to travel to answer questions\u00a0and he could\u00a0use the\u00a0video show to deliver something he was really good at. Then, he made the decision to use it to get to the point where his keynote speeches were solely Q&amp;A sessions.\n\nGary explains that the format for #AskGaryVee is simple. They\u00a0go into an all-glass conference room at VaynerMedia,\u00a0Gary sits down in front of the\u00a0camera, and\u00a0India\u00a0asks him five questions that come from\u00a0social media (Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook), which Gary\u00a0answers in one take. Any edited spots, which are rare, go to black and white\u00a0so they're clearly recognizable.\n\nIn addition to #AskGaryVee, Gary recently started\u00a0#DailyVee, which is a day-in-the-life vlog\u00a0that gets edited into episodes\u00a0to help\u00a0entrep...", "duration": "39:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-188-16-03-11.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1457089200, "title": "Facebook Live: Why Live Video Matters for Marketers", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Have you tried Facebook Live video broadcasting?\n\nWant to know what it means for your business?\n\nTo discover how to use Facebook Live, I interview Mari Smith.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Mari Smith, the world's leading Facebook marketing expert. She co-authored Facebook Marketing: An Hour a Day and is author of The New Relationship Marketing. Mari has also teamed up with Facebook to assist in educational events.\n\nMari will explore Facebook Live, how it works, what it means for marketers, and much more.\n\nYou'll discover tips to set up your Facebook Live broadcast.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nFacebook Live\nWhat Is Facebook Live?\n\nFacebook Live is like Periscope, Meerkat, MeVee, and a few other apps\u00a0that let you\u00a0stream live video from your mobile device.\n\nMari loves Facebook Live because\u00a0whether you\u00a0use the live-streaming feature with your personal profile or your page, you have a built-in audience. When you go live, the\u00a0video goes out in the notifications and in the news feed and gets great organic reach.\n\nMari believes\u00a0Facebook Live video is great for marketers because it\u00a0gives the ability to create a intimate, authentic connection with your audience. It humanizes and personalizes your brand.\n\n\n\nShe clarifies\u00a0that you don't need to download anything extra to stream with Facebook Live\u00a0on your profile; it's part of the\u00a0Facebook iOS app. Mari points out that Live is\u00a0different from Facebook\u00a0Mentions, which is only available to verified Facebook users.\n\nAt the time this episode was\u00a0recorded,\u00a0all iPhone users had Facebook Live on their personal profiles in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand, Japan, and most English-speaking countries. On February 26, 2016, Facebook announced they'd opened Live to more countries, as well as Android users.\n\nListen to the show to hear about Mike's first experience with using Facebook Live.\n\nFacebook Live for business\n\nMari says when you use\u00a0Facebook Live through your personal profile, you get to choose the audience. You can broadcast to\u00a0the public, friends only, a specific friends list, or just a few friends. Since\u00a0one of the keys from a business perspective is to\u00a0broadcast live and then share it to your page, you want to go with a public broadcast. Then once\u00a0it's\u00a0been shared to\u00a0your page, you can boost the post\u00a0to\u00a0reach a wider audience.\n\nWhen asked for examples of people using Live, Mari shares that\u00a0Guy Kawasaki uses Live regularly from his page to show equipment or where he is and what he's doing. She also points to\u00a0Robert Scoble, who uses Live regularly from his profile to do\u00a0tech updates.\n\n\n\nMari says she really enjoys what\u00a0Carol Tuttle\u00a0is doing. Carol does\u00a0a Blog Talk Radio show that she simultaneously\u00a0broadcasts on\u00a0Facebook Live, and then hosts on iTunes as a podcast. From\u00a0her Facebook Live post on her page, she shares the iTunes subscription link and the show's call-in number.\n\nMari shares that she watched\u00a0fitness expert\u00a0Christine Dwyer\u00a0live-stream her turbo kickbox jam class. Christine\u00a0set up the camera on a tripod\u00a0and\u00a0pointed it into the mirror, so viewers were able to\u00a0see the scope of the room and Christine\u00a0teaching the class. She had\u00a0a very nice, engaged audience.\n\n\n\nMari is quick to remind listeners that while she's sharing great examples, the idea is to focus\u00a0more on the application of Live and how people can use it within their industry.\n\nFor example,\u00a0Doreen Virtue, one of the top experts on angels, uses Facebook Live broadcasts on a regular basis\u00a0to\u00a0give people special messages....", "duration": "44:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-187-16-03-04.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1456484421, "title": "16 Twitter Tools for Social Media Marketers", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use Twitter in your social media marketing?\n\nWant to be\u00a0more efficient and productive on the platform?\n\nTo talk about a wide range of Twitter tools for social media marketers, I interview Ian Anderson Gray.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview social tools expert Ian Anderson Gray. Ian blogs about social tools at Seriously Social, which can be found at iag.me. He's\u00a0also\u00a0a website developer, speaker, and social media consultant.\n\nIan will explore a slew of Twitter tools for marketers.\n\nYou'll discover tools for social sharing, managing followers, analytics, and more.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\n16 Twitter Tools for Social Media Marketers\nIan's background\n\nAfter college, Ian says he got started in the technology sphere by building websites\u00a0at the\u00a0web agency he founded. Then, about five or six\u00a0years ago, he became interested in social media and started\u00a0blogging at Seriously Social.\n\n\n\nHe shares that he was most interested in the tech side of social media. Specifically how tools could help him be more efficient and productive. That's when he began\u00a0writing on social media tools.\u00a0From there, Ian has moved on to consulting and speaking.\n\nListen to the show to discover Ian's original career path.\n\nSocial Sharing Tools\n\nIan starts off with\u00a0missinglettr,\u00a0a relatively new tool he's using as a drip-feed marketing system for Twitter. He explains that it extracts images, titles, and text excerpts from your latest blog posts, and then posts\u00a0them through your Twitter account for up to a year.\n\nSimply connect missinglettr with your RSS feed, Ian says, and whenever you have a new blog post, you're\u00a0notified to go into missinglettr and review\u00a0the pieces\u00a0extracted from that post. Select the\u00a0ones you like and edit them and you'll have a whole year's worth of content from a single blog post.\u00a0For example, in a list post, Ian explains, missinglettr\u00a0will likely extract the title of each section, as well as your logo, some text quotes, and images.\n\n\n\nHe says Missinglettr offers a free plan that doesn't include extracting images, and quotes premium plans starting at $15 a month.\n\nTo keep up with\u00a0the latest articles from his favorite authors and blogs, Ian uses\u00a0Feedly. He explains how to take things a step further by connecting it with Buffer\u00a0and IFTTT\u00a0(If This Then That).\n\nAfter you\u00a0add both your Feedly and Buffer accounts to IFTTT, you can\u00a0create a recipe\u00a0that says IF you\u00a0save an article for later in Feedly, THEN it will be added it to your Buffer queue for sharing to your Twitter followers.\n\nIan says it's an\u00a0easy way to share the best content you find (either your own or other people's) as you read it, and mentions that it works whether you're using Feedly\u00a0on a\u00a0smartphone or the web.\u00a0He shares that while\u00a0IFTTT\u00a0is free, Buffer and Feedly both offer free and paid options, and explains that\u00a0for this combination to work, you'll\u00a0need to have a paid Feedly account, which is $5/month.\n\nWhile\u00a0Friends+Me is technically a Google+ sharing tool, Ian says it works really well for cross-posting whatever you put\u00a0on Google+ to Twitter, as well as other social networks. The tool offers both free and paid plans. Ian likes it because Friends+Me\u00a0takes only the title of your Google+ post (it knows you have only 140 characters per tweet), the article link, and the article's image, and shares it to Twitter.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to learn what Ian really\u00a0likes about Friends+Me.\n\nContent Discovery Tools\n\nIf you're looking for timely\u00a0content to share, Ian suggests using the Trending Now feature of\u00a0BuzzSumo.", "duration": "40:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-186-16-02-26.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1455879626, "title": "Nurturing Leads With Social: How to Warm Up Your Following", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you engage with your customers\u00a0and prospects on social media?\n\nWant tactics to warm up your leads?\n\nTo discover how to move people from fans to customers, I interview Kim Walsh-Phillips.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

She's also a columnist for Entrepreneur Magazine. Her brand-new book, co-authored with Dan Kennedy,\u00a0is the No B.S. Guide to Direct Response Social Media Marketing.\n\nKim will explore how to use social media to turn cold prospects into warmer opportunities that lead to sales.\n\nYou'll discover which types of content will\u00a0engage your audience.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nNurturing Leads With Social\nKim's backstory\n\nKim says\u00a0she has been doing public relations since before MySpace. Although she would get clients into the newspaper and throw great events, she was unable to\u00a0show a return on investment. So when it came time for clients to renew, they would cancel. Kim\u00a0spent much of her time going to networking events, meeting people, and trying to sign new clients. She knew she had to do something differently.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, a\u00a0friend gave her Dan Kennedy's original book, the\u00a0No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing. Because\u00a0social is a channel just like direct mail, television, and\u00a0radio, applying Dan's principles to social media\u00a0worked.\n\nShe could show clients how much money came\u00a0from every dollar they spent, and was able to\u00a0keep their accounts,which is something she was unable\u00a0to do before.\n\nListen to the show to learn\u00a0what Kim had to do\u00a0one time to make payroll.\n\nDirect response social media\n\nKim explains that people use social media to have conversations, not to read a brochure.\u00a0Direct response is a marketing tactic used\u00a0to get a\u00a0click-through, an opt-in, or drive\u00a0a purchase.\n\nShe shares that before social media, direct response tactics were used in direct mail, infomercials, print advertising, and even email.\n\nKim\u00a0says that when you tie social media and direct response together, you have conversations with people to create\u00a0a direct result that is measured.\n\nListen to the show to discover why Kim believes email and social media marketing don't carry a lot of direct response messaging.\n\nHow marketers can tap into social\n\nFacebook is a cocktail party, Kim explains, whereas Google is a shopping mall (people are there searching for products, programs, and services). If you're going to interrupt their cocktail party with an \"excuse me,\" you have to offer enough value that someone is willing to turn away from their best friend to pay attention to you.\n\nTo engage fans in this non-disruptive way, Kim suggests you\u00a0make a list of the 10 questions prospects ask you most often. For example, if you're an orthodontist,\u00a0you would use\u00a0the questions parents ask when they're considering braces for their child.\n\nIf you're just getting started in business, she suggests using\u00a0Quora\u00a0to find questions people ask about your industry.\u00a0Kim also shares that\u00a0you can give services such as Textbroker.com\u00a0a list of questions and their experts will answer them for you, creating copyright-free content really inexpensively.\n\n\n\nSimply answering those questions makes for great blog content and social media posts.\u00a0Each day in your social media content, post a link to one of those great blog posts. Alternatively, use it for the post itself. For example: \"A lot of people are curious as to how much braces cost. Costs generally range between\u00a0X and Y.\"\u00a0Those types of posts, Kim adds,", "duration": "39:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-185-16-02-19.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1455274826, "title": "Snapchat Content Strategy: How Marketers Can Win With Snapchat", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you on Snapchat?\n\nWant to know how to use it for marketing?\n\nTo discover how to create a content strategy on Snapchat, I interview Carlos Gil.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Carlos Gil, the head of social media marketing at BMC Software and co-host of the Social 545 podcast.

He decided as a marketer, he needed to get on Snapchat, because the Millennials who were using it would soon be adults.\n\nHe says he spent most of 2014 getting to know the platform and creating content.\u00a0Over the course of a solid year, Snapchat became his\u00a0go-to social network.\n\n\n\nCarlos began seeing more of his friends within the social media marketing community on the platform. What sold him on Snapchat over other networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, was the engagement.\u00a0Snapchat essentially forces your audience to come back and watch your content within a 24-hour period, because if they don't see it, it goes away.\n\nListen to the show to learn about Snapchat's previous reputation.\n\nWhy marketers and entrepreneurs should be on Snapchat\n\nLast February, we had Gary Vaynerchuk and Shaun McBride (aka Shonduras) on the podcast to discuss Snapchat. A year later, it looks like Snapchat is about to explode.\n\nSnapchat has\u00a0more than 200 million monthly active users and\u00a0its audience continues\u00a0to grow and mature.\u00a0Snapchat is very transparent when it comes to their demographics,\u00a0and\u00a0reports that 77% of their user base is above the age of 18.\n\n\n\nCarlos thinks people are consuming so much content on Snapchat because it\u00a0puts\u00a0what you love about Twitter (the micro-content aspect) and what you love about YouTube (pressing a Play button to sit back and watch content) into a single app. You can go in and press a button to see what anyone you're following has\u00a0done in the last day.\n\nHe explains that when\u00a0you publish content on Snapchat, it's available for 24 hours, which\u00a0forces your network to come back and watch it. The messaging feature on Snapchat, which works almost like a text message, allows you to send content directly to your friends. Then, you can specify how long you want that content to be seen, and see when someone views your content .\n\nListen to the show to discover why Snapchat is amazing at getting\u00a0their users' attention.\n\nTypes of Snapchat content\n\nCarlos shares that there are two different kinds of\u00a0snaps: one is a photo and the other is a video of up to 10 seconds.\n\nFor images, he says there are a couple of different filters you can use to change the contrast and color of your photo. There are also geofilters, which are graphic overlays for\u00a0your\u00a0photos, based on your location. For example there are geofilters exclusive to\u00a0cities and other locations such as Disneyland.\n\n\n\nVideos have the same geofilters, but also have features\u00a0like fast-forward, rewind, and slow motion. There are a couple of additional tricks to spruce up your snaps so they look better than average\u00a0video content on your smartphone.\n\nListen to the show to hear what else you can add to your Snapchat photos.\n\nSnapchat Content Strategy", "duration": "47:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-184-16-02-12.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1454670045, "title": "LinkedIn Mobile: What Marketers Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Have you tried the updated LinkedIn mobile app?\n\nAre you actively using LinkedIn to engage with your network?\n\nTo discover how to use the LinkedIn mobile app for marketing on the go, I interview Viveka von Rosen.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

(Note: After this recording, LinkedIn announced they were retiring the Connected App on March 21, 2016.)\n\nIn addition, there are tools\u00a0like the\u00a0Recruiter app, Sales Navigator, Lookup and Elevate\u00a0which are associated with LinkedIn's premium accounts.\u00a0Then there's LinkedIn's news reader, Pulse,\u00a0and the new Groups app.\n\nAlthough all of LinkedIn apps are available to iOS users, only some are\u00a0available on Android, and Viveka reminds listeners that not all of the apps are free. \u00a0For example, Elevate is a combination CRM, content management, content curation tool priced for medium to large companies.\n\n\n\nViveka shares a free alternative to Elevate called LinkedIn Lookup, and discusses the differences between the Connected app and Lookup.\n\n\n\nViveka talks about the new Groups app and shares ways users can take advantage of features like\u00a0the\u00a0Highlights tab and the @ tag function.\n\nListen to the show to hear Viveka discuss how and why LinkedIn is focusing on mobile.\n\nThoughts on the improved\u00a0LinkedIn mobile app\n\nViveka feels the updated LinkedIn app is significantly easier to use than the old version, which means people\u00a0will use it to stay in\u00a0contact with their\u00a0network more often.

He shares that people reached out to him and thanked\u00a0him for\u00a0helping them in their careers, and he says that\u00a0feeling was different from anything he experienced in the world of architecture.\n\nPat talks about what he did and didn't like about working as an architect, and how\u00a0the long-term process of breaking\u00a0a giant project down into chunks helped him when he\u00a0started in entrepreneurship.\u00a0He says the process of working hard on a building, planning ahead,\u00a0and not knowing what\u00a0it will be like\u00a0until people are actually using it all translate to building and launching product.\n\nArchitects and entrepreneurs go through similar processes, Pat says. Each of them are\u00a0building a solution for a client's problem. As you build it, you make changes, you pivot and you learn as you go.\u00a0To be successful in any business you need to learn how to adapt and solve other people's problems.\n\nListen to the show to learn what\u00a0software\u00a0skill Pat used in architecture that he still uses in business.\n\nWhy Pat wrote a book about the pre-launch phase\n\n\n\nIn addition to Pat's weekly Smart Passive Income podcast, he does a show called AskPat,\u00a0during which he answers a voice mail question submitted from his audience via\u00a0SpeakPipe.\n\nOne of the most common\u00a0questions asked is \"How do I know if this idea I am working on is worth spending the time?\"\u00a0He tried to answer this question on both shows and found there wasn't enough time for him to cover the topic.\n\nThe topic was validated through an\u00a0audience survey (Pat uses\u00a0SurveyMonkey) in early 2015, when he segmented the people who said they had yet to start a business. By far, their number one concern was not wanting to waste\u00a0time on something that might not be successful.\n\nThat's when Pat\u00a0decided he needed to write a book to people with amazing ideas, that might\u00a0be life-changing products or services, move forward.\n\nListen to the show to hear\u00a0the reason behind\u00a0the title of Pat's new book.\n\nMaking mistakes\n\nAssumptions are great because they are ideas, Pat explains. However,\u00a0if you act on those assumptions without knowing whether it's something people would actually pay for, that's when you have an issue.\n\nPat shares how a\u00a0couple of WordPress plugin ideas he had turned into a $15,000 mistake.\u00a0He didn't\u00a0discuss the ideas with anybody because it was such a good idea, he didn't want to share it.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Christopher Penn, the VP of Marketing Technology at Shift Communications. His book is titled Marketing Blue Belt and he's also a Google Analytics expert. His brand-new course is the 2016 Marketing Plan Framework: How to Build a Data-Driven Customer Journey. Chris is also co-host of the Marketing Over Coffee podcast.\n\nChristopher will explore Google Tag Manager and the future of analytics.\n\nYou'll discover how to set up and use\u00a0Google Tag Manager.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or\u00a0Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nGoogle Tag Manager\nWhat is Tag Manager\n\nChristopher says Tag Manager is a digital bucket that makes it easier to manage website tags such as a Facebook or Twitter remarketing tag,\u00a0a\u00a0pixel from an ad tracking system or a piece of java script.\n\nHe explains that when a website has a lot of pages, or\u00a0if you use\u00a0a marketing automation system, such as as Marketo or Pardot\u00a0to manage multiple websites, things can easily get lost.\n\nHe says you put the code for Tag Manager on every page of your site only one time\u00a0then, instead of modifying the tags of individual pages, you simply put new tags\u00a0in and out of the bucket. Chris adds that it's a lot more reliable than manually managing tags for each page.\n\nListen to the show to discover how\u00a0Tag Manager can speed up your site.\n\nThe importance of Tag Manager\n\nIn addition to speed, Chris believes reliability is a big reason to use Tag Manager. If you have a lot of different webpages, websites or use marketing automation services that have their own landing pages, forgetting to put\u00a0tags on all those\u00a0pages\u00a0will ruin your analytics, Christopher says.\u00a0As long as you use the bucket on every page, you're covered.\n\n\n\nThe flexibility of Google Tag Manager, is really important. It allows you specify that\u00a0you want some tags on some pages, other tags on all pages and certain conditions to be met for still others. Chris shares an example.\n\nSay you are promoting an event, like Social Media Marketing World,\u00a0and you want to put a tag on the event page for people who have visited the page, but haven't yet purchased a ticket. If you've haphazardly put tags everywhere, you could lose track of what page your tag needs to be on. With Tag Manager, you can specify it to fire the tag if the url has \"smmw16\" in it.\n\nTag Manager is also important for social media marketers who don't have control over\u00a0website updates.\n\nIf you're with a big company and constantly have to go\u00a0through the IT department to add new tags or if you have\u00a0a small website and use\u00a0an outside consultant\u00a0for website maintenance, it becomes difficult to update tags in a timely manner.\n\nWith the bucket on every page, you\u00a0can add and subtract tags through Tag Manager and no one needs to update the website.\n\n\n\nChris illustrates another benefit of using Tag Manager by sharing the example of someone hard coding a Google Analytics tag into their WordPress theme.\n\nWhen\u00a0the theme is updated, their analytics tags go away. Use Tag Manager with\u00a0Google Tag Manager for WordPress plugin, and WordPress will automatically put the bucket on every page\u00a0so you\u00a0can update the theme as much as you want without losing those tags.\n\nListen to the show to learn about assigning roles within Tag Manager.\n\nHow to set up Tag Manager\n\nChris says if you already have a Google Analytics account, you can go to TagManager.Google.", "duration": "40:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-181-16-01-22.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1452855615, "title": "Dealing With Unhappy Customers: What Social Marketers Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Does your business respond to customers via social media?\n\nAre you prepared to deal with upset customers?\n\nTo discover how to turn unhappy customers into happy fans, I interview Jay Baer.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

His company Convince &\u00a0Convert helps\u00a0major brands with their social media and content marketing, and they increasingly get involved in issues with customers.\n\nIt's not just about being proactive and doing marketing, Jay says. You have to be just as good, if not better, at reactive customer service. Jay found even\u00a0organizations with a lot of resources were befuddled by everything related to digital customer service and experience in the modern world.\n\nJay shares how conducting a tremendous amount of research with Tom Webster\u00a0from Edison Research\u00a0changed the focus of his book.\n\nLast year at Social Media Marketing World, Jay did his \"Hug Your Haters\" presentation for the first time. Although he has taken the Youtility concept all over the world, Jay says the Hug Your Haters book is the best thing he's ever done and the speech is the best speech he has ever given.\n\nListen to the show to learn what Tom Webster said he liked about Hug Your Haters in the\u00a0forward to the book.\n\nWhat are haters and why do people hate\n\nJay refers to\u00a0anybody who complains about a business either off stage or on stage as a hater. An off-stage hater is somebody who complains in private: on telephone and email. An on-stage hater is somebody who complains in public: social media, review sites, discussion boards and forums.\n\nHe shares that historically and even currently, the majority of people complain off stage but that the pendulum is swinging the other way\u00a0because\u00a0it's much easier to reach out to a brand on Facebook, Twitter or beyond than it is to send an email or wait on hold.\n\nWhen people complain off stage, they almost always want an answer. They have a problem they want to be fixed, and 90% of the time they expect companies to respond.\u00a0When people complain on stage, they don't necessarily want an answer; they want an audience. They\u00a0want people\u00a0to empathize and engage with them around their experience. If they actually hear back from the company, it's a bonus.\n\n\n\nEven though only 47% of the people who complain in public actually expect companies to get back to them, Jay says their research proved that if you actually answer the\u00a0person who had a bad experience and left a review online, it has a meaningful and significant impact on your customer advocacy.\n\nListen to the show to discover how\u00a0content shock also applies to disgruntled customers.\n\nWhy engage haters\n\nJay says haters are not the\u00a0problem, ignoring them is. He believes there are multiple benefits to answering every complaint in every channel every time, instead of what most businesses do today, which is answer some people some of the time in the channels they prefer.\n\nFirst, if you answer somebody, you at least have a chance to turn them around.", "duration": "41:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-180-16-01-15.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1452250852, "title": "Social Media Evolution: What Does the Future of Social Marketing Look Like?", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you amazed at how much social media has changed over the last few years?\n\nWant to discover what's next?\n\nTo explore the evolution of social media, I interview Brian Solis.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

This is something he\u00a0studies as both an analyst and an anthropologist.\n\nBrian has continued to write books, do research and speak on\u00a0how to bridge the world of brand or business with technology and people. He says social has become part of that process, as has\u00a0mobile and digital transformation, wearables, etc.\n\nWhen asked about major changes in social media that have taken place between his first book and today, Brian talks about creating\u00a0an infographic called\u00a0The Wheel of Disruption\u00a0while he was writing\u00a0What's the Future of Business? The infographic showed all of the things that\u00a0were\u00a0disrupting industries, with an emphasis on brand, marketing and engagement.\n\n\n\nHe explains that then and now,\u00a0the three things Fred Wilson once called The Golden Triangle\u00a0are at the core of everything.\n\nBrian goes on to discuss how\u00a0wearables, augmented reality and services\u00a0like Uber, Instacart,\u00a0Postmates,\u00a0Amazon, Drone Delivery and Google Express\u00a0are creating disruption not only on technology fronts, but also on behavioral and expectation fronts at a human level.\n\nListen to the show to hear Brian explain how\u00a0the disruption happening today has grand implications for every business in every industry.\n\nThe importance of experience\n\n\n\nBrian shares that while many marketers, brand strategists and executives say experience is one of the most important things to deliver, that means different things to different people. From great customer service to great product design, it's all over the map.\n\nBrian\u00a0believes that everything that happens when you buy, use, shop for or have a problem with something are moments that contribute\u00a0to the overall experience.\n\nBrian shares why he thinks we should be able\u00a0to\u00a0define and design experiences as part of business and branding to build better relationships, and why he\u00a0believes experience is the next competitive advantage.\n\nHe says that while some savvy organizations have introduced efforts to define a brand experience (BX), a customer experience (CX) and a user experience (UX), all of these efforts are disparate. Thus, by default or by design, the experience is\u00a0disconnected.\n\nListen to the show to hear why Brian wants to bring all experiences under one banner of X, where everything works together.\n\nBusinesses doing a great job with experience\n\nBrian explains that\u00a0he chose the companies he talks about in\u00a0his book not because they are examples of holistic experiences,", "duration": "47:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-179-16-01-08.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1451646047, "title": "Is Blogging Dead?

Technology didn't empower us to do things like shoot and post videos immediately, stream online or do podcasts. Back then, even sharing images was pretty difficult.\n\nHe shares that for him, blogging started to evolve when social media\u00a0platforms for smaller forms of text-based publishing turned up, like Twitter. Then images and video became easier to publish and share.\n\nMitch says things became very different with\u00a0Twitter and Facebook status updates. The updates\u00a0gave\u00a0people who\u00a0were\u00a0writing long-form articles\u00a0the ability to publish stream of consciousness\u2013style instead.\u00a0He\u00a0talks about how this change\u00a0created\u00a0a space for platforms like Huffington Post\u00a0to progress and become more popular with people who wanted to write.\n\n\n\nWhile Mitch still looks at his blog as a place for a writer to write, he says it's no longer the primary place for his content. He talks about\u00a0putting content in places such as Medium, LinkedIn Publisher, Facebook Notes and Harvard Business Review where it might find different audiences. He explains why he'd rather publish directly on these other sites and use them as his distribution platform.\n\nMark thinks blogging will be dead when reading is dead and that there will always be a place for long-form content. He explains why things like\u00a0podcasts and streaming video\u00a0are\u00a0taking some readership away and how smartphones play into that.\n\nMark says\u00a0that Mitch is onto something in saying what's changing most drastically is not what we're doing, but where.\u00a0He points out that there are cataclysmic changes in how content is published and consumed and offers the example of Facebook Notes, which encourages people to blog on Facebook.\n\nMark talks about the difference in publishing on Facebook, LinkedIn or other platforms and says the\u00a0magnet for inbound leads\u00a0isn't on your website anymore.\n\n\n\nWhen discussing the question of what is and isn't a blog,\u00a0Mitch shares why he's moving away from using that terminology and using words such as article, writer or journalist instead.\n\nIt's semantics, Mark\u00a0says, and shares an insight from\u00a0Tom Webster, his\u00a0partner on the Marketing Companion podcast. Tom works for Edison Research\u00a0where\u00a0they study podcasting a lot. One of the things they found was that\u00a0people don't know what the word podcast means.\n\nListen to the show to discover what Mark says will happen with storytelling and content marketing in a few years.\n\nBuilding on \"rented\" land\n\nMitch says it used to be that publishing on social networks was like building your house on rented land, and explains why he\u00a0doesn't believe it's that way anymore.

He's using Kickstarter as a platform for marketing and exposure, while allowing people to contribute to a cause.\n\nEach time the project hits one of four\u00a0different funding goals, John will personally donate $25,000 to Pencils of Promise on behalf of Fire Nation.\u00a0He recognizes\u00a0that not everyone can donate $25,000 to help build a school, but says they can buy a journal, knowing part of those proceeds will go toward building a school in a developing country.\n\nJohn talks about why he's going to keep his publishing in house and shares other plans for the rest of his 33-day launch campaign.\n\nSomeone else who has traveled around the country doing launch parties is Lewis Howes.\n\nListen to the show to learn about some of the Kickstarter rewards for people who purchase\u00a0The Freedom Journal.\n\nWhy John wrote a book on goal setting\n\n\n\nAfter doing many\u00a0interviews on EOFire, John says the question he's most asked about his guests is,\u00a0\"What's the magical recipe to success?\" He shares that in addition to\u00a0hard work for a long period of time the major commonality is that his guests know how to set and accomplish goals.\n\nAfter polling his\u00a0audience, John discovered his listeners struggle with setting and accomplishing goals.\n\nHe knew this\u00a0was something he could solve and explains why he chose to create a leather bound journal instead of a PDF or an online app.\n\nListen to the show to learn how many interviews John has done for EOFire.\n\nWhat's a goal\n\nJohn defines a goal as\u00a0SMART, an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time Bound. If something\u00a0doesn't have those five qualities, he says, it's not a goal.\n\nThe Freedom Journal starts by teaching you exactly how to set a SMART goal.\u00a0Once you set the SMART goal, you can go forward to accomplish it.\n\nListen to the show to discover what John thinks keeps people from succeeding when they set a goal.\n\nJohn's military training\n\nJohn talks about his military service\u00a0and shares how his military training helped with his goal setting.\n\nHe says he quickly learned the value of Parkinson's law (tasks will expand ...", "duration": "47:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-177-15-12-24.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1450436454, "title": "Social Growth: How to Use Pinterest to Grow Your Following on Facebook, YouTube and Beyond", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you active on Pinterest?\n\nHave you thought about using Pinterest to grow your other social networks?\n\nTo discover how to drive traffic from Pinterest to other networks, I interview Natalie Jill.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Natalie Jill, the founder of Natalie Jill Fitness, a site dedicated to health and fitness. She inspires women around the world with her videos and visual content. She's also got a unique social strategy that helped her grow 1.3 million Facebook fans and 476,000 Instagram fans.\n\nNatalie will explore how she uses Pinterest as her secret marketing tool to build a loyal following on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and beyond.\n\nYou'll discover how to adapt your\u00a0content for Pinterest.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nSocial Growth\nWhat led Natalie to social media\n\nNatalie says she got into\u00a0social media by accident.\u00a0While\u00a0dealing with a lot of\u00a0personal issues, she turned to Facebook to develop a support system and\u00a0talk about her struggles.\n\nShe explains how\u00a0sharing what she was doing to lose weight\u00a0and\u00a0posting pictures of food in an album called \"What I Eat\" developed into\u00a0a downloadable ebook of her recipes. This led to her first full product, which is\u00a0now called\u00a07 Day Jump Start.\n\nBy sharing success stories of the people who bought her book and listening to what her audience was asking, Natalie's Facebook presence started to grow and her products started to take off.\n\n\n\nThat's how Natalie Jill Fitness was born.\n\nListen to the show to learn what Natalie thinks makes a good salesperson.\n\nWhy Pinterest is great for marketers\n\nNatalie initially built her business on Facebook (pre-Facebook pages) and had about 5,000 subscribers when she realized she couldn't keep everything on Facebook.\n\nShe\u00a0started exploring other social media platforms like Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. Natalie says she was looking for a social media site\u00a0where she could post her content and reach more people over time.\u00a0When she noticed older items\u00a0getting repinned, she decided Pinterest\u00a0had the content value-over-time effect she was looking for.\n\nA year and a half ago, Natalie started deep-diving into Pinterest\u00a0and says she\u00a0currently has 1.3 million fans on Facebook and fewer than 50,000 followers on Pinterest (it's one of her smallest social networks). She goes on to explain why the lower Pinterest follower count doesn't matter when it comes to content shares. She\u00a0also points out that Pinterest comes up in Google search, which is a huge benefit.\n\nWhen\u00a0Natalie noticed she was getting a lot of website traffic from Pinterest, she decided to\u00a0figure out how to use Pinterest to help with her content in other places.\n\nNatalie explains how she\u00a0tested her tactic, which she calls the\u00a0Pinfinity concept,\u00a0starting with Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0a Pinterest board called \"Bodyweight Exercises.\"\n\n\n\nNow people searching for body, weight, exercise, workouts, fit mom, etc.,\u00a0find her on Google+ or on Pinterest, and they're taken back to her video on Facebook. Although there's no built-in option to pin things from Facebook, Natalie has found a way to do it.\n\nNatalie explains why she drives traffic to social networks instead of her website.\n\nListen to the show to hear\u00a0how many\u00a0Facebook followers Natalie had before she started this experiment.\n\nHow Natalie\u00a0uses Pinterest to grow her other social networks\n\nYouTube is another example of Natalie's method at work.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Dan Gingiss, former head of digital customer experience for Discover Card, co-host of the Focus on Customer Service podcast and head of digital marketing for Humana.\n\nDan will explore how to better serve your customers with social media.\n\nYou'll discover what\u00a0your business needs to respond to on social media.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nSocial Customer Service\nDan's story\n\nDan, who has been in marketing or product development most of his career, says he\u00a0has\u00a0always been in a service business in some way.\n\nDan talks about the impact of his first job out of school. He\u00a0was a marketer at a direct-response company that sold high-end collectibles. One year around Christmas, he got a phone call that should have gone to customer service. A woman was\u00a0upset because a gift she ordered for Christmas had not yet arrived. Dan shares how he made sure Christmas wasn't going to be ruined on his\u00a0watch.\n\n\n\nDan says taking an\u00a0extra moment to think about something from the customer's point of view usually will make you a much better marketer. He\u00a0talks about his roles at Discover\u00a0and winning\u00a0the JD Power Award for best customer experience, taking it away from AmEx.\n\nListen to the show to hear how Dan got started in social media.\n\nHow customer service fits into social media marketing\n\nStudies from Gartner say that as soon as next year, more than 85% of companies will have to compete on customer experience. It's getting too expensive for industries to\u00a0compete on price, so they need to differentiate themselves by customer\u00a0experience.\n\nDan says when you interact with customers on a one-to-one basis on social media, it makes them more loyal. Loyal customers spend more with you, stay with you longer and tell their friends about you.\n\n\n\nAll of these elements\u00a0result in improved KPIs (key performance indicators), which is what marketers care about.\n\nForrester's Customer Service Index is a pretty good indicator of how well large companies are doing, Dan explains. Over the course of many years, Forrester looked at the stock prices of the top- and bottom-performing public companies. The top-performing companies do well in\u00a0customer experience, while the poor performers in customer experience are at the bottom.\u00a0There\u2019s a direct link between customer experience and profitability.\n\nDan shares what happened\u00a0at Discover when they looked\u00a0at engagement rates on customer service responses (what happened after they responded to a customer and resolved his or her issue).\n\nListen to the show to discover the biggest challenge of one-to-one marketing.\n\nBusinesses doing customer service well\n\nOn Dan's podcast they interview large brands such as Whole Foods, Jet Blue, Chipotle and Hertz, as well as lesser-known companies like Telstra.\n\nTelstra is the largest telecom company in Australia. Unlike most of the telecoms in the United States, they've decided to differentiate based on service. They've managed to connect all of their systems, including social, into a single CRM, so any customers contacting them on any channel can have the same agent help them, as long as that agent is working.\n\nAnother recent podcast interview was with Scotty's Brewhouse, an\u00a0upscale sports bar that has 13 locations in Indiana.

Since I drained the battery playing with\u00a0my new iPhone, it was charging in another room when a text\u00a0message came at 4:12 PM: \u201cWe have a bit of an emergency. Our Facebook page is missing. You around?\u201d I had missed the text.\n\nThe phone rang 12 minutes later, and my wife picked it up. Our community manager Erik Fisher was calling to tell me what happened. Between the time he texted me and when he called, Erik\u00a0poked around Facebook and\u00a0confirmed it. The Social Media Examiner Facebook page\u00a0had disappeared.\n\nAnd I mean it was really gone. I even received\u00a0a notification that my personal profile was incomplete because it didn\u2019t list where I worked.\n\n\n\nI checked to see if I could\u00a0view\u00a0the page on mobile or on my laptop, if I could get into the admin side of the page and if the\u00a0Facebook Fan widget appeared on our site. The answer for everything: no.\n\nListen to the show to learn why it's important to instruct your team to call you in an emergency situation.\n\nFirst thoughts\n\nInitially, I thought we\u2019d been hacked. Then I recalled how after I did the Chalene Johnson story we'd taken all the steps necessary to secure the accounts of all of our staff.\n\nWe secured email with 2-step authentication\u00a0to our corporate Gmail accounts and we turned on Facebook Login Approvals.\u00a0Plus, we recently completed a security audit of everyone on our team, and have a master document of who has administrative access to what.\u00a0These are all steps you can take to secure your business accounts, and you can hear more about how to implement them in the podcast.\n\nListen to the show to hear\u00a0our\u00a0thoughts about \"what if\" the page was gone permanently.\n\nFirst steps\n\nAfter I got off the phone with Erik, everything around me faded into the background.\u00a0Within minutes I posted the following to friends only:\n\n\nOk friends, our Social Media Examiner Facebook page has fully disappeared from existence? Anyone have any suggestions on what to do?\n\nPosted by Michael Stelzner on\u00a0Sunday, November 8, 2015\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nInitially, I decided to share\u00a0it only to friends just in case there was something nefarious going on. Later on, I changed the status to public.\n\nHere are some of the questions people asked me:\n\n\tDid your admin accounts get compromised?\n\tAre you spending enough to have a dedicated rep?\n\tAny notifications from Facebook?\n\tAre you accidentally unpublished?\n\tDid you move it to the Business Manager?\n\nThe answer to all of these questions was \"no.\"\u00a0I searched all over to find out how to submit my issue to Facebook. I reached out to my network and someone eventually told me about the Report Pages that Disappeared form.\n\n\n\nI also found\u00a0where Facebook hides its support responses.\n\nListen to the show to discover\u00a0what I determined I should have done at the beginning.\n\nReaching out to friends\n\nI've been developing relationships with folks for ye...", "duration": "40:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-174-15-12-04.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1448622027, "title": "Online Reviews: How to Respond to Fraudulent Reviews", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do people review your business online?\n\nEver receive negative or fraudulent reviews?\n\nTo discover what to do when you receive a review that's not what you were expecting, I interview Dan Lemin.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Daniel Lemin, the founder of One Good Brand. He is also a strategist for Convince & Convert, and author of the brand-new book, Manipurated.\n\nDan will explore online reviews and how to deal with bad and fraudulent reviews.\n\nYou'll discover why online reviews are so important.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nOnline Reviews\nDan's backstory\n\nDan started his online career with\u00a0Google's corporate marketing team and saw the emergence of\u00a0black hat SEO\u00a0(search engine optimization). He\u00a0explains the\u00a0distinction between\u00a0white hat (good) and black hat (bad) SEO,\u00a0and talks about link farms as an example of black hat tactics.\n\nGoogle came to love Yelp's fresh content and Dan says that's how the\u00a0rating and review platforms attracted\u00a0shadowy SEO characters. They saw\u00a0the opportunity to continue \"tricking\" consumers through new platforms.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to discover why the owners of small- and medium-sized businesses need to know the dynamics of the SEO industry.\n\nWhy reviews are important\n\nDan shares that nearly\u00a090% of consumers say they trust reviews as much as they trust their friends and family.\u00a0Since so many people make decisions based on online reviews,\u00a0the vast majority of a business's prospective customers are filtering through review sites.\n\nSince\u00a0Google favors this type of content, reviews are\u00a0a new SEO tactic, and that's why site owners are adding some type of rating and review component.\u00a0For instance, a\u00a0lot of hospitality businesses like Starwood Hotels have added reviews to their websites.\n\nHe says one review will not necessarily make or break a business, but cautions that the presence of the review industry can make or break small businesses, because\u00a0they don't have all the tools and techniques a large company like Chipotle might have.\n\nWhen asked which review sites matter most, Dan explains his research found it really depends on the business category.\u00a0For example, Gondola Adventures in Newport Beach, which is in a super-specialized industry,\u00a0says\u00a0Yelp matters, but TripAdvisor is even more important.\n\n\n\nDan says companies can track reviews manually by going to each review site, but it's very time-consuming. To help, there's a whole cottage industry of companies such as ReviewTrackers\u00a0and\u00a0ReviewPush\u00a0that do review tracking for businesses.\n\nListen to the show to learn how much traffic Yelp gets from Google.\n\nThe purpose of fake reviews\n\nDan shares that there are\u00a0different layers to the purpose of fake reviews.\n\nHe first discusses fake positive reviews and says that several weeks ago,\u00a0Amazon filed an unprecedented lawsuit against 1,100 people. They accused anonymous people on\u00a0Fiverr\u00a0of selling reviews for profit on Amazon.\n\nFor his book, Dan interviewed a young lady who writes reviews for a living, and says it's very difficult to distinguish her reviews from legitimate ones.\n\nDan discusses fake reviews that are created\u00a0to injure the reputation of a business. Dan also shares an example of another type of fake review,\u00a0a scam that targeted\u00a0wedding photographers in the Bay Area.\n\n\n\nAfter responding to what looked like a legitimate inquiry from their websites,\u00a0the photographers would get an email saying\u00a0\"I decided not to hire you\" or \"we changed the date.\" The email would go on to say, \"I work in the online reputation business,", "duration": "41:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-173-15-11-27.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1448017231, "title": "YouTube Ads: What Marketers Need to Know About YouTube Advertising", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you post\u00a0videos on YouTube?\n\nWant to know what makes a video ad successful?\n\nTo discover how YouTube\u00a0video ads work, I interview Derral\u00a0Eves.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Derral Eves, an expert in YouTube and video marketing. He's YouTube-certified in Audience Growth, AdWords, Google Analytics and Video Advertising. He's helped big and small businesses bring in more than 1 billion views collectively.\n\nDerral will explore YouTube ads and what marketers need to know.\n\nYou'll discover the formula for creating great\u00a0video ads.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nYouTube Ads\nHow Derral got into YouTube\n\nIn 2006, Derral was doing a lot of search engine optimization\u00a0work\u00a0with local businesses when he found their\u00a0videos ranked easily on Google (this is back when Google had Google Video). Late in 2006, Google purchased YouTube and it became\u00a0a lot easier to find something on YouTube through Google. Derral realized it was a great way for small shops to share\u00a0their message and get easy ranking and visibility.\n\nDerral shares how a video that cost $99 to make in 2006 received over 385,000 views on YouTube and has sold more couches for a furniture store than any of their other advertising.\n\nA couple of years ago, Derral started doing his own videos\u00a0to help clients get answers to common questions. He\u00a0created a plan of execution, tried to figure out the best trending videos to make and so on. His goal was to get 10,000 subscribers and a million views in that first year. He reached his goal in three months. In six months, he was number-one for training on how to use YouTube on YouTube.\n\n\n\nToday, Derral consults with and helps businesses, brands and YouTube channels get exposure, develop an audience and monetize.\n\nListen to the show to discover what originally led\u00a0Derral to\u00a0YouTube.\n\nWhy create video ads?\n\nBecause video ads convert at a very high level, Derral believes\u00a0video marketing\u00a0is a great way to deliver, engage and excite. He says\u00a0video is powerful if it's done right, but can be negative if it's done wrong.\n\nDerral talks about working on the video ad for the\u00a0Squatty Potty, which appeared on Shark Tank.\u00a0As of this recording, the video has 43 million combined video views from\u00a0Facebook, YouTube and some freebooted video.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbYWhdLO43Q\n\nAlthough Derral found that Facebook video is good for branding and engagement, he says the video got better conversions with YouTube.\n\nListen to the show to discover the benefit of\u00a0Facebook video versus YouTube.\n\nThe process for making video ads\n\nDerral says you need to start by\u00a0determining what you want to\u00a0accomplish with your video\u00a0ad. He cautions that if you have 80, 10 or even 3 things you want to accomplish, then it's never going to work. You need narrow it down to one reason to\u00a0make the ad. Then everything else will benefit from it.\n\nWhen you know what success looks like, you work backwards to get someone\u00a0to take the desired action at the end of your video.\u00a0Derral says you have a short amount of time to accomplish this\u00a0and walks listeners through\u00a0the steps\u00a0he uses to build YouTube video ads: capture attention, talk about the problem and offer a solution.\n\nHe believes that if you do this\u00a0correctly, you can repeat it several times throughout the video and you can keep your audience\u00a0engaged throughout the process. For example, even though the Squatty Potty video is long (2:54 minutes), the audience retention was high and over 80% of the people who click on it watch the whole ad.", "duration": "53:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-172-15-11-20.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1447412426, "title": "Blogging Tools: Apps to Better Manage Your Blog", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have a blog?\n\nWant to improve\u00a0the content development, publishing and promotion processes?\n\nTo discover how to streamline your blogging with the best tools, I interview Ian Cleary.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Ian Cleary, the social tools guy. His blog, RazorSocial.com has placed in our Top 10 Social Media Blogs 3 years in a row. He's also the founder of the Digital Influencer Club.\n\nIan will explore marketing tools for bloggers.\n\nYou'll discover tools for your editorial calendar, search engine optimization, social media, email marketing\u00a0and more.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nBlogging Tools\nHow Ian got into blogging\n\nIan talks about the social media training company he had in Ireland. He says his blog\u00a0failed because\u00a0he wasn't particularly passionate about it; he was blogging because people said he should. Ian thinks that's the trap a lot of people fall into.\n\nIan shares how reading\u00a0Launch\u00a0helped him realize what he'd done wrong with his blog, so he decided to focus on the tools and tech side of social media.\n\nListen to the show to hear about Ian's first encounter with Mike.\n\nEditorial\u00a0tools and plugins\n\nIan says it doesn't matter if you have a team of one or ten, you still need to plan your blogging.\n\nHe explains how he and his team use the Status feature of a WordPress plugin called Edit Flow to move posts from Ian to his image person, and then to the editor. Once the editor is finished, the post is ready to publish.\n\n\n\nIan also keeps rough ideas for future blog posts in EditFlow\u00a0under the Pitch status, so he has post ideas ready to write anytime he goes to the blog.\n\nCoSchedule\u00a0is another excellent calendar tool Ian is excited\u00a0to try.\n\nRegardless of the tool you choose, you need a good editorial process, Ian says, even if you use Microsoft Excel to track things in the short-term.\n\nListen to the show to discover some of the limitations of Edit Flow.\n\nSEO and research tools\n\nEven if you don't know a lot about SEO, Ian explains how\u00a0the\u00a0Yoast SEO plugin helps you optimize your content for search in an easy way.\n\n\n\nIf you're creating a piece of content and want to see if there's a way to improve it, Ian suggests using BuzzSumo\u00a0or\u00a0Uprise.\u00a0Both are research tools that let you view lists of content from across the web\u00a0based on a keyword you search for. The lists show which posts received the most shares, and Ian tell listeners how to review them to make their own content better.\n\nIan explains the process of using\u00a0Ahrefs\u00a0to find links to high-ranking articles that are similar to yours but are out of date. He shares how bloggers can\u00a0reach out to these authors or websites to link to their newly published\u00a0content instead.\n\nIan also mentions a\u00a0predictive content analytics\u00a0tool called InboundWriter. The tool lets you put in the keywords you want\u00a0to rank for, then\u00a0gives you a green or a red status to show your\u00a0chance of getting organic traffic to your content based on those keywords.\n\nFinally, Ian shares how bloggers can use\u00a0SEMrush\u00a0to see which\u00a0keywords their competitors rank for in Google search results. He says that when you\u00a0see what words your competitors are ranking for, you can pull traffic from them by writing better articles based on those keywords.\n\nListen to the show to hear\u00a0more about InboundWriter.\n\nSocial promotion tools\n\nWhen you include influential people who are relevant to your niche in your content, there's a good chance they will share that content, which will drive shares and traffic.\n\nIan says Topsy\u00a0is a great way to find relevant,", "duration": "42:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-171-15-11-13.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1446807659, "title": "Instagram Strategy: How to Grow a Loyal Following With Instagram", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Is your business on Instagram?\n\nWant to develop an engaged\u00a0following?\n\nTo discover how to create\u00a0an\u00a0Instagram strategy for your business, I interview Nathan Chan.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He's also host of the Foundr podcast. Nathan is also crushing it on Instagram with nearly 400,000 followers.\n\nNathan will explore how he built a massive following on Instagram.\n\nYou'll discover techniques you can employ right now for your Instagram strategy.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nInstagram Strategy\nWhy Nathan started Foundr\n\n\n\nNathan launched Foundr\u00a0on March 5, 2013,\u00a0because he wanted to become an entrepreneur and didn't know where to start. He\u00a0realized\u00a0there weren't any magazines targeting aspiring or novice entrepreneurs, only magazines\u00a0aimed at established\u00a0businesses.\n\nFoundr is a monthly publication, available on iOS and Android mobile devices. Download the app and explore the interactive magazine, which is subscription-based. Once you get inside, Nathan says, it's like a flipbook, where you click and explore.\n\nNathan explains why Foundr differs from a traditional print magazine.\n\nBecause some people prefer to read and others like\u00a0to listen, Nathan added a Foundr podcast to the mix after he left his day job. He wanted to share several amazing interviews he'd recorded on Skype. For example, the issue with\u00a0Tony Robbins on the cover\u00a0includes\u00a0a feature article\u00a0with\u00a0exclusive material, as well as the\u00a0audio interview embedded inside the magazine.\n\nListen to the show to hear how long it took Nathan to leave his job and what he was doing when\u00a0he started Foundr.\n\nFoundr and Instagram\n\nFoundr has been\u00a0on Instagram since November 2014, and has more than 400,000 followers.\n\nA year and a half ago, Nathan\u00a0tried\u00a0Instagram and was having no success. He shares how a\u00a0reader from Melbourne who had an entrepreneur page on Instagram with 20,000 followers contacted him. The reader thought if he\u00a0posted Foundr's\u00a0Richard Branson cover, he would get Foundr\u00a0more readers.\n\nNathan shares why the tactic didn't work and what he learned he should have done instead.\n\n\n\nLast November, Nathan revisited Instagram. He'd already got\u00a0about 500 followers organically, since Foundr\u00a0had 20 or 30 images\u00a0posted. When Nathan did a couple of posts on the Foundr Instagram page, he saw their magazine sales spike on Google Analytics.\n\nBy this time, the guy from Melbourne was up to 80,000 followers, so\u00a0Nathan reconnected with him and they started battle-testing different combinations on Instagram to see what\u00a0would\u00a0get more followers, encourage people to click on his bio and build his\u00a0email list. Foundr's email list has since grown considerably, due to traffic from Instagram. Last November, it was around 2,000. Now it's just about to hit 100,000.\n\nNathan explains how to use lead magnets on Instagram to get people\u00a0on your email newsletter list.\n\nListen to the show to discover why Nathan gave Instagram another try.\n\nNathan's Instagram strategy\n\nNathan says his strategy is to create viral-type content that resonates with Foundr's\u00a0target audience and provide it on a consistent basis. The goal of the Instagram account is to build community, raise awareness of the brand and build the email newsletter database.\n\nTo get more\u00a0email subscribers, Foundr currently links to an ebook as a lead magnet in the bio. The link pushes people to a landing page where\u00a0they\u00a0can get the \"How to Get Your First 10,", "duration": "48:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-170-15-11-06.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1446199258, "title": "Podcast to Book Deal: How to Turn Your Passion Into Profit", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you host a podcast or write a blog?\n\nWant to know what it takes to get a book deal?\n\nTo discover how to turn your content into a book deal, I interview Lewis Howes.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

They do this by following their own dreams and desires, while staying in tune with their audience.\n\nLewis relates this to his own experience with\u00a0building\u00a0a couple of different businesses. While one of those businesses\u00a0served him and other people for a while, Lewis explains there came a time when he\u00a0was no longer inspired by teaching people about how to maximize LinkedIn.\n\nLewis shares why he transitioned into webinars and ultimately began The School of Greatness podcast\u00a0three years ago.\n\nLewis explains that a lot of people connected with The School of Greatness podcast. They started asking for more programs, online courses, coaching, events and now a book.\n\nListen to the show to discover how Lewis and I met, and what he said to me.\n\nWhen and why Lewis started a podcast\n\nIn 2012,\u00a0Lewis asked\u00a0Pat Flynn and Derek Halpern\u00a0what was working in their businesses to drive traffic, get leads and build their\u00a0audience. Both of them said their\u00a0podcast.\u00a0Find out why he was surprised by their answers.\n\nIn\u00a0January 2013,\u00a0Lewis started podcasting once\u00a0a\u00a0week. At the three-and-a-half- to four-month mark, he got an email from iTunes saying they loved what he was doing (the inspiration and guests) and\u00a0wanted to feature him on their home page.\n\nThis\u00a0exposed Lewis\u00a0to a whole new audience\u00a0beyond\u00a0the online marketing audience he'd been building. Now he was reaching people from all over the world who wanted to live a better life.\n\n\n\nLewis shares how The School of Greatness started as an\u00a0interview show and turned into a mixture of interviews and solo episodes.\n\nListen to the show to hear how Lewis came up with the title for his podcast.\n\nLewis's podcast audience and guests\n\nLewis thought his audience was going to be young entrepreneurs, men and women, probably mid 20s to late 30s. He since discovered\u00a0it serves a much broader audience range:\u00a0college kids, moms who play it for their kids in the car, the 50-year-old guy who wants to leave his corporate job to build a business, world-class athletes, former athletes and people from all walks of life.\n\nLewis\u00a0shares\u00a0how he chooses guests for his podcast and how his delivery has evolved from one podcast a week to two shows a week (Monday and Wednesday), plus a 5-minute inspirational segment on Friday.\n\nLewis also talks about the three things he believes factored into his\u00a0success: getting featured on iTunes, interviewing Tony Robbins and having people share the first episode he\u00a0did on video.\n\nhttpv://youtu.be/kSoO2KjVVG4\n\nListen to the show to discover how many downloads The School of Greatness gets each month.\n\nThe book deal\n\nIn 2007, Lewis read\u00a0The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss.", "duration": "42:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-169-15-10-30.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1445594447, "title": "YouTube Strategy: How to Plan Your YouTube Marketing Success", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you create videos for your audience?\n\nAre you curious about what works on YouTube?\n\nTo discover more about\u00a0YouTube video strategy, I interview Owen Hemsath.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

For instance, you may have a couple of Q&amp;A videos with your staff, an old commercial and some home video of the\u00a0company picnic. All of these videos have low\u00a0views, and there's no real cohesive strategy.\n\nThe second thing Owen calls out is violations of what he refers to as the 3 Ps: Platform, Purpose and People.\n\nMarketers\u00a0often violate the Platform when they\u00a0repurpose their non-YouTube\u00a0video content (Google hangouts, Meerkat videos or portrait videos) for YouTube.\n\nRepurposing leads to a violation against People. YouTubers want to engage with your content, comment and be a part of your community. He says that when marketers repurpose, such as putting their Meerkat videos on YouTube, they're telling their audience they don't care enough to create content for them.\n\n\n\nThe third violation involves Purpose. Marketers need to have a purpose for their\u00a0videos. They must figure out what they're trying to communicate with their video and the business objective of\u00a0that video, whether it's to build subscribers, get more shares, grow a list\u00a0or\u00a0sell a product.\u00a0Marketers who\u00a0don't consider purpose when developing their content strateg...", "duration": "35:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-168-15-10-23.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1444989601, "title": "Blab.im: Why Your Business Should Consider Blab", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you host live-streaming video?\n\nWant to hear about the latest live-casting technology?\n\nTo discover more about Blab, I interview Joel Comm.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

The next year,\u00a0he decided that video online needed to be kicked up a notch.\n\nInspired by the rise of YouTube and the reality show The Apprentice, in 2007 Joel produced and hosted the world's first competitive Internet reality show, called The Next Internet Millionaire,\u00a0which received\u00a0an honorary Webby award for reality TV.\n\nIn 2008 UStream.tv became one of the first tools for\u00a0streaming live video from a desktop, so he\u00a0started doing The Joel Comm Show from his offices with co-host Dan Nickerson. They did a weekly interactive show that was usually about an hour long. Sometimes they would have a guest in his studio office, and other times they\u00a0would just engage with the people who were commenting. It's\u00a0very similar to how people\u00a0comment on Blab.\n\nJoel believes\u00a0streaming video is\u00a0a great way to communicate, broadcast, share and deliver content, and build community.\n\nListen to the show to learn what was involved with filming\u00a0The Next Internet Millionaire.\n\nJoel and Blab\n\nJoel, who has been using Meerkat, Periscope and Live for Facebook Mentions for several\u00a0months,\u00a0thinks it was Mia Voss who first told him about\u00a0Blab. She mentioned it at the beginning of August, and he started using\u00a0Blab a couple of weeks later. He has been\u00a0immersed in the platform ever since.\n\nHe hosts two different shows and then logs on\u00a0at other random times, either to do a Blab that's not really a show, to hang out and talk\u00a0with people or to be interviewed on somebody else's show.\n\n\n\nJoel explains that Blab, in its simplest form, is a video conferencing tool that allows up to four\u00a0people to be on screen at once. It's integrated with a chat room, and whoever wants to watch a blab can do so. Viewers are also able to interact with each other and the hosts.\n\nBlab is\u00a0integrated with Twitter\u00a0(your login is your Twitter account), and you're able to easily tweet from the Blab interface. There's a mobile app available for iOS devices and an Android app is on the way.\n\nWhat's so cool about Blab is that it works, Joel says. While Google hangouts\u00a0sometimes require a whole tutorial,\u00a0Blab is so simple that most people get it intuitively. Audience members\u00a0click to request to join a seat. When the host approves you,\u00a0you're on the show.\n\nPeople ask Joel what's better: Periscope or Blab. He believes that's not the right question, because it's comparing apples to oranges.\n\n\n\nPeriscope, Meerkat and Facebook Live Mentions are all one-to-many broadcasting apps. They allow one person to instantly reach and talk at their\u00a0audience. It's only a conversation in that those watching can comment, and whoever is hosting can refer to those questions and comments on video. Unless you have somebody right next to you on the screen, it's just one person.\n\nBlab puts\u00a0the \"social\" component into social media in the most profound and effective way.

There were books about your LinkedIn profile and about how to network on LinkedIn, but she wanted one\u00a0that covered all the bases.\n\nStephanie's book,\u00a0Linked to Influence,\u00a0provides a framework for building your own personal brand on LinkedIn, and\u00a0includes\u00a0networking and other opportunities as well.\n\nListen to the show to hear why\u00a0Stephanie says LinkedIn saved her\u00a0life.\n\nWhy people use LinkedIn\n\nThere are almost 400 million members on LinkedIn, 30% are from the United States and 70% are international. Over 60% of LinkedIn members make more than $75,000 a year and 40% of LinkedIn members make $100,000 or more. The users are affluent, well-educated and come to LinkedIn to\u00a0really connect with others. They want to find or share information, news and knowledge, but also want to build a network,\u00a0connect with others and make things happen for their businesses.\n\n\n\nStephanie likes how LinkedIn does content aggregation. LinkedIn's\u00a0Pulse app curates news,\u00a0based on your network. The smarter your network, the more relevant the content and information you see on Pulse. It includes articles\u00a0from major media outlets, as well as stories from people you're connected to who are publishing content on LinkedIn's platform.\n\nThe\u00a0interface on the Pulse app is fantastic, Stephanie says. You can zip through it, save articles, share them and comment.\n\nListen to the show to learn\u00a0most people's perception of LinkedIn.\n\nBenefits of a good network\n\nStephanie refers to cultivating\u00a0the right LinkedIn community\u00a0as\u00a0building a smart network. The smarter your network, the more relevant people and opportunities you attract. Have a valid reason for bringing someone into your network.\n\nA smart network has market opportunities unique to you. Everyone's situation is different, Stephanie explains. Look at people in your home and work locations, current and previous industries, your\u00a0organizations and associations, referral sources, potential business partners, suppliers in your industry, journalists and more.\n\n\n\nTake a 360-degree view of the people you know\u00a0and decide who are the most important. Connect with high-quality people and get to know them better.\n\nListen to the show to discover the myth of a large network.\n\nHow to build your network\n\nStephanie is very strategic about who is in her\u00a0network. She does not connect with every journalist or every person she\u00a0meets at an event. However, she says,", "duration": "40:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-166-15-10-09.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1443780019, "title": "The Art of Story: How to Captivate an Audience", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you give presentations or speak to clients?\n\nWant to illustrate your knowledge with better stories?\n\nTo discover how to improve your stories, and your storytelling, I interview Michael Port.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He has a master from the graduate acting program at New York University. Michael\u00a0worked professionally\u00a0on the shows\u00a0Sex and the City, Third Watch, All My Children, Law & Order and 100 Center Street, as well as in the films\u00a0The Pelican Brief, Down to Earth and The Believer. He earned a living doing commercial voice overs for companies including\u00a0AT&amp;T, Pizza Hut, Braun, Coors Beer, MTV and others.\n\nAfter\u00a0he left acting, Michael says he decided to\u00a0talk his way into a job for which he was completely unqualified. He pitched himself, got the job and worked his way up in the fitness industry on the business side.\u00a0He credits his post-acting success to being an actor, as he was able to perform during life's high-stakes situations.\n\nWhen the spotlight and eyes are on you, the way you perform will determine the quality of your life, Michael says.\n\nAfter\u00a0Michael left the fitness industry, he went into consulting for businesses and started writing books, and he saw it more and more. Over the last 13 years, Michael\u00a0realized he had to meld his experience and training as an actor, his experience as a professional keynoter and\u00a0what he knows about the business world.\n\n\n\nThat's what Steal the Show is about, Michael says. Half\u00a0the book is on the techniques associated with being a great public speaker\u00a0and the other half is focused on performing during life's everyday situations.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about how\u00a0Michael coaches speakers, as well as why he originally resisted helping people with their public speaking.\n\nWhy people\u00a0love stories\n\nPeople love narrative,\u00a0wonder and imagination, Michael says. Stories can get us out of our own head and into another world.\u00a0We turn everything into a story, he continues. Politics, religion, love, our success or our failures become stories. Sometimes the stories we tell actually get in our way\u00a0and sometimes they\u00a0can change the world.\n\nMichael talks about a researcher named Jonathan Gottschall, who studies the neuroscience behind stories. Jonathan\u00a0says the constant firing of our neurons in response to fictional stimuli strengthens and refines the neural pathways that lead to skillful navigation of life's problems.\n\nListen to the show to discover in what way projects are stories.\n\nHow to find your stories\n\nPeople sometimes draw a blank when they start to work on a presentation or prepare for\u00a0an upcoming meeting, because so many things have happened over the years. Those experiences and stories are not top of mind, since you\u00a0are more likely thinking about today and tomorrow.\n\n\n\nThere are four different prompters for the discovery part of the process.

She is also a social media strategist and an expert in visual marketing.

This was shortly after the iPad\u00a0first came out. She loaded Instagram and loved it, but no one she knew was on it.\n\nThen, when Pinterest came out, Peg, like a lot of people, thought Pinterest and Instagram were the same, because they were both about images. Although she initially chose to focus on Pinterest, after she learned more about both platforms, Peg discovered how different the two were.\n\nWhen Peg went back to Instagram, she saw it was a great place for people to have conversations.\n\n\n\nEven if you know lots of people on Facebook, Peg believes Instagram is where you can build a community. As a blogger or entrepreneur, it's the kind of place you want to go to meet new people.\n\nListen to the show to learn about why more people didn't get on Instagram immediately.\n\nInstagram challenges for marketers \n\nPeg believes social media is challenging for marketers because they want to look at things in a more traditional way: how to get people to do x, y and z. The newer platforms, like Snapchat and Instagram, are even more challenging. It's not easy\u00a0to write a viral blog post or post a YouTube video that goes viral.\n\nInstagram is limited, Peg says, because you just get that one link in your bio and there are no links in the comments.\n\nWhile a blogger might not see the value in Instagram (\"Why should my blog be on Instagram if there's no link for people to click every day?\"), brands are getting more engagement on Instagram than any other social platform. It creates brand awareness that leads more people to your business, events and products.\n\n\n\nThe biggest mistake marketers make, Peg says, is they aren't posting enough. On a recent panel, Peg heard Instagram people who have 500,000+ followers say they post multiple times per day. One of them posts 8 or 10 times per day. And they post excellent content.\n\nIt takes more time to create an Instagram post. Although you can share a blog post immediately, with Instagram you have to create the image, write the text and figure out all of the things that go with it.\n\nOn Facebook, people don't post enough either. On Martha Stewart's Facebook page they post every hour. Of course she probably has the biggest backlog of content of any person ever, Peg adds.\n\nListen to the show to discover why Social Media Examiner doesn't do much on Instagram.\n\nIdeas for what to post\n\nPeg says there are basic things to post on Instagram, such as pictures of what you're doing or where you are. If you're at an event, it's fun to post pictures of people you meet or do selfies. You can post a day in the life at your blog or business, pictures of your team or behind the scenes at your company.\n\nShow pictures of wherever you happen to be to give more of a human connection with your company.\n\n\n\nFor example,", "duration": "41:23", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-164-15-09-25.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1442570428, "title": "Facebook Advertising 101: How to Get Started With Facebook Ads", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you considering running\u00a0Facebook ads?\n\nHave you tried\u00a0Facebook ads but have had little success?\n\nTo discover how to run successful\u00a0Facebook ad campaigns, I interview Amy Porterfield.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

She worked for Tony Robbins for about six and a half years as director of content development. In that last year Tony\u00a0got heavily into social media (he did his own Twitter),\u00a0and\u00a0Amy worked on Tony's Facebook page.\n\nAmy got the entrepreneurial bug, and knew she wanted to go out on her own. She fell in love with social media and she knew that was the\u00a0area to pursue.\n\nWhile still in the corporate sphere, Amy started educating herself. She\u00a0asked to be involved with anything related to online marketing and social media. About a year later, she took the leap and left the corporate world. Amy\u00a0started by doing social media consulting, but\u00a0eventually built a business around online training courses related to social media marketing.\n\nListen to the show to discover how Amy and I first connected, and our first experience at Blog World.\n\nWhy use Facebook ads?\n\nFacebook does a lot to help marketers find their ideal audience online. Amy believes\u00a0the targeting capabilities on Facebook are far more advanced than any other social media platform. Facebook allows people to get in front of their perfect\u00a0audience on a regular basis.\n\nAmy\u00a0breaks down the Facebook targeting options.\n\nIf you've built up a Facebook business page and\u00a0have a few thousand fans, start with\u00a0targeting\u00a0them. It's the cheapest way to target on Facebook, since you don't pay as much when you target your own fans versus a cold audience.\n\n\n\nThe next thing to\u00a0do is create a lookalike audience of your own fan base. You tell Facebook that you have these fans, and you want to target people who are similar in likes, interests, activities and behavior. Facebook will give you an audience that's very similar to the one you've already attracted.\n\nThen upload your email list to Facebook. Facebook\u00a0will\u00a0compare it to their database, and when they find a match, they put the\u00a0contact in a bucket. This allows you to target\u00a0people who are already on your email list with a new opportunity. Also, take that email list and ask Facebook to find a lookalike audience.\n\nAmy adds\u00a0a couple of other targeting options to the mix.\n\nTarget fans of other Facebook pages, such as\u00a0your competitors or people who are aligned with your business. Amy says the reason she mentioned the other options first is that sometimes when people are first starting out and go to look for similar interests, they\u00a0struggle to find Facebook pages to\u00a0pop up.\n\nFor example, when you put together your ad, if you type \"Amy Porterfield\" in interests, her page will likely pop up, and you can target her fans. But a\u00a0lot of pages won't populate, Amy explains. Facebook says it has to do with trending, activity, engagement and how many fans you have. Amy suggests trying to find five pages and\u00a0target their fans.\n\n\n\nAnother one of Amy's favorite techniques\u00a0is to\u00a0re...", "duration": "44:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-163-15-09-18.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1441360845, "title": "Finding Your Spoken Voice: How to Become Believable", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you talk on\u00a0podcasts or in video?\n\nWant to be\u00a0more comfortable in front of the microphone?\n\nTo discover how to improve\u00a0your spoken presence, I interview David Lawrence.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Technology, David's\u00a0other passion, has also run through everything he has done.\n\nDavid recalls his first time on a commercial radio station at WNCI in Columbus, Ohio. At the very end of \"Barracuda\" by Heart, he came out with\u00a0\"Landshark, candy gram,\" which was the big bit on Saturday Night Live at the time. From there he played the radio station jingle and headed into his\u00a0career.\n\nAfter 12 or 13 years as a disk jockey, David's\u00a0radio station flipped format, and he\u00a0moved over to talk radio, where he found his stride. From there he went\u00a0into syndicated radio:\u00a0SiriusXM.\u00a0In 2007 David decided\u00a0that \"radio was great, it had its day and I was done with it.\" It was time to move to on-camera.\n\nHe says he likes the phrase, \"Leap and the net will appear.\" David\u00a0just leapt, although he had been preparing and training. Before he\u00a0did anything on-camera, he\u00a0learned how the business worked, as well as who the\u00a0gatekeepers (but not decision-makers) were.\u00a0That knowledge was helpful when David\u00a0first started to audition, he says. David\u00a0booked Heroes within six\u00a0months of starting the full-on audition process, which is a lot faster than a lot of actors experience with the process.\n\n\n\nDavid explains how his one episode of Heroes\u00a0turned into many. The first day on the set, his character\u00a0was\u00a0supposed to get shot and killed. Toward\u00a0the end of the\u00a0day, the director gave David\u00a0new lines. In this newer version, his character had a chair thrown at him and was sent back to prison. \"I was new at this and I said, 'Wait a minute. I rehearsed my death scene all weekend. I'm not going to be able to do that?' They responded, 'Do you want to die? Because we talked to your agent and you're in the next eight\u00a0episodes.'\"\n\nIn addition to all of the legwork and preparation, David says the book, Secrets of Screen Acting (for which he recently\u00a0finished voicing the audio book version), was also helpful.\n\nDavid also teaches voiceover courses on VO2gogo.com and he created the\u00a0Rehearsal app. Here's how the app came about.\n\nDavid\u00a0was in his\u00a0agent's office and was called to audition across town\u00a0with\u00a0little time to prepare. His usual process is to\u00a0record his\u00a0lines and his\u00a0partner's lines. He would then put that recording on iTunes, so he could repeat it until he\u00a0learned his\u00a0lines. All he\u00a0had at his\u00a0agent's office was his\u00a0iPhone with voice memo, which did not have a repeat function.\n\nWhen David\u00a0got to the studio, he learned they decided to write out the part.", "duration": "55:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-161-15-09-04.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1440756036, "title": "Getting Attention: The Science of Being Captivating Online", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want to bring more attention to your business or product?\n\nWant to find out what inspires people to take notice?\n\nTo discover how to get people's attention online, I interview Ben Parr.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Mashable noticed and asked Ben\u00a0to write for them. He then came\u00a0on board as a junior editor, and was promoted to co-editor in 2009, which was when he moved to San Francisco.\u00a0Ben was with Mashable for 3 1/2 years.\n\n\n\nAs\u00a0co-editor, Ben was in charge of the West Coast. Since he\u00a0was the only one in Silicon Valley for a long time, if anything came up in Silicon Valley\u00a0(like they needed someone to talk to Mark Zuckerberg), they called on Ben. He wrote about 2,400 articles and\u00a0also helped manage and mentor a lot of reporters and junior editors.\n\nBen's\u00a0book, Captivology, came about\u00a0a\u00a0couple of years ago.\u00a0When Ben was\u00a0just starting out investing in companies, he realized they were all asking for help with press and marketing, customer and user acquisition, and virality. He explains that all of these areas are about getting attention for products and getting users.\n\nBen says he\u00a0did a lot of research, and realized there was a lot of interesting information about attention over the last 50 years, but no one had put it together into something mainstream.\n\nListen to the show to discover why Captivology was the book he had to write.\n\nThe science behind the book\n\n\n\nFor Captivology, Ben went through more than\u00a01,000 different research studies and interviewed dozens of PhDs, as well as business leaders and thought leaders,\u00a0like Sheryl Sandberg, Steven Soderbergh and David Copperfield. They helped him\u00a0frame the book in a way that there's a lot of science and research, but also practical information. There's knowledge people can\u00a0use in daily life.\n\nGoing into the book, Ben\u00a0had theories about things like reward systems, and\u00a0confirmed some of his\u00a0beliefs on how they\u00a0work.\n\nFor example, there's a type of reward-giving, called post-action rewards. This is when someone gets a reward as a surprise after completing an action. When you surprise people with a reward, it reinforces behavior.\n\nListen to the show to discover why incentives are the worst ways to get attention.\n\nThe three types of attention\n\nIn Ben's research, he discovered three stages of attention: immediate, short and long attention.\n\nImmediate attention. This is the immediate and automatic reaction people\u00a0have to certain sights, sounds and stimuli. When people hear a gunshot they\u00a0duck, which is an automatic reaction to protect themselves. There's a lot of fascinating science on how that works and why it matters, Ben says.\n\nShort attention. Short attention\u00a0is\u00a0the second stage.

He was vice president of custom media (also known as content marketing) at business publishing company Penton Media\u00a0until\u00a02007. At Penton,\u00a0Joe and his team helped advertisers who wanted to do something unique tell their stories. For example,\u00a0if a company like Microsoft wanted to tell a story to an executive audience, Joe and his team\u00a0would help them create an ongoing newsletter, a magazine, blog series or webinar series. Joe\u00a0did that for seven\u00a0years.\n\nJoe left Penton at the end of March 2007 and wrote his first blog post titled \"Why\u00a0Content Marketing?\" on April 26, 2007. That led up to Joe launching Junta42, which he says was basically the eHarmony for content marketing. The idea was to match\u00a0brand sites that wanted to outsource some portion of the content process (creation or distribution) with agencies that would pay for the service to get\u00a0the leads.\n\n\n\nJoe explains how in 2008, with no money, no paid distribution and about\u00a02,000 subscribers, he\u00a0decided it was time to build relationships with influencers. He started a\u00a0research project called The Top 100 Content Marketing Blogs. (I was on the list first for White Papers and then Social Media Examiner.) He notified\u00a0everybody who was on the list, and it just took off.\n\nFast-forward to\u00a02009, Joe shares, the model was working and they matched up about 1,000 projects. However, they were still having trouble getting companies\u00a0to pay for a subscription to the service, even though they\u00a0were driving leads to them. After his best case study (they sent a\u00a0$1 million+ customer to an agency, and the agency\u00a0decided not to renew their subscription), it finally hit Joe that\u00a0this business was not going to work.\n\nAlthough Joe\u00a0was \"in love with his product,\" he\u00a0finally\u00a0figured out the key was to fall in love with your audience and focus on their needs and pain points. His\u00a0audience was\u00a0asking for training, education, consulting and speaking. They weren't even ready for a matching service, because they didn't even know how to create a content marketing strategy.\n\nJoe pivoted to the education and training concept and launched Content Marketing Institute six months later. That was May 2010.\n\n\n\n\"At that moment we said we were going to create the leading online destination for content marketing, the leading magazine and the leading event,\" Joe recalls. \"And within two years we were able to do that.\"\n\nListen to the show to hear how Joe and I first connected, as well as the similarities between our projects.\n\nWhy now is the\u00a0time to get into a content-driven business\n\n\n\nContent Inc.\u00a0is Joe's fourth book.

So\u00a0Chalene\u00a0changed her password to something out of the ordinary, logged back in and changed her bio.\n\nThen, it happened again. The hackers were sending out porn and tweeting other people at the same time Chalene was on Twitter.\u00a0Her other accounts were hacked as well.\u00a0She felt like she wasn't safe in her own home. Even though it was an Internet attack and there wasn't a physical threat, Chalene recalls that it felt like it.\n\nDarren shares where he was on the night of Chalene's cyberattack. He and his wife just got home from dinner and were flipping through Instagram when they noticed that Chalene's account had content she normally wouldn't post. So he texted her and said he thought she'd been hacked. She wrote back that she knew and was freaking out. He said to call him so they could get it under control and get the hackers out of her system.\n\nBy the time Chalene called Darren, her Twitter, Instagram and Facebook had been taken over. And, though she didn't realize it yet, the hackers\u00a0were also in her inbox.\n\n\n\nChalene and\u00a0Darren\u00a0spent eight\u00a0hours, working\u00a0through the night, trying to patch everything up.\n\nPeople assume it's personal, Chalene says, but that's not the case. It hit her especially hard because social media is her livelihood. The hackers\u00a0deleted everything she posted on Instagram over the last four and a half years, and they started posting videos of animal cruelty and violent porn. Chalene felt helpless and responsible.\u00a0The cost of the hack, which included security experts, loss of wages and rebuilding her security, was in excess of $200,000.\n\nDarren says hacking is a sport for some people and a hobby for others. They are experts in their field. Since they don't have legal ways to demonstrate their expertise, this is how they do it.\n\nDon't worry about hackers, Darren suggests. Focus on what you need to do to\u00a0protect yourself. Situations like this expose holes that we knew existed, and that we should have patched, but kept putting it off. It's like waiting until a health condition pops up and then deciding to get in shape.

First, there's the \"thought\" element. It starts with people who have excellent forward thinking, stay on the cutting edge and push boundaries, understand deeply how things work and are able to articulate it.\n\nAnd second, they must be a\u00a0\"leader,\" someone whom others listen to and follow.\u00a0A thought leader does those things over time, consistently producing material that people will listen to month in and month out.\n\nBefore I started Social Media Examiner, I was\u00a0called one of the leading authorities in the white paper world. To earn that, I constantly wrote articles,\u00a0started a blog, did training,\u00a0wrote a book, summarized industry research and had a monthly newsletter.\n\n\n\nEstablishing yourself as a thought leader is a lot of work. Even harder is maintaining it.\u00a0Mari Smith is an excellent example of someone who chose to own her title of \"Facebook Expert,\" and is having great results.\n\nListen to the show to discover how long Phil and I have been working together and what we did before Social Media Examiner.\n\nHow we decide who should be on the podcast and on our stages\n\nWhen deciding on our content, we ask two questions: \"What should people speak about?\" and \"Who should speak about those subjects?\"\n\nTo determine what people will speak about, we look very carefully at the data, Phil explains. We study\u00a0our annual Social Media Marketing Industry Report, which is based on the\u00a0subjects our readers tell us they do and do not care about. It\u00a0influences decisions about the kinds of speakers we need to find, which sometimes means we need to seek out\u00a0experts\u00a0we don't know yet.\n\nIf you want to pitch yourself to a conference or podcast, it's important to first study it. Look at the\u00a0organization's\u00a0typical lineup to see what kinds of things people are speaking about, and determine\u00a0if you're a fit.\n\n\n\nNot every thought leader is appropriate for every situation. We get inquires all the time from people who pitch us things that aren't appropriate.\n\nListen to the show to hear how booking speakers is like programming for television.\n\nWhat we look for in our speakers\n\nPhil and I share the\u00a0four criteria we look for in a speaker.\n\n1. Are they a great communicator?\n\nWe're not just looking for inspirational communicators, we are looking for people who can explain or teach at a very deep level how to use the different social media platforms.\n\nA\u00a0lot of people think they're great communicators, but a lot of people also think they're good drivers. I share how when Sally Hogshead was keynoting at Social Media Marketing World, she said \"Raise your hand if you think you are a good driver.\" About 95% of the hands went up in the room. Then she says, \"Interestingly enough, research shows that only 55% of people are good drivers, so that means that about 40% of you are kidding your...", "duration": "51:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-157-15-08-07.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1438336823, "title": "Online Reviews for Local Businesses: What Marketers Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you own or manage a local business?\n\nAre you leveraging the full power of online reviews?\n\nTo discover how to leverage online review services, I interview Martin Shervington.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Part\u00a0of this\u00a0is for local businesses, so they can appear on a map, get reviews and so on.\n\n\n\nMartin has been doing research on this and says businesses are not quite connecting the dots\u00a0on Google+ marketing and using this powerful tool. He says as of last year, only\u00a037% of businesses had claimed their Google listing, 63% have not.\n\nListen to the show to discover more about Google My Business.\n\nThe impact of reviews\n\nMartin has spoken to hundreds of businesses (owners and staff) about reviews. People use\u00a0reviews\u00a0as a socialized way to judge\u00a0the businesses around them, which get more customers as a result of reviews.\n\nFor example, Martin shares, Tasty Thai in San Mateo can attribute\u00a0thousands of dollars of revenue to\u00a0one single positive Yelp review from a guy who had been to Thailand and loves their Thai food.\n\nAt the moment Yelp has a lot of people's attention, and Martin hopes Google reviews will get to that level as well.\n\n\n\nReviews can bring tourists, new people and new business. The downside is there's the\u00a0potential for negative reviews.\n\n\"[Businesses\u00a0have to have] good service, good product and sometimes be willing to say when you haven't got it 100% right,\" Martin says.\n\nListen to the show to hear about an amazing experience I had while\u00a0traveling, based on a Yelp review.\n\nGoogle listings\n\nMartin explains how Google sometimes auto-generates a business listing, and a lot of people's businesses are listed without them knowing about it.\nTo determine if your business has\u00a0an auto-generated listing, Google your location to see if anything comes up. If it doesn't, go to Google.com/business\u00a0to\u00a0set one up. If it is already set up, click where it says \"claim this listing,\" so you can\u00a0control uploading photos,\u00a0reply to posted reviews and more. When you set up a page on Google they verify it by\u00a0phone or by mail.\nThere are two different types of local pages, Martin continues, a\u00a0storefront and a service area. If you run your business from home, say you are a service area to\u00a0hide your address.\n\n\n\nOnce you've claimed your property or set up your page from scratch, there are several things you can do: change the profile image (which is the icon people see when you make comments or reply to reviews), change your cover photo, manage your photos, add what you do to the description area, post on that Google page, reply to reviews, share reviews and more.\n\nYou can even embed the best reviews on your website. This is how you\u00a0take the\u00a0social proof you get from reviews and spread it onto your website.\n\nThe Google My Business dashboard provides a\u00a0higher-level frame-of-reference around the things that are connected to your business, such as\u00a0analytics, your YouTube channel, the page insights\u00a0and the Google+\u00a0page itself.", "duration": "40:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-156-15-07-31.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1437732022, "title": "Pinterest Marketing: How to Succeed on Pinterest", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use Pinterest for your business?\n\nWant to know what works on Pinterest?\n\nTo learn how to improve your Pinterest marketing, I interview Jeff Sieh.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

A couple years ago, he decided it was time to take the\u00a0plunge\u00a0into social media.\n\nDriving home from a long road trip, Jeff was listening to the Social Media Marketing Podcast episode with Cynthia Sanchez, and got intrigued by Pinterest. Once he started playing on the platform, Jeff\u00a0noticed it was driving a lot of traffic to\u00a0his\u00a0relatively new blog.\n\nAfter Jeff's Google+ post, called Manly Pinterest Tip #1, about sharing a secret board with his daughter, did really well, he wrote Manly Pinterest Tips #2-5. \u00a0Jeff explains that his concept for Pinterest was a play on the fact that everyone thinks\u00a0Pinterest is for women. His \"manly\" version really took off.\n\n\n\nJeff did an\u00a0initial version of his\u00a0podcast with four\u00a0other guys. They did seven episodes before switching formats. At the beginning of the year, Jeff brought\u00a0back the Manly Pinterest Tips podcast as a solo, weekly show, and has\u00a0interviewed Pinterest experts, like Peg Fitzpatrick, Rebekah Radice and Cynthia Sanchez. He's done about 30 episodes.\n\nSince the Manly Pinterest Tips podcast\u00a0did well, Jeff embarked on\u00a0an experiment in branding. He figured it took a year to grow a good, manly beard. So he decided he would launch the website and build the\u00a0brand for a year. \"If it doesn't work, I can shave the beard off, it'll be fine,\" he says. \"Well, it worked.\"\n\nJeff explains the concept of secret and group boards. A secret board is something that only you or you and other people you designate can see. They\u00a0are a great way to gather info for yourself or for collaboration. You can also\u00a0create\u00a0public group boards. Jeff has a board with Peg Fitzpatrick about bacon\u00a0and\u00a0an Instant Instagram Tips.\n\nListen to the show to hear more about Jeff\u2019s secret boards.\n\nMen & Pinterest\n\nContrary to popular belief, there is\u00a0tons of stuff for guys on Pinterest. Jeff explains that\u00a0men are the fastest growing demographic on Pinterest. In 2014 the number of men on Pinterest doubled. In fact more men use Pinterest in the United States every month than read Sports Illustrated and GQ combined.\n\nTo make his point about good content for men on Pinterest, Jeff calls out boards from the National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major League Baseball. Jeff also mentions his\u00a0popular woodworking board, DIY boards (from Lowe's and Home Depot, for example) and more. All of this content appeals to men.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to discover why Jeff finds the stereotype about men and Pinterest funny.\n\nBuyable pins\n\nBuyable pins\u00a0are\u00a0a way for people to purchase products through Pinterest.\u00a0It's rolling out this summer, starting mostly with major brands like Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, and ecommerce platforms Shopify and Demandware.\n\nBuyable pins will be huge for business,", "duration": "43:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-155-15-07-24.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1437127256, "title": "Sharing: The Art and Science of Social Sharing", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you create content for your business?\n\nWant to encourage people to share it?\n\nTo explore the art and science of social sharing, I interview Bryan Kramer.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Plus, he says,\u00a0Human to Human provides the best platform used for sharing and not the other way around.\n\nShareology, which is two years in the making,\u00a0is the study of how, what, where, when and why people and brands share. As a self-proclaimed anthropologist, Bryan has a lot of interest in the subject.\n\nBryan says he always asks his audience\u00a0what class they took on sharing.\u00a0In kindergarten, kids learn how to share their toys, but that's about it. It's a skill people learn on top of\u00a0school, and is part of some classes, like communications, but is not a focus.\n\nSocial sharing comes in many different flavors, he explains. Meerkat and Periscope are new flavors, but there are so many more.\u00a0Shareology focuses on the evolution of sharing: the past, present and future.\n\nListen to the show to learn how people shared articles before\u00a0social media.\n\nWhy people share\n\nFor the book Bryan did more than 250 interviews with executives, marketers and social media people, as well as professors of linguistics, psychology, sociology and so on, with the question \"why people share\" in mind.\n\nThe answer came down to one thing: connection. People\u00a0all have the\u00a0desire to reach out and connect with other people, whether it's through sharing content and having someone reply back or by sharing other people's content and helping them out.\n\nThese are the six types of people who share:\n\n\tAltruist: Someone\u00a0who shares something specific about one topic all the time.\n\tCareerist: Someone\u00a0who wants to become a thought leader in their own industry, so they can see their career grow.\n\tHipster: Someone who\u00a0likes to try things for the first time and share it faster than everyone\u00a0else.\n\tBoomerang: Someone who asks\u00a0a question so they can receive a comment only to reply. (This can be a troll, but not necessarily.

This\u00a0means any third-party developer can create an app that will work with Messenger. So if someone sends you a link to something in a Facebook message, it may ask you to install an app when you click on it.\n\nMessenger is also integrating with businesses,\u00a0although there are only a few online merchants doing this as of now. With this functionality, when people make a purchase, Messenger will ask them\u00a0if they\u00a0want to get updates for this merchant via Facebook Messenger. That's almost as good as having a person's cell phone number, Mari explains, because there's a high open rate for SMS messages.\n\nUsing this technology, merchants can make purchase recommendations or send\u00a0shipment updates via Messenger, for example. It basically opens up the dialog between the business\u00a0and the customer.\n\nListen to the show to hear how Instant Articles are similar to LinkedIn Publisher.\n\nWhy businesses should use Facebook for customer service\n\nMari believes Facebook should be part of a business's customer service plan, since\u00a0most people\u00a0are already on Facebook and many use\u00a0Facebook through mobile devices.\n\nMari talks about\u00a0how she was recently interviewed for a Wall Street Journal article on how companies like JP Morgan\u00a0and Coca-Cola are turning off voicemail, and cutting millions of dollars in expenses by doing this. Mari thinks it's\u00a0a sign of the times. The biggest challenge for businesses is that customers have so many different ways to contact them: a tweet or DM on Twitter or a Facebook wall post, comment or direct message. It can be unwieldy.\n\nCompanies\u00a0should also look at the features recently added for business pages on Facebook. The newest call to action button on ads is \"Call Now.\" Facebook wants people to call businesses. They realize if a phone is in someone's hand, they can just press the Call button. The challenge is businesses would need to have staff on standby or a system in plac...", "duration": "44:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-153-15-07-10.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1435917622, "title": "YouTube Community Development: How to Build a Following With YouTube", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you create\u00a0YouTube videos?\n\nWant to increase your audience?\n\nTo learn how to create an online community using YouTube, I interview Tim Schmoyer.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

After seeing what was on there, he decided to upload his first video. It was a quick, 30-second video of him talking to the\u00a0camera. He\u00a0had no idea where that first experience would lead.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sbC_K0cCUI\n\nAs this\u00a0was pre-Facebook, Tim says he and his girlfriend at the time made videos to show their friends and family what they were up to. They made videos of their dates, engagement\u00a0and\u00a0wedding, as well as when they moved, had kids and so on.\u00a0Tim believes\u00a0they made about\u00a01,000 videos just sharing their\u00a0story.\u00a0It started as a way to communicate with family and friends. Along the way, other people started watching.\n\nAround 2009, Tim reached out to Mark Robertson, ReelSEO, and YouTube personality\u00a0Kevin Nalty, and\u00a0asked them why certain things did and did not work on YouTube. When they didn't know the answers, Tim decided to figure it out himself. He said he'd report back to them what he learned.\n\nTim began having conversations with people who were trying to figure out the same things about YouTube and audience growth. That was the start of him turning YouTube into his business.\n\nA while later, Tim reached out to Mark Robertson\u00a0again with constructive feedback. Tim told Mark that while he had a great website about video, there was nothing being done\u00a0with online video. Tim ended up taking over Mark's YouTube channel, and trained the site's\u00a0viewers how to master YouTube as a platform for audience development.\n\nAfter a\u00a0few years, Tim\u00a0started working full time for an animation studio to do audience development for their web series. A year later, after he had grown it to almost 100,000 subscribers, Tim's\u00a0job was\u00a0eliminated. However, they paid him full-time for six months to get his own business started.\n\nIn February 2013, Tim launched his\u00a0YouTube channel, called Video Creators. By the end of six\u00a0months, it was his full-time income.\n\n\n\nVideo Creators has three series on it.\u00a0Every Tuesday, Tim\u00a0talks about news in the online video industry. Wednesdays, he\u00a0shares a YouTube tip. Then, on Thursdays he answers a\u00a0question from his audience. The channel\u00a0revolves around using online video as a platform to change lives.\n\nWithout spending any money on promotion, Tim has grown his YouTube channel to over\u00a075,000 subscribers and more than\u00a0four-million views. He gets tons of interaction and engagement, including about 15,000 comments a month.\n\nListen to the show to learn\u00a0what YouTube was like in the beginning.\n\nCommon mistakes with video\n\nThe biggest mistake Tim sees people make with video is that they treat it like it's the same as television. People new to video (who don't watch YouTube) don't have another frame of reference for how to craft video content. Therefore,\u00a0they make the same content they would create\u00a0for television,", "duration": "42:49", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-152-15-07-03.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1435312839, "title": "Facebook Groups: How to Nurture a Community on Facebook", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have a Facebook group for your community?\n\nAre you considering starting a Facebook group?\n\nTo learn how to use a Facebook group to build a loyal community that helps your business, I interview Jared Easley.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

They decided to move forward, even though there were plenty of things that could have prevented them from even getting started.\n\nJared explains how they reached out to a few people who had put on large events, and asked for their perspective and advice.\u00a0One person who gave them a lot of feedback\u00a0was\u00a0Phillip Taylor, who does a conference for financial bloggers. Armed with\u00a0information, they turned to\u00a0Kickstarter to crowdfund the conference.\n\nThey just needed a small amount ($11,000) to validate the idea, and they weren't sure if it\u00a0would take 30 days to raise the money or if they'd even get it at all. They\u00a0asked the podcast community if they would support the conference, speak at it and share it with their\u00a0network. A\u00a0lot of people said yes, Jared shares, \"but it's one thing to say yes and it's another thing to vote with your wallet.\"\n\n\n\nWhen the campaign was\u00a0published, they\u00a0hit that $11,000 within 9 hours.\u00a0At the end of the 30 days, they\u00a0had over three times the amount needed, which was more than enough validation to sell tickets, pursue sponsors and follow through. Six hundred people came to the first Podcast Movement Conference.\n\nListen to the show to hear more about the Podcast Movement Kickstarter campaign.\n\nWhy Jared started a Facebook group\n\nThe Podcast Movement created\u00a0a Facebook page so they could do ads and other promotions leading up to the\u00a0conference, but they didn't initially have a Facebook group. Although\u00a0they went to other podcast-focused Facebook groups to spread the word, they had to be careful, because some of the groups had a smart but strict policy on self-promotion.\n\nAs soon as the first event was over, there was so much excitement that they realized they needed to create a way for the attendees to continue conversations. That's when\u00a0Jared and his co-founders\u00a0started the Facebook group. Not even a year later, the group has 1,600 members and is\u00a0growing every month.\n\n\n\nThe group is called Podcast Movement - Past, Present, and Future Attendees, so it's open to all past and potential attendees. This way, anyone who is\u00a0interested in podcasting can be involved in the community and the conversations.\n\nListen to the show to learn the original intent of the group.\n\nHow the two\u00a0Facebook communities have helped Jared's business\n\nThe Podcast Movement group and page have served two different purposes.\u00a0The Facebook page has been essential for Facebook ads and for getting the word out to people who might not already know about the conference.", "duration": "43:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-151-15-06-26.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1434708022, "title": "Facebook Growth: How to Create Huge Facebook Communities Without Advertising", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Wondering how to grow your Facebook following without resorting to paid advertising?\n\nWant to discover the secrets to getting more fans and driving them to your blog?\n\nTo learn how one marketer has built several massive Facebook communities, all through organic growth, I interview Collin Cottrell.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He would go to hunting camps with his father and uncles, and\u00a0they would sit around the campfire, tell stories about hunting and talk about life. Collin found he had a passion for hunting, and wanted to figure out how to make a living from it.\n\nIn high school Collin started building websites, doing graphic design and using social media\u00a0(at the time it was MySpace and the beginning of Twitter)\u00a0to build his way into the hunting outdoor industry. For example, he worked on Bowhunting.net (which was on AOL\u00a0in 1994 and then launched fully in 1996). Collin\u00a0also attended hunting and outdoor trade shows, such as the Archery Trade Show, where he would interview\u00a0the different dealers and put the videos on their websites.\n\nThe hunting industry needed a new way to market to their growing customer base with social media, Collin says, and that\u2019s how he found his niche.\n\nAt the same time Collin was going to trade shows, he was building his own marketing company on the side. Developing\u00a0relationships with major players in the hunting industry was a huge boost to his business.\n\nListen to the show to discover the similarity between how Collin and I got started, even though we're in very different niches.\n\nCollin's start on\u00a0Facebook\n\nAround 2007, Collin launched\u00a0a graphics/web design/marketing agency\u00a0with\u00a0a focus on\u00a0the hunting\u00a0and\u00a0outdoor industry. Facebook pages were just being introduced, so Collin decided to create\u00a0hunting-related pages to build\u00a0communities.\n\nIn addition to the bowhunting page, he\u00a0started pages for shed hunting, turkey hunting and more.\n\nFacebook was different at the time, Collin recalls. If you put out good content, and you had a good following, you could reach a lot of people. He put interesting, informative, value-driven content on the page, such as questions, pictures and videos.\n\nA short time later, Collin decided to create a\u00a0whitetail deer hunting page, since it\u2019s the top tier in the hunting industry in America.\u00a0He did crossovers from the other pages to get fans to the new one. This Facebook page\u00a0grew organically very quickly through contests, content and posting several times a day.\n\nA year and a half ago, when they were at 500,000 fans, they were able to reach 25 to 50 million people a month. Whitetail Overload\u00a0launched August 1, 2014.\n\n\n\nSince Collin is a web and graphic designer, he was able to build landing pages and apps for his giveaways right in Facebook, which drove people to\u00a0his pages, as well as other large hunting-related niche pages.\n\nGiveaways, Collin shares,", "duration": "45:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-150-15-06-19.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1434103241, "title": "Meerkat and Periscope: How Businesses Are Using Live Mobile Broadcasting", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you interested in live mobile broadcasting?\n\nHave you tried Meerkat or Periscope?\n\nTo learn about mobile broadcasting apps, I interview Brian Fanzo.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He is always looking for ways people can leverage technology to be\u00a0more productive\u00a0and\u00a0tell their story in unique ways.\u00a0Brian\u00a0likes to jump on every new app: it\u2019ll either fail fast, and he\u2019ll uninstall it or\u00a0he'll run with it! Mobile broadcasting definitely falls into the later category.\n\nBrian shares how he was introduced to Meerkat.\u00a0He was speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, when he got a message from someone who worked at Twitter, telling him that\u00a0Ashton Kutcher and Gary Vaynerchuck were\u00a0on a\u00a0new video app. About 35 seconds later, Brian\u00a0had downloaded it and clicked the start button.\n\nMeerkat came out February 26, 2015, and Brian was on it March 2.\n\nBrian took to Meerkat\u00a0immediately.\u00a0He\u00a0put his mobile device on his tripod, hit the stream button, put in the event hashtag and was live. He treated it like he does his regular YouTube videos: walking around, describing the event and sharing\u00a0it with his audience.\n\nAbout three minutes in, someone commented, \u201cI see the Samsung booth, can you turn to your right.\u201d That\u2019s when Brian\u00a0realized he didn\u2019t just bring the experience to his audience, he was letting his viewers be a part of it. People in the United States could dictate what they saw in Spain. \"It felt interactive, like having a true conversation,\" he recalls.\n\nSince Brian was about to go to\u00a0South by Southwest, \u00a0he put some strategy behind his Meerkating.\u00a0Brian contacted a couple of brands that were holding different events, and asked for backstory, so he could be prepared to cover them. During SXSW,\u00a0Brian\u00a0did a Meerkat of all the sessions he went to, as well as a preview each morning and recap every evening.

The first thing Vani's\u00a0father introduced her mother to was a McDonald's hamburger. Since cows are sacred in India, her mother had never eaten a hamburger before and it was a shock to her system. It turned out American food didn't sit well\u00a0with\u00a0Vani's mother, so she just made Indian food at home.\n\nHowever, she let Vani and her brother eat whatever they wanted. Because the siblings\u00a0wanted to fit in with their neighbors and peers (Indian food looked weird and smelled funny to some of the other kids), they shunned their mother's cooking and asked for fast food and other processed foods.\n\nAs a result, Vani\u00a0had a lot of health issues as a child: eczema, asthma, allergies\u00a0and\u00a0stomachaches. She didn't tie them to food; she thought they were largely genetic, because her brother also had health issues.\u00a0Many years later, her health issues caught up with her. Vani\u00a0was working in a prestigious job for a big-six\u00a0consulting firm shortly after she graduated from college.\u00a0She gained over 30 pounds\u00a0right away (eating catered meals brought into the office and\u00a0fancy dinners out), and landed in the hospital with appendicitis. Vani\u00a0didn't look or feel well. It was a major wake-up call.\n\n\n\nAfter her recovery, when\u00a0Vani\u00a0got back to work, she started to research health and nutrition. She wanted to lose the weight and get healthy.\n\nVani set out to learn about what she was eating; what the ingredients were, why they were in the food and why the food companies were using them. She discovered the chemicals put in food (many of which were\u00a0invented in the last 50 years or so) were there just\u00a0to improve the bottom line of the food industry, to figure out how to sell food cheaper by using food-like substances and making them taste like real food. Vani realized the majority of the food she had been eating was processed and had little to no nutrients left in it.\n\nThe health incident happened 14 years ago\u00a0and Vani started the blog 4 years ago. The Food Babe Way is all about adopting healthy eating habits.\n\nListen to the show to discover what Vani's aunt told her cousin about Vani's\u00a0new look.\n\nFoodBabe.com\n\nVani says she created the blog because her co-workers and friends asked her to.\n\nShe explains how she came up with the name. After asking\u00a0her husband to register the name EatHealthlyLiveForever.com, Vani recalls\u00a0him saying, \"Are you crazy? That's a horrible name. No one's going to remember that.\" She asked him to come up with something better. A few minutes later, he saw FoodBabe.com was available on auction, and suggested that.\n\nAt first Vani didn't want to call it Food Babe because for most of her life, she was anything but a food babe. She decided she wouldn't call herself the Food Babe,", "duration": "52:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-148-15-06-05.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1432893620, "title": "Twitter Marketing: How Smart Marketers Are Succeeding", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use Twitter for your business?\n\nWant to discover how to use the latest Twitter updates?\n\nTo learn more about Twitter marketing, I interview Joel Comm.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Twitter and microblogging interested Joel, since he had already been blogging for several years.\n\n\n\nIn May 2007 Joel posted his first tweet. \"In true, first-tweet form, it was utterly forgettable,\" Joel recalls. \"I think it was something like 'Trying to figure out what this Twitter thing is.'\"\n\nThat was about it, until six months later, when Joel\u00a0gave Twitter\u00a0another try.\u00a0He looked more closely,\u00a0and decided Twitter\u00a0was a cool platform for engagement. Sometime in 2008, after Joel\u00a0accumulated about 5,000 followers, a friend told him John Wiley &\u00a0Sons\u00a0was looking for somebody to write a book on how to use Twitter for business. They connected and hit it off. The first edition of\u00a0Twitter Power\u00a0came\u00a0out in February 2009.\n\nAt the time, many were still trying to figure out\u00a0Twitter, which posed the question, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"We began to realize the heart of social media is about sharing life, relationships, the journey that we are on together,\" Joel says. \"It's the points of commonality that we have in many of these mundane activities ... that bring us closer together. Therein lies the power of Twitter to connect people.\"\n\nAn organic tweeter, Joel uses Twitter.com and the Twitter app on his\u00a0phone. For\u00a0those who like to consolidate and schedule tweets, he\u00a0recommends tools like SocialOomph and Hootsuite.\n\nListen to the show to hear both of our initial thoughts on Twitter.\n\nHow the retweeting process has changed\n\nIn the past\u00a0if people\u00a0wanted to retweet something, they would have to take all of the original tweet's text, copy it and put \"RT\" in front of it. They could only comment if there was any space left in the 140 characters.\n\nJoel believes\u00a0Twitter finally realized that when people want to retweet, they have something they want to say about it. So now, if you want to retweet, you can quote that tweet and still have 116 additional characters left to add to it.\n\n\n\nThis change makes these retweets feel like more of a conversation, because it puts all related tweets together.\n\nThe way it works\u00a0is simple. If you are in the app, you can retweet and share as is or quote the tweet.\u00a0If you are on the site and you click Retweet, it opens up a window and you can comment or just retweet.\n\nListen to the show to learn what Joel thinks of the Twitter character limit.\n\nTwitter video\n\nJoel starts by talking about Vine. You can record a Vine video and it automatically goes to Twitter. In addition to doing a straight video, Vine\u00a0allows you to do creative things. For example, you can\u00a0hold down the\u00a0recording button, let up with your thumb, then point in another direction and take some other video, until you've got your full segment.\n\nJoel finds native Twitter video more interesting,", "duration": "37:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-147-15-05-29-.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1432288837, "title": "Stand Out: How to Build a Following That Matters", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you wondering how to stand out in the noisy online world?\n\nWant to build your status as a thought leader?\n\nTo discover new ways how to stand out, I interview Dorie Clark.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

She then\u00a0realized the next challenge (after you find the place to make your mark) is to become a recognized expert.\n\nShe wanted to learn from the best, so Dorie\u00a0interviewed 50 top thought leaders, including Seth Godin, Daniel Pink\u00a0and David Allen, to try to figure out how they came up with their breakthrough ideas and built their\u00a0following.\n\nDorie wanted to demolish the myth that famous people are perceived as having always been famous. There are certain replicable actions that anyone can do with the right strategy.\n\nOne common thread is that all of the people she profiled are known for their ideas. The idea comes first, and then\u00a0these people roll up their sleeves and work in the trenches in their profession to\u00a0spread their ideas.\n\nMindset is a key factor in whether someone will be successful. Dorie refers to Carol Dweck from Stanford University, who talks about a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset.\u00a0If you have a growth mindset and you're not getting the results you want, you believe if you change\u00a0what you're doing, you'll get those results. If you have a fixed mindset and you're not getting the results you want, you think it must be because you're not smart or talented enough, and there's nothing you can do to change it.\n\nSharing ideas puts you in a position of vulnerability, because it's possible people won't like them. However, it's fundamentally an act of generosity if you have ideas you believe can help the world.\n\nPeople need to step up and be willing to share their ideas, because those who are doing it now are no different than\u00a0anyone else. They are just willing to do something differently.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about\u00a0what stops most people from becoming successful.\n\nWhy create a breakthrough idea?\n\n\n\nA breakthrough idea is something new and valuable that you (and often only you) can contribute, Dorie explains. This is more\u00a0important than ever, because the world we live in today is so competitive and globalized. There is always going to be someone willing to do the work for less money than you.\n\nTen years ago, if you needed a website designed, you went to the Chamber of Commerce mixer to see who does websites, and you picked a designer. Now, you go on Elance or Odesk and find\u00a0someone who will\u00a0do it for half the price around the world.

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nExperiences\nThe book's premise\n\nRobert says he and co-author Carla Johnson believe\u00a0we're moving into a new era of marketing.\n\nMarketing school textbooks (which stop around the mid-1990s) teach the five eras of marketing. All eras last about 20 years. According to Robert,\u00a0we are now in the 6th era, which is relationship marketing.\u00a0The Relationship Era was kicked off\u00a0in the early 1990s with The One to One Future by Dr. Martha Rogers and Don Peppers, which gave birth to the CRM movement.\n\n\n\nAs we move into 2015, Robert explains, we are evolving into a new era.\u00a0\"Developing delightful, informative, useful experiences from marketing's lens is really the new way to formulate a marketing strategy going forward,\" he\u00a0says.\n\nRobert shares more about the evolution of the eras and how they inform this new one.\n\nFrom the early 1990s and into the Internet era (the late 1990s and early 2000s) the goal\u00a0was to figure out how to\u00a0develop a database or a relationship with our consumer and deepen it through the use of data, as well as how to assemble richer data sets around the\u00a0consumer to be able to deliver a better product or service to that consumer, using that relationship. This is what gave\u00a0birth to the CRM movement as we know it today.\n\nAs this era progressed, and social media within it, relationship development between a brand and its\u00a0consumers\u00a0became\u00a0more complex. These days, digital more broadly disrupts how we relate to consumers, since we now have to establish a relationship from that first meeting and beyond.\n\nThat expansion of marketing's responsibility for the full life cycle of the consumer, and the complexity brought on by all of the\u00a0different channels, are creating a real evolution of marketing. We\u00a0need to develop more compelling experiences to be able to delight those customers at various stages of their journey.\n\nListen to the show to discover more about the book.\n\nWhat Robert means when he talks about experiences\u00a0\n\nWhen a business\u00a0creates\u00a0a\u00a0website or something with a physical dimension, such as\u00a0a conference or a print magazine, it's creating an experience for its audience. The hope is to deliver value that's separate and discrete from the company's\u00a0product or service.\n\nRobert shares a few examples.\n\nKraft makes\u00a0macaroni and cheese, as well as other products. However, Kraft's Food & Family magazine\u00a0and\u00a0Kraft's online recipes\u00a0are experiences. They are value delivered to a consumer that's separate from the company's products.\n\n\n\nAnother example would be\u00a0a home cookware shop that teaches\u00a0cooking classes as a means of providing a physical experience. The shop is trying to align its brand or a need or want, and is doing so\u00a0by creating an experience for its customers.", "duration": "38:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-145-15-05-15.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1431079231, "title": "Purpose: How People Over Profit Leads to Business Opportunity", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Does your business have a purpose beyond making money?\n\nWant to discover how shifting your business priorities can make a huge difference?\n\nTo learn how focusing on purpose and people leads to powerful marketing, I interview Dale Partridge.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

When he\u00a0broke his\u00a0arm the summer between high school and\u00a0college, his\u00a0dreams fell apart.\n\nAs\u00a0a baseball pitcher, Dale\u00a0felt pitchers know how to lead the team, so he decided to create a business.\u00a0Dale started a\u00a0fitness company, which grew rapidly but was unsatisfying. So he sold the business. After that he worked in the stock market for a while, before raising money and opening a\u00a0rock-climbing gym. Dale\u00a0thought things were going well until he got\u00a0pulled into the yoga room by one of his\u00a0business partners and was\u00a0fired from his\u00a0own company for being a \"horrible leader.\"\n\nDale changed. He explains how for a few years he went on a frenzy starting companies before hitting a wall. Dale\u00a0realized\u00a0chasing profits wasn't putting meaning in his\u00a0soul.\u00a0He wanted to figure out how to\u00a0blend purpose and profit, and this was the beginning of Sevenly. He was 25.\n\n\"I said, 'let's create a company where every week, we partner with a new charity,'\" Dale recalls. \"We would create products like shirts and hats and beanies and jackets, and any time somebody bought one of our products, we would give $7 to the charity that week. So if we sold 1,000 products, we'd give that charity $7,000.\"\n\nSevenly\u00a0sold 800 products the first week. A few months later, they grew to 10 employees, then 20 employees, and two years later, 45 employees. Sevenly launched on June 13, 2013.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHwgakQcGI\n\nDale explains that seeing money not as the primary goal, but as a byproduct of helping a million people, was the shift. He got lost in something that was so much fun and literally changing the world. Sevenly has raised $4.2 million in $7 donations.\n\nListen to the show to learn about\u00a0the \"aha\" moment that set Dale on this path.\n\nThe system businesses need to break\n\nDale explains the cycle of companies. They often start with a cycle of honesty and move into an era of efficiency.\u00a0When companies get\u00a0big, they go from people over profit to people and profit, and\u00a0become addicted to more. They start confusing being bigger with being better, he adds.\n\nWhat often comes after the efficient era is what Dale\u00a0calls the deceptive era. This is when businesspeople start to lose their soul and forget why they started the company. At that point they either go out of business, or those who stick around enter the final apologetic era. That's\u00a0where they earn back consumers' trust, and go back into the honest cycle.\n\nFor example, Domino's Pizza was one of the worst companies in the world in the 1990s.

At that time the computer lab was basically a windowless cave with 20 rows of 20 computers each, Ted recalls. Early one morning working in the lab, he\u00a0noticed the ambient\u00a0light was\u00a0blue. It was because the Netscape screen was mostly blue, and that's the site everyone used.\n\n\n\nAfter 20 minutes or so of searching fruitlessly and getting frustrated with Netscape, somebody leaned over and suggested Ted\u00a0try Google, which he did.\n\nTed's test search term was his\u00a0mother's name, Dr. Lynette Wright, a fairly famous medical geneticist. However, since they share the same last name as the guys who invented airplanes, most search engines easily got confused.\n\n\"Google returned my mother as the second search term, instead of eight\u00a0pages deep, which was the norm for other sites,\" Ted shares. He\u00a0kept working and 20 minutes later, Ted\u00a0noticed\u00a0the guy next to him\u00a0getting frustrated. So Ted\u00a0leaned over and explained Google to him.\n\nAbout four\u00a0or five\u00a0hours later, Ted finished working, stood up, looked around and noticed\u00a0the light in the room changed from the ambient blue of Netscape to the ambient white\u00a0of the\u00a0Google screen.\n\nTed, who's always trying to figure out how things work, found that very interesting. So during his\u00a0second year at the University of Chicago, he blew apart the history, math, psychology and epidemiology of word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nAfter graduation, Ted decided to start his own\u00a0business. That company, which he started\u00a015 years ago,\u00a0is now called Fizz.\n\nListen to the show to discover the unique way in which Ted watched TiVo and Google get adopted.\n\nThe importance of word-of-mouth marketing\n\nTed defines word-of-mouth marketing as \"identifying your influencers and coming up with a story that is interesting, relevant and authentic that ladders back to qualities of your brand and then sharing that story as much as possible.\"\n\n\n\nThat's the\u00a0first part. The second part, Ted says, is \"creating for your influencers as many opportunities as you can as a brand or a company for them if they feel like it to share your brand's story with as many people as they would like to do so.\"\n\nTed shares the word-of-mouth marketing campaign he ran for Pabst Blue Ribbon (P.B.R.) with\u00a0the brand manager at the time, Neal Stewart.\u00a0The goal was to get more people in America to drink P.B.R.\n\nTed identifies the three critical components of a story being shared:\n\n\tIs the story interesting to influencers so they will pick it up, study it and really understand it?\n\tIs it relevant to influencers' audiences?\n\tIs it authentic the way they currently understand the brand and the category in general?", "duration": "44:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-143_15-05-01.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1429869659, "title": "More Marketing Time: How to Procrastinate Your Way to Success", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you spend too much time on insignificant tasks?\n\nWant to have more time to do\u00a0what you do best?\n\nTo learn how to multiply your time as a marketer by procrastinating, I interview Rory Vaden.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Rory says it\u00a0also means he knows more about makeup than cars.\n\n\n\nDuring\u00a0college at the University of Denver, Rory was recruited to work in a program called Southwestern Advantage, where he sold educational children's reference books door-to-door\u00a0and eventually managed salespeople. He says that's\u00a0where he\u00a0developed a passion for sales.\n\nIn 2006, Rory and three others\u00a0started Southwestern Consulting, with\u00a0the mission to help salespeople achieve their goals in life. They now have\u00a0115 team members and are working with more than 1,000 people.\n\nRory's\u00a0first book, Take the Stairs, is\u00a0all about the psychology of overcoming procrastination, improving self-discipline and getting yourself to do things you know you should do that you don't feel like doing. It\u00a0answers the question, \"How do the most disciplined people in the world get themselves to be disciplined?\"\n\nRory's\u00a0second book, Procrastinating on Purpose, addresses the question, \"How do the most successful people today think about time and do they believe the same clich\u00e9s we often hear about time management?\" Rory says a lot of them don't.\n\nListen to the show to discover what launched Rory's speaking career.\n\nWhy people struggle with time management\n\nRory says\u00a0there is no such thing as time management, only self management.\n\nIn the world we live in today, time management isn't just logical, it's emotional. Our feelings of guilt, fear, worry and anxiety, as well as our desire for success and our need to feel valued dictate how we spend our time\u2014as much as our inbox, our to-do list and\u00a0our calendar do.\u00a0There's also a new type of thinker that has emerged:\u00a0the\u00a0multiplier.\n\nRory shares the history of time management.\n\nEra one time-management thinking is one-dimensional. It was developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and was all about efficiency. All things being equal, doing things faster is better. However,\u00a0there is a point of diminishing returns with efficiency.\n\n\n\nEra two time-management thinking is two-dimensional. This was ushered in by Dr. Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, in the late 80s. Dr. Covey gave us the time-management matrix. The Y axis was importance (how much something matters) and the X axis was urgency (how soon it matters), so it was a way to score tasks and prioritize based on their score. While\u00a0prioritizing is a relevant skill today, there is a massive limitation\u2014nothing about prioritizing creates more time.\n\nRory believes you cannot solve today's time-management problems with yesterday's time-management solutions.\n\nPeople who are multipliers, Rory says,", "duration": "43:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-142_15-04-24.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1429264820, "title": "Marketing Trends: How to Think Differently and Predict the Future", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want to stay on top of the latest marketing trends?\n\nLooking to tap into the next big trend?\n\nTo explore marketing trends, I interview Rohit Bhargava.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Rohit Bhargava, the author of Personality Not Included and Likeonomics.

For example, he'd work for a toothbrush brand in the morning and an enterprise data client in the afternoon. This is how he\u00a0started making connections among industries\u00a0and began\u00a0thinking about trends. Rohit started\u00a0writing trend reports in 2011.\n\nRohit's experience includes working with Leo Burnett in Australia and\u00a0Ogilvy\u00a0in the United States. He did digital strategy and even worked on\u00a0Intel's first social media guidelines.\n\nOne of the biggest problems, Rohit explains, is a lot of trends are self-serving. \"Imagine I have a company that sells hammers, and then I declare 2015 the year of hammers,\" he laughs. \"How convenient is that?\"\n\nPeople declare trends based on whatever they sell so it helps them, but what they point to isn't actually a trend.\n\nRohit\u00a0considers a trend to be an observation about the accelerating present. That\u00a0means there\u00a0are\u00a0signs of something already happening\u00a0that\u00a0will\u00a0become\u00a0more important. A trend\u00a0will\u00a0either change the way consumers make decisions or change the way companies structure their business models or how they do business.\n\nListen to the show to discover one of the biggest mistakes many trend writers\u00a0make.\n\nWhy marketers should care about trends\n\nThe biggest benefit to knowing about trends, Rohit explains, is to know when to pivot. The term pivot is frequently used improperly. For example, if someone\u00a0sells bicycles and then becomes a coffee shop, it's not a pivot, it's a completely new business.\n\nAn actual pivot was seen when BMW, in addition to making cars, decided to start a program called DriveNow\u00a0in which\u00a0they rent electric cars. They're tapping into the trend of the\u00a0sharing and collaborative economy, and experimenting with their business model. BMW is saying we still make super high-quality cars, but we now distribute them in different ways: we sell, lease\u00a0and rent them.\n\nThat's smart, Rohit says. It's\u00a0the way to look at something that's happening in the marketplace and see how it affects your business.\n\n\n\nMarketers need to be on the lookout for trends and pivot accordingly, but also understand trends that are\u00a0already happening.\n\nListen to the show to learn about Rohit's haystack method\u00a0and\u00a0the difference between trend curating and trendspotting.\n\nGlanceable content\n\nThe trend of glanceable content is a reaction to our shrinking attention spans, Rohit explains. There's material out there, like BuzzFeed headlines, that tantalize us so much we can't help clicking on them.\n\nBut that alone doesn't make it a trend.\n\nThis idea of the shrinking attention span leads\u00a0to innovation in unexpected places. There's\u00a0a team of MIT researchers working on studies of\u00a0glance behavior: how fast\u00a0can we read something in a situation when we need to consume it quickly?

He\u00a0realized if he was going to talk about Twitter,\u00a0blogging and Facebook, he had\u00a0to use them. So he\u00a0started a blog as an experiment. It took him\u00a0about 9 months to find his\u00a0voice, Mark recalls. It dawned on him\u00a0that all of his\u00a0contacts and business were coming through his\u00a0blog, so he needed to pay attention to it.\u00a0The blog really started kicking in around 2010, and has\u00a0been building ever since.\n\n\n\nThe turning point happened when Mark started to write posts that were\u00a0more authentic and had personality. Instead of finding his\u00a0audience, Mark's\u00a0audience found him. Mark tells new bloggers \"To stand out, you need to be original. And to be original, you need to have the courage to tell your own story and have your own voice.\"\n\nIn 2009 Mark wrote a post that was\u00a0a little bit controversial, called The Social Media Country Club. As a new blogger, Mark felt like\u00a0an outsider. He says\u00a0it seemed like all of the influential bloggers were in this club, where they never said anything negative about each other. Mark\u00a0was thinking, \"How are we going to grow if we don't challenge each other?\" Coming\u00a0from 27 years of marketing experience, Mark\u00a0expected any channel used for business to be measurable, while others felt it was all about the conversation. Though nervous, Mark started speaking his mind. The reaction was supportive and positive. His audience was grateful somebody finally said it.\n\nListen to the show to discover what Mark blogged about at first and how he felt about it.\n\nWhy marketing with content is so difficult today\n\nWhether you're an individual blogger, working in a business or working for a brand, many niches are getting crowded with content and social media activity. This makes it\u00a0very difficult to compete.\n\nMark feels this was predictable. He says when the Internet first started, everyone needed a website. If you were the first one with a website, you had an advantage. Then you\u00a0needed to be found. If you were the first one to figure out search engine optimization,\u00a0you had an advantage, because you're going to be at the top of the search rankings. However,\u00a0after\u00a0your competitors figured it out, it got harder and more expensive to be in marketing.\n\nHe says it's the same thing with blogging. It's hard to be seen, because people are figuring it out. People are trying to stand out, but creating more or better content isn't necessarily the answer.\n\nFor the last year, Mark has\u00a0been obsessed with figuring out how to maneuver in this very crowded world. And that's why he wrote The Content Code.\n\nListen to the show to hear my Times Square analogy.\n\nMark's code for success\n\n\n\nMark explains how\u00a0all conversations are about content: creating more,", "duration": "43:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-140-15-04-10.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1428055231, "title": "Influencer Marketing: How to Work With Influential People", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you reach out to\u00a0influencers?\n\nWant to create good relationships to increase your visibility and get more customers?\n\nTo learn how to work with influencers, I interview Doug Karr.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Then about 12 years ago, he started a\u00a0blog.\n\nFrom a database marketing standpoint, Doug shares he's\u00a0always been intrigued by the pockets or the gaps, and not the averages. In the direct mail days, the motto\u00a0was \"go after a certain age group, gender and neighborhood, and get 100% saturation.\" Doug found, over time,\u00a0it was the\u00a0smaller pockets of people who had higher conversion rates.\n\nThis is true in online marketing as well. People who do SEO\u00a0optimize for huge keywords with massive search volumes. Maybe they rank, but they don't get any results (meaning business) out of it.\n\n\n\nInfluencer marketing is the same, in that people go after influencers. They spend a lot of money without\u00a0seeing results,\u00a0because they make\u00a0significant errors as they select and research influencers.\n\nDoug says he\u00a0tells people who are transitioning from traditional to online media that he doesn't think a lot has changed. As marketers, it's all about building trust\u00a0and\u00a0satisfying clients.\n\nBlogging and social media are great for that,\u00a0because customers can now\u00a0talk to people at different companies and get insight into their business through these channels. You build relationships virtually, then get those people\u00a0to convert.\n\nListen to the show to hear what opportunities came to Doug from blogging.\n\nHow Doug defines influencer marketing\n\nDoug believes influencers are people within our industry who\u00a0already have established trust with an audience.\n\nLet's say\u00a0someone has an amazing audience you want to reach. The best way to get to that person's audience\u00a0is to create an influencer marketing campaign and work with that influencer\u00a0to help you\u00a0promote your products and services.\n\nThe keys are audience (find an influencer whose audience matches what you need) and reach. Determine if the influencer's reach is wide enough to make your campaign\u00a0sensible from a time and money standpoint.\n\nListen to the show to hear examples of good influencers to reach out to in the marketing and social media space.\n\nThe differences among reach, popularity and influence\n\nDoug says half of the time, a\u00a0company fails because they focus on reach and popularity, but not necessarily on influence.\n\nInfluence is not about\u00a0retweets or shares. It's about conversions. If someone\u00a0makes a purchase based on a person's advice, that person\u00a0is an influencer.\n\n\n\nWhen Doug works with an influencer, he looks at that person's\u00a0target audience to see whether he or she has captivated their trust and made sales to them.\u00a0One\u00a0of the telltale signs that influencers are doing well is\u00a0they've had the\u00a0same\u00a0sponsor on their site for 3 years; they don't switch them out every month.\n\nDoug also cautions that before entering into a relationshi...", "duration": "41:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-139-15-04-03.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1427623233, "title": "Launching Products: Lessons From Mistakes and Pushing Boundaries", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Thinking of launching a product, service or even a company?\n\nWant ideas of what to do and what not to do?\n\nIn this special episode, we're going to talk about how to push the boundaries when you launch.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

In July 2013 we launched a website designed to help busy parents do fun activities with their kids. I shut it down a year and a couple months later.\n\n\n\nI learned when you launch something in a space that you do not have a lot of experience in, you need to do more research than I did.\n\nMy\u00a0research process prior to launching My Kids' Adventures included going\u00a0to the library and to book stores\u00a0and\u00a0identifying popular blogs. While\u00a0we made assumptions based on what we saw everyone else doing, we didn\u2019t test whether our\u00a0target audience (busy, working professionals) had the time to read, consume, do and share our content, even though they may have had the\u00a0desire to do so.\n\nWays to test these assumptions\u00a0would have been to go to\u00a0trade shows attended by my target audience and talk to them or do a joint survey with a big website in that space to\u00a0gather data.\n\nOne thing I learned was sometimes it\u2019s better to go deep in a space where you are already successful than to try to go wide into a space where you don\u2019t know anything.\n\nThere are so many niches where people have developed some success. They hear the word pivot and decide to dive into something new. Instead of doing that, the better thing to do is figure out something new that still fits with your existing audience.\n\nThe hardest thing in the world is to create an audience. And you can\u2019t launch a product if you do not have an audience.\n\nListen to the show to learn the\u00a0biggest mistake I made when I launched My Kids' Adventures.\u00a0\nThe Phases of a Product Launch\nThe research and definition phase\n\nWhenever I get a new idea for a product, it starts with a spark in my brain. One of the first things I do is talk through my idea with people I trust to see whether or not my vision is crazy. I have these crazy ideas about every two months, and the vast majority of them never turn into anything.\n\nAfter talking to a lot of people, and justifying why I thought this newest venture would be successful for busy marketers,\u00a0I came up with a list of assumptions\u00a0to test.\n\n\n\nLast\u00a0fall, I\u00a0put together a readers\u2019 survey.", "duration": "47:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-138b-15-03-29.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1427450413, "title": "Split Testing: How to Improve Your Site Conversions", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you split test the opt-ins on your website?\n\nWant to get better results?\n\nTo learn how to create effective split tests, I interview conversion expert Joanna Wiebe.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Joanna Wiebe, a copywriter, conversion expert and founder of CopyHackers.com--a website designed to help you improve your conversions.

After leaving law school, she was looking for her next opportunity.\u00a0When a\u00a0friend who worked\u00a0at an agency said they were looking for a writer, Joanna got the position, along with\u00a0the title\u00a0creative writer. (She thought copywriter sounded\u00a0too boring.)\n\nA couple years later, Joanna went over to Intuit (makers of Turbo Tax)\u00a0as\u00a0senior copywriter. Once there, she says she finally\u00a0figured out what copywriting was ... and understood that it was not boring!\n\nJoanna explains\u00a0the difference between a creative writer and a copywriter. A\u00a0creative writer is a person who is more likely to come up with tag lines and concepts for ads and campaigns. It's someone who abstracts a message from insights. On the other hand, from Joanna's experience\u00a0a\u00a0copywriter is more of a scientific writer. Copywriting\u00a0is not about you. It's\u00a0about listening to people who are potentially nothing like you to find the right message, she says.\n\n\n\nAccording to Joanna, split testing became more readily available eight or nine years ago,\u00a0and testing tools, like Optimizely, VWO and Omniture (before it was\u00a0acquired by Adobe), were starting to pop up. So the company\u00a0started\u00a0split testing\u00a0different approaches to solving problems. They would\u00a0test them using actual data: website visitors or email subscribers helped them test by voting with their clicks or their credit cards.\n\nThis led Joanna\u00a0to start\u00a0Copy Hackers about\u00a0three years ago.\n\nListen to the show to discover how creativity stifled Joanna in her first position as a writer.\n\nThe ad at the bottom of Copy Hackers\n\n\n\nTo capture email addresses Joanna\u00a0uses a solution called Bounce Exchange. They have been experimenting with ways to get people's attention.\n\nThere\u2019s a little guy in the corner of the website and it says \u201cClick here to get a free guide.\u201d It appears as you\u2019re scrolling down the page. Once you click on it, it gives you the opt-in box.\n\nBounce Exchange is software presented with a service, Joanna explains.

So Jason\u00a0quit, went back to school for training in SEO and digital marketing. He\u00a0worked at a little startup called Market Tools, then Marketo and he's now at LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nJason talks about his time at Marketo. He\u00a0led global and content marketing and did\u00a0the blog and the social channels himself when he\u00a0first started. It was chaos, he recalls. Jason\u00a0learned very quickly how to solve other marketers' problems and write about them, which is\u00a0how he\u00a0grew his\u00a0blogging skills.\n\n\"It was B2B marketing, which could be quite boring,\" Jason recalls. \"I took what I call the George Costanza approach, where I do the exact opposite of what everybody else is doing.\"\n\nFor example, if someone said to Jason that social media doesn't work in B2B, he\u00a0would do the exact opposite and prove them wrong. After a tremendous amount of trial and error to find out what worked and scaling his\u00a0content efforts, Jason was successful.\n\nListen to the show to hear the backstory for Welcome to the Funnel.\n\nBuild relationships that tie into content\n\nJason believes it's essential to include influencers in your marketing strategy, especially in your content.\n\nWhen you first start building your presence, seek out\u00a0thought leaders in the space.\u00a0Figure out how to\u00a0take their wisdom and feature it in your content. You'll\u00a0add third-party validation and keep from talking too much about yourself.\n\nAt the same time, you also get on their radar. They know you're helping them spread the word and eventually you can find mutual benefit.\n\nListen to the show to learn how going to conferences helped Jason get into\u00a0guest blogging.\u00a0\n\nHow to create\u00a0sharable content that generates leads\n\nJason believes we don't need more content, we need more relevant content.\n\nHe has\u00a0a concept he started at Marketo and brought over to LinkedIn called, \"The Big Rock.\" Basically you need to\u00a0ask yourself what conversation you want to own, and then write the book on it.\n\nJason suggests going\u00a0from thinking like a publisher to actually publishing like a publisher.\n\nWhen Jason\u00a0first got to LinkedIn, the question was, \"How do I market on LinkedIn successfully?\" Since\u00a0the conversation was being owned by others, Jason\u00a0decided\u00a0to take it back. He\u00a0wrote a 65-page book called The Sophisticated Marketer's Guide to LinkedIn. It was everything you wanted to know about marketing on LinkedIn, written very strategically.\n\n\n\nIt\u00a0was\u00a0broad-reaching content gated for the purpose of\u00a0collecting\u00a0email addresses.

She was mostly an observer, and wanted to interact with others on the platform. In 2008, she started creating videos on her first YouTube channel. Amy enjoyed\u00a0having a creative outlet where she could record and share experiences with her friends.\n\nWhen social media gained popularity, Amy looked at\u00a0video differently.\u00a0\"I talked on Twitter to get to know people. I talked to a camera, so I could share that experience with those people. It was that simple,\" she recalls. \"Then I started to realize there was a lot more to this story.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2011 Amy began\u00a0working independently. She used video to differentiate herself in the marketing space\u00a0and\u00a0started creating videos for her\u00a0Savvy\u00a0Sexy\u00a0Social blog.\n\nNow, she has a camera set up in her\u00a0office\u00a0and\u00a0a fun bookshelf background.\n\nThree times a week Amy\u00a0talks via video to people who want to learn more about implementing social media for their brand and their business. Although she's made other fun videos, as well as videos for brands, she recently filmed her\u00a0400th episode for the\u00a0Savvy\u00a0Sexy\u00a0Social blog.\n\nListen to the show to hear Amy's opinion on which came first: social media or video.\n\nFacebook video vs. YouTube\n\nAmy believes linking to a YouTube\u00a0video on Facebook has never been a good idea, because you need to customize the experience based on the platform. Although a YouTube link has never been visually pleasing on Facebook,\u00a0there's always been a way to work around that.\n\nNow that Facebook is\u00a0pushing their own organic video, the game is changing.\u00a0If you have an audience on Facebook or are hoping to grow one, it's definitely something to consider.\n\n\n\nAmy\u00a0wants people to watch her YouTube\u00a0videos, but within a space she\u00a0controls, which is her\u00a0website. Usually when Amy\u00a0posts to Facebook, it's a blog link with the video embedded on her\u00a0site.\n\nHowever, since Facebook\u00a0video will\u00a0perform better than a link to a blog or a YouTube\u00a0video,\u00a0Amy suggests another option.\n\nSince\u00a0Facebook video has a clear call-to-action button that you customize at the end, it's an excellent teaser opportunity. \"If the first 30 seconds of the video are really interesting, then upload that to Facebook,\" she says. \"Then, have the call to action at the end ask viewers to watch the rest of it on your website.\"\n\nListen to the show to find out what loyal YouTubers think about using Facebook\u00a0video.\n\nMistakes video marketers make\n\n\"There's way too much green screen time going on,\" Amy says. To be a professional on video, you don't need\u00a0a perfect backdrop. YouTube and other online video platforms are places\u00a0to get to know someone personally, so relax. You can still have the level of prestige that your brand deserves without having a formal background.\n\nThe beginning of the video is the most critical, Amy adds.\u00a0A lot of marketers and businesses spend far too much time at the beginning of a video doing what they think is the right thing and not considering t...", "duration": "41:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-136-15-03-13.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1425639652, "title": "Crowdfunding: What You Need to Know to Succeed With Crowdfunding", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you plan to launch a product,\u00a0project or business?\n\nWant to learn how to use crowdfunding to support your next venture?\n\nTo learn how to succeed with crowdfunding, I interview Emily Best.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

She\u00a0would come\u00a0to the\u00a0set with scripts for big indie films that had embarrassing and dismal parts for women.\u00a0The\u00a0largely female production group for the play\u00a0would have drinks after the show, \"rage against the state of women in cinema\" and discuss\u00a0doing something about it.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Caitlin was making a movie called Newlyweds with well-known DIY filmmaker Ed Burns.\u00a0Ed shot Newlyweds\u00a0with a\u00a0scaled-down crew for $9,000, made possible by the video capacity of D-SLR cameras.\n\nEmily recalls during one of their rage sessions in late 2010, Caitlin\u00a0said, \"Guys, we should make a movie. It's so easy. And I'll prove it to you.\"\n\nThat was the beginning.\n\nListen to the show to hear what happened when Emily visited Caitlin on the Newlyweds set.\n\nHow Emily crowdfunded her film\n\nCaitlin and Caroline von Kuhn, who wrote the script for their film Like the Water, did not write a mockumentary shot in downtown Manhattan like Newlyweds. They wrote a slow, contemplative indie drama about grief and friendship set in Maine in the summer.\n\nSince Emily's film was an entirely different scope, she learned quickly that\u00a0it couldn't be shot for\u00a0$9,000; their shooting budget was $85,000.\u00a0Emily says they had raised $65,000 from a group they\u00a0affectionately referred to as \"friends, family and fools\" and were looking at a $20,000 shortfall in spring 2011.\n\nhttpv://youtu.be/PFDjGcLQaVk\n\nMost independent\u00a0films are made by\u00a0a group of friends getting together when everyone's schedules line up. This was also the case with Emily's film, so they had a very short window to find the rest of their funding. Pre-production through shooting was planned to take place from\u00a0the middle of June to the beginning of August. It was May, and they had to find a way to communicate the importance of the film to their community\u00a0and get the rest of the funding.\n\nEmily says it didn't take long for a bunch of women to land on a familiar message for people seeking to crowdfund projects: a wedding registry. At the time, Kickstarter and Indiegogo were new.\n\nThey\u00a0made a list of everything they\u00a0needed: cameras, car rentals, bug spray, sunscreen, wardrobe, food, coffee\u00a0and more. Emily\u00a0typed it into a WordPress blog\u00a0and\u00a0put a PayPal link at the bottom. Then, the six\u00a0of them sent it to everyone they knew.\u00a0In 30 days, they'd raised $23,000 in cash and hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans and gifts of locations,\u00a0goods and services. And then they went off to make the\u00a0film.\n\n\n\nThe community involvement for\u00a0this type of crowdfunding offered numerous benefits.", "duration": "42:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-135-15-03-06.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1425034856, "title": "Snapchat Marketing: What Businesses Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you on\u00a0Snapchat?\n\nDo you use it for\u00a0marketing?\n\nTo learn how to use Snapchat for your business, I interview Gary Vaynerchuk and Shaun McBride.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nSnapchat Marketing\nWhy marketers use Snapchat\n\nGary believes marketers\u00a0need to be\u00a0where people are paying attention. As a platform,\u00a0Snapchat has the attention\u00a0of\u00a015- to 25-year-olds in America. If that's the demographic you're trying to reach, you need to be on\u00a0Snapchat. A bonus of Snapchat is that the grounds are very fertile, Gary adds. It's so new, brands haven't \"ruined it yet.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Shaun, a lot of people think that\u00a0since\u00a0Snapchat content disappears, it's not valuable. He says that's not the case.\n\nOn many social media platforms, viewers\u00a0scroll through\u00a0content quickly. And even though those posts\u00a0will be there forever, viewers will never see it again. Marketers are only grasping for 50% of users'\u00a0attention at a time, and those users\u00a0never look back.\n\nSnapchat users can't look back. However, marketers have 100% of their audience's attention for the\u00a0length of the content's life.\n\nShaun explains that on Snapchat, you send out pictures or videos for a certain number of seconds (1 to 10). As the consumer, you absorb that content and then it disappears off your screen. Your never see it again, unless you screenshot the frame of a movie or a picture, which gets\u00a0reposted.\n\nGary\u00a0believes the younger generation gravitates toward\u00a0Snapchat, because parents have infiltrated\u00a0Facebook and now Instagram. \"Snapchat created a haven that parents didn't know about,\" Gary explains. \"Plus, the content itself just disappeared. The holy grail for teenagers.\"\n\nListen to the show to hear Gary's 80s analogy\u00a0for\u00a0Snapchat.\n\nWhat marketers are doing on Snapchat\n\nShaun\u00a0uses Snapchat to\u00a0involve and engage his fans in projects.\n\nFor example, Shaun created a\u00a0Jurasnap Park, playing off of Jurassic Park, full of all of his friends. He invited them to take a selfie, draw themselves\u00a0into a dinosaur and send it to him. He then took screenshots and reposted all the dinosaur snaps of his fans\u00a0for the world to see. They felt involved because it was a group project, rather than a project\u00a0he just\u00a0did on his own.\n\n\n\nGary explains that what Shaun did with his Snapchat story is\u00a0a way your business can interact\u00a0with\u00a0everyone who follows\u00a0you, instead of just engaging one to one.\n\nCreative people think of stories in a linear sense, Gary shares. They put out 7 to 15 collections of images to tell a 150-second story instead of just one 10-second story. Depending on how you want to tell a story, Snapchat offers options. You can share a long narrative, like snapping your entire night at the Super Bowl, or just add\u00a0one snap at a time.\u00a0Snapchat\u00a0has enormous creative potential if you understand context.\n\n\n\nShaun created a platform for himself, Gary adds. Many people engage with Shaun\u00a0because he gives back. Some enjoy getting\u00a0acknowledgement from somebody they deem famous.

In 2003 he\u00a0joined a student loan company startup as the director of technology. In the startup world, you do many different jobs. Christopher explains that in addition to being the CIO and CTO, he\u00a0ended up doing a lot of the marketing, data collection and reporting to stakeholders. Over time, he realized \u00a0he\u00a0enjoyed the marketing more than running the technology.\n\nListen to the show to hear how Christopher used podcasting and social media to stand out from larger companies.\n\nThe importance of\u00a0analytics\n\n\n\nChristopher believes\u00a0there's a perception that doing analytics is difficult and requires a math degree. However,\u00a0he relates analytics\u00a0to cooking. He says you don't need to be a professional chef to make a decent breakfast\u2014you just need to follow the basic recipe. If you want to be a professional chef, that's a different story. You should have a culinary degree and years of experience.\n\nData and analytics are the same way, Christopher explains. If you want to be able to intelligently report on what you're doing, it's relatively easy to get started. If you want to get super-sophisticated, you'll probably want a statistics background down the road.\n\nIn terms of what's readily available, particularly for social media, there are four layers of measurement:\n\n\tThe media layer with\u00a0social tools and analytics about audience reach and engagement.\n\tThe web layer, where after engaging on social media, someone interacts on your website.\n\tThe middle layer is marketing automation, which is\u00a0tracking engagement at an individual level.\n\tThe bottom layer is your sales and CRM.\n\nChristopher believes the first step toward strategy is measurement and data. After you\u00a0analyze the data, which is the art and science of telling what happened, then you need\u00a0to derive insights from it. Once you determine why certain things happened, then you can figure out what to do next.\n\nListen to the show to learn why and how to use benchmarking on Google Analytics.\u00a0\n\nSimple things marketers can do with Google Analytics\n\nMarketers need to start by defining\u00a0goals and goal values in their\u00a0analytics. That changes the application from \"what happened\" to \"how it's impacting your business.\"\n\nFor example, choose a goal, like newsletter signups. Then determine\u00a0what dollar value you put on a newsletter subscriber (what a subscriber spends on your website). Once you do that,\u00a0you'll start to see things like estimated revenue of traffic. This is the value of traffic coming from social media and search to your site.\n\n\n\nBefore delving into\u00a0specific features of the platform, Christopher recommends taking the free courses offered by Google Analytics Academy.

Laura admits she even blogged about\u00a0how stupid she thought Twitter was. The following month she gave it one more shot. Within 24 hours, Laura's opinion changed. She followed\u00a0a bunch of fascinating people, and saw first-hand how Twitter makes you feel connected.\n\n\n\nLaura feels she got the hang of it within a month, went to her first Tweetup and the beginning of June put her Twitter handle on her business cards.

She\u00a0never finished that proposal. She did, however, make several friends at Wiley through Twitter. She reached out to one of them and asked who to talk to about her book. They were looking for someone to write Twitter for Dummies. A match was made.\n\nThe first edition of Twitter for Dummies came out the same time Laura\u00a0launched OneForty.\n\nListen to the show to find out how Laura came up with the name for Pistachio consulting and why she used it for Twitter.\n\nHow to be successful on\u00a0Twitter\n\nLaura\u00a0hears a lot of the same questions about Twitter all the time: \"How do I get more followers?\" \"What do I tweet about?\" \"What is the point of Twitter? What is the value for my business?\"\n\nLaura believes\u00a0people\u00a0need to\u00a0center everything they\u00a0do on Twitter around who they\u00a0want to read it. You need to figure out who the perfect customer is for your\u00a0business\u00a0and what they actually need.\n\nStart by writing a Twitter mission statement on your profile that addresses who the account is for and what value it delivers. Whenever you are deciding what to tweet, see if it fits your mission. The other great thing about a mission statement, Laura adds, is that it\u00a0lets others simply articulate what your account is about, who should follow it and why.\n\n\n\nThe key to being successful on Twitter is sharing the right information, whether it's your own links or other content. Laura adds that you can get away with a fair amount of self-promotion, if you provide information\u00a0that helps people, especially the people who would make a good customer for you in the first place.\n\nIn his book What Would Google Do?,\u00a0Jeff Jarvis said, \"Do what you do best and link to the rest. You can build a valuable Twitter account that shares hardly any original content if it\u2019s extremely well curated.\"\n\nListen to the show to hear Social Media Examiner's Twitter mission statement.\u00a0\n\nBusinesses doing Twitter right\n\nLaura shares two personal Twitter experiences. One with Canada Goose Inc and another\u00a0with Verizon. In both cases she\u00a0had a specific customer-service need.\u00a0With Verizon, she had a wire down on her\u00a0street. With Canada Goose Inc she\u00a0had an order for a hard-to-find jacket cancel out.\n\nIn both cases she\u00a0said on Twitter.\u201cHey @company.", "duration": "43:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-132-15-02-13.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1423220453, "title": "Book Marketing: Wisdom From Seth Godin", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Wondering how a master marketer thinks about books and the launch process?\n\nTo explore book marketing, blogging and podcasts, I interview Seth Godin.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I'll interview Seth Godin, author of 17 books, including Purple Cow, Permission Marketing and Tribes. He blogs every day on topics related to marketing, leadership and more. He also has an excellent podcast mini-series called Seth Godin's Startup School.\n\nSeth and I explore his latest book along with his thoughts on publishing and marketing books.\n\nYou'll discover Seth's philosophy\u00a0on writing, the importance he puts on blogging and more.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.

He\u00a0explains that he usually comes up with the title early in the process, and then writes\u00a0the book to go with it. However,\u00a0in this case, the title came second to last.\n\nThe book exists because when his son\u00a0was\u00a0heading off to college, he asked Seth\u00a0to write down his advice. A\u00a0letter to his son turned into a book for everyone. It's a heavily illustrated book about fear, bravery and doing work that matters.\n\nSeth's background is in publishing and he was a book packager for 12 years, during which time he and his team wrote 120 books. These included almanacs, books on gardening, business and everything in between.\n\nIn 1999, he started writing books as a solo\u00a0author. One person with a point of view. That's when things shifted for him, he says. \"I didn\u2019t say, 'What book do I need to write next, because I need to pay the bills?' I said, 'What do I care enough about saying to put myself through all the pain and suffering it takes to bring a book into the world?'\n\nSeth's first \"real book\" was Permission Marketing\u00a0which has his picture on the cover.\n\nListen to the show to discover why Seth believes all of his books are marketing books.\n\nHow Seth decides what to write when it comes to his books\n\nSeth doesn\u2019t think he has much say in what he chooses to write about. While he is\u00a0very strategic in most elements of his\u00a0life, his best writing is not strategic at all. \"I start with an itch and the writing is my scratching of the itch,\" Seth reveals.\n\nHe\u00a0starts a new book every few days, and some of them\u00a0only last a paragraph or two, which is why it\u2019s great to have a blog. If a book won\u2019t go away, then he has\u00a0to write it.\n\n\n\nSeth believes most people shouldn\u2019t look at the book business as a way to make a living. The book business is an organized hobby, and a fabulous way to bring ideas into the world and a great thing to leave behind.\n\nFor those who want to write a book to become a paid, professional author, Seth says, don't. Instead, think about using books as a generous way to spread ideas\u00a0and\u00a0earn trust.\n\nListen to the show to learn why Seth doesn\u2019t discuss upcoming projects with his peers.\n\nWhy Seth decided to publish and distribute this book on his own\n\nSince most people don't finish the books on their Kindle, Seth\u00a0wanted What to Do When It's Your Turn\u00a0to be only available on paper. He also didn't want people to buy\u00a0just one copy of the book.\n\n\"If you buy 1 copy, I send you 2. If you buy 3 copies, I send you 5. If you buy 8 copies, I send you 12,\" he explains. \"If you get an extra copy of a book, you have to give it away.\"\n\nSince ideas are now spreading person to person and not top down,\u00a0Seth wanted\u00a0this book to be\u00a0his\u00a0experiment with horizontal publishing.", "duration": "41:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-131-15-02-06.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1422615606, "title": "Content Curation: How to Easily Find Great Content to Share", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you curate content for your blog and social media sites?\n\nWant to discover how to find remarkable content to share?\n\nTo learn how to explore content curation, I interview Ian Cleary.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He wanted an international business that combined his\u00a0knowledge of tools, technology and social media, which led him to\u00a0RazorSocial.\n\nIan explains when he started the blog just over two\u00a0years ago, he initially focused on guest blogging. Ian\u00a0developed relationships with other people in the industry, seeking out\u00a0opportunities to guest post on similar sites. It got his name out there and drove\u00a0traffic to his site, which was the intent. He then had to make sure his site had really good content.\n\n\n\nIan now\u00a0has\u00a0more than\u00a0100,000 visitors to the\u00a0site every month. They run\u00a0webinars and sell online training. Ian's primary focus is to still build relationships and provide quality content. \"People are prepared to buy our premium content because they know we deliver good content all the time,\" he says.\n\nListen to the show to hear more about Ian's networking strategy and the story of\u00a0how we first met.\n\nWhat is content curation?\n\nIan believes that content curation is about\u00a0finding relevant content and sharing it\u00a0in a meaningful way. For example, if you do a weekly roundup post, don't just list article titles and links, instead add the reason why\u00a0each post\u00a0is interesting.\n\nCurated content\u00a0can be your own articles, as well as posts\u00a0from others. When Ian compiles\u00a0his email newsletter, he'll\u00a0put\u00a0in his\u00a0latest posts, but he also picks out some of his popular older articles,\u00a0and\u00a0points out why he thinks they would be valuable for his readers.\n\nListen to the show to discover how Ian curates his own content.\u00a0\n\nWhy marketers should care about curating content\n\nIan explains how content curation builds up a marketer's authority. If your audience trusts you because you consistently share good\u00a0content, when you share your own material, they're more likely to engage.\n\nOn the flip side, if you share consistently bad or irrelevant\u00a0content from other sources, people won't be as interested when you share your own articles.\n\nListen to the show to find out how Social Media Examiner curates other people's content.\n\nIan's content sharing strategy\n\nWhen Ian shares other people's content on Facebook and other social media platforms, he puts\u00a0a line before the article link explaining what the article's about and why it's interesting.\n\nIan also explains how he curates content for\u00a0posts on his blog. For example, he\u00a0recently\u00a0did an article on podcast tools. He reached out to podcasters, and asked for their three favorite podcast tools. He compiled the response and\u00a0wrote a summary.\n\nThis type of post is both valuable and shareable. The influential people in the article share the post.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Jon Loomer, a Facebook marketing expert who specializes in Facebook advertising. His blog, JonLoomer.com, was the top pick in our 2014 top 10 social media blogs.\n\nJon explores the benefits of Facebook advertising.\n\nYou'll discover new tools for publishers on Facebook, information about conversion tracking, custom reporting options and more.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher. How to subscribe/review on iPhone.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nAdvanced Facebook Ad Techniques\nNew Facebook tools for content publishers\n\nBefore going into detail about the four new features aimed at\u00a0content publishers, Jon explains the difference between an organic post and a Facebook ad.\n\nAn organic post is something you share with your fans that's free and will also show up in the news feed. If you want to promote a post or create a separate promotion, that's an ad.\n\nThe first new feature is the ability to target organic posts by interest to your fans. Targeting interests was previously something you could only do with ads.\n\nJon shares\u00a0why a marketer might want to try targeting fans. Facebook's algorithm only shows content to people who are likely to engage. After these fans engage, Facebook will show it to more people. So, if you target a post to people you know are highly likely to engage, you'll get the benefit of more Facebook visibility.\n\nNote: You can target by demographics, as well as to fans of other\u00a0pages and fans in specific categories.\n\n\n\nThe next change, which has been rolled out to a small number of big media companies, is smart publishing. This is auto-publishing, based on user engagement. Facebook looks at the most popular links people share on Facebook, and will share them with your fans. It won't post on your fan page, it'll just appear in your fans' news feed.\n\nThird is post end date. If you share something that's going to expire, you can put a post end date. It will disappear from your page and the news feed when that promotion is over.\n\nYou'll hear about the final update, which is improvements to domain insights.\n\nListen to the show to hear Jon's take on dark data, as well as how to generate and use UTM codes to better track link engagement and conversions.\n\nHow Facebook tracks conversions\n\nBy default, Jon explains, Facebook records a conversion when somebody has clicked your ad and converted within 28 days or viewed your ad without clicking and converted within 1 day. However, if you use your custom reports, you can adjust that window. You can get rid of view-through, or you can set view-through and click-through conversions for 1 day, 7 days or 28 days.\n\n\n\nWhen you have that conversion pixel on your site, Facebook knows three\u00a0things: whether someone viewed your ad, clicked your ad or if they ever fired that conversion pixel. Facebook\u00a0uses these metrics\u00a0to determine whether your ad resulted in a conversion.\n\nTo get to custom reports, go into your Ads Manager and click on Reports. Then click on the Customized Columns button, and then in the bottom right-hand corner of the window, the Attribution Window pops up. This is what you change to include any or all six reporting options.\n\nListen to the show to discover what happens to your view-through and click-through conversions when you target the right way. \n\nWhy bloggers should consider using Facebook ads\n\nJon says that there's nothing more important than traffi...", "duration": "49:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-129-15-01-23.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1421492403, "title": "The Social Media Examiner Show: This Week in Social Media", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Welcome to our weekly edition of what's hot in social media news.\n\nTo help you stay up to date with social media, here are some of the news items that caught our attention.\nWhat's New This Week?\nWe've got exciting news this week!\n\nThe Social Media Examiner Show: Subscribe now (for free) and discover quick tips for marketing your business in our 10-minute daily podcast.\n\nConsume snack-sized social media content each day.

Facebook lost 3% of its social login market share while Google gained 6% in 2014, going from 34% in Q3 to 40% in Q4.\n\nREPORT: Messenger Cuts Into Facebook App's Reach:\u00a0According to November 2014 data from comScore, the Facebook Messenger app is boosting its share of overall reach among U.S. users, at the expense of the social network's flagship app. Messenger rose to fifth place in rankings of reach among smartphone apps at 43.1%. The main Facebook app still overwhelmingly topped the list at 69%. Facebook-owned photo- and video-sharing network, Instagram, took ninth-place position on the list at 30.7%.\n\nSocial Media Update 2014: A September 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center finds that Facebook has the highest concentration of users, capturing 71% of American adult Internet users and 58% of the entire adult population. However, its overall growth has slowed, while other sites continue to see increases in users. The study also broke down key demographic trends and frequency of use for each of the five major social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn.\n\nData Driven and Digitally Savvy: The Rise of the New Marketing Organization: Forbes Insights and advertising technology company, Turn, surveyed 331 senior executives from a range of industries.

Two tactics\u2014books and podcasts\u2014are the factors that made the difference. He noticed the audio version of his book Epic Content Marketing really took off, so he figured there must be something to audio.\n\nJoe shares how his and Robert Rose's podcast evolved. Joe recalls how once after their weekly phone call about what was going on in content marketing, he said, \"We should have recorded that.\" Robert asked, \"Why don't we?\" They launched This Old Marketing the following\u00a0week.\n\n\n\nJay started podcasting in January 2012, and just finished the third season of his Social Pros podcast, which totals about 150 episodes.\n\nJay explains that Tristin Handy, who was director of marketing at Argyle Social at the time, said, \"Did you ever think about doing a podcast? We should do a podcast.\" And Jay thought, \"No and okay.\" They got together and decided to create a show that paid attention to the unsung heroes of social media. Jay says it's grown far beyond the expectations he had for it at the beginning.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to discover which podcasts I listened to when I started the Social Media Marketing podcast.\n\nHow podcasting helps their businesses\n\nWhen Joe looked\u00a0at the behaviors of those\u00a0who attend\u00a0Content Marketing World, he realized his core\u00a0customers\u00a0engage in at least three\u00a0different content vehicles, such as the newsletter, magazine and/or\u00a0webinars. It's the third thing that's the tipping point, so he figured\u00a0the\u00a0audio content could be what\u00a0gets people to the event.\n\nJay says\u00a0the Social Pros podcast allows them to spotlight their\u00a0corporate clients, as well as interview potential future clients. Podcasting has become a strong lead-generation business strategy. It's also helped Jay\u00a0from a personal branding and awareness perspective, because it positions him (and his company) as a leader in the field.\n\nListen to the show to hear how podcasting builds customer loyalty.\n\nTheir\u00a0new\u00a0ventures\n\nJoe's\u00a0releasing\u00a0a new book called Content Inc., which\u00a0will be out in time for Content Marketing World in September.

From there he freelanced as a producer for programs, such as the Today Show and Weekend Today. After the first dot-com boom, Andrew followed the path of some of his friends into the marketing world.\n\n\n\nWhile working\u00a0at startups, Andrew\u00a0realized that if you created great content, like television producers did, you actually would inspire people to buy stuff. He figured if\u00a0he\u00a0could apply those principles in the marketing world, he\u00a0could really be successful.\n\nHe then\u00a0partnered with James Cosco, a journalist, who also went to BU. They\u00a0started an agency called Tippingpoint Labs,\u00a0and grew it until\u00a02012, when Andrew sold his share in the business\u00a0and wrote Brandscaping.\u00a0Andrew\u00a0has since\u00a0been traveling the world, speaking\u00a0and\u00a0helping\u00a0people\u00a0find the right kinds of partnerships and\u00a0rethink marketing.\n\nListen to the show to hear about Andrew's background as a producer, and how the skills he developed prepared him for work in marketing.\n\nThe meaning of brandscaping\n\nAndrew says that brandscaping is leveraging the audiences of others for the benefit of both partners.\n\nIn the digital age everybody has an audience, whether it's on social media or through email. If you partner with other brands and create valuable content that they would want to proactively send to their audience, then there is no need to buy access to the media.\n\nListen to the show to find out\u00a0how our podcast is a brandscape.\u00a0\n\nThe benefits of partnering\n\nAndrew explains that there are three simple benefits to\u00a0partnering: it's better, faster and cheaper.\n\n\tIt's better. As marketers, we can create better content if we're willing to partner with others who know the audience perhaps even better than we do.\n\tIt's faster.\u00a0Most content marketing is a slow-grow strategy. But brands that partner with other brands see much more rapid success with the content they create.\n\tIt's cheaper. It's much less expensive to share with other audiences than it is to advertise.\n\n\n\nIf you're nervous about partnering with a brand, Andrew suggests you find a person who is a known talent and who\u00a0already has access to your audience.\n\nListen to the show to discover\u00a0how to\u00a0partner with talent.\n\nExamples of content collaborations\n\nAndrew shares examples\u00a0of some great\u00a0marketing partnerships.\n\nWhen Converse (the athletic shoe company) was trying to rebuild their brand, their CMO Geoff Cottrill realized they got the most traction when celebrities wore their shoes and they ended up in a magazine. Since it was too expensive to buy access to celebs, Geoff figured they\u00a0should\u00a0look for the next big thing. So he partnered with Guitar Center, because they have access to wanna-be musicians.\n\nThey built a studio in Brooklyn,", "duration": "46:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-127-15-01-09.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1420196431, "title": "Pinterest Traffic: How to Use Pinterest for More Exposure", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want to drive more traffic to your site with Pinterest?\n\nAre you looking for ways to improve your Pinterest exposure?\n\nTo explore how Pinterest can help your business I interview Pinterest expert, Vincent Ng.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Vincent Ng, host of the Pictures to Profits podcast and author of Pinterest Marketing: How to Search Optimize Your Pins and Boards for Pinterest. He's a Pinterest expert and blogs at MCNG Marketing.\n\nVincent shares how to use Pinterest to drive more traffic to your website.\n\nYou'll discover reasons why you should use Pinterest in your social media marketing, tips on images and plugins that can boost traffic to your site and provide social proof for your company and what you need to know about Pinterest's smart feed and promoted pins.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nPinterest Traffic\nHow Vincent got started with Pinterest\n\nWhile Vincent has successfully used Twitter and Facebook for his social media clients, he found neither site could drive much traffic to his blog.\n\nCurious about Pinterest's rapid early growth, he explored the site and discovered a fair amount of traffic going to his blog from it. That is when he decided it was the site he needed to be on.\n\n\n\nVincent has been on Pinterest since its beta stage four years ago and has witnessed how much the platform has changed and evolved since the beginning.\n\nListen to the show to discover the major changes and trends Vincent has witnessed on Pinterest.\n\nReasons to consider Pinterest for your marketing\n\nPeople are naturally drawn to attractive, magazine-quality images. Information can be processed very quickly when it's seen as an image or picture. Pinterest makes it possible to leverage beautiful, shareable images to drive more traffic to your site.\n\n\n\nYou'll hear Vincent describe how to lay out your images to get the most impact and reach from Pinterest.\n\nPinterest is also a powerful way for users to discover things they might not have expected to find. It's become a visual search engine for products and can link items together based on how they've been previously pinned or searched.\n\n\n\nVincent shares how many people bypass Google and go directly to Pinterest to search for products and lifestyle topics because the content is curated by actual users and the results tend to be high quality.\n\nListen to the show to find out how Pinterest's visual recognition engine links related products to be searched and discovered.\n\nThe biggest mistakes people make on Pinterest\n\nThe biggest mistake businesses make on Pinterest is neglecting to redirect the source of a pin back to their site. The source is the URL where you want users to be directed when they click on your pin.\n\n\n\nYou could potentially get hundreds of pins and repins on your image, but you lose the opportunity to grow your blog with Pinterest if you don't link directly to your site as the source of the pin.\n\nListen to the show to learn how to edit your image to redirect where you would like your pins to point users.\n\nThe Pinterest smart feed and what marketers need to know about it\n\nThe Pinterest smart feed is a new algorithm based on the quality of the pin, the quality of the pin's source (blog or website) and relevance of pins. Each factor is measured based on the number of users who link to the specific pin or the source.\n\nHigh-quality images and the most popular sources are given preferential treatment on Pinterest's feed.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nYou'll discover the importance of failure in\u00a0your work and your life, reasons you should embrace failure, and how the lessons and discoveries you make can help you succeed.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nEmbracing Failure\nWhy a show on failure?\n\nAs C.S. Lewis said, \"Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.\" As we fail, we are pointed in a direction. We learn a lot from failures\u00a0because they\u00a0can\u00a0help us get better.\n\n\n\nWe focus\u00a0so much\u00a0on success stories and what works that we often overlook the unmentioned road of failure, challenges, errors and mistakes\u00a0that inevitably led\u00a0to every single one of those success stories.\n\nIn 2014, I had a really big failure. In fact, it was my biggest failure ever.\u00a0Many people don't know about it and this show is the first time I've spoken about it publicly. I would like to\u00a0share\u00a0what went wrong, the lessons I learned and the importance of failure to your\u00a0business, marketing and life.\n\nListen to the show to hear\u00a0why failure is so important to your business and life.\n\nThe importance of failure and reasons to embrace it\n\nHenry Ford offers this great quote: \"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.\" The path that we go down is meant to have challenges and mistakes. It's what strengthens us and makes us better.\n\nHere\u00a0are\u00a0three\u00a0reasons you should embrace failure:\n\n1. It's part of the entrepreneur's journey.\u00a0Whether or not you consider yourself an\u00a0entrepreneur or\u00a0business owner, this lesson applies to everyone. Nearly every definition of \"entrepreneur\" focuses on\u00a0the word risk. Risk is\u00a0at the core of all business breakthroughs and success.\n\n\n\nWith\u00a0risk comes failure. It's\u00a0inevitable and it's okay.\n\n2. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. If you're not willing to float a new idea for\u00a0your company, experiment with your marketing or\u00a0launch a new venture, the opportunity\u00a0that sits in front of that idea will never manifest. It will never come true. You'll never really grow.\n\nSocial Media Examiner is my third major business venture in the last 18 years.\u00a0It followed\u00a0a design agency and a\u00a0white paper writing consultancy, both of which were very successful and have since\u00a0shut down.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, I started the\u00a0media company which you now know as Social Media Examiner.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, I tried and failed at a lot of things.\u00a0You'll hear four examples of my terrible failures, and why\u00a0I didn't let these failures stop me\u00a0or get me down.\n\n3.\u00a0New discoveries are born in the ashes of failure. The\u00a0most important reason to\u00a0embrace failure is that it makes way for\u00a0new opportunities to grow into awesome things. There's no better time than right after\u00a0you crash and burn to reflect on what you've done wrong and really learn from it.\n\nI love this quote from\u00a0Zig Ziglar: \"It's not how far you fall, but how high you bounce that counts.\" You have to try, experiment, fail and do it over and over again.\n\nIn summary, failure is a necessary part of the process of making new discoveries.\n\nListen to the show to discover\u00a0how\u00a0two of America's most famous businessmen never gave up on their discoveries\u00a0and why\u00a0their\u00a0persistence\u00a0paid off.\n\nMy story\n\nIn July 2013, I launched My Kids' Adventures,", "duration": "39:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-125-14-12-26.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1418986836, "title": "Content Marketing: How Businesses Can Grow With Content", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have a content marketing strategy for your business?\n\nWould you like to discover how to create and distribute content that will drive sales for your company?\n\nTo learn how to grow your business with content marketing, native advertising and more, I interview Robert Rose.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

It's about\u00a0providing content-driven experiences that are educational, entertaining or useful to your audience, but ultimately drive engagement, awareness\u00a0and sales for your brand.\n\nSocial media gives you the power to aggregate your own audiences and be your own media company. The tools needed\u00a0to\u00a0publish\u00a0the type of content that establishes you as a thought leader in your industry\u00a0and\u00a0draws customers to your brand are readily available and easy to use.\n\nListen to the show to discover how content marketing can go\u00a0beyond\u00a0written articles and encompass things like videos, app development, games and more.\n\nExamples of businesses that do content marketing well\n\nYou'll hear Robert explore how big\u00a0companies like\u00a0Chipotle Mexican Grill, LEGO and Coca-Cola leverage\u00a0content marketing in\u00a0creative and innovative ways\u00a0such as\u00a0movies, TV series and magazines.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBhTiyQU1kA\n\nCompared to what large companies might spend on traditional mass media or big sponsorships, their\u00a0content marketing expenditures are just a drop in the bucket, according to Robert\u2014yet it has such a big impact from a\u00a0branding\u00a0standpoint.\n\nEven if your small business doesn't\u00a0have the budget for national TV spots and large print campaigns, you\u00a0can get a lot of bang for your\u00a0buck through content marketing. It's\u00a0easy and inexpensive to publish, distribute and promote your own content through\u00a0blogging, social media and podcasting.\n\nRobert uses\u00a0Marcus Sheridan's business blog to illustrate this point. He used his site\u00a0to answer every\u00a0question asked\u00a0about pools and became an\u00a0expert in the very small niche\u00a0he was already passionate about.

Visuals are a snackable way to express ideas.\n\nVisuals are a huge part of social media and they\u00a0continue\u00a0to evolve. People are so busy today. Images\u00a0catch their attention\u00a0and\u00a0are quicker and easier to\u00a0process than text as they scroll through a social media feed.\n\n\n\nBeyond leveraging social media platforms typically known to be visual\u00a0(Pinterest and Instagram), Kim also looks for ways to implement visuals and eye-popping graphics in her Twitter content strategy and on her blog.\n\nListen to the show to discover more\u00a0ways\u00a0to\u00a0leverage visual content in your\u00a0social media marketing.\u00a0\n\nThe importance of visuals\u00a0for social media marketing\u00a0\n\nFrom a social media marketing standpoint, the old saying that \"a picture's worth a thousand words\" holds so much value today. As marketers, we\u00a0all need to be or become\u00a0storytellers. A great photo or graphic tells a story in one hot second.\n\n\n\nWe\u00a0live in such an information-overloaded space right now and attention spans are so short. Text-based marketing alone has become less and less effective.\n\nThe brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text.\u00a0A\u00a0good image can connect an idea or message\u00a0much quicker\u00a0and stronger than text-only content.\n\nListen to the show to find out\u00a0other amazing stats for the effectiveness of\u00a0visual content on\u00a0what your audience\u00a0will\u00a0process, learn and retain.\u00a0\n\nDifferent types of visuals you can create\u00a0\n\nThere are\u00a0five primary types of\u00a0visual content you can create for social media:\u00a0videos, photos, creative images, infographics and slide shows. Kim explains that comics, memes and infographics tend to be\u00a0hugely\u00a0popular on social media.\n\nComics and memes are a way to showcase humor.\u00a0They're fun and relatable, so people are eager to\u00a0share them with their\u00a0friends and family.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kim, businesses that use infographics probably have a 12% higher growth rate than companies that don't. Infographics offer a visual way to share a lot of interesting content in one image.\u00a0People love them too.\n\nThe most popular place to get more bang from your infographics is on Pinterest. People share them there like mad. Another great place to leverage infographics is on blogs.\n\nAn infographic doesn't necessarily have to be complex to be appealing\u00a0and effective. For example, if you have a blog post that's about 10 ways to do something, then you could repurpose your blog content\u00a0and very easily make an infographic on those 10 ways.", "duration": "43:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-123-14-12-12.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1417777247, "title": "Content Sharing: How to Build a Following Using Other People\u2019s Content", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have a content sharing strategy for your business?\n\nAre you interested in discovering ways to leverage great content to promote your business and drive sales?\n\nTo learn\u00a0how to build a following by sharing other people's content, I interview\u00a0Guy Kawasaki.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

His newest book is called The Art of Social Media: Power Tips for Power Users.\n\nGuy explores how to build your\u00a0social media following by sharing other people's content.\n\nYou'll discover how to create\u00a0a consistent brand image\u00a0for your company, develop a strategy\u00a0for\u00a0consistently sharing\u00a0great content with\u00a0your audience and\u00a0leverage that content to promote your products or services.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nContent Sharing\nHow Guy got started in social media\u00a0\n\nDepending on how you define social media, Guy was there at the very beginning with CompuServe forums. He says he was late to blogging, starting four or five years after it really took off,\u00a0but gradually adopted social media much quicker over the years.\n\nGuy joined Twitter six or seven months after it started, but was on Google+ six days after it launched.\n\n\n\nToday, Guy considers social media as God's gift, especially for entrepreneurs, because it's fast, free and ubiquitous. It's a great equalizer and makes it possible to potentially reach millions of people with just one tweet, image or post.\n\nListen to the show to discover why Guy says we're in the renaissance\u00a0of\u00a0marketing.\u00a0\nHave a consistent image and mantra across all of your social networks\n\n\n\n\nIn Guy's new book he talks a lot about the importance of having a consistent brand image across all of your social media channels.\n\nGuy advises against\u00a0adopting a different persona for each social media platform. It's much too difficult to manage and will make people question who you really are.\n\nYou'll hear Guy explore the importance of having a\u00a0mantra for your business and provides some great examples.\n\nYour mantra explains who you are and why your product, service or business exists in two or three simple words. It should go in the Bio or About Me sections of all of your social media profiles.\n\nListen to the show to learn how your mantra is radically different\u00a0than your company mission\u00a0statement\u00a0or\u00a0slogan.\n\nThe importance of the Incognito Window\u00a0\n\nGuy explains that the Incognito Window is a feature found on all browsers, which allows\u00a0you to browse your pages and your social profiles anonymously.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nIn this episode I interview Sue B. Zimmerman, known as the Instagram Gal. She co-authored the ebook, Instagram Basics for Your Business and taught Instagram Marketing for Small Businesses on CreativeLive. Sue helps businesses leverage the power of Instagram.\n\nSue explores what you need to know to improve your marketing and grow a community on Instagram.\n\nYou'll discover what marketers should know about Instagram, including the best photos to capture and the importance of comments, hashtags and direct messages.\n\n\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nImprove Your Instagram Marketing\nWhat marketers should know about Instagram  \n\nVideo is very much underused on Instagram and yet there are some very cool things marketers can do with it. A few months ago, Instagram bought Hyperlapse, an app that allows you to create time-lapse videos and share them on Instagram.\n\n\n\nHyperlapse is simple and fun to use. It speeds up the frames 3, 6 or 12 times and gives the feeling of moving really quickly through physical space, which is interesting and different to see in your Instagram feed.\n\n\n\nThe advantage of Hyperlapse is it can absolutely get someone to stop in their Instagram tracks while they scroll through their feed. It also makes it possible for you to compress a longer video into the allotted 15 seconds for video on Instagram.\n\nListen to the show to discover a new trick with hashtags you can use to get your posts to the top of Instagram's hashtag curation. \n\nPromote conferences and events with Instagram\n\nInstagram is the best way to connect with and grow your community at events and conferences. Just like you would with a Twitter hashtag, you can follow an Instagram hashtag before, during and after an event and find people who share a common passion or interest with you.\n\n\n\nWhen you promote events on Instagram, the visual content can be accessed at any time. It's available forever and can easily be found with the hashtag.\n\nEven if you miss a chance to meet someone in person at an event, you can still reach out to him or her on Instagram afterwards. If you're authentic when you reach out, they will likely respond and follow you back. This is one of the best ways to grow a community on Instagram.\n\nListen to the show to learn the best photos to capture with Instagram at events and conferences. \n\nCreate a community on Instagram\n\nSue suggests you always have a call to action in your posts. You can ask a question or offer valuable content that starts a conversation. The goal is to drive engagement on Instagram through meaningful comments and conversations, not just with a double-tap heart.\n\n\n\nCommunity is built by each post you curate because it's a chance to connect with other people through their comments and questions. Sue advises to never leave questions unanswered and always thank and acknowledge people who leave comments.\n\nThe more engagement you drive on Instagram through your comments and posts, the more others will do the same for you or want to be part of the conversation too. The key is being as diligent on Instagram as you are on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to the show to learn where to focus your time and attention when you manage your business's Instagram account. \n\nHow marketers can use Instagram hashtags\n\nBefore you come up with hashtags for your brand or business,", "duration": "40:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-121-14-11-28.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1416567640, "title": "Becoming Recommended: How to Build a Business Others Love Recommending", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you rely on word of mouth to promote your business?\n\nAre you wondering how to get more people to recommend your product or service?\n\nTo learn how to build a business that's highly recommended, I interview Paul Rand.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

He's also the chief digital officer at Ketchum and former president of the Word of Mouth Marketing Association.

What an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation!\n\n\n\nPaul discovered that Stew Leonard's does a great job connecting with people\u00a0and that they built sociability into their business from the very beginning. He felt like he was truly part of a special experience when he was in the store.\n\nThere are some fairly consistent things, particularly in the age of social media, that companies should do to take advantage of this level of brand affinity.

Word-of-mouth recommendations have always been the Holy Grail for marketers. Social media basically puts that power on steroids.\n\nNow when someone says something positive about your brand, that endorsement has the potential for reaching millions of people.\n\n\n\nPaul describes two types of recommendations: implied or explicit. An explicit recommendation is told directly in person, through a post or from an online review that\u00a0something is great. An implied recommendation can be as subtle as liking a Facebook page\u00a0or sharing a post, yet it can be just as powerful and influential, depending on the source.\n\nListen to the show to find out how recommendations, even from complete strangers, can drive people to your product or brand.\u00a0\n\nWhat drives recommendations\n\nThere are many reasons people are eager to accept and offer recommendations. Very simply, we humans take our cues from other humans. If someone tells us a product, brand or service is good and we notice them benefiting from it, we assume it will benefit us as well. However, it's all a matter of influence.\n\n\n\nMost people have a certain degree of knowledge or passion for a specific topic or interest and tend to make recommendations around it.

He helps brands figure out why humans do what they do. His particular area of interest is to capture the opinions and study the behavior of people out of their homes and on the go.\n\nFor Tom, understanding mobile\u00a0marketing\u00a0goes beyond the technology. It's about being able to understand people's needs, wants, and desires while they are in transition, out and about, and away from home.\n\nThis idea was the impetus behind his new book, The Mobile Commerce Revolution: Business Success in a Wireless World\n\nListen to the show to learn how it's been possible for Tom's company, Edison Research, to study mobile behavior for decades.\u00a0\n\nWhat is the mobile commerce revolution\n\nEvery year, experts in various trades are asked if this is going to be the year of mobile when, in fact, the year of mobile has already happened. According to Tom, the mobile commerce revolution is already upon us.\n\nYou'll hear Tom describe the Starbucks mobile app as an example of how much consumer behavior has already been shaped by mobile.\n\n\n\nThere's no special technology to the Starbucks mobile app. It's nothing more than a bar code on your phone that's tied to a method of payment. Yet it's eliminated the need for a wallet and made it simpler to purchase items using something Starbucks customers already have in hand: their smartphones.\n\nThe use of this smartphone app has become such\u00a0default behavior that it\u2019s prompted customers to make a purchase at Starbucks when they otherwise might not have.\n\nIf you base your mobile strategy on the technology, then you will not make it.\u00a0Mobile isn't about technology. It's about being able to understand and enable human behavior.\n\nListen to the show to hear what companies with successful mobile strategies are doing that others aren't.\n\nHow marketers should respond to the mobile explosion\u00a0\n\nIt's easy to be lulled into thinking that big data and clickstream analytics will give you everything you need to know to develop your mobile strategy. However, the first step when you develop a successful mobile strategy is to examine\u00a0human behavior.\n\n\n\nTom describes the mobile web as having three distinct eras. We've moved past the first two eras of optimizing for mobile and responsive design. We are now moving towards a new era of contextually relevant experiences based on a customer's unique needs and wants in the context of their specific location.

Mark immersed himself in Twitter 7 years ago, when he started his own consulting business\u00a0and started to teach.\n\n\n\nMark admits that he was not an early fan of Twitter. It took him months to figure out that this platform was more than just the advertising, technology, mentions or hashtags.\u00a0Once he understood the powerful human aspect behind Twitter, it changed his life and he wanted others to understand it too.\n\nMark calls Twitter the greatest networking tool ever created. Many of the connections he's made around the world would not have been possible without Twitter and his blog.\n\nListen to the show to discover more about Twitter's powerful ability to connect you with potential clients and\u00a0opportunities.\u00a0\n\nThe three elements of the Tao of Twitter\n\n\n\nMark identifies tao as the Chinese word meaning path. He explains that there is a certain path to success.\n\nBehind every Twitter success story, perhaps behind every social media success story, there are 3 essential elements to this path: meaningful content, a targeted audience, and authentic helpfulness.\n\nYou'll hear Mark discuss each of these three elements in detail and how they work to create meaningful connections\u00a0for your business when you use Twitter.\n\nAccording to Mark, there is no better way across any social media platform to create an audience than Twitter. It offers so many ways to find the right people for your business.\n\nListen to the show to discover how these three elements work together to lead to success on Twitter.\u00a0\n\nHow businesses can use Twitter\u00a0\n\nIn The Tao of Twitter, there is a chapter called \"25 Ideas to Toast Your Competition\". Mark offers a few examples of this in the show.\u00a0He thinks that Twitter is under utilized by businesses today, yet it has the power to transform your business.\n\nFor instance, Twitter search can be the most powerful source of marketing research available to you. It offers users the ability to target an audience down to a specific zip code, sentiment, or keyword.\n\nTwitter's\u00a0Advanced Search allows you to find potential clients, conduct competitive research, track trends, or provide customer service, all in real-time.\n\n\n\nMark explores the benefits of paid promotions and ads on Twitter.\n\nAccording to Mark, this is a great time to try Twitter advertising. The inventory is high and the cost is relatively inexpensive at the moment, but Mark projects that this may not be case for long, as more people learn to leverage this opportunity.\n\nListen to the show to discover a little known trick that makes Twitter\u00a0advertising especially attractive\u00a0to marketers.\u00a0\n\nBroadcast content versus being helpful", "duration": "41:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-118-14-11-07.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1414749604, "title": "Blog Monetization: How You Can Make More Money With Your Blog", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you looking for ways to make money with your professional blog?\n\nDo you want to know how to leverage your content to monetize your site?\n\nTo learn how\u00a0to make more money with your blog, I interview Leslie Samuel.\nMore About This Show\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner.

Once he saw LinkedIn's viability in developing business clients and recruiting candidates, he\u00a0started \"running down that street like there was no tomorrow,\" as he put it.\n\n\n\nMany years later, LinkedIn considers Ron to be one of their top 1.5% of people with a large network, as well as one of their top 15% in terms of using the platform strategically.\n\nListen to the show to find out how Ron went from using LinkedIn to recruit talent to teaching other people how to successfully use LinkedIn.\u00a0\n\nWhy it's important for marketers and business owners to have a well-developed LinkedIn profile\n\nA lot of people approach LinkedIn as just a place for job-seekers and treat their profile just like a resume, which is a flat, two-dimensional experience. LinkedIn is actually a multidimensional tool that allows you to tell your stories. It's called\u00a0transmedia storytelling.\n\nLinkedIn is one of the first professional platforms where you can set up your profile, stage your brand or service and tell a story with other media.\n\n\n\nRon explains that LinkedIn is like a new TV station. With its 300 million users in 200 countries, people are on it 24/7. You'll hear why it's\u00a0more critical than ever to be creative in the way you present your brand.\n\nThe number-one activity on LinkedIn is people checking out your profile before they allow you into their network. So first impressions count.\n\nListen to the show to hear how LinkedIn is\u00a0integrated\u00a0into the powerful networking happening at the Social Media Marketing World conference.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest mistake people make with their LinkedIn profile\n\nThe biggest mistake people make is that they interact with LinkedIn as though it's a resume.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\n\n\nIn this episode, I interview Mari Smith, who is the world's leading Facebook marketing authority.\u00a0She's authored the books, The New Relationship Marketing and Facebook Marketing: An Hour a Day.\u00a0This is her fourth appearance on the show!\n\nMari explores what\u00a0you need to know about marketing with Facebook, and in particular the news feed.\n\nYou'll discover the importance of native links, why micro-video should be key to your Facebook posting strategy and how Atlas will change the way you do online advertising.

You'll hear more about this in the show.\n\nThe next big consideration is\u00a0connecting with your mobile users. With 75% of Facebook users accessing the site from mobile devices, your content must be effective on a mobile feed and able to direct people to a mobile-friendly landing page.\n\nListen to the show to find out why community managers are more important than ever to your Facebook marketing strategy.\u00a0\n\nReview your posting strategy\n\nWith Facebook clearly giving preferential visibility to consumers rather than brands, marketers now have to rethink their posting strategy. Especially with all of the latest updates to the news feed.\n\nMari explains that some of the changes have been around links, and as marketers we are all about the images.\n\nIn the past we have been told that posts with photos get the best visibility in the news feed. Mari explains that marketers have tried all kinds of clever ways to circumvent the news feed ranking algorithm. When you wanted to include a link in your post, you could use an image and include the link in the description.\n\nNow what Facebook calls native link posts give you a bigger image preview on your posts. You type or paste a link into your publisher on your page or profile, and it automatically generates a preview with a large image.\n\n\n\nYou'll hear the huge advantages of this type of post, and why you need to consider it for your posting strategy.\n\nListen to the show to find out why Mari recommends you change up your posting strategy to integrate more links.\n\nHow Facebook's Save feature works and its advantages\n\n\nAt the end of July 2014, Facebook introduced a new Save feature,\u00a0which lets you to save items found on Facebook to check out later when you have more time.\n\n\n\nAvailable on both mobile and desktop, the Save feature was initially only meant for native link posts, but Facebook quietly upgraded it to allow any post with a link, video, photo or status update to be saved. Even if a post has multiple links in it, you can save all of the links at once with this tool.\n\nMari recommends that you remind your fans from time to time of how to save and retrieve their saved items.

First of all, it was a great experiment. I didn't even know if someone like me, who knew absolutely nothing about social media, could even start a blog and become a leader in this space. I actually call Social Media Examiner an online magazine.\n\n\n\nIn 2008/2009, when I was exploring this idea, I did notice that not a lot of people were talking about the \"how\" of social media. It was more about \"What's wrong with social media?\" or \"Why should I consider social media?\" It was the \"how\" stuff that was really popular.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was that the articles detailing the how-to stuff were going crazy-viral on social.\n\nYou'll hear two examples of articles that I wrote for Copyblogger and Marketing Profs. Those articles turned out to be two of the most popular articles written on those sites.\n\n\n\nIt was the response to those two articles that drove me to start Social Media Examiner almost 5 years ago to the day. Little did I know then that a million+ people a month would consume our content today. It's hard to believe that it's been 5 years.\n\nListen to the show to find out the type of approach I took when it came to writing the articles for Copyblogger and Marketing Profs.\n\nWhere the idea for Social Media Examiner came from\n\nIt all started when I contacted Ann Handley, chief content officer at Marketing Profs, to ask if she wanted to connect on LinkedIn. Her response was, \"Are you on Facebook?\" At that time I thought Facebook was just for college students. This was probably in 2008 or early 2009.\n\nSo I opened a Facebook account, and started to notice that there was a whole new community of people, not just students, who were having a great time on there. This opened my eyes to what could possibly happen. It was where it all started, I guess.\n\nEvery idea has a genesis point, if you will, and that genesis moment was when Ann said, \"How about Facebook?\"\n\nListen to the show to discover how the name Social Media Examiner came about.\n\nThe business strategy behind growing Social Media Examiner\n\nBefore the launch of Social Media Examiner, I put together an online event under my White Paper Source brand. I called the event Social Media Success Summit. This was to see if a segment of my White Paper Source audience would be interested in social. This month is actually our 6th annual Social Media Success Summit.\n\n\n\nThe success of this first summit made me decide to run the idea of Social Media Examiner by several of the presenters.\n\nThe first summit included Mari Smith,\u00a0Denise Wakeman and\u00a0Chris Garrett, who all helped me put on this online conference.\n\nThe idea behind Social Media Examiner was for me to write one article a week. Then I would recruit the others mentioned above to write one article a week. So the plan was to have a spread and hopefully be able to publish on the site three times a week.\n\nThis group originally did not think it was a good idea.", "duration": "47:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-114-14-10-10.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1412330421, "title": "YouTube Growth: How to Grow Your YouTube Channel", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you post videos on YouTube?\n\nAre you looking for ways to increase your traffic and subscribers?\n\nTo explore how to grow your YouTube audience, I interview Steve Dotto for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Steve Dotto, who produces Dotto Tech, a YouTube show\u00a0designed to help you \"discover your inner geek,\" by focusing on productivity, apps and more.

According to Steve, toward the end of the run, the Internet was becoming more relevant and the show was becoming less relevant. So about four years ago, he pulled the plug on the TV show and then took some time to figure out his next step.\n\nHe started to teach, dabbled on YouTube and did a radio show. Then at a conference two years ago in Victoria, he met Mari Smith, who introduced him to the world of Internet marketing and showed him how to build a community.\n\n\n\nSteve took her advice and added his own approach. About a\u00a0year ago, he really started focusing on YouTube.\n\nListen to the show to hear how last year's YouTube/Google+ changes were key for community development.\n\nSteve's show format\n\nSteve's how-to series shows his viewers how to use tech tools\u2014from Google functions to iPhone apps\u2014more effectively. Steve says if you watch an episode and say, \"I didn't know I could do that,\" \"I'd like to do that\" or \"I should be doing that,\" then he's done his job.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePVkSfKeEfI\n\nMost of Steve's videos are between 5 and 12 minutes long, which is a little long by conventional YouTube wisdom. His goal is to take on a topic and teach his viewers something they probably didn't know.\u00a0Bottom line, he explains, is edutainment value.\n\nListen to the show to hear an example of something Steve teaches during an episode.\n\nWhy you should start a YouTube show\n\nSteve feels that for many different topics it's easier to convey a concept with inflection through video than on other platforms.\n\nIt's also a relaxing environment to browse through and discover information.\u00a0Steve says most people will binge-watch YouTube. They'll watch several videos in a row on the same topic to learn something.\n\nA video is easier to follow than a blog, it's more engaging than a podcast and you can bring all of the media types together, Steve believes.\n\nListen to the show to discover how Steve feels about writing.\n\nWhat tech Steve uses for his show and why\n\nSteve sets his broadcasts up as screencasts, but uses an app so viewers can also see his face as he explains the tech.\n\nThe why: Content creates a connection between the presenter and viewer. Whether it's a blog, podcast or YouTube video, there is an intimate relationship between you, the speaker, and the audience. With the vastness of the Internet, Steve believes we often lose that personal engagement that happens when someone consumes our content.

Almost immediately, he started his first blog.\n\nDarren explains that he had no background in technology or writing, just a fascination with community and communication.\n\nHe developed an audience for his personal blog over the next year and a half, writing about a variety of niche topics (photography, spirituality, movies, politics). When his audience \"complained\" that there was too much variety, Darren split the topics up into different blogs.\n\nFrom there, Darren began to experiment with making money from blogging. It evolved from a hobby into a part-time job, then grew into a full-time business.\n\nListen to the show to hear how many blogs Darren launched over the years.\n\nWhy it's never too late to start blogging\n\nWhen Darren first started blogging, he looked at the big bloggers and thought he was too late to start. At that point, the big names had only been blogging for a year or two. However, Darren says new bloggers are breaking through all the time.\n\nMore blogs mean greater opportunities to network and the ability to grow faster, especially if you can get on the radar of an influencer in your niche.\n\n\n\nWhile there may be a ton of bloggers out there, Darren explains that there's nobody who has your exact set of experiences, opinions, stories, skills and perspectives, and that's what sets you apart. If you can harness your uniqueness, there's certainly a way to get noticed.\n\nListen to the show to hear how blogging in your niche will serve you well now and in the future.\n\nDigital Photography School, then and now\n\nDarren started Digital Photography School in 2006. It evolved from one of his previous blogs\u2014a digital camera review blog. It was quite profitable, Darren explains, but not particularly satisfying. He wanted a blog about photography that he enjoyed writing\u2014where he could build a relationship with his readers and answer common photography questions.\n\n\n\nWhen the site launched, Darren wrote all of the blog content himself (two to three posts per week), focusing on evergreen content and throwing shareable content into the mix. It was on a free theme, boot strapped, and gradually began to rank in Google and develop a following. He monetized using AdSense and Amazon affiliate marketing.\n\nA photography enthusiast, Darren says he's the guy in your circle of friends who people ask to photograph parties because they can't afford a real photographer. He's also the one everyone comes to before they buy a camera.\n\nHe started the site writing beginner-level content. As the site developed, he hired professional photographers to write for the more advanced audience.\n\n\n\nNow,", "duration": "41:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-112-14-09-26.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1411120820, "title": "Webinars: Growing Leads and Sales With Live Online Events", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use webinars in your marketing?\n\nAre you looking for new ways to generate sales and leads?\n\nTo\u00a0explore the art of using webinars to generate leads and ultimately sell, I interview Lewis Howes for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Lewis Howes, author of\u00a0The Ultimate Webinar Marketing Guide and host of the School of Greatness Podcast, where he focuses on leadership and personal development.

Companies of all sizes, as well as entrepreneurs, use them because they generate more sales than any other online marketing strategy.\n\nSocial media helps you get your information out there, connect with your audience, get feedback, build relationships and more. However, tweets and Facebook posts don't usually result in a huge number of instant sales.\n\nA webinar, however, gets you in front of a captive audience that's interested in learning what you have to share for an extended period of time. It's more than just a quick message, post, article, picture or video. It's an interactive way to connect, build trust and make sales sooner rather than later.\n\nMost webinars are free. Then at the end, you can refer them to your solution, product, coaching or live event. You can convert in a more effective way than by just using social.\n\nListen to the show to discover how webinar tools have changed.\n\nWhat tech you need\n\nLewis recommends GoToWebinar, because he feels it's the most consistent.

For example, on the post-registration thank-you page, put up a video or some text and ask registrants to share it on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nTo make this easier, there are tools you can use such as the WP Sharely plugin or create a pre-populated Tweet button through ClicktoTweet.com.\n\n\n\nAnother way to generate leads is to partner with others.\n\nLewis talks about how he does affiliate webinars where people in a similar marketing space promote his information to their audience. He'll do a webinar with free content, offer his product or service and then give a 50% commission to that affiliate. You're paying someone to generate leads for you.\n\nListen to the show to hear the results of a successful affiliate marketing webinar.\n\nOptimizing the registration process\n\nLewis likes to use LeadPages templates for his webinar registrations.\n\nHe'll create three different registration templates: one with a simple image, a headline and opt-in; another that's more in-depth, including a compelling headline and a list of benefits; and a third that's a hybrid with a video and bullet points.", "duration": "1:00:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-111-14-09-19.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1410516039, "title": "Writing and Social: Why the Written Word Is Your Marketing Advantage", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you write content for your business?\n\nAre you looking to improve the quality of your writing and your storytelling skills?\n\nTo\u00a0explore why the written word matters in social media, I interview Ann Handley for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Ann Handley, the co-author of Content Rules and chief content officer at MarketingProfs\u2014providing training and education to empower both large and small business marketers.

So she wrote it!\n\nAnn wrote her first book, Content Rules, four years ago with C.C. Chapman. That was the beginning of the conversation about content marketing. These days, she explains, being able to write well is a necessity.\n\nEverybody Writes came out of Ann\u2019s love for good writing and her desire to see marketers do a better job with their content.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about Ann's first book,\u00a0Content Rules.\n\nWhy the written word is so important to marketers\n\nAnn explains that since we're all publishers in this age of technology, our words become our ambassadors. Our writing conveys a lot of things about us. It can make us seem warm, fun, competent and trustworthy. But it can also make us seem boring, humdrum and confused.\n\nChoosing the right words to tell our story is really important, especially when you want to connect with your customers.\u00a0In a world where we all have a platform, whether it's a blog or a website, words matter now more than ever.\n\nListen to the show to hear what people said to Ann when she told them she was writing a book on writing.\n\nWhat non-writers need to know about writing\n\nAnn believes we are all writers. If you have a website, work in marketing or post on social media, you're a writer. To learn to craft better content, just develop the necessary writing muscles.\n\n\n\nAnn talks about a story she tells in the book. As a non-athlete, she could never do a pull-up or a push-up. About a year ago, Ann started working with a personal trainer and then four months ago, she did a push-up. It's just like writing. If you want to get better at writing, or at push-ups, you just need practice.\n\nEveryone is capable of becoming a better writer.\n\nListen to the show to learn what keeps people from believing they can write.\n\nHow to develop writing muscles\n\nTo get better at writing, you need to make it a priority.

He ended up getting a job and staying.\n\nAfter four years, he returned to the U.S. and was working in advertising doing campaigns for celebrity perfumes when he realized he'd left a brand he loved\u2014Australia and travel.\n\nFor the next two years, Jesse spent time on SlideShare doing things like You Suck at PowerPoint.\n\n\n\nDuring that time he also put up proposals for people to send him money to attend festivals like SXSW and Cannes Lion in exchange for his notes and photos. Jesse says that gave him a good foundation for how to build community.\n\nWhen he saw a job open up for social media manager at Tourism Australia, he sent his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but he knew he needed to do something more.

His team promotes tourism to the country as a whole and also works with the different states and international offices.\n\nHe says that advocacy and word-of-mouth have always played a role in promoting any industry, especially travel. Tourism Australia had started a Facebook page before he joined the organization; however, it took them three years to hit 1M fans.\n\n\n\nJesse shares that he took a look at what had already been done and made the decision to launch Instagram, Google+ and Twitter as well and he's ramped it up ever since.\n\nListen to the show to hear how Jesse views the return on social media for Tourism Australia.\n\nThe strategy behind Tourism Australia's social media\n\nJesse's social media strategy\u00a0has a couple of components.\n\nHe says the first component is to build something that gets bigger over time. Jesse explains that in traditional advertising, the work tends to focus on big campaigns that you work on for 6 months, then launch. His approach for Tourism Australia is different. His team works on the small things that add value\u00a0every single day.\n\nAs an example, he explains that instead of running a big campaign or contest to grow Instagram quickly, they've grown the account slowly over the past two years by posting consistently.

He shares that he decided to try the platform for 30 days. During that time, he made a Vine a day based around silly ideas he and his roommate came up with. Each 7-second Vine featured a special effect and in 30 days, Zach says he accumulated 200,000 followers. He was hooked by the growth rate.\n\nZach talks about why the challenge of using Vine to tell stories excites him.\n\nListen to the show to find out how Vine works.\n\nWhat Zach's most popular Vines have in common\n\nZach believes his Vines are successful because they include circumstances everyone can relate to.\n\n\nFor example, almost everyone has locked the keys in the car or wanted a special souvenir from a vacation.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to hear about more of Zach's successful videos.\n\nHow making Vine videos has changed things for Zach\n\nZach shares that as he was working his way through film school by teaching FinalCut, he was introduced to posting on YouTube. As he added Vine and Instagram to the mix, his exposure grew. Zach says that Vine exposure has brought him bigger clients, like Coca-Cola and McDonald's, with bigger budgets.\n\nListen to the show to discover why Zach believes platforms like Vine are changing the commercial branding world.\n\nVine's culture\n\nZach states that Vine is very secretive about their analytics. The only metrics available are likes, ReVines and the released loops. He shares that he estimates the average Vine user to be between 13 and 25 years of age\u2014otherwise known as\u00a0Millennials.\n\nHe explains that Vine has a diverse collection of categories including a DIY category where you learn how to do a project in 7 seconds and a Comedy category, which Zach believes is the number-one reason people are on Vine.\n\n\n\nZach says you don't need any film experience to be successful on Vine. He points out that a lot of Viners who have 7 or 8 million followers simply grabbed a camera and started recording.\n\nListen to the show to hear how personality and style lead to follower growth.\n\nHow Vines can be viewed or shared\n\nZach shares you need the Vine app to view videos on Vine, but that they can also be embedded on websites. He says embedding is what led to Vine's increased popularity and that Vines perform best outside of the app.\n\n\nListen to the show to find out how a third-party YouTube compilation of Zach's Vines contributed to his success.\n\nHow bigger businesses are using Vine\n\nWhile it attracts bigger brands like Coca-Cola and Virgin Mobile, Zach explains that marketing on Vine is different than on platforms like Facebook because Vine hasn't monetized. He says that because brands can't pay to have their Vines put in front of someone,", "duration": "39:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-108-14-08-29.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1408701604, "title": "Measuring Social Media: What Marketers Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you understand how to measure social media activities?\n\nDo you know how to gather the right data to help you achieve your business goals?\n\nTo\u00a0explore how you can measure social media activities, I interview Lutz Finger for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Lutz Finger, who is the director of data analytics at LinkedIn and co-author of the new book,\u00a0Ask, Measure, Learn: Using Social Media Analytics to Understand and Influence Customer Behavior.\n\nLutz shares why he's so interested in social analytics.\n\nYou'll discover why Lutz believes social media analytics will have a bigger impact than the onset of the Internet did.\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nMeasuring Social Media\nWhy do so many businesses struggle with measuring social media activities?\n\nLutz talks about the trial-and-error phase of social media measurement and how we've moved beyond that phase in some areas but are still learning in others. He says the promise of social media analytics has a lot of misconceptions around it.\n\nWith easy access to data on trending content, followers, Klout scores, etc., businesses are trying to find a way to use the data. Lutz explains why this approach often leads to a negative outcome and why businesses should approach using data with a goal or question first.\n\n\n\nLutz shares why it's important to understand how a metric is built and points to the Influencer metric as an example. He says that while there are at least 10 different Influencer metrics that have to do with reach, not every influencer can help fulfill every goal.\n\nHe explains why he would consider Social Media Examiner an influencer if he wanted to put a new social tool in front of people who work with social media, but not if he wanted to sell clothing.\n\nListen to the show to learn what\u00a0influencer reach\u00a0must be combined with to move people from awareness to intention.\n\nThe difference between viral and contagious content\n\nLutz says the term viral, when used to describe social media content, is wrong because something that's viral is equally infectious at every stage. For example, a story that is liked by 1 in 10 people the first time it's seen will be liked by 1 in 10 people in the future.\n\nHe explains that when something is contagious, it gains weight as long as it travels. The more people who believe in it, the more trustworthy the story becomes, regardless of whether it's true.\n\nListen to the show to find out how people convince an algorithm that something is contagious and how that's affected things like the New York Times Bestseller List.\n\nHow social media data can empower a business\n\nLutz states there isn't good or bad data, there's just useful and useless data. He explains that data is only useful when a business has the right question.\n\nHe shares that many organizations start by asking what data they have and how they can measure it. Then they try to find something in the data to help their business.\n\nLutz says you need to start with a question or goal, and then figure out how to capture the data that will help answer that question instead of using data to come up with a question you didn't have in the first place.\n\n\n\nHe illustrates how a sales department can use data to answer the question, \"How can we find new clients?\"\n\nListen to the show to discover why sentiment is an especially difficult metric to measure.\n\nHow marketers can start measuring social media activities\n\nOnce you have the question,", "duration": "49:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-107-14-08-22.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1408096804, "title": "How a Podcast Built a Business: The Lou Mongello Story", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you have or want to start a podcast?\n\nAre you wondering how your podcast can lead to bigger things?\n\nTo\u00a0explore how a podcast went from a hobby to a full-time business, I interview Lou Mongello for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Lou Mongello.

Because he was in the service business, he had this idea for making something once and selling it. He shares that what he really knew all about was not law or computers, but Disney World.\n\nIn 2002, Lou gave himself a personal challenge. He wanted to write a book, get it published and get it validated by somebody. When the book came out, he thought that was the end of it. But his two-page brochure website turned into articles, which turned into a thriving discussion forum.\n\nIn 2005, Lou realized podcasting was more powerful than anything he could write. That's when he started podcasting, doing videos, creating other products, doing events, etc. He's been doing this full-time since 2007.\n\nListen to the show to learn how Lou found a publisher to work with.\n\nHow Lou moved from the book to the blog\n\nWhen he started the book, he was on things like Usenet news groups and early discussion forums. He says this showed him there was a community of people out there interested in Disney in the same way he was.\n\nBecause he was responding to so many similar emails, he decided to write the responses as articles (which is what blog posts were back in 2003). He also created a discussion forum on his site; 29 people signed up on the first night! That number organically grew from 29 to 1,000 to 5,000 to 10,000 to 50,000 and the community is still going strong.\n\nListen to the show to find out what Lou built his discussion forum on.\n\nHow building his community led to the podcast\n\nLou says he started working on his second book the day after his first book came out. His community was very active and he shares that in 2005 he started hearing about podcasting and how anyone could use podcasting to broadcast their message.\n\n\n\nHe shares that he started without knowing what he was doing and if or how people would find the show. Within the first week, the podcast had a few hundred downloads then a few thousand. Lou believes this is because people interested in Disney were and still are hungry for content.\n\nListen to the show to hear Lou's experience moving from the first wave of interest in podcasts into the second wave of interest.\n\nWhen the podcast turned from hobby to profession\n\nWhile Lou had things like AdSense and affiliate programs making some money on his website, it wasn't enough to quit his job. Lou says he'd left his law practice and sold his IT consulting company.", "duration": "45:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-106-14-08-15.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1407492054, "title": "Instagram Success: How a Marketer Grew a Loyal Following With Instagram", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want to grow your business using Instagram?\n\nAre you wondering how to build a loyal following?\n\nI interview Chalene Johnson for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast and explore how she amassed a following of 365,000 on Instagram.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Chalene Johnson.\u00a0Chalene is author of the fitness book Push, a motivational speaker and her infomercials on fitness have sold millions of DVDs.

When she told her agent she wanted to pitch a book about goal-setting and focus instead of a fitness book, he told her she didn't have the social media following or the credibility to write that type of book.\u00a0\n\nShe got to work and spent a year using social media to build a platform with the intention of writing the book she wanted to pitch to publishers in New York.\n\nListen to the show to hear how Chalene used social media when she first started.\n\nWhat Chalene built to support her book pitch\n\nChalene shares that she had a ton of followers on YouTube and had just started a Facebook page when she decided to write Push. Even though she had millions of DVD customers, her agent had to remind her that publishers don't care who you know; publishers want to know if you have the ability to reach those people.\n\nTo build her email list, Chalene created a 30-Day Challenge for her Facebook audience.\n\n\n\nShe started with three quick videos\u00a0to show how she uses her phone to organize her daily to-do list and included a simple email opt-in.

Then she noticed she wasn't getting any love on Facebook.\n\nShe didn't want to learn about\u00a0Facebook ads and shares that she kind of picked up her toys and stomped off the playground. That's when she began to realize her kids were all over Instagram but businesses weren't.\n\n\n\nIn winter 2012, Chalene decided to become an early settler on Instagram. She started with life-casting, sharing personal images to show where she was and what she was doing during the day.\n\nListen to the show to find out how following a favorite fashion icon drastically changed Chalene's Instagram strategy.\n\nHow Instagram has changed Chalene's business\n\nChalene shares that as a business owner and someone with a family, Instagram saves her time. She says instead of spending hours creating content, she can now spend literally 15 seconds and produce content to drive traffic to an opt-in for current or future offers.\n\nUnlike Facebook, Instagram allows her to put a call to action (CTA) in every post without affecting her engagement.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to discover what Chalene track...", "duration": "39:23", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-105-14-08-08.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1406887238, "title": "Launching With Social: A Study of What Works and What Does Not", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Are you planning to launch a new blog, product or service?\n\nDo you want to know how to organize and execute a successful launch with social media?\n\nTo share ways you can use social media to launch or celebrate anything, this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast\u00a0gives techniques and insights learned from the launch of My Kids' Adventures' Parenting Adventures podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, you'll learn how to plan your launch and what assets to include. You'll also find out what worked for us and what didn't.\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nLaunching With Social\nStart the launch process\n\nThe first thing I did was to prepare a PowerPoint presentation for people on the internal team. If you're a one person show, you can prepare the same ideas and present them to a friend or even to yourself. What's important is to go through the process below.\n\nFirst you need to identify the audience you want to target. As part of the annual survey for Social Media Examiner and My Kids' Adventures, we asked two questions.: \"Do you listen to podcasts?\" and \"Are you a mom or a dad?\".\u00a0Based on the responses we were able to determine that dads listen to podcasts more than moms which helped us to resize our expectations.\n\nYou then need to identify your biggest asset. Whenever you launch anything, you should use what I call tag-along marketing. You've built an audience somewhere - with a blog, a newsletter, an existing podcast. This asset you own is there for you to use. Piggyback some of the marketing efforts for your new venture on it. My biggest asset was the Social Media Marketing podcast.\n\nNext take a look at who you're up against. I looked at the Kids & Family category and identified Sesame Street, Adventures in Odyssey and other podcasts from established brands that have been around forever as competitors.\n\n\n\nYou need to establish what your product is all about. To wrap everyone's heads around Parenting Adventures, I simply shared that it's a 30 minute interview show followed by a fun\u00a0activity.\n\nThen choose your launch date. The Parenting Adventures podcast launched on Friday, June 13, 2014.\n\nListen to the show to hear why this date was chosen to launch the Parenting Adventures podcast.\n\nFind the best way to launch\n\nOne of my strongest assets are the relationships we've built. From these relationships, I was able to\u00a0identify different \"camps\" of people we could reach out to for their support.\n\nOne of the obvious camps was staff and contractors who work for our company.\u00a0For the second camp, we identified allies from the bloggers and podcasters the My Kids' Adventures marketing team has been building relationships with for a year.

While the page was mildly successful, it wasn't driving any traffic.\n\nEven though the page had shown prior growth, it had been sitting at 10K-13K fans for 18 months. In early October 2013, Rachel set a goal of getting to 50K fans by Christmas to support the spring launch of their book,\u00a0101 Kids Activities That Are the Bestest, Funnest Ever!, and started to post to the page more frequently.\n\n\n\nShe says they noticed that a competing Facebook page with a huge audience was posting content from the Kids Activities Blog without providing a link back or attribution\u2014the page was even cropping the watermarks from Holly's images and posting them with the updates.\n\nWhen she looked closer, Holly found that the updates from this page posting her stolen content were getting up to 9,000 shares each.\n\nListen to the show to hear why this was a turning point for their Facebook content strategy.\n\nHow they changed the approach to managing the Quirky Momma Facebook page\n\nHolly says seeing the viral impact of their stolen images made them go back and find the top 50 posts on their blog. They concentrated on only sharing posts that were already doing well on other social media sites like Pinterest\u2014posts that had viral potential.\n\n\n\nShe says that they were only sharing a few times a day and sharing mostly their own stuff because that's what they knew best.

He says businesses can be successful even if they spend as little as $5 or $10 a day.\n\nAs examples, Rick mentions using Facebook ads to guide people into a giveaway to build your email list, or to geographically target people to let locals know about a discount, offer or promotion.\n\n\n\nYou'll hear why Rick personally likes to use Facebook ads to promote his webinars.\n\nAs marketers, we have to be aware that people aren't on Facebook to be sold to.\n\nListen to the show to discover what type of freebie you should include in your offer.\n\nHow remarketing works on Facebook\n\nFacebook came out this year with\u00a0Website Custom Audiences, which are another form of retargeting or remarketing.\n\nRick explains that you use these audiences by placing a Website Custom Audience (or remarketing) pixel on your website. The pixel tracks website visitors who are also Facebook users and builds an audience from them, so you can serve ads to them on Facebook.\n\n\n\nThis is great. It lets you serve ads to warmer leads because they're already familiar with your business.\n\nListen to the show to hear Rick's thoughts on using Facebook ads to grow\u00a0page likes.\n\nAbout boosted posts\n\nIf you boost a post, you're stuck with the preset levels for the ad spend and limited targeting.\n\n\n\nRick says if you want more people to see a specific post, you're better off turning the post into a page post ad.\u00a0To do that, you have to use the Ads Creator or Power Editor, but you'll have better control of your ad spend budget and deeper targeting options.\n\nListen to the show to hear why Rick recommends that you don't boost posts.\n\nExciting things businesses can do with Facebook ad targeting\n\nWhen most people think of targeting on Facebook, they think of interest targeting\u2014for example, targeting people who like pages similar to your business page.\n\nRick believes the really exciting stuff is Website Custom Audiences or uploading your email list to Facebook to create a custom audience that lets you target those people with your Facebook ads.\n\nYou can take it a step further and create a lookalike audience of Facebook users from your own custom audience. These types of audiences are made up of Facebook users who share attributes similar to those in a custom audience you designate.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to learn how including custom elements in your ad copy leads to a higher conversion rate.\u00a0\n\nWhy pay Facebook to reach your email subscribers\n\nRick explains this concept is the same as remarketing to your website visitors on Facebook.", "duration": "45:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-102-14-07-18.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1405072845, "title": "Customer Service: The Key to Delivering Experiences Worth Talking About", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you believe that you provide good customer service?\n\nAre you wondering why customer service is so important to your business?\n\nTo learn how service and social media tie together, I interview John DiJulius for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview\u00a0John DiJulius, the author of What's The Secret: To Providing a World-Class Customer Experience.

They knew that they wanted to be different from every other hair salon in their area.\u00a0This meant that they wanted to create an experience like no other.\n\n\n\nWith his first book, Secret Service, he originally wanted to name it \"Mastering a Norm Factor\" from the TV program Cheers but he couldn't get the rights. John not only wanted their regular customers, but also the ones who only came in twice a year,\u00a0to feel like the character Norm.\n\nThe book is based around systems that they use behind the scenes to obtain customer intelligence to be able to personalize the experience.\n\nAlthough 20 years later John is no longer in the business, he still owns it. He's just finished his third book; his business, the DiJulius Group, has grown; and he now gets to travel the world to share what \"secret service\" really is.\n\nYou'll hear one of the great examples that they used in the hair salons that the customers weren't aware of, but the staff knew what it meant for the customer.\n\nListen to the show to hear other examples of how you can differentiate your first-time customers from returning customers, and give each one a different experience.\n\nWhy the first customer experience is so important\n\nJohn states that people aren't actual customers until they've tried you out. That's why their first experience with you is so important. It can even take 3 or 4 experiences before they become a customer.\n\n\n\nYou have to give them an opportunity to give you a second chance. It's essential that you make them feel comfortable and create an emotional connection with them.\n\nJohn says that there are certain non-negotiables that need to happen. When you're face-to-face with the customer, you need to provide the 5 Es (the first 3 only take 1 second each simultaneously to do).\n\n\tEye contact\n\tEnthusiastic greeting\n\tEar-to-ear smile\n\tEngage them\n\tEducate them\n\nListen to the show to find out why it's so important to deliver one secret service at every encounter.\n\nThe business benefits of good customer service\n\nJohn explains that there is empirical data that looks at companies in the top 5% for customer satisfaction versus everyone else in that industry over a 7- or 10-year period.

CRM manages all of your customers' data, and when you add the word social, it takes in all of the social data too.\n\n\n\nWhether you want to sell to customers or retain them, social CRM just adds those social data points. This can be a Facebook profile, Twitter account, etc.\u2014basically anything that has to do with social media.\n\nIt's the ability to manage all of your data points around the customer within a single software source.\n\nListen to the show to find out why Kyle doesn't distinguish between the two.\n\nThe definition of CRM systems\n\nKyle explains that a CRM system is software that allows you to manage every single touchpoint you have with your customers. For example, their email address, what they bought previously from you, their Twitter handle, and so forth. It's really based on what level of business you have.\n\nSo if you're an enterprise company,\u00a0then the CRM solution would be Salesforce. However, if you're a smaller company,\u00a0Nimble would be a great alternative.\n\n\n\nCRM systems are anything to do with a customer interaction. This can be either in a store or online.\n\nListen to the show to discover why these people aren't just customers, but prospects too.\n\nWhy social CRM is important for marketers\n\nKyle refers to Mary Meeker's State of the Internet\u00a0report that was released at the end of May this year. He thinks that we have reached a point where social media has hit maturity, and for us to realize the true value of it, we have to be able to connect it to our customers who are already in our systems.\n\nFor example, if a retailer has 1000 customers within their CRM solution, they need to be able to find the social pieces of data that connect them to these existing customers. As a business, you want to turn these customers into advocates. To do this, you need to manage your data around the customer.\n\n\n\nKyle believes that from a social standpoint, it allows you to recognize the true value of social and you can use it to communicate more effectively.\n\nYou'll discover how you can drive more sales when you combine customer email addresses with their social networks.\n\nOne of the biggest things that Kyle sees right now is marketers who use the one-click sign-on using Facebook on their website. When a customer visits your website and signs in through Facebook, you get all that customer's information. There is so much data you can pull when you connect with customers on a social network.\n\nListen to the show to find out how social CRM can improve your advertising effectiveness while reducing your customer servic...", "duration": "36:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-100-14-07-04.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1403863231, "title": "Marketing You: How to Play to Your Unique Strengths", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you struggle when it comes to marketing yourself?\n\nAre you wondering what your unique strengths are?\n\nTo learn how to\u00a0promote yourself based on these strengths, I interview Sally Hogshead for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\n\nKeep reading to discover more.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview\u00a0Sally Hogshead, author of\u00a0Fascinate and How the World Sees You. She was an award-winning copywriter at the age of 23 and worked with brands such as Nike, Target and BMW. She's one of the few women in the Speaker Hall of Fame and\u00a0a popular keynote speaker (Sally keynoted Social Media Marketing World) and a simply fascinating woman.\n\nSally shares how you can be successful and fascinating in your work and your life.\n\nYou'll discover how fascination can increase your value, put you at an advantage and enable you to get more satisfaction out of your work.\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nMarketing You\nThe journey from\u00a0Fascinate to How the World Sees You\n\nSally explains that the hardest part for her when writing a book is when it goes into the print stage.\n\nWhen her last book\u00a0Fascinate was ready to be shipped to stores, she felt at a loss and didn't know what to do with herself. She started to think about doing a personality assessment, which was based on the same system that she had created for brands. So instead of it being about how consumers see a brand, it's about how the world sees you.\n\nOnce the test was ready, it was put out on social media for free and it became a huge part of her business. It surpassed\u00a0Fascinate.\n\n\n\nSally soon realized that people really wanted to know how to make themselves\u2014not their brand\u2014fascinating. She pivoted her entire company and started to study more about it and go deep into what makes one person perceived as valuable, and someone else perceived as a commodity.\n\nOnce you have done the assessment, it becomes clear why certain people like, respect and admire you, and why you turn others off.\n\nThe key here is that you don't have to change who you are; you have to become more of who you are.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to find out why it helps to see the patterns among your work colleagues, and how it can help you communicate more effectively with them.\n\nHow social media has played a part in the development of this entire concept\n\nBefore the days of social media, our average attention span used to be 20 minutes. Now with social media, it's around 9 seconds.\u00a0People can now form an opinion of you instantly on social media.\n\nWith that in mind, you now have to find a way to front-load your value. It's your opportunity to make the most accurate and authentic first impression.\n\nYou'll hear what Sally and her team discovered when they ran a one-year free beta test for about 30,000 people, and why it led them to turn it into a paid model.\n\nAt present, the Fascination Advantage Assessment\u00a0costs $37. However, you can get free access to an in-depth, custom report, which identifies your personality advantages. Check out the key takeaways at the end of this article to find out how to enter.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to hear the two main things that people who took the initial assessment wanted to know.\n\nFascination and the research behind it\u00a0\n\nSally states that fascination is a state of intense focus. When you're fascinated by something, you are totally focused on that one particular thing.

He said, \"Sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, we don't own those. We are using other people's property.\"\n\n\n\nScott explains the reason for that comment was to address the concern marketers have in the drop in organic reach\u00a0with their posts on Facebook.\n\nThe challenge now is you can't ignore Facebook because there are over 1.2 billion people who use it, and you have to find a way to live with it.\n\nScott says the reason why he calls these sites rented is because they are ultimately in control. If you look at Facebook, they can change the algorithm any time they like, and marketers have to suffer the consequences, unless they are willing to pay.\n\nYou need to look at your owned sites, where you do have control. Scott thinks it's best to centralize your content in a hub, then have digital outposts of rented spaces and good relationships with influencers. Then use paid media around all of that to strategically amplify your earned, owned and rented spots.\n\nListen to the show to find out why it's not just about using paid for promoting your ads.\n\nBlogger outreach and why it's important\u00a0\n\nScott says that blogger outreach isn't that different from media relations.\n\nYou need to look at who the influencers with an audience are, and figure out if you can either invite them to special events, give them an experience with your products or let them meet with the executives of your company. Then they can go and tell a story to their audience.\n\n\n\nAny brand has a story to tell and you have to think of ways you can inspire others to tell your story.\n\nOnce you have figured out who the main industry influencers and bloggers are in your industry, then you can start to reach out to them. It's important to take note of how they interact with other brands too.\n\nYou'll discover the parallels and distinctions between public relations and blogger relations, and how to treat each type of influencer differently.\n\nWhen Scott was at Ford, they mixed the bloggers in with journalists.

Twitter cards give you a lot more options than you get with an ordinary tweet.\n\nWith a normal tweet, you can upload an image that has to be rectangular. If it isn't, Twitter crops the top and bottom for it to fit. When you create a tweet with an image, the default is displayed on Twitter.com and on mobile apps.\n\n\n\nTweets with images do not support Twitter cards. They are completely separate.\n\nTwitter cards work similarly to how Facebook pulls in default information from a post when you paste a URL into Facebook. It pulls in an image, a headline and some text.\n\nListen to the show to hear why I believe Twitter cards only work on Twitter.com and their own mobile app right now.\n\nHow a Twitter card works\n\nIf you go to Twitter.com and go to a Twitter account that has Twitter cards enabled, you'll see the option to View Summary in the bottom right of the tweet.\n\n\n\nWith Twitter's mobile app, you have to click on the tweet to see the Summary card. You'll hear the advantages and disadvantages of this one-click process.\n\nOne of the benefits you get with a Twitter card is the amount of content you can add. You get 70 additional characters for the title, and 200 additional characters for your description.\n\n\n\nWhen you click on View Summary in a tweet, you'll notice that below the tweet is where your additional content appears. There's also the ability to include images.\n\nYou can even include tall images. For example, I was able to display an image that was 480 x 580 pixels within a Twitter card.\n\nListen to the show to find out what information you can include and what is powerful if you have a multi-author blog.\n\nTwitter card benefits for bloggers\n\nThere are three types of Twitter cards that work well for bloggers. These are the Summary card, the Summary card with large image and the Photo card.\n\n1. The Summary card is the default that most bloggers will likely choose. It shows a small image that's offset to the right, and all text is below it. This is very similar to how Facebook works.\n\n\n\n2. The Summary card with large image is a better option if you have nice big images on your blog.\n\nThe difference here is that the large image is above the content. When someone hits View Summary, they will see the large image before the additional information you have included.\n\n\n\n3. The Photo card is essentially the same as the Summary card with large image, except it doesn't have the summary. Instead you just see the photo with a headline.\n\nTo see a Photo card in use, you can check out Mashable on Twitter. At Social Media Examiner, we use the Summary card and we use the Summary card with large image for My Kids' Adventures.\n\nListen to the show to discover how the images you create for Facebook Open Graph on your blog can also be used for Summary cards.\n\nHow to set up a WordPress blog to work with Summary cards\n\nFirst of all, you need to install the WordPress SEO by\u00a0Yoast\u00a0plugin.", "duration": "47:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-097-14-06-13.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1402048805, "title": "Marketing Instagram Style: What Marketers Need to Know", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you use Instagram for marketing?\n\nAre you wondering how you can grow an Instagram following that will build your business?\n\nTo learn how Instagram can help you engage your audience, I interview Jenn Herman for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Jenn Herman, who blogs\u00a0at Jenn's Trends\u00a0and is one of our top 10 social media blog winners for 2014.

Many people believe that it's a platform for selfies and pictures of food. However, Instagram is much more than that and goes a lot deeper.\n\n\n\nThe marketing aspect is so much stronger now, and will only continue to grow.\n\nSo far this year, the main buzzword has been visual marketing, with Facebook and Twitter embracing visual content.\n\nNot only is Instagram a visual platform, it also gives you the capacity to create visual content for other sites. With the Instagram tools\u00a0available, you can create fun artwork to use on your blog, website, Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0It's very useful for cross-promoting.\n\n\n\nRight now, 65% of the world's top brands use Instagram and Jenn says the number continues to grow.\n\nThere are 200 million monthly active users on Instagram, 70% of which log in daily. This is a huge base of people for marketers to reach. No matter who your target audience is, some of them will use the platform.\n\nYou'll hear why you can reach people more clearly through Instagram than you can with any other platform.\n\nAs a marketer, you should aim to create original images for Instagram. There are many different ways to incorporate your products and services into an image to make it look more native and get better engagement.\n\nListen to the show to find out what our 2014 Social Media Marketing Industry Report revealed about visual marketing.\n\nMarketers who use Instagram well\n\nThe first brand example that Jenn talks about is fashion designer\u00a0Michael Kors. The way they do product placement on Instagram is amazing.\n\n\n\nThe images they create for their fans are behind the scenes at fashion shows, photo shoots and great shots of their products. These types of images can help you to\u00a0connect with your audience.\n\nAlthough Jenn loves the images, she says it's their lack of engagement that lets them down.\u00a0Instagram is a highly engaged and active environment.\n\nJenn advises marketers to be aware of this, and make sure that you're responsive to your followers.\n\nListen to the show to hear the type of images we used to create some buzz prior to Social Media Marketing World this year.\n\nEngagement on Instagram\n\nJenn states that engagement is considerably higher on Instagram than it is on Facebook, Twitter and Google+. When Jenn tests her blog posts on all of the different platforms, Instagram almost always comes out ahead.\n\nOne way to create engagement on Instagram is to ask a question in the caption. This encourages your readers to start or join the conversation.\n\nWhen they start to respond, you receive a trail of comments.", "duration": "42:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-096-14-06-06.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1401444042, "title": "Relationship Marketing: How to Secure Guests Who Become Allies", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Do you want to grow better relationships with market influencers?\n\nAre you wondering if interviewing people can help your business?\n\nTo learn how interviewing people can help build power relationships for your business, I interview John Lee Dumas for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview\u00a0John Lee Dumas, author of the book Podcast Launch and host of the EntrepreneurOnFire podcast\u2014a top-ranked business podcast.

The very first interviews he ever did were for the EntrepreneurOnFire podcast.\n\n\n\nHe says that if you listen to his first 50 episodes, it's obvious that he was new to it.\n\nBefore John started his own podcast, he loved listening to the likes of Andrew Warner of Mixergy, Pat Flynn of Smart Passive Income and David Siteman Garland of Rise To The Top.\u00a0He noticed that nobody was doing a 7-day-a-week show, and decided to give it a go.\n\nAlthough he knew he wouldn't be great in the beginning, he knew he had to start somewhere. So he reached out to people in the space to see if they would talk to him.\n\n\n\nYou'll hear why John batch-processes his interviews for the week ahead, and how many episodes he did before he felt like he had settled in.\u00a0John is now around the 608th episode mark.\n\nWhen you host a podcast, you need to come across as authentic.

To be able to do this, he knew he had to grow an audience. He had to become a leader in a particular area, industry and niche.\n\nWhen John listened to podcasts, he connected with them straightaway.

He says it's like being the third person in a conversation when you listen to these shows.\n\n\n\nFor John to be able to do a show, he knew he had to be a little bit different and come up with a unique selling proposition.

Not only was he exposed to it as a profession, but John's dad was also a great mentor to him.\n\nHis dad always obsessed about trying to deliver value to his customers and to make sure he kept his word.\n\n\n\nThe way people sell today has changed because of all of the different tools that are available.\u00a0Back then, people knew what they wanted to buy, but now it's something different.\n\nListen to the show to find out what John's first job was when he left college.\n\nHow teaching and selling connect\n\nFirst of all, you don't want to be pushy with your product. Most people are turned off by this and build a wall straight away, even if they're interested.\n\nInstead, you need to tell stories, share examples of other people's success and start to paint a picture of\u00a0how you can solve the customer's problem. John feels that with this approach, the trust barrier is removed. It's a great way for other people to relate to you as someone who delivers value, without the exchange of money.\n\nSome of the best ways to attract people to you is to teach through workshops, seminars or articles. A lot of people want to be taught and led by someone else. When you develop a reputation for being someone who can teach people, then you get invited to places where you have the opportunity to sell.\n\n\n\nA lot of people still believe that if you give too much away, you won't be hired. However, from John's experience (and mine), it's the total opposite. The more you give and demonstrate your expertise for free, the more likely you are to attract that ideal customer. People see you as someone who is willing to give before they ask.\n\nListen to the show to discover the percentage of business that John receives from people who are not customers or he doesn't have direct interaction with.\n\nAn example of a business that is winning by teaching\n\nOne of the first companies that comes to mind is HubSpot, which\u00a0makes a profit from teaching. They produce great ebooks and run live webinars with different experts.\n\n\n\nAnother company that John personally uses is REI, which sells quality outdoor gear. They do a tremendous amount of teaching on their website. The information they provide supports the products they sell. It's great for the outdoor enthusiast who wants to be part of that community, as well as buy a product from them.\n\n\n\nYou'll hear a great example of how a small software company stood out from their competitors in the way they market their product and why John believes it's the key to success.\n\nListen to the show to hear other examples of companies and individuals who sell through teaching.\n\nWhat is the \"Total Content System\"?", "duration": "40:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-094-05-23.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1400234440, "title": "Crisis Management: What to Do When Your Business Makes a Public Mistake", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Is your business ready for a social media crisis?\n\nAre you wondering what you should do if you or a colleague makes an embarrassing public mistake?\n\nTo learn how to handle a social media crisis, I interview Gini Dietrich for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Gini Dietrich,\u00a0author of the brand-new book,\u00a0Spin Sucks: Communication and Reputation Management in the Digital Age,\u00a0and founder of the blog Spin Sucks.

When she returned to collect the check, the customer had crossed out the 18% and had written, \"I give God 10%, why do you get 18%?\" The customer left a 10% tip instead.\n\nOne of the waitress' friends took a photo of the receipt, which included the customer's name, and posted it on Reddit. This led to it going viral and the whole world saw it.\n\nApplebee's response was that they were going to fire the waitress and her friend, because it was against their policy to show pictures or talk about customers. Especially when a name is included.\n\nWhat happened next on Applebee's Facebook page\u00a0added fuel to the fire.\n\n\n\nApplebee's replied to every person's comment on Facebook with a canned PR response. You'll hear what the response included.\n\n\n\nPeople didn't take kindly to the way Applebee's handled the situation, and started to dig deep on the Internet. Pictures were discovered that had been posted with good customer feedback on their Facebook page. Although these pictures included the customer's name, nobody got fired for it. A Facebook page was then started to try to get the waitress' job back.\n\nYou'll hear what Gini's gut instinct was on the person who was handling the corporate Facebook page for Applebee's, and why it contributed to the crisis.\n\nGini advises you never to use a canned PR message on social media, because it's about being social. You need to engage, be transparent and remain human. This means you need to show sympathy and empathy toward what's happening.\n\nAlways take time to think about the statement before you put it out there.\n\nListen to the show to find out how the way you handle a social media crisis can affect your sales.\n\nThe first thing you should do once you're aware of an issue\n\nGini says that the first thing you should do is understand what has happened. This means communicating with both sides to get the bigger picture.\n\nIn Applebee's case, they should have listened to the customer, the waitress and her friend before they did anything else\u2014whether they had a policy in place or not.\n\n\n\nYou have to remember that we live in a world of instant gratification, where people tend to react before they think the situation through.

As a result of this, there has been a lot of interesting dialogue in this space.\n\n\n\nThe upside of blog comments\n\nMark explains how there are a lot of different business reasons behind blogs, and it's up to each individual business to make the decision whether to have comments on their blog.\n\nHe says that there are probably some very good economic reasons why Copyblogger decided to remove comments, but Mark thinks that blog comments are the economic engine.\n\nThe community that Mark has built on his blog has led to many different business benefits for him and his community. You can get to know people in the comment area, which can lead to collaborations, customers and suppliers.\n\n\n\nMark feels that a lot of influence takes place in the blog communities, where you can develop strong relationships\u00a0compared to the ones you make on Twitter or Facebook.\n\nYou'll hear other great benefits that come from comments on your blog, and why Mark sees them as a gift every day.\n\n\n\nThe Huffington Post has a little bit of a different viewpoint, just because of their sheer size. They face a bigger challenge because of the number of comments they get every day. It's hard for them to actually interact and engage with every single commenter.\n\nTim explains at this point, it's a matter of them looking at some of the prolific commenters on their site and working with them. They've found that some commenters don't want to write for them, they are happy just commenting.\n\nListen to the show to find out the cost of engagement, and why you can engage yourself broke.\n\nSome of the challenges the Huffington Post faces with blog comments\n\nTim says that the biggest issue for them is to figure out how to allow people to share and express their thoughts on content, while\u00a0appreciating that the standard for commenting is different from their editorial standards.\n\nThey have to find ways to moderate this effectively with the different languages, countries and time zones.\n\n\n\nYou can't replace a human when it comes comment moderation. You need to find a balance between using technology, combined with what people can do.\n\nYou'll hear how the Huffington Post deals with heated dialogue and negative comments on their blogs.\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with spam, last year they made all commenters authenticate ...", "duration": "39:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-092-14-05-09.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 549899114, "seriesTitle": "Social Media Marketing Podcast helps your business thrive with social media", "pubDate": 1399024801, "title": "Haters: How to Deal With Haters and Trolls of Your Business", "author": "Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner", "summary": "Have you ever been publicly criticized or mocked for something that you did?\n\nAre you wondering how you can deal with this type of negativity when it happens on social media?\n\nTo learn about haters and how to deal with them, I interview Marcus Sheridan for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.\nMore About This Show\n\n\nThe Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.\n\nIt's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.\n\nThe show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).\n\nIn this episode, I interview Marcus Sheridan, who\u00a0blogs at The Sales Lion, is host of The Mad Marketing Podcast\u00a0and is a partner at\u00a0River Pools & Spas. Marcus is a consultant and keynote speaker. In fact, he was the closing keynote at Social Media Marketing World and he simply killed it!\n\nMarcus shares the various types of critics you might attract and how you can deal with them.\n\nYou'll discover the differences among haters, trolls and critics and what to do when you are under attack.\n\nShare your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!\nListen Now\nYou can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, or Stitcher.\n\nHere are some of the things you'll discover in this show:\nHaters in Business\nHaters are the type of people who seem to get great joy out of saying nasty things about you or your company online. If you haven't dealt with haters yet, the chance of dealing with one in the future is pretty good.\n\nI'm going to share a story with you that happened recently to us, and my hope is that it will prepare you for these types of people. If you let them have their way,\u00a0then they succeed and you fail. This will impede your progress.\n\nThe story is about an entertainment piece that was made for Social Media Marketing World 2014. Phil Mershon, who is my event director, created an original jingle called \"Let's Get Social,\" which was sung by Mary McCoy from\u00a0Continuum Marketing Services.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itvvFfeLh84\n\nThe song was performed just before Jay Baer took the stage with a panel, which included Ted Rubin, Nichole Kelly and Jeffrey Rohrs. The panel discussion was entitled \"Have We Lost The Social in Social Media?\"\n\nThis particular piece of entertainment was designed to be funny, and was to set the stage for the panel discussion. Even though it was corny, attendees got into it. Although on the video, you can't grasp the audience's reaction.\n\nThe video was originally released on the event page for Social Media Examiner, on my personal Facebook profile and on Social Media Examiner's Facebook page. It was never intended to be released to the public.\n\nThe day after it was uploaded, it started to go crazy viral. The first day alone it received 75,000 views on YouTube. The number of negative and nasty comments on YouTube was unbelievable.\n\nPhil and I had a discussion as to whether to close off the comments, but I didn't feel that was appropriate. You'll hear the reasons why I kept the comments open, and what I hoped would happen.\n\nAn article was then published by Gawker called The Devil Is Real, and He Made a Song About Social Media Marketing.\u00a0Gawker is a gossip blog that has a section called Valley Wag, which covers the social space.\n\n\n\nThis very negative post spurred a lot of the video's views and negative comments on YouTube. Following this blog post,\u00a0Mashable, Huffington Post, Slate\u00a0and\u00a0CNET\u00a0also covered the story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the Friday of that week, VH1 created this 90-second comedy piece\u00a0of the video:\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6byr_JKuk\n\nTo date, our video has been viewed nearly 500,000 times, with just over a 1,000 comments. At one point it ranked #15 worldwide. Someone has even made an acoustic version of it, which is quite good.\n\n\n\nNow the plus side of it all is that Social Media Marketing World was referenced or linked back to within all...", "duration": "54:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/e1/43/77/e143773a-a6d0-d3dd-be84-a286aff184f1/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/socialmediamarketing/SocialMediaMarketing-091-14-05-02.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}]}
