Before we dive into any questions today\u2026 I have an important announcement. In just a few more weeks will be the launch of my new newsletter - Curzio Research Advisory. As we're approaching episode 500 of my Wall Street Unplugged podcast, this is something that has been a long-time in the making. And today, I wanted to share with you (my subscribers) a few\u00a0more details. Moving on to today\u2019s main segment\u2026 Although my expertise is in the markets, investing, and stocks\u2026 every now and then I get a question that covers personal finance. This relates to everyone\u2026 and especially if you\u2019re new to investing. Whether it\u2019s student loan debt, car loans, or mortgage payments\u2026 I present listeners my #1 word of advice. It\u2019s simpler than you think, and more importantly, it\u2019s never too late.  Other topics covered today include: An update on Northern Dynasty and their EPA concerns, stop-loss orders, and more advice on how to use 13F\u2019s to your full advantage...", "duration": "41:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/sainvestorradio/FS20496.mp3?dest-id=11995", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 341813080, "seriesTitle": "Wall Street Unplugged with Frank Curzio - Your Best Source for Finance, Investing & Economics", "pubDate": 1488407593, "title": "Ep. 495: Jordan Trimble: This one could triple", "author": "", "summary": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On today\u2019s show I bring back Jordan Trimble - President and CEO of Skyharbour Resources (SYH.V). Skyharbour stands today as one of the most overlooked Uranium explorers. It's located in the heart of what's now known as the #1 mining jurisdiction is the world - Canada's Saskatchewan. Since Jordan was last on the show in November, we've seen a massive shift in the sector. Today, Jordan catches listeners up to date. Aside from Uranium prices finally coming off their lows... Skyharbour Resources alone has jumped nearly 150% in just 3 months. From .28 to .69, the stock still rests under $1 but as Jordan explains, this won\u2019t be the case much longer\u2026 Skyharbour just released news on their most recent drilling program. And the results are game-changing. But as investors, lets not forget - junior miners don\u2019t generate any revenue\u2026 cash concerns are critical, and at times, over-drilling can be detrimental... even in favorable economic conditions. As the company plans to aggressively drill in the near future, I ask Jordan the questions all investors need to know. Then, stepping back from the technicals, we take a closer look at the Uranium market as a whole. We already know demand is ramping up\u2026 but what about the other catalyst? As Jordan explains, there are multiple underestimated market components. These are factors that will only continue to drive Uranium prices higher. The fundamentals are all lining up. As for Skyharbour, if you took my recommendation a few months ago... keep enjoying the ride. As I expect Uranium prices to double in the next 6 to 12 months... well positioned companies like Jordan's should reap all the benefits. Also, don\u2019t miss this week\u2019s Educational Segment [45:36]. As the market continues to reach new all-time highs, fears are rising. Is the market too expensive? Are we overvalued? Absolutely not. Ignore it.

For the most part, today\u2019s show is not too different from others. Well, aside from one thing... I\u2019ve got a headache. And although there\u2019s a lot to cover\u2026 today I take a moment to step away from the market-talk. No \u201cshots fired\u201d or anything, but there\u2019s just a few things I need to clear up. And every once in awhile it\u2019s a bit more fun hosting a show - without any filter. I use this occasion to talk about the last newsletter I worked for\u2026 one of the biggest insurance scams in the world\u2026 and my apparent faulty claims on Boeing\u2019s automation front. As for the markets\u2026 Last week, I touched base on one of the largest bubbles on planet - Chinese real-estate. Time to short? ...Not so fast. On today\u2019s show, I dig a little deeper. And by looking at the big picture, this is a situation that almost makes too much sense. Tune in as I explain why investors need to pump their brakes on this particular trade\u2026 Then, for today\u2019s main segment, I talk about about the one and only - Tesla (TSLA). And why anything you read on this stock, you must take with a grain of salt. This is not a buy, or sell. In fact, I\u2019m indifferent\u2026 But at least I tell the truth.

To begin the show, and before my guest signs on... I share one of the most underutilized tools in the world of financial research and analysis. They\u2019re called 13F's. Every quarter, all hedge funds and institutional investment managers with over $100 million in qualifying assets are required to report something called a SEC 13F filing. Simply put, these 13F reports disclose what the largest investors in the world are buying and dumping\u2026 allowing regular people like you and me to see exactly where the \"smart money\" is moving. This is the easiest way investors can trade with famous traders like George Soros, Warren Buffett, or John Paulson. And they are publicly available every quarter\u2026 in full detail. Breaking down these reports can lead to the market's most interesting trends. And, with nothing to hide, this is where I find a lot of my new investment ideas. Today I share a few examples\u2026 Then for this week\u2019s interview, I\u2019m joined by John Petrides \u2013 Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Point View Wealth Management. John is a Wall Street Unplugged regular. From retail and telecom\u2026 to infrastructure, healthcare, and financial sectors... Every time John joins the show, he covers it all. And today he starts with earnings season... Thus far, just over 85% of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings. And about 66% have exceeded analyst expectations. Today, however, we take a closer look at the more important metrics\u2026 Earnings growth has reached a 3-year high. And with forward expectations getting dangerously high, John raises all the right questions. We also talk about today's most hated industry\u2026 Out of all sectors this earnings season, none performed as poor as retail. Stores like JC Penney, Macy's, and Target have all been crushed this past holiday season. And although shopping trends continue to point online, John and I both agree that the end is nowhere near for department stores. Tune in to hear who we think will survive\u2026 To end the interview, John prepares investors for upcoming rate hikes. The fed fund rates are currently sitting at 1.25%. But due to \u201chawkish\u201d changes coming soon, John expects rates to reach as high as 3% in only 2 years from now. More importantly, John shares with listeners his two favorite sectors going forward in today\u2019s deregulatory environment. And also shares with us 4 international stocks that he considers \u201cbuys\u201d today. Then, for my Educational Segment, I cover the fastest growing industry in the world. It has ties with every sector on the planet. However, because it\u2019s still early, this highly talked about sector is a minefield.

Keep the questions coming! Last week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), otherwise known as the inflation rate, posted its largest gain in nearly four years - crushing expectations. And as Fed Chairman, Janet Yellen, has already promised, an interest rate hike is just around the corner. Investors everywhere are ramping up for this massive macroeconomic change. But what does this mean for gold? With mild inflationary trends and expected growth in the dollar\u2026 almost everyone is expecting the price of the yellow metal to drop. But I can\u2019t say I agree\u2026 Then, taking my focus overseas, I talk about China\u2019s massive real estate bubble. And highlight the best ways for investors to position themselves around the crisis. Get your pens ready as I give listeners a list of ETF\u2019s to pay close attention to. Today\u2019s show also covers one of the biggest topics addressed in this past election (republican or democrat) - American Infrastructure. As you\u2019ll hear, the infrastructure trend is for real. And as far as President Trump\u2019s lengthy promised to-do-list, I expect infrastructure changes to lead the way. Good new for investors - there are a ton of stocks still in the sector that are relatively cheap in comparison to the S&amp;P500. Tune in as I explain why it\u2019s time to start placing your bets\u2026 And finally, to end the episode, I bring a few stocks under the microscope. This includes some of the top companies in the US that paying the highest tax rates. The stocks are CVS Pharmacy, KMI, and General Electric.

Today's guest is Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Global Investors. If there\u2019s anyone that knows the global economy, it's Frank. To begin the episode, Frank talks about the reality of deregulation. As we all know, the Trump administration has promised massive tax reforms. But Frank argues that these reforms are going to take much longer than what has been initially anticipated. As Frank says, it\u2019s time investors realize Trumps pro-business reforms will \u201ctake twice as long\u2026 cost twice as much\u2026 and will make everyone half as happy.\u201d In addition, Frank explains his bullish stance on the mining, materials, and energy sectors. According to Frank, the recent cutbacks in supply for several commodities will soon lead to large increases in price. Changing topics, Frank then gives his outlook for the airline industry. Two years ago Frank\u2019s company, US Global Investors, launched what\u2019s now known as the #1 airlines ETF in the world (JETS). And his timing couldn\u2019t of been better\u2026 Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, as of last week, is now investing $8M into the airliner industry. This is the same industry he called a \u201cdeath trap for investors\u201d just 5 years ago. As Frank explains, a lot has changed since then.\u00a0 Following decades of mergers, bankruptcies, and other disruptions, this sector is finally finding some stability. And current valuations are low \u2013 trading at 12 times earnings. Tune in as Frank makes his case for the finest pure-play airliner investment in this rejuvenated sector. Then, to close up the interview, Frank discusses \u201csmart data.\u201d And his methodologies behind emerging market investments in countries like China, India, and Argentina. These are places where so many investors have been burnt \u2013 yet where Frank has found so much success. Although there is still money to make in America, Frank shows us little-known ways to diversify our portfolios overseas. Also, I'll be covering this week's interesting short report on Northern Dynasty (NAK). I've been getting tons of questions. And I hope this segment clears up all the confusion.

It's what I like to call an \"elite dividend payer.\" \u00a0 Most \"elite dividend payers\" are companies you'll never hear about. These are companies that have plenty of cash flow... they're not exiciting... and they don't plan on raising cash anytime soon. \u00a0 Wall Street loves to rave on and on about a stocks capital gains but never the other crucial part of the formula - the dividend yield. \u00a0 Over time, as these companies continue to raise their dividend, investors can make a fortune. \u00a0 Then, there are some stocks you should never ever short or bet against. And believe it or not.. Tesla (TSLA)\u00a0is one of them.\u00a0 \u00a0 The company has a lot of work to do to live up to their valuations... and although the fundamentals scream its a sure short... Investors need to be very careful here. Tune in as I explain why.

There\u2019s a lot of \"funny money\" business going on around this time of year.

Today I'm joined by longtime friend - Marin Katusa, CEO & founder of Katusa Research. For any new listeners out there, I often bring Marin on the show as he is, hands-down, the most connected person in the mining industry. To start off the interview, Marin discusses the current states of gold, uranium and other resource sectors. As every investor should know, the dollar almost always moves\u00a0inversely\u00a0with the price of gold. For this reason, gold investments\u00a0are used\u00a0as a \"safe haven\" for investors around the globe. When markets become volatile and fears arise, gold is usually your best hedge. In the event of market downturns, gold prices surge... limiting your losses. Again... the dollar/gold inverse relationship has been the common rule of thumb for as long as I can remember... Marin claims, however, that 2017 will be a break for this historical pattern.\u00a0 And gives us a closer look as to why... Switching gears, we then talk about the geopolitical environment of one of the biggest trends today - Uranium. Through this analysis, Marin explains a huge angle of the Russia/ Trump story that nobody else is talking about... As a result, he shares with us one of the biggest secrets behind investing in Uranium this year. And tells listeners exactly where to avoid all Uranium investments. Then, the big announcement... Marin introduces listeners to another private placement\u00a0opportunity. Listen up as this is your chance to invest with some of the greatest investors in the world.

Keep the questions coming! \u00a0 The first topic of the day covers the inevitable... A recession. The business economy is one big cycle. Historically speaking, the markets expand, contract, and recover... over and over again. Where do we stand today? Well, theres been a lot of positives to takeaway from the markets recently... Let's take a closer look... Earnings are growing by 8% thus far for nearly 70% of S&amp;P 500 companies... Wages are growing at the highest rate since 2009... And now, due to the Trump administration - \u00a0we're looking at new regulations and a massive tax reform in the near future. Trump, so far, has sent shockwaves throughout the market but the dollar continues to strengthen. As I explain in the show, the possibility of a near economic down cycle is slim - and way further out than I initially expected. But let's get back to the point... a recession is inevitable. As investors, we want to stay aware of where the markets are heading. And although you don't need to worry about another crisis anytime soon, you always want to be prepared. So tune in as I tell listeners which stocks you need to own - during a recession, and while the market is falling. Then, after a slew of earnings releases this week, there's a few companies I wanted to go over... The first company I break down is Facebook (FB) - what I now like to call the \"the greatest company in the world.\" The social media giant just reported outstanding quarterly earnings by completely blowing estimates out of the water. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is like the Bill Gates of the 90's. Throughout my 20 years of financial research, I've never seen a company grow and dominate as quickly as Facebook has. Although we may see a slight pull back in the stock price in the coming weeks... I explain why the sky is the limit for this company. Chipotle (CMG), the other company I talk about on today's show,\u00a0experienced just the opposite as fas earnings go... The company reported a 76% decrease in profits compared to this quarter a year ago. Since the release, the stock price is down nearly 20 points! As investors, this might just be the drop we've been waiting for. Also, there's something I wanted to ask you (my subscribers)... We need your help.

I begin today's episode by covering one of the most talked about companies on Wall Street - Apple. Their earnings were just released, beating expectations across the board. And since the news, analysts' reactions have been overwhelmingly bullish. But I can't say I agree\u2026 And I'm not so sure about Apple's quarter being \"dynamic\" either. After doing some of my own digging, I've realized there are some underlying truths about Apple\u2019s 2016 end results... catalysts' that no one else cares to mention. Year-over-year, earnings have only grown 2% - mostly influenced by buybacks and a favorable tax rate. Yes, they blew expectations out of the water. But how much were earnings estimates lowered? Thus far, I've had a pretty good track record on covering this tech giant... and considering all of the noise surrounding this story - I have to warn my listeners. So, before my guest signs on, I'll be explaining why I'm not buying into all of the hype. Then, for today's main segment\u2026 I'll be introducing listeners to a stock that should 100% - be on everyone\u2019s radar. The following company has the potential to become the next \"market dominator.\" And shares are still selling for under $1. That\u2019s why I brought on today\u2019s guest, Garth Braun - President and CEO of Blackbird Energy (BBI.V). Garth's Blackbird Energy was by far, in my opinion, the most impressive company at last week's Vancouver Resource Investment Conference - which hosted over 200 names in the sector. Garth has done the unthinkable. And I was sold in less than 5 minutes of talking to him\u2026 Garth has taken Blackbird from a small, speculative explorer - to a $300 Million dollar company. And unlike most junior's in the sector, they don't just have a stake in the ground... waiting for a price-tag or an industry-leader acquisition... They are actually drilling and producing some of the finest natural-gas condensate in the world - located smack in the middle of the Montney Formation - Canada's next big energy bet. \"Over the last 18 months, some of the largest transactions in Canada, outside of the oil sands, have been located in this region.\" Industry leaders like Encana, Apache, Shell, and Sinopec now have holdings practically located in Blackbird's backyard. To make matters better, Garth was one of the first to discover this liquid-rich area. In 2014, he says, people considered this land as \"moose pasture.\" But it doesn't stop there\u2026 Due to the low priced oil market, Garth's team has been determined to innovate. And as a result, Blackbird Energy has made significant advancements. They've cut costs \"dramatically\" with state of the art technology. And experts are calling their innovations \"disruptive.\" Garth has clearly lead his company through an amazing transformation. Although the stock price is currently resting at 52-week highs, the recent jump has been well deserved. This is not meant to be a promotion. I truly believe this company has more upside potential than any other stock priced below $1. However, as we all know, rewards will come with risks. Stocks that are priced this low can still be very volatile - especially in the oil industry. So I\u2019m urging all listeners to do their own research. Still, Blackbird\u2019s story is one you don\u2019t want to miss. And finally, for today's Educational Segment, we're throwing stocks, finance, and economics out the door. I will be making one of boldest bets all year.", "duration": "01:19:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/sainvestorradio/WSU20EP20487.mp3?dest-id=11995", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 341813080, "seriesTitle": "Wall Street Unplugged with Frank Curzio - Your Best Source for Finance, Investing & Economics", "pubDate": 1485585247, "title": "Ep. 486: Frankly Speaking: How to invest on my recommendations", "author": "", "summary": "Welcome back to another episode\u2026 To start off today\u2019s stream of questions, I explain to listeners one of the biggest misconceptions in investing. The key to investing in any stock (not just the ones I recommend) comes down to just one simple trick - patience. Many listeners have learned the hard way so I wanted to fully address this once and for all. Its extremely important that investors take their time on placing their bets. Meaning, if you do believe in a stock's long-term position, don't make a FULL investment all on the same day. Tune in as I explain how this strategy is one of the best ways to avoid volatility in the markets. I guarantee your returns will see better results. I then revisit my position on a stock that's been beaten down tremendously. This stock was considered \"the darling\" of the biotech industry a little over a year ago. It went from being loved by analysts across the board, to now - hated. I\u2019ll be explaining why this biotech pioneer has the potential to rebound over the next 12 to 18 months. Moving on to the next question, I talk about one of today\u2019s biggest trends - Marijuana. David, a Colorado local, says the marijuana industry is booming and asks if now is the perfect time to invest... I couldn\u2019t disagree anymore. If you own any marijuana stocks, be sure to listen as I break down the sector. Although we\u2019ve seen a recent run-up in stock prices, I believe the industry will continue to face huge headwinds. These stocks are simply trades\u2026 NOT investments. And finally, to end the episode, it's Nike (NKE) vs. Under Armour (UA). Tune in as I pick my favorite out of the two for 2017. Other topics include: A sneak peek for next week's Wall Street Unplugged with CEO of BlackBird Energy, KKR's future earnings, and whether it\u2019s too late to get in on Northern Dynasty (NAK).

It's only January, but if you've followed me for the past few weeks, you've come to realize how important this month really is. I covered one key conference (CES2017) a couple weeks ago. And on today's episode, I have two more coming for you. It's a lot of information in only just a few weeks but bare with me... Each of these conferences come with game-changing announcements. To start, let\u2019s go over what a difference a year makes... Donald Trump is now in office, and the bull market continues to get stronger. In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit over 20,000 for the first time this week! This \u201cTrump rally\u201d has been strong for investors in every sector\u2026 except for one - Biotech. That\u2019s why I invited Marc\u2026 Marc is Chief Income Strategist at the Oxford Club, Editor of the Oxford Income Letter and host of the Oxford Club Radio podcast. He just got back from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. For those not familiar, the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference its like the Superbowl for healthcare, biotech, and pharmaceuticals. To start off the interview, Marc gives us his takeaways from the event. As Marc explains, the biotech sector has recently been facing a ton of headwinds. The sector currently faces a slew of new regulations as new administration takes the reigns. And in return, the biotech sector got a bit more complex. Although times are rough today, Marc breaks down his opportunistic outlook for the sector going forward. Investors must be patient as we are still in the \"early innings\" of biotech treatment Marc says. However, he adds that the demand for this sector will explode relatively soon. Together, we then break down the trends and stocks that are going to have the highest impact on the sector. These trends include big data and DNA sequencing. Also, before Marc signs off, he shares with us his favorite growth & income stock outside of the biotech sector. Then, for today's Educational Segment [39:31], I break down my visit to the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference - the largest junior mining conference in the world. The host and close friend, Marin Katusa, invited me to speak at the event. This is where it gets interesting\u2026 Out of the 5,000 people at this conference, not one person seemed to be bearish on the resource sector. What does that mean? ...It means I'm nervous. Let's not forget... Only 1 in 3,000 projects go from early stage development to actual production. To make matters worse, some of these stocks are already up 100%-300% from their lows yet people are still doubling their positions! But it's not all bad news. Although about 90% of these companies are terrible long-term investments, a few CEO's I met with were far from bluffing. Tune in as I introduce listeners to the few stocks that caught my attention. One is a stock that could potentially be the next Northern Dynasty!", "duration": "01:10:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/sainvestorradio/WSU20EP204852028EDITED20129.mp3?dest-id=11995", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 341813080, "seriesTitle": "Wall Street Unplugged with Frank Curzio - Your Best Source for Finance, Investing & Economics", "pubDate": 1484943987, "title": "Ep. 484: Frankly Speaking: Why we can't forget about the large-caps", "author": "", "summary": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking.

Also, my newsletter, Curzio Venture Opportunities, is approaching just its fourth month since launching in November. And it\u2019s been a wild ride ever since.

My next question covers today\u2019s main segment [17:16]. Since the Trump election, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time focusing on a variety of small-caps. But there are stocks we simply cannot forget, regardless of new policies... Most of these companies have been around for decades. Whether the market is up or down, these management teams have been through it all. I can guarantee it. More importantly, markets are cyclical. Which means plenty of well-known, safe stocks are still out there - just weeks away from rebounding. Today I share a few names I have in mind.

This week I\u2019m joined by Amir Adnani \u2013 CEO of\u00a0Uranium Energy Corp.\u00a0&\u00a0GoldMining Inc.\u00a0(formerly known as Brazil Resources) On today\u2019s show, Amir and I dive into one of the biggest topics in the markets right now \u2013 Uranium. If you own any Uranium stocks, or you\u2019re thinking about buying, this is a must-listen. Because for the first time in years, a new dawn for nuclear power is finally approaching. To start off the interview, Amir gives listeners 3 reasons why the \u201cperfect storm\u201d is on its way. We\u2019ve already seen a swing in prices and Uranium is trading at levels not seen since 2004. But let\u2019s not get too ahead of ourselves. Amir explains why investors must be patient. If you haven\u2019t bought into Uranium yet, don\u2019t worry. Although all signs are pointing upward, he say\u2019s companies are still in \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d \u2013 with current Uranium prices sitting at just $22/lb. The point is, however, the Uranium market is finally coming off it\u2019s lows. And we don\u2019t expect prices to return anytime soon. The turnaround is real. And demand expectations are promising\u2026 After all, the number of reactors under construction world-wide are at record levels! Tune in to hear everything you need to know about the sector. Amir and I then dive into a stock listeners should be very familiar with \u2013 GoldMining (BRI.V). Yes, we\u2019ve seen Gold take an unexpected hit since the Presidential election\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean investors should run. To end the episode, Amir reassures his investors. He explains how his company, GoldMining, plans to keep building on top of an already strong, overlooked balance sheet. And finally, I move on to my educational segment [54:33].

With all\u00a0the noise surrounding the internet these days, it's difficult to find a good financial research platform.

Sites I generally use for my own research. Some come with a cost and some are free, however, each of these sites have their own strength. Remember, this podcast is about you, not me. I highly recommend you check them out. Then, my next question covers a stock I am getting tons of feedback on - KKR & Co. LP (KKR). I recommended this stock just two weeks ago on my educational segment. And since then, it appears many subscribers are hesitant or concerned. Today, I'll be jumping back into the numbers - and will explain why there's\u00a0still massive upside potential. Also... I can't win them all. A couple months ago I made a mistake. I recommended a retailer just as the holiday season was picking up. And since then, the brick & mortar sector has been crushed. I'll admit my losses. However, I still believe this particular company is in way better shape than its competitors. Although I'm expecting a little more \"pain\" in the short-term, I still love their long-term position.

And for good reason\u2026 The CES is the host of nearly 4,000 technology companies\u2026 The space covers 2.2M square feet\u2026 And it takes me about half the day to walk through the entire event. From an investor stand point \u2013 this is the opportunity to witness these trends on the launch pad, firsthand. And investing in the right stocks within these megatrends can result in massive gains. But here\u2019s the thing. The trick to investing in this sector is all about knowing\u00a0which trends to avoid\u2026 There\u2019s one vital question we all must ask ourselves before we place our bets. \u201cDo these tech-trends actually serve a consumer need?\u201d If consumer adaptability is far out of reach. And if earnings are already dropping \u2013 As investors, why aren\u2019t we looking elsewhere? To start off today\u2019s episode, I\u2019ll be diving in on 3 tech trends every investor must avoid. I have\u00a0the numbers to back it up. Then, tune in to hear the ideas I actually do believe in. These new technologies are already implemented by the biggest names in the industry. Listeners will hear examples of each trend and how they can\u00a0directly impact the consumer. Get your pens ready. To end the episode, I\u2019ll be sharing\u00a0the best plays in the sector \u2013 A list of stocks that have already secured their seat for the future.", "duration": "52:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/53/ee/36/53ee3625-0f02-dd17-20ee-fc3c43e24b79/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/sainvestorradio/WSU20Ep.2047720-20Tech20Trends20and20CES.mp3?dest-id=11995", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 341813080, "seriesTitle": "Wall Street Unplugged with Frank Curzio - Your Best Source for Finance, Investing & Economics", "pubDate": 1482539303, "title": "Ep. 476: Frankly Speaking", "author": "", "summary": "Keep the questions coming!

And an event that investors cannot miss. Before today's guest signs on, I'll be giving listeners an exclusive sneak-peek. The announcements of these \"exponential growth technologies\" create once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.

Then, for today's main segment, I'm joined by longtime friend, Meb Faber - best selling author,\u00a0entrepreneur, and Chief Investment Officer/ Portfolio Manager at Cambria Investment Management. The dollar is surging, the market continues to hit all-time highs, and we've seen one of the longest lasting bull markets in decades... Meb is a numbers guy. A research junkie. His evaluation methodologies are far from the norm... He calls it the Shiller CAPE ratio. Not only does he claim future expected returns are going to be lowered, he has the numbers to prove it. The markets are getting more expensive. And as a result, the chances of finding \"cheap uptrends\" are getting slimmer. As Meb explains, investors need to take a step back... \"Every investor should have at least half of their stocks outside the US\" he says. Using the CAPE ratio, Meb has managed to find a couple markets that have the \"cheap upside\" investors are looking for. Tune in to hear what they are... Then, to sum up the episode, Meb gives listeners his 3 steps to the ideal, global market portfolio.

John provides listeners with a step-by-step market review \u2013 leading us all the way to today\u2019s rally. Oil prices hit 10-year lows\u2026 gold had its best 1st quarter in 30 years\u2026 \u201cmacro\u201d events like Brexit, and the Election \u2013 all have had their place in this years economic roller-coaster. As investors, there are many lessons we must carry-over into the new year. Tune in to hear why John and I are approaching 2017 much differently than last year. Also, It\u2019s about time\u2026 The Fed finally raised interest rates \u2013 squeezing in one hike in a year that was supposed to have four. What now? As John says, the biggest question lies behind the \u201clanguage\u201d of the Fed going forward. He explains why investors need to be cautious if interest rates rise faster than expected. Switching gears, John shares with us the biggest post-election headwind for several S&amp;P 500 companies. A tax reform is on it\u2019s way\u2026 but that does not mean these stocks are off the hook. This is why I love bringing John on the show. He can give listeners insight on just about any topic. To end the episode, John gets on a roll \u2013 giving his outlook on a wealth of sectors.
