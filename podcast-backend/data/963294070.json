Before you head into the weekend, make this last stop to get the insight you need to equip you on your journey toward success.\nDon\u2019t get comfortable in your business! \nEverything in our culture screams at us to get comfortable as quickly as possible and for as long as possible.

Scott has your back. He looks for every bit of advice, tips, scenarios, and insights that will help you excel in your business. Because of his diligence and networking abilities, Scott came across a helpful blog post from Jeff Cohen and his team. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott and Jeff go over the tools you need to leverage your marketing list, how to garner reviews for your product, and how to go from good to great levels of success. You don\u2019t want to miss this powerful and practical episode! \n\nImagine, you have some products that have been slow or nearly impossible to move and Amazon is letting you know that you have an increase in storage fees coming. Should you pay it? Can you liquidate it? What do you do? Jeff Cohen came across a similar scenario when he heard from one of his clients. That client proceeded to utilize \u201cSnagshout\u201d and successfully liquidated his product, made money, and sold additional products in the process. If you are facing a similar situation or you just want the peace of mind by having the tools necessary to tackle it if it comes up, you came to the right place!\n\nOn this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott sits down with business leader Jeff Cohen. Part of their conversation touched on garnering reviews for Amazon products. Jeff gives some helpful tips to keep in mind when trying to accumulate a good number of reviews.\n\n \tDon\u2019t ask for a review if the product was purchased at a very heavy discount. \n \tYou cannot ask the buyer for a positive review. \n \tYou cannot tell the buyer what to write in the review. No examples of a perfect review.\n\nListen to this episode to get more useful tips and insights from Jeff! \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSometimes the easiest solution to a lot of problems is sitting right in front of you. Why not use the tools you have and the resources at your fingertips to solve issues you run into? Jeff Cohen points out that one of the greatest advantages to building a marketing list and cultivating a brand following is leveraging that when the time comes to liquidate products. He suggests that if you need to liquidate products quickly, offer them at a great discount to your brand following. It makes them feel special and it solves your problem. It\u2019s a win, win! To hear Jeff expand on this thought further, make sure to listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller! \n\nIt has been said that the enemy of doing something great isn\u2019t doing something poorly, it\u2019s settling for good. Where are you settling for good rather than pushing for great in your business? One area to be aware of according to Jeff Cohen is your storage fees through Amazon.

After years of building a thriving eCommerce business, Steve decided to take his insights and knowledge to help others get started in this booming industry. The primary way Steve is imparting his knowledge is by organizing high-quality and high-value conferences. Don\u2019t check out at the thought of attending a conference.

What makes a conference stand out from all the rest? Avid conference attendee and business leader Steve Chou has learned over the years what makes a great conference. In recent years, he has turned to organizing conferences that stay small and intimate. Steve is convinced that the most value a person can get out of a conference lies in WHO they interact with. Information is wonderful and it\u2019s an important feature but getting to know someone and bouncing ideas off of them is one of the most valuable yet underrated keys to a successful conference experience. \n\nEveryone has been there, you went to a conference to get a jumpstart to your business and yet days or weeks later you still haven\u2019t taken any action on what you learned. How do you apply the information you receive from eCommerce conferences? Conference organizer and business leader Steve Chou suggests finding someone who will hold you accountable. Maybe this is someone you meet at the conference, maybe it's a family member or business associate. The key point here is, you need someone who will check in and hold you to implementing the information you gathered at a conference. \n\nThere are many people curious about and trying to get started in eCommerce. Is eCommerce still a viable industry to start a business in? Is it worth taking the time to explore and invest in? Entrepreneur Steve Chou is convinced that the best is yet to come regarding eCommerce. He says that eCommerce is still just a small fraction of overall sales.

How great would it be to hear from someone who has recently found the success you are looking for? You might be wondering what does selling online look like, how can you get started? You\u2019ve come to the right place! On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott sits down with Gary and Kim Rey who went from zero to one million dollars in sales all through Retail Arbitrage and Online Arbitrage via Fulfillment By Amazon. You will hear how they got started, how they divide the labor and some of their best practices and tips that you can implement today! Don\u2019t let any more excuses keep you from pursuing success, take action!\nRetail Arbitrage and Online Arbitrage - what is the difference? \nLingo and insider verbiage can be very confusing. You might be afraid to ask or maybe you forgot so here is a quick recap of what Retail and Online Arbitrage are. Retail Arbitrage is surveying retail stores to find products that there is a demand for on Amazon. Online Arbitrage is the same thing but it\u2019s all done online, no physical shopping in the retail stores. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, you will hear from a husband and wife team. Gary enjoys OA and his wife Kim enjoys RA. Don\u2019t miss the lessons you can learn from their recent success!\nRetail Arbitrage is a great way to get started with selling online. \nYou know you want to get started with selling online but you aren\u2019t sure what route to take. Should you start with Retail Arbitrage (RA) or Online Arbitrage (OA) or something else? Kim Rey found that starting off with RA was really helpful for her. Kim started by buying just a few extra items here and there when she was out shopping. She would look at the profit that she would be able to make on each item and decide from there. Her strategy has changed over time but she found this to be a great way to get started. Find out what you can learn from Kim and her husband Gary\u2019s experience on this episode of The Amazing Seller! \u00a0\nIf it\u2019s not broken, don\u2019t fix it. Selling on Amazon using existing listings. \nSelling online can be very intimidating. There is a lot of different strategies and lingo to wrap your mind around and you are nervous about losing your money and failing. This is one of the reasons Scott invited Gary and Kim Rey on the show today. Gary and Kim have successfully learned and streamlined an approach to Retail Arbitrage (RA) and Online Arbitrage (OA) that works for them. They don\u2019t even get involved with creating their own listings on Amazon. \u00a0Gary and Kim simply find products that are performing well and that they can get at a low price and then post those products to existing listings on Amazon. This may not work for everyone but it does simplify the process. To hear more about Gary and Kim\u2019s story, make sure to listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller! \nDon\u2019t let your personal preferences influence what you buy and sell. \nYou\u2019ve heard it said that \u201cYou are your own worst enemy.\u201d Gary and Kim Rey would agree with that statement. They have been highly successful engaging in Retail Arbitrage (RA) and Online Arbitrage (OA) over the last couple of years. One of their biggest tips when getting started with RA and OA is to avoid personal bias. Even if you cringe at the thought of black nail polish, don\u2019t let that keep you from researching the price and possibly making a big profit. They\u2019ve learned over the years that there are many different and niche interests in the marketplace and if they can learn and adapt to these interests, they will be more successful for it.

Don\u2019t give up! You need experienced and thorough experts that can help you navigate complicated waters. Scott and his team at The Amazing Seller have gone through all the tough and \u201cin the weeds\u201d details so don\u2019t have to! Let Scott and Chris guide you on this episode as they break down the UPC code debate, where to get UPCs, and other great business advice! Rest assured, you came to the right place.\nWhat are your options when obtaining a UPC for your product? \nIf you are just getting started with selling on Amazon, a lot of the recent talk about UPCs can get really confusing. What you need to know is that UPCs are essential to selling your product on Amazon and with other retailers. You might be wondering, \u201cWhere do I get a UPC for my product?\u201d You can get a UPC from GS1 or other Third party providers such as Snap. The big difference between these two options is that GS1 gives you ownership of your UPC. They create the unique UPC and hand it to you for a cost. Most third party providers like Snap obtain the first few digits of the UPC from GS1 and then generate the rest. You can verify via GS1 the UPCs that you obtain from Third parties to make sure you are compliant with Amazon\u2019s standards. This might all sound very confusing but Scott and Chris take the time on this episode of The Amazing Seller to break down what this all means and how it directly impacts business owners like you. \nWhat you need to know regarding Amazon\u2019s policy with UPCs\nLet\u2019s cut through all the jargon and get to the clear cut information that you need to make sure you are compliant with Amazon\u2019s standards. The last thing you want is to go into selling with Amazon or continuing to sell with them and go off of the wrong information. So here is what Amazon wants you to know regarding their recent change in UPC policy: \n\n\u201cWe verify the authenticity of product UPCs by checking the GS1 database. UPCs that do not match the information provided by GS1 will be considered invalid. We recommend obtaining you UPCs directly from GS1 and not from other 3rd parties selling UPC licenses to ensure that the appropriate information is reflected in the GS1 database.\u201d\n\nThis means that you CAN continue to get UPCs from 3rd parties but they MUST be verified via GS1. Anyone can verify a UPC through GS1. Don\u2019t panic if your UPC is provided by a party like Snap. Just double check to make sure it is valid via GS1. If it\u2019s not, there are steps you can take to address this. To hear Scott and Chris expand on this topic, listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller. \nKey advice when you are just beginning your business. \nLots of people come out of the woodwork when you start a business to share in your excitement and give you their advice. How do you determine which voices to listen to? It\u2019s kind of like parenting in a lot of ways. When you first find out that you and your spouse are expecting, everyone wants to chime in on how you should start off as new parents.

You can set up some kind of side job or side hustle to start earning some extra income that you can put into the start of an Amazon business. On the show today is Nick Loper, host of The Side Hustle Show to talk about different side income ideas that you can build that could launch your online business dreams.\nBut I don\u2019t have time to start a side hustle!\nTime is the one common denominator among every one of us. We all get 24 hours and what we choose to do with that time is what matters. On this episode of the podcast, Scott asked Nick Loper what he would say to a person who says they don\u2019t have enough time and his advice was golden. If you\u2019d like to hear what Nick said in answer to that question AND get some side hustle ideas of your own to try out, you\u2019ve got to listen to this conversation.\nIf you want it bad enough you\u2019ll find a way to do it.\nWhen Nick Loper and Scott were talking about the time crunch we all feel when it comes to making a side hustle or other online opportunity work, they both came to the same conclusion.

It\u2019s the people who take action who see success. Find out more about Nick\u2019s approach to carving out the time to build side income, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nMake extra money by buying low and selling high using flea markets, garage sales, etc.\nOne of the ideas Nick Loper had about how people could begin building side income to help fuel their Amazon private label dreams was to find things at flea markets that you can sell for more on eBay, Amazon retail arbitrage, or other places. It\u2019s an amazingly simple thing to do with just a little bit of research and know-how. And guess what, Nick is on the show today to give you some of that knowledge, so what are you waiting for?\nAre you interested in making your first $1000 quickly to get a private label business started?\nScott and his buddy Dom Sugar have been brainstorming a way to help you get a start even though you don\u2019t have any money to put toward a traditional private label launch.

On this episode, Scott shares a good deal in the way of updates on his own family and personal life to show you how integrated life has to be with your business if you\u2019re going to be truly fulfilled. In the midst of telling his stories, Scott highlights the importance of finishing what you start and how that kind of commitment will fuel in you in life and in business. It\u2019s just one example of how The Amazing Seller is about more than the money - it\u2019s about a great life.\nAre there certain states that are better for entrepreneurs?\nIf you spend even a little bit of time in the online entrepreneurial space you\u2019ll discover that there are certain places in the country that entrepreneurs seem to be drawn to. Two of those places are San Diego and San Francisco. But are there other places that are good locations for entrepreneurs to hang out and network? A listener to the show is moving soon and wants to consider these kinds of issues when he makes the decision about where he\u2019s going to live - and he wanted Scott\u2019s opinion. Be sure to listen to hear how YOU can help answer this question!\nWhen I order products from another country what format should my invoices be in?\nIn past episodes, Scott has mentioned that it\u2019s vitally important that you have the documentation you need from your overseas supplier to verify what you purchased, etc. It\u2019s important not just for your records and peace of mind but also because of issues that can arise regarding customs, product specs, etc. It\u2019s much better to be safe rather than sorry, so doing the legwork to get the right paperwork from the outset is worth it. You can hear Scott describe the kind of things your paperwork should contain, on this episode of The Amazing Seller. \nWhat is it that makes a private label product truly \u201cprivate label?\u201d\nA listener who is fairly new to selling private label products is coming at it very carefully because he\u2019s done numerous online business opportunities in the past that have not all worked out. He\u2019s heard a lot about private label sales and wants to make sure he\u2019s understanding the concept correctly - and know how to approach it wisely. Scott is very impressed with this guy\u2019s thoroughness and spends a little extra time unpacking some of the nuances of private label sales, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nDo you want to ask an experienced seller your eCommerce or private label questions?\nThe Ask Scott session of The Amazing Seller podcast is your chance to ask an experienced, street-wise Amazon and eCommerce seller your situation-specific questions. You can ask about anything - mailing lists, product selection, PPC, off-Amazon sales and websites, and much more. Don\u2019t be shy.

On this hot seat episode, Scott and Chris are chatting about a hot seat product where both those rankings have dropped 20% since last year. That\u2019s a significant loss of revenue and the seller wants to fix the problem! You can\u2019t blame him - and Scott and Chris have some great insights into why it\u2019s happening and how the problem could be addressed. It\u2019s all on this episode.\nIf Amazon asks you to be THEIR vendor, should you jump at the chance?\nThe hot seat participant in today\u2019s episode of the podcast has an established wholesale brand that he\u2019s been selling on Amazon and fulfilling himself (through his company). Amazon has seen his success and has approached him about being a vendor for them - meaning he\u2019d sell directly to Amazon and they would purchase at a wholesale rate. There are all kinds of pluses to doing that, but there are also some cons you want to be aware of. The guys go over the pros and cons in depth on this episode.\nWhen your private label sales drop by 20% - what\u2019s the problem and how do you fix it?\nAnytime a product that has been successfully selling drops in sales by 20%, you should be concerned. That\u2019s what happened to this episode\u2019s \u201chot seat\u201d participant and he\u2019s asking Scott and Chris to help him figure out what changed. You\u2019ll hear the guys talk about all kinds of possibilities and pinpoint one thing in particular that is the most likely culprit. It\u2019s a great episode that addresses a number of things so be sure you make the time to listen.\nIs being eligible for Amazon Prime an important part of getting sales?\nThere\u2019s no question that private label sellers who connect with the Amazon Prime feature by fulfilling through Amazon are at a HUGE advantage. Not only does it appear more professional, but anyone who has Amazon Prime can order your products and receive them with free shipping and free returns if they have issues with the product. That means there is a lot more motivation for them to choose your product over another. Find out how this seller is making the decision about getting listed with FBA, on this episode.\nHow do you test keywords to see what is best for your products?\nIf you are trying to optimize your product listing for the best keywords (and you should) then you\u2019ll want to systematically test all the possible keywords for your product to ensure that you\u2019re using the actual keywords and phrases buyers are using to find products like yours. How do you do that? You have to use the Amazon PPC (pay per click) promotions to drill down into what buyers are actually using to find your products. That\u2019s the only way, and it does cost some money, but if you do it right it will yield great results. How do you do it right? Scott and Chris cover that on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[3:42] The situation that\u2019s on the hot seat today!\n \t[5:20] Pros and Cons of Amazon approaching you to be THEIR vendor.\n \t[10:50] Sales have dropped 20% and search rank has dropped.

There are all kinds of issues that you have to be aware of including export licenses, taxes, when ownership of the products transfers to you (thus in indicating your liability), customs fees, and more. You can walk that path yourself or you can have someone help you. Scott definitely advises the later. Find out how it works on this great episode where Scott is chatting with Ryan Peterson, of Flexport.\nHow Ryan started thinking about creating a freight forwarding company.\nIt\u2019s often the pain we experience ourselves that prompts us, entrepreneurs, to build something to solve that problem. That\u2019s how it was for today\u2019s guest, Ryan Peterson. Ryan had experienced some issues with his supplier and the sea shipping options that not only cost him a lot of money through fees and delays but also didn\u2019t allow him to keep his products in stock as easily as he expected. He\u2019d already worked in the overseas markets and figured he might be the guy to figure out some better systems to make things happen smoothly for others. Flexport is his solution. Find out more about Ryan and the Flexport story on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nProduct shipping issues can trip up your sales pipeline in a number of ways.\nOne of the many problems Ryan Peterson ran into that caused him to build the Flexport solution for purchasers of overseas products was regarding timing. What he discovered was that everything had to legally be done in a certain sequence. If it wasn\u2019t, and his product was shipped before a certain requirement was met, the shipping company would charge him daily fees for having his products \u201cstored\u201d at their facility. It\u2019s just one example of the kinds of headaches it can be to ship by sea. But there are answers and Ryan has built the solution, which you can hear about on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhen it comes to dealing with overseas shipping, make sure you understand the terms.\nThere are all kinds of acronyms and terms used in the sea shipping and freight forwarding that can get you confused. And if you choose the wrong options, thinking they are the right option (which is not entirely unheard of) you can wind up paying lots of money in the form of customs fees and taxes that you really didn\u2019t have to pay. So how do you navigate a field of landmines like that? You need someone to guide you - and on this episode of the podcast, Scott has just the guy - Ryan Peterson of Flexport. \nHow are you going to deal with your freight issues for private label products?\nIf you\u2019re sourcing your products from overseas - China in particular - you are going to have to decide how you are going to handle your shipping issues. You can do it yourself. It\u2019s possible, but you have to know what you\u2019re doing. Or you can hire a company to be the go-between and the one to ensure all steps are being followed properly. To help you make that decision Scott\u2019s brought on an expert from the freight forwarding industry to help you understand the pros and cons of each option - and hopefully to make a good decision for your situation.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast and his gust, Ryan Peterson!\n \t[3:50] Ryan\u2019s story and how he build a freight forwarding company.\n \t[6:26] Why issues are always changing in the private label and ecommerce world.\n \t[8:20] Why Ryan wanted to create his own system and company for freight forwarding.\n \t[13:38] The main things to watch out for when it comes to sea shipping.\n \t[17:30] The logistical differences between freight forwarders and parcel post shippers.\n \t[21:58] The freight forwarder\u2019s job to bring all companies and processes together.\n \t[24:54] One of the main things that hangs up sellers who order from China.\n \t[29:55] The Flexport solution to these complicated issues.", "duration": "49:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS308.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1484299820, "title": "TAS 307 : Ask Scott Session #93 \u2013 Inventory Money \u2013 Defective Products \u2013 Bundles \u2013 RA to PL Seller", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Establishing and running a successful eCommerce business is a challenge for anyone - no matter how experienced or talented you are.

You\u2019ll hear him deal with all kinds of issues - from getting started to pivoting into bigger and better ideas outside of Amazon. You\u2019ve got to hear this one, it\u2019s got some great questions and good answers.\nCash flow for a new eCommerce business: How do you do it well?\nGetting started with private label sales is not an easy thing, especially if cash is tight. But even if you have a lump of cash to start with you have to be able to stimulate sales in a way that keeps your cash flow consistent. If you can\u2019t do that you\u2019re going to run into all kinds of problems keeping inventory available, which in turn causes your search engine rankings to be inconsistent. If you want to hear Scott\u2019s advice about managing cash flow, including some cool software or app ideas, be sure you take the time to listen.\nI got damaged custom merchandise from my supplier, should I return it?\nA listener called in to ask a very interesting question on this episode. He received some customized products from his supplier but they are damaged. He\u2019s not typically shy about returning defective or damaged products but in this case, since they have his logo on them, he\u2019s concerned about returning them. Why? Because he can envision the supplier fixing them, then selling them on Amazon themselves, bringing disrepute to his brand. What can he do? Find out how Scott suggests he avoid that possibility, on this episode.\nHow to optimize a product bundle effectively.\nYou\u2019ve heard Scott talk a lot about creating product bundles to build a second listing on Amazon that can generate cash flow. There are all kinds of benefits to it, including the ability to rank for a different set of keywords than your original product. But that won\u2019t happen if you don\u2019t optimize the bundle listing well. On this episode, Scott answers a question about bundling complementary products and optimizing that new listing, and there are all kinds of tips he gives to help you do it right. You\u2019ll want to hear this one. \nWhat are the best ways to move from retail arbitrage into private label sales?\nIf you\u2019ve ever sold products using the retail arbitrage model you know that it\u2019s not a model that you can scale very well, simply because your product supply is inconsistent. You can\u2019t expect to build a business on somebody else\u2019s brand. So how can you make the switch from retail arb to private label sales? A caller asks for Scott\u2019s advice about that very thing on this episode and Scott gives 3 free resources he can tap into to teach him the step by step process to get it done. Are you interested?

Find out how on this episode.\nMany entrepreneurs (most entrepreneurs, really) don\u2019t like the idea of handing off responsibilities within the business to others, especially people they don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s one of the things that has to be done if you are going to scale your business and realize more profits. Outsourcing is one of the ways you can do that and on this episode, Scott and his guest John Jonas talk about how to outsource the smart way without breaking the bank. You are going to get a ton of value from this episode.\nDealing with a VA from another culture is a skill anyone can learn.\nOne of the things John Jonas has discovered as he\u2019s worked with VAs from the Philippines, in particular, is that every culture has its own norms. For example, workers from the Philippines are very loyal and eager to please. But they tend to need a very clear set of instructions and a boss who will continue check in with them to ensure they understand their tasks - until those tasks are being performed flawlessly. If you can learn how to patiently train the person who works for you, you\u2019ll be able to find a long-term VA or assistant who will provide tons of value to your company. Find out more on this episode.\nWhat are the small things that are consuming your time? Pass them to someone else for greater effectiveness.\nIs social media eating up your time? Are emails and product research gobbling up hours that you could be working on more important things? You\u2019re not alone. Many eCommerce sellers find themselves bogged down in the details - but there IS hope. You can find a very competent, foreign worker who can take the load off of you by taking on your low-value tasks that have to be done - so that you don\u2019t have to do them. Find out how it works and how you can make it happen on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast about getting help!\n \t[1:39] My introduction of John Jonas, my expert guest on this subject.\n \t[4:29] John\u2019s story of getting into outsourcing and finding help.\n \t[9:11] How John learned the best way to train his help (using Amazon Private Label).\n \t[19:32] The obstacles and hurdles John says you should watch out for.\n \t[25:10] Communicating well with Philippine workers you hire.\n \t[26:15] How to handle insurance, taxes. etc. with foreign workers.\n \t[28:40] Paying foreign workers with the right systems.\n \t[30:00] How to find the right VA for your situation (how John created his service).\n \t[37:38] Determining if you need or want part time or full time help.\n \t[42:48] Assessing your own needs and moving forward to find the help you need.", "duration": "54:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS306.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1483954202, "title": "TAS 305 : INCOME Update and Future Plans for TAS (Mission 2017)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "You never know what\u2019s going to happen when you start something. Things can go way beyond what you thought would happen - which is exactly where things have gone for Scott Voelker. It\u2019s been awhile since Scott has shared an update on his personal brands and progress as an Amazon private label seller, so this episode is going to do that. But he\u2019s also got some plans for the new year regarding how he\u2019s helping other people learn how to build their private label business. If you want to hear how Scott has been doing in his business and what he\u2019s set as a goal for you this next year, be sure to listen!\nWeird things happen when the spotlight shines on you.\nScott never imagined that the TAS brand and movement would become so big. When he first started his own Amazon sales business he only wanted to generate income for himself and his family. But the more he worked on things the more he came to see that what he was learning was of value to so many people - he just had to share it. That\u2019s how the podcast and his workshops came to be and the rest is an unbelievable piece of history. But with that kind of notoriety comes some weirdness. People don\u2019t always respond well. On this episode, Scott talks a bit about how he\u2019s been received and what he\u2019s learning about the things you experience on the path to success.\nWhy Scott never wants to be a guy who doesn\u2019t do what he\u2019s teaching others to do.\nOver the past year, there have been a few people accusing Scott Voelker of being a \u201cteach but not do\u201d sort of internet guru. They think he\u2019s phased out of selling on Amazon himself but is still making money from teaching others how to sell on Amazon. Nothing could be further from the truth. On this episode, Scott pulls back the curtain to show you what he\u2019s doing in his own sales business and gives you the reasons that he NEVER wants to teach something that he\u2019s not personally doing. It\u2019s great insight into the character behind the TAS brand.\nWhy you have to just start. No excuses.\nScott Voelker has often said, \u201cJust start.\u201d He knows that unless you get moving, you\u2019ll never have a chance of getting anywhere. That\u2019s why he\u2019s continued to stress the importance of taking action now before you get scared away or find a reason to give in to your personal insecurities that tell you, you can't do it. You\u2019ve got to take action if you\u2019re going to change your life for the better. Sure, there is a bit of risk involved but the potential rewards are far beyond what most people imagine. Scott\u2019s got a bit of a pep talk for you on this episode about what it takes to get started and why you should - so be sure you listen.\nScott\u2019s goal: Help 500 people earn $1000 per month.\nEvery new year most people in the entrepreneurial space set goals for their business. Scott is no different. He\u2019s got personal goals for his income and sales numbers but he\u2019s also got some goals for what he wants to do through The Amazing Seller podcast and brand. On this episode, Scott Voelker tells how he\u2019s come up with the mission of helping 500 people make $1000 per month through eCommerce and online sales - and why it\u2019s important for the trajectory of what he\u2019s doing as an Amazon coach and consultant.

You can connect with Scott Voelker to ask your own Amazon or eCommerce related questions. It could be anything: product selection, email marketing, list building, website issues, really - anything. When you do, Scott will answer them on the podcast for everyone to hear. And when you ask your question be sure you leave your name so Scott can thank you personally and refer to you directly. For now, listen to this episode to hear Scott\u2019s answers to the questions of other eCommerce sellers.\nBeing an entrepreneur is a life of ups and downs. Get used to it and get fueled by it.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for people who are trying to build an eCommerce or another type of business to be discouraged often. That\u2019s because any time you\u2019re trying to build something great you\u2019re going to run into resistance. It\u2019s just the way life is. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott has a pep talk for you about how to deal with the discouragements that will inevitably come and how you can turn them to your advantage for greater success. That\u2019s something you could use, isn\u2019t it? Be sure you take the time to hear this episode.\nWhat is the best way to use product discounts in conjunction with review requests?\nA listener called in to ask Scott about a particular approach to seeking reviews in conjunction with offering a discount code. He doesn\u2019t exactly want to offer the discount in exchange for the review - that would be a violation of Amazon\u2019s policy - but he does want to couple the two together. Is it a strategy that would actually work? Even more importantly, is it something Amazon would even allow without penalizing the seller in some way? You can hear Scott\u2019s response to this creative strategy on this episode.\nI noticed that a certain product on page two is selling more than those on page 1. What\u2019s up?\nAn Amazon seller who is doing product research has noticed something a bit unexpected. There are products that are showing up on page 2 of the search results that are actually selling more products than the products on page 1 of the search results. How can that be? Doesn\u2019t Amazon weight the search results in favor of those products that are selling more? Why would a higher seller be on page 2? Scott\u2019s got some theories about what might be happening in this situation and he\u2019s going to tell you what he thinks about it on this episode.\nWhy you don\u2019t have to start big on Amazon private label.\nWhen you are considering a business selling private label products on Amazon you may be a bit intimidated because you think you\u2019ve got to put a lot of money into it at the beginning. But actually, there are advantages to NOT putting in a ton of money at the start. That way you can test a market, validate that there is good potential for sales, and get your feet wet a little bit at a time - learning how the entire process works. If you want to learn how to do it Scott has some great resources to share with you so make sure you take the time to listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[1:47] Be realistic about the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial process.\n \t[6:04] QUESTION ONE: Can we give a 100% code in the same email where we ask for a product review?\n \t[13:33] QUESTION TWO: How do product sales relate to page ranking?\n \t[19:02] QUESTION THREE: When starting out can I start small to test and validate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 304\nTAS 304 : Ask Scott Session #92 - Your Business and Marketing Questions\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

Her goal was to build a hobby business and it swelled into so much more. Find out how Sophie did it and how her story could help you build your business, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nThe amazing true story of a hobby business turned 7 figures within 2 years.\nWhat is your goal for your Amazon business? In other words, what is the REASON you are doing it? It\u2019s got to be about more than just making money. Today\u2019s guest is Sophie Howard, a resident of New Zealand who started her Amazon private label business in order to provide for the lifestyle she and her family wanted.

You\u2019re going to be inspired by her tenacity and drive and see how her success could be yours as well.\nHow Sophie researched her niche - it was an intense process.\nAs you\u2019ve learned from previous episodes of The Amazing Seller, product and market research is a very necessary part of the private label sales process. If you don\u2019t make a good choice at the beginning you may be stuck with a struggle for the lifetime of the product. Sophie Howard took that very seriously because she not only wanted to have a successful product, she also wanted to be confident that success was around the corner. And successful is exactly what she was, selling her business for 7 figures in just two years. You can hear what Sophie did to research her products and find the very best fit for her products in her market, on this episode.\nThe power of joining Facebook groups surrounding your product niche.\nOne of the ways that Sophie did product and market research was to join a number of Facebook groups that were centered around her product niche. She became a familiar face in the groups, asked questions, listened and took part in the conversations going on, and discovered what people who were already highly interested in that market were naturally interested in. She discovered through those relationships where there were gaps in the market that she could fill. If you want to hear the specifics, you can by listening to this great episode.\neCommerce is changing so fast if you don\u2019t enjoy learning you won\u2019t enjoy eCommerce.\nSophie Howard is a great example of the kind of person who does well in the eCommerce space. She\u2019s an avid learner and isn\u2019t afraid to jump in and find out how things work. She believes that you have to be eager to learn or else the eCommerce world will be a source of constant frustration for you - because it\u2019s always changing and will continue to do so.

But it\u2019s not only reserved for the new year, you should do planning and goal setting anytime you notice the need. On this episode, Scott walks through his own planning process for setting goals and accomplishing them. His process involves asking the right questions, planning backward, and pushing himself to go a bit farther than he thinks he can. You\u2019ll benefit from hearing what Scott does so grab your notepad and pencil and take some great notes!\nIf you\u2019re going to accomplish what you want, you\u2019ve got to plan to do it.\nOne of the things Scott has noticed is that many people have wishes or hopes for what their life could be like, but very few people actually take the steps needed to ensure that their hopes become reality. It doesn\u2019t make sense but it\u2019s true. If you want to accomplish something you\u2019ve got to be willing to create a plan for achieving it - and then you\u2019ve got to be willing to take steps to make it happen. On this episode, Scott\u2019s walking through his personal planning process as an example for you to follow in creating your own goals and planning to achieve them. \nThe goals you shoot for depend on the questions you ask yourself.\nIt\u2019s very important in any business to create goals, but the success you have in developing the right goals depends on the KINDS of questions you ask yourself - and the WAY the questions are phrased make a lot of difference. On this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast, Scott is going to show you how the right questions can lead to bigger goals and a more spectacular accomplishment of them. You won\u2019t want to miss this simple but powerful tweak that can help you set and attain the goals you really want.\nBackward planning is the best way to ensure that you\u2019re going to get to your goals.\nOnce you\u2019ve got your goals in place - once you can clearly see what you want to attain - you\u2019ve got to devise a very clear plan of action for how you will accomplish those goals. The best way Scott has found to do this is to start with the goal itself and work backward. Take one step back, just prior to accomplishing the finished goal and clearly outline what that place will look like. Then take one step backward from there and do the same thing. Keep going until you get all the way back to where you currently are. What you have before you at that point is a clear action plan that will take you step by step to your goal. Now it\u2019s time to get busy by applying it to a timeline. Find out how Scott does it on this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast.\nWhy you need to create a 3-year vision for what you want your business to look like.\nDo know really know what you\u2019re headed towards? It\u2019s not just about monetary goals and business success - it\u2019s about the KIND of company you want to run, the types of relationships you want to have, the quality of life that you want your family to enjoy, and more. On this episode of the podcast, Scott highlights the importance of having a 3-year vision for where you are headed and why it can be a powerful catalyst for your forward motion and the accomplishment of your goals. You should take the time to listen. You\u2019ll have a bigger vision and a more exciting motivation to reach your goals if you do.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast about vision and planning!\n \t[4:21] The tools you\u2019ll need to create your vision and action plan.\n \t[7:00] Getting started by asking the right questions to discover your goals.\n \t[13:47] Ask yourself specific questions about your goals.\n \t[15:30] Working backwards from your goals to create your plan.\n \t[20:00] Use a calendar to create your 90 day plan and 30 day sprints.\n \t[25:25] Create a 3 year vision for your company and life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 302", "duration": "34:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS302.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1483090220, "title": "TAS 301 : Ask Scott Session #91 \u2013 Your Business and Marketing Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "What\u2019s the latest sticking point in your Amazon or eCommerce business moving forward? Are you having trouble with product selection? Are there questions about using the Amazon dashboard or backend? Maybe it has to do with list-building or sales funnels. This is the Friday episode of The Amazing Seller podcast where you can ask your questions about eCommerce and private label sales on Amazon - and Scott Voelker is the guy who will answer your questions on the episode.\nIs it helpful to include a product video on my Amazon listing?\nOne of the newest things the Amazon platform offers to private label sellers is the opportunity to create an enhanced product listing. You have to brand register your products to have the option but it allows you to adjust and improve your listing in lots of ways. One of those way is the inclusion of a product video to show more of the benefits and features of your products. But is it always a good idea? And if it is beneficial, what improvements in ranking and sales should you expect to see as a result? On this episode Scott walks through some of the initial things you can expect from adding a video to your product listing, so be sure you take the time to learn about this new feature. \nHow important is a unique design for my new product?\nA listener called in to ask a question about the benefits of having a unique product design. He\u2019s a graphic designer and as he looks through the Amazon catalogue many of the products seem to be pretty generic to him. He feels that he could create a better design for a product and quickly be THE go-to brand in the niche simply because his product is different. But is that true? On this Ask Scott episode, Scott Voelker walks through the pros and cons of creating a unique design for your products and when you should consider it in the product launch stages. If you\u2019re curious about how to go about differentiating your products you need to hear this episode.\nHow can I go about tracking my product inventory. Amazon\u2019s numbers don\u2019t look right?\nOne of the listeners to The Amazing Seller Podcast called in to ask a question about the stats and inventory numbers that Amazon provides in the backend of the seller accounts. He doesn\u2019t feel that his numbers look accurate because his total sales, returns, and remaining inventory numbers don\u2019t add up. He\u2019s curious if Scott has a better way to keep track of numbers instead of relying on Amazon\u2019s numbers, and whether or not he should contact Amazon\u2019s seller help to find out why their numbers are different. You can hear Scott\u2019s answer on this episode.\nIs retail arbitrage still an option? How can it be combined with private label sales?\nMany Amazon sellers get their start by selling products through retail arbitrage on Amazon. That simply means they find discounted products under existing brands and sell them on Amazon as a wholesaler. But most people move from there into private label sales, which means they source their own product, brand it themselves, and have exclusive rights to the sale of that product. But it\u2019s possible to do both at the same time and to continue doing both to add more cash flow to the business.

To commemorate the journey Scott has asked his good friend Chris Shaffer to come on as the HOST of this episode to help Scott walk through his own journey so that you can see that there\u2019s nothing special about how Scott has gotten to where he is except for one thing - and it\u2019s the thing that you hear Scott say episode after episode of this podcast - he\u2019s TAKEN ACTION!\nHow Scott Voelker learned that he didn\u2019t want to work a 9 to 5 job.\nScott Voelker has had his share of 9 to 5 jobs, \u201cworking for the man.\u201d Right out of school he worked for a local cable company, connecting and disconnecting cable TV, climbing poles, etc. He\u2019s worked as a supervisor or foreman in his Dad\u2019s construction business, and he\u2019s also run his own photography business. Scott decided through that journey that he didn\u2019t like putting in a load of hard work to advance someone else\u2019s business when he wasn\u2019t being compensated for the amount of quality work he was putting in. You can hear how he made the transition from full-time employee to full-time entrepreneur, on this 300th episode of The Amazing Seller.\n\n\nWhy you can overcome any obstacle if you are determined to do it.\nOne of the overriding principles you\u2019ll hear on this episode that recounts Scott\u2019s journey from 9 to 5 employee to full-time entrepreneur is that he was willing to do the work needed to overcome the obstacles that blocked the path to success. Scott is convinced that if you set a goal and are determined to reach it, nothing can stop you. You may have to stop for a bit to learn a new skill or to find someone to help you, but you won\u2019t be stopped for good if you think in terms of possibilities instead of obstacles. Scott\u2019s journey is an inspiring example of how it works so be sure you take the time to listen!\nAn important question for any endeavor: What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\nAs Scott has worked toward building his own online sales and training business he\u2019s discovered that one of his greatest assets has been his wife. At many points along the road he\u2019s been hesitant to step into something new, including the start of the Amazing Seller Podcast. But his wife was always there behind the scenes encouraging him to give it a try. One of the things she said to him repeatedly which you can take as a great tool for your progress is this: What\u2019s the worst that can happen? When you can answer that question you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s usually not as bad as you think and not as difficult to press ahead as you imagined.\nScott says his Wife is his BIGGEST cheerleader and supporter\n\nI knew if I could help enough people - eventually, I\u2019d be compensated for it.\nIn this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott was asked by his friend Chris what his plan was for the monetization of his podcast when he first began. Scott said that he didn\u2019t worry about that at first because he knew that the old Zig Ziglar quote was true - if he helped enough people get what they wanted, he would eventually get what he wanted - which did include a certain amount of compensation. It\u2019s proven exactly true and Scott says to this day that it\u2019s his greatest joy to see people apply what he teaches them and then go out to rock their own Amazon or eCommerce business. You can hear Scott\u2019s story on this amazing episode of The Amazing Seller.\nHere's a few old pictures that Scott mentioned in this episode.\nIn this first picture you'll see the car Scott purchased to advertise his video transfer business. He explains in this episode how after starting his photography business how he discovered video transfers as an additional revenue stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this next picture you'll see the video transfer machines he discussed and how he discovered this market. This again is proof that once you start a business and Take Action things start to appear.

With those changes come both challenges and incredible opportunities for those who are willing to put in the work to learn what the changes mean and how to get their products rocking in light of them. This episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott and his buddy Chris are chatting about the changes that have happened over the last year, what it has meant for building online eCommerce businesses, and what can be done better moving forward to make 2017 a rocking and powerful year for you.\nWhy changes over the last year on Amazon have shifted the launch mindset.\nFor a very long time, everyone who\u2018s been building a business on Amazon private label products has been able to motivate people to leave reviews by offering them a discount in exchange for that review. But that\u2019s an advantage that has gone away due to changes on Amazon. The change has forced Amazon sellers to shift their mindset about how to promote products and how to build a more successful business. You\u2019ve got to do new things to make sales happen now, that's the long and short of it. On this episode, Scott and Chris cover some of the mindset shifts that have been forced by Amazon changes and suggest ways you can make your business fly even higher by using the advantages that come BECAUSE OF the changes.\nThe changes Amazon has made lately make it BETTER for serious sellers. Here\u2019s why.\nThe changes that have happened on the Amazon sales platform this year in relation to reviews have made one thing very clear. Many people were building a business solely on the back of being able to offer a discount in exchange for reviews. What that has done is make an opportunity for those who are serious about building a business on Amazon and independent of it. The learning curve is high but it\u2019s actually a BETTER opportunity for those who are serious business people who want to build a long lasting eCommerce business. Find out how you can be one of those long-lasting brands, on this episode.\nThe winning way to choose private label products in light of recent changes on Amazon.\nAs things have changed on the Amazon platform over the last year it\u2019s become apparent that the old way of doing product selection doesn\u2019t work anymore. Why? Because reviews are now harder to come by so if you\u2019re going to use reviews as a way to establish social proof you\u2019re going to have a harder road getting there. That means you\u2019ve got to target product niches where the most successful products have fewer reviews. If you\u2019d like to hear more about how Chris and Scott go about selecting great products to launch on Amazon you can listen to this episode and get all of their insights.\nHere\u2019s how you can leverage lightning deals to promote your products and get more sales.\nThe Amazon platform has always allowed you to use the \u201cLightning Deal\u201d feature, but the way to use it and exactly WHO can use it has changed a lot over the years. But now, it\u2019s much more available to everyone than in the past and it\u2019s a way you can utilize to get more product sales in spurts through Amazon\u2019s promotion of your products. On this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast, you\u2019re going to hear how Scott and Chris suggest anyone can use the Lightning Deal feature to boost sales and sales rank so to get your products rolling and build momentum.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this podcast about 2017 strategies!\n \t[4:53] The things that have changed in the last year.\n \t[10:12] Mindset shifts due to Amazon changes this past year.\n \t[15:00] Why it\u2019s now BETTER for serious eCommerce sellers.\n \t[32:03] What to consider as you launch a new product in the future.\n \t[34:14] Advice for those just starting on Amazon in 2017.\n\nRESOURCES MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE\n\n \twww.TheAmazingSeller.com/workshop - Join one of Scott\u2019s workshops!", "duration": "43:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS299.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1482485411, "title": "TAS 298 : Ask Scott Session #90 \u2013 Your Business and Marketing Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s time for another of the Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episodes where you get to hear Scott\u2019s answers to the real-life questions of other Amazon sellers. And what\u2019s even better than that is that YOU can ask your own specific questions for Scott to answer. You\u2019ll be able to learn all kinds of great things about product listings, marketing funnels, sales issues, and much more. If you want to hear Scott\u2019s answers and even learn how to ask your own questions you should make sure you listen to this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode.\nHow much detail should you include in your product listing? Will other people copy it if you do?\nA listener asks today whether he should include the kinds of things that set his product apart when it comes to product materials, densities, etc. He has two different thoughts about it. #1 - it IS the type of product that those things really matter so he sees it as a possible way to show that his product is high quality. #2 - He\u2019s concerned that others in the market may use his detailed descriptions to copy what he\u2019s doing and bring more competition to his market. Scott\u2019s got a great way of looking at this issue so be sure you listen to get this episode.\nSelling an electronic product? Do you need to be compliant with FCC regulations and such?\nOne of the things Scott has often advised AGAINST is the sale of electronic products. His main reasons have been that there are too many products in the space and that the likelihood of product returns due to product defects is much higher. But there are other issues having to do with government regulations, etc. that you need to be concerned about. On this episode, Scott dives into that issue and the various things you want to keep in mind so you don\u2019t get yourself into trouble. It\u2019s an amazing amount of detail for a short response so be sure you listen, take notes, and take action! \nWhen you launch a second product and want to offer a discount to your list, how do you do it wisely?\nA caller to the show named April is about to launch her second product. AND, she\u2019s been building an email list for her first product and is eager to send a discount to her list for the new product. Way to go April! Her question on this episode has to do with the best way to provide a discount to the people on her list. Should she give a discount code that anyone can use? Should she create a single-use code and reply to each person who wants to use it? Or is there a better way? Scott\u2019s got some great ideas about how to do this in a powerful, simple, and search-boosting way, so be sure you listen.\nWhen it comes to the time you have available, here\u2019s a caution to help you budget it well.\nOne of the things Scott has been learning (again) is that time is a very precious thing. Every minute that passes is a minute that you can never get back. Here we are approaching the holidays and most of us will be spending a lot of time with family. But we\u2019re also eagerly building Amazon and eCommerce businesses. How do you effectively make sure that the time you\u2019re spending with your family is time WELL SPENT with your family, with your mind engaged in the moments you have with them? You can hear why this is becoming more important to Scott and what he suggests you do to keep yourself on track when it comes to the wise use of your time, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this Q&amp;A episode of the podcast!\n \t[1:00] The importance of remembering that TIME is a precious thing.\n \t[5:17] The phrase of the week: Consume then do.\n \t[6:52] QUESTION ONE: How specific should my product details be in terms of materials and other parameters in light of potential copycat products?\n \t[15:22] QUESTION TWO: On electronic products is the FCC label required on the product someplace?\n \t[22:00] QUESTION THREE: I\u2019m about to launch a second product and want to send a discount to my list for the second product.", "duration": "32:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS298.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1482312641, "title": "TAS 297 : 5 Tips to Better Understand Your Market and Increase Conversions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Today\u2019s topic on The Amazing Seller is not all that appealing at first glance. It\u2019s the issue of figuring out exactly who your target market is - your ideal customer - and how to speak the language they actually use in real life so that you can relate better to them and increase your conversions. For this episode, Scott has asked Joel Bower to come on the show because he\u2019s got tons of experience in this area and has been working to hone his skills in customer messaging to amplify his impact and sales. You won\u2019t want to miss this because the results that can come from a few small tweaks can be powerful for sales conversions. Be sure to listen!\nThe #1 way you are wasting your marketing money.\nEverybody who is selling products online - whether private label products or some other channel - understands that marketing is what keeps the wheels of the machine rolling. But you can\u2019t just shoot out marketing messages and expect people to buy your products. You\u2019ve got to produce marketing messages that connect with real people in real life. When you do that well you are showing a real person on the other end of your message that you care about them and that you can provide the perfect solution to their problem or need. Joel Bower has learned how to craft his marketing messages to truly connect with the person on the other side of the message - and he shares his top 5 tips on this episode. \nWhy you\u2019ve got to use the features of your product to highlight the benefits.\nWhen you\u2019re setting up a product listing inside the Amazon dashboard you have the opportunity to set up bullet points to highlight the features of your product. It\u2019s important to list the features because they are a finer point of the things that make your product unique. But you\u2019ve got to learn not to major on the features but instead focus on the benefits the end user will receive from using the features. The people who are purchasing your product need to understand what they are going to get from using your product and each feature needs to be tied into that basic human need to benefit personally. Find out more about how to do this like a pro, on this episode. \u00a0\nHere\u2019s why you have to understand your customer\u2019s journey to increase sales.\nThere\u2019s more to marketing your products than simply putting out your message and receiving the sale. You\u2019ve got to understand that your customers are on a journey of sorts, a progression from recognition of their need all the way beyond making a purchase to meet that need - into a relationship with the person who helps them meet it (you). On this episode Scott and his guest Joel are chatting about how important it is for you to understand your customer\u2019s buying journey and how you can create marketing messages that not only take it into account but go beyond that to utilize it to help them see the benefits your products will provide and lead them along on that buying journey into relationship with you.\nHow to use the knowledge that extroverts are led by excitement and introverts are led by security.\nThere are two types of people in the world in terms of how they relate to others - introverts and extroverts. At risk of being too simplistic, you can use those two personality types to your advantage when it comes to selling your products. Extroverts are led toward a decision, many times, by excitement. Introverts, on the other hand, are led to a decision oftentimes through their desire for safety. Listen to this episode to better understand how your use of those motivations can help you position your products and marketing messages to tap into those underlying needs and gain more sales and customer relationships as a result.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this podcast for connecting better with your customer, and Scott\u2019s guest Joel Bower.\n \t[2:25] Joel\u2019s start in real estate and how he got into online sales.\n \t[6:48] How Scott has learned from Joel and the rest of the people on...", "duration": "53:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS297.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1482139811, "title": "TAS 296 : The NEW Open Brand Concept to Test and Launch Products Faster", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "There are lots of ways to start selling products on Amazon. But there are some approaches that restrict you more than others in terms of the categories you are able to sell within and the variety of products you can offer. On this episode, Scott talks with his friend Dom Sugar about what it means to build an open brand, why it is a faster way to find and launch products, and how you can approach this style of selling, on this episode.\nAre you married to your product brand? What would happen if you weren\u2019t?\nThe idea of selling products under an \u201copen brand\u201d is foreign to a lot of sellers who are trying to build a brand in a certain niche. An open brand enables you to sell products in all sorts of niches, testing as you go, learning what products are popular and which are not. This approach enables you to get products started faster and cull the ones that aren\u2019t working while still building a business. You can even have multiple niched brands within your open brand. If it doesn\u2019t make sense to you now, that\u2019s OK. Listen to this episode to hear Scott and his friend Dom Sugar explain what the open brand strategy is.\nHow retail arbitrage can connect to an open brand sales model.\nDom Sugar has been selling products online for years. Most recently he\u2019s been selling private label products and is doing so very successfully. But he\u2019s not exclusively selling private label products, he still sells products under a retail arbitrage model through his open brand. He finds the opportunities, puts them on Amazon to see what will happen, and lets them sell at whatever rate they will. It\u2019s a way that he has low-volume sales going on all the time to support his other business endeavors. It\u2019s a great model that you can learn more about on this episode.\nAn open brand enables you to build brands within your brand.\nAs Scott and Dom talked about the concept of building an open brand on this episode, it became clear that it\u2019s possible to build a handful of individual brands within a larger \u201copen\u201d brand. The open brand may be the name on the seller account - \u201cABC Products\u201d for example. Then underneath that main brand may be a home brand, a pet brand, a sporting goods brand, and more. It enables you to try all kinds of products in any niche, regardless of whether you\u2019re already doing that type of product or not. Find out how to make it happen in your business, on this episode.\nThe power of an open brand is that you\u2019re able to test for beneficial, larger brand possibilities.\nWhen you keep your brand broad and open you are able to try a variety of products without having to remain within a certain niche. When you find one that begins to sell at a rapid pace then you have the opportunity to think through the possibility of selling related products and actually building a brand from it. This is one of the tips that Dom Sugar shares with Scott on this episode. Dom\u2019s been selling products online for years and has lots of perspective on how you can go about finding and selling products profitably. \u00a0\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast with Dom Sugar!\n \t[1:20] Dom\u2019s experience in online sales and why he\u2019s such a great resource.\n \t[4:00] What is the \u201copen brand\u201d concept.\n \t[9:10] The importance of keeping email lists segmented according to interest.\n \t[15:57] Should you have multiple seller account to create different brands?\n \t[18:26] Tips for choosing brand names.\n \t[26:48] Strategies Dom uses to sell more products.\n \t[37:14] The power of brands within a brand.\n \t[41:00] The kind of products Dom looks for to start another item in his product line.\n \t[49:20] Don\u2019t let the barriers stop you from getting started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 296\nTAS 296 : The NEW Open Brand Concept to Test and Launch Products Faster\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

And no matter how much she follows up, trying to get an answer to why she\u2019s being denied, she\u2019s not getting anywhere. So she called in to ask Scott what he would recommend. Should she give up? Should she just go to Etsy or eBay and forget about Amazon altogether? Scott\u2019s got some great insights for this person - and you can hear it on this episode.\nMy wife has always dreamt of starting a clothing boutique. How can we get started on Amazon?\nA listener from Ireland called Scott to ask about the different issues he might face trying to sell clothing on Amazon.

But one of the GREAT things about it is that things are changing all the time, too! Every now and then a change is made to the terms of service or tools that make it much BETTER for those selling their private label products on Amazon. On this episode Scott is walking through some of the most recent changes, helping you understand what they mean for you, and showing you how to use them effectively on your products to ramp up sales.\nIf your products are not brand registered you are now SERIOUSLY missing out on new features!\nFor a while now Amazon has been allowing private label sellers to apply for brand registration - a way to register yourself as the only owner of your brand. So far there have only been a few benefits to being brand registered but as of the last week, there\u2019s a HUGE reason to get your products brand registered - you can get new formatting tools to make your product listing stand out in some special ways. Images, text enhancements and formatting, additional bullets, and more are now yours - but only if you\u2019re brand registered. Find out how you can take advantage of it, on this episode.\nWhat if you could build a long form sales page for your private label products?\nLeadpages and ClickFunnels are two of the popular landing page software services that enable you to build sales pages on your own website. Statistics prove that landing pages of this sort are much more effective in making sales. Now Amazon has created some template-based features for all brand registered products that make your product listing much more like a long-form sales page. You can find out the details and learn how to start building your own product listing sales pages on the Amazon platform - on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nDo you have access to the new Enhanced Content on your Amazon listings?\nAmazon has been rolling out a new feature - enhanced content - to all brand registered sellers over the past few weeks. But not everyone is seeing it yet. If you\u2019re not seeing this new option in the advertising tab of your seller account then you need to reach out to Amazon to see how you can get it. Chris and Scott walk through what they suggest you do if Amazon has not given you the enhanced content yet, on this episode.\nNow you can get rid of hijackers forever - by getting brand registered.\nFor quite a while now it\u2019s been possible for someone to list products under your product listing and eventually take it over, leaving you with no control over your own product listing. But Amazon has now created a way for you to prevent that from happening, but you\u2019ve got to be brand registered first. But not everyone gets approved for brand registry the first time. How do you keep working to get your products registered if you\u2019ve been rejected? You can find out by hearing what Scott and Chris have to say, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[1:05] How you can get in on the next live workshop.\n \t[1:54] Enrollment for the private label course is closing!\n \t[3:54] What is enhanced content and where can you check it out?\n \t[7:20] The templates and layouts that can be used for the enhanced content.\n \t[13:35] How this new change is like a long-form sales page.\n \t[15:00] Be sure NOT to include testimonials in these new fields.\n \t[24:24] Why it\u2019s vital that you get brand registered immediately. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 294\nTAS 294 : How to Use the NEW Enhanced Content Features and WHY You Should\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

Is your product safe? Should it include a choking warning? Is there a risk that you could be sued or that your product could be held liable for harm done to a person or their property? These are not things we like to think about but they are a necessary consideration when you\u2019re building a business. On this episode, Scott is chatting with Michelle Love about the issue of liability insurance, both for your business and to cover your products. You\u2019ll want to hear this one.\nDo you know when you need to purchase product liability insurance for your Amazon biz?\nMany Amazon sellers who are just getting started have small supplies of their products and very low investment in the business. The thought of purchasing business and product insurance could serve as another reason to quit or not get started at all. But you don\u2019t need to worry about that hurdle yet because Amazon has sales thresholds that you have to meet in order for them to require you to purchase insurance. Do you know what it is? On this episode, you\u2019ll find out and get a lot more advice about insurance for your business from Insurance Agent Michelle Love.\nHow much can Amazon sellers expect to pay for product liability insurance?\nWhen you are trying to budget for the expense of product and business insurance you really need to have some figures you can start with to ensure you\u2019re going to be able to pay for it when the time comes. But it\u2019s hard to know exactly what you\u2019re going to need to pay because the premiums depend on the specifics of the products you are selling. How risky are they? What dangers might be involved? It\u2019s not an easy issue to unravel without professional help. On this episode, you\u2019re going to be shown exactly how to know when and what insurance you need in order to cover yourself from lawsuits and liability.\nHow do you know if you\u2019ve got the right kind and enough insurance for your Amazon business?\nInsurance is not the most exciting thing to talk about but if you\u2019re going to run a business you\u2019ve got to make sure you do everything needed to protect yourself and handle any legal claims that may come against you. On this episode Scott is chatting with Michelle Love, an Insurance Professional who is also selling products through Amazon FBA, so she knows the particular issues that Amazon sellers face and can help you navigate the confusion. Find out how you can know the right insurance and the right amounts of it to purchase, on this episode.\nDid you know that the Amazon Terms of Service you signed require you to purchase insurance?\nThe habit we all have when it comes to terms of service is to quickly scroll through and hit \u201caccept.\u201d But that\u2019s a practice that can come back to bite you eventually, especially if you are agreeing to do something in the arrangement - which most terms of service do require. In Amazon\u2019s terms of service, there are requirements on you as an Amazon FBA seller that you buy product liability insurance when you reach a certain sales threshold. Did you know that? More importantly, do you need insurance now? Find out the answer for your situation on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this product liability episode of the podcast!\n \t[0:30] Introduction to Scott\u2019s guest, Michelle Love.\n \t[5:00] The need and importance of insurance for your business and products.\n \t[8:03] Product liability insurance: the price depends on the risk.\n \t[10:47] When and what do you need to do to prove your insurance to Amazon?\n \t[15:30] Additional issues that can impact Insurance premiums.\n \t[18:00] How can you know that you\u2019ve got the right insurance for your needs?\n \t[22:40] Do you need coverage for products that are waiting to be shipped?\n \t[24:00] Guidelines for what business and product liability insurance could cost.\n \t[26:20] Is insurance needed for each and every produ...", "duration": "52:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS293.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1481275828, "title": "TAS 292 : Ask Scott Session #88 \u2013 Your Business and Marketing Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "What\u2019s the deal with this year? It\u2019s just flown by! Here we are in the 4th quarter, the first part of December 2016 and we\u2019re looking at Christmas coming up. But there is lots to be concerned about that\u2019s much more important than product sales. Yep, you heard that right. You\u2019ve got family at home and kids around and the holidays are almost here. So make sure you take a breath, look around you, and enjoy the moment. That\u2019s the first thing Scott has to say as he starts this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode of the podcast and he\u2019s learning it himself as he goes. If you\u2019d like to hear this episode and ask your own question, you can ask Scott yourself. Listen to this Q&amp;A episode to find out how!\nI\u2019m doing well with my first private label product but am still on page 8. How can I improve that?\nA listener called in to ask how he can improve his product ranking. At this point, he\u2019s consistently on page 8 or page 9 and his niche is a very competitive sub-niche of the sporting goods category. Even though he\u2019s getting a decent amount of sales he\u2019s curious if he\u2019s ranking so low because his seller account is new. He\u2019s also curious what he can do to improve his product rank. Scott\u2019s got one main thought about why his product is ranking so low. Can you guess what it is? You can find out on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nNo more discounts in exchange for product reviews. What should you do now?\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard, Amazon has now changed its policies to forbid private label sellers from offering discounts in exchange for a review. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t give discounts. It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t ask for reviews. But it DOES mean that you can't offer the discount only if the purchaser agrees to leave you a product review. The practice of discounts in exchange for reviews used to be one of the most powerful ways to drive product reviews, which in turn helps with social proof, which in turn drives sales. So\u2026 since it\u2019s not allowed now, what should you do to get a product going? Scott\u2019s going to tell you how he\u2019s modified his strategy, on this episode.\nCan you tell me what the best way is to research great keywords for my products?\nA listener called in on this episode and he's a Jr. in college and has already launched 4 products and has two more on order. He\u2019s rocking the Amazon private label sales world already and is eager to find out how he can find the best keywords that his products can best rank for. He knows that getting his products found for the keywords people are actually searching for is what is going to help him get in front of the people who are wanting exactly what he has to offer. If you\u2019d like to hear how Scott recommends all sellers go about finding their best product keywords - including the tools he\u2019d use to find them.\nIf private label sales are proving to be a challenge, here\u2019s how you can get your questions answered.\nThe Friday episodes of The Amazing Seller podcast are aimed entirely at answering YOUR Amazon, business, marketing, and private label sales questions. If you are struggling to get your private label questions answered, Scott is the guy. If you want to know how to do better list building and online marketing, Scott\u2019s here to help.

But this episode should prove to you that those are entirely false beliefs. This episode features a couple who started out selling products via retail arbitrage but soon transitioned into wholesale products from China that turned into a successful business. It wasn\u2019t overnight and it took a lot of hard work and smart product research but this couple has done it. You can hear every step of their process and the things they\u2019ve done to keep the ball rolling on this episode.\nHow to get past the discouragement to become successful selling on Amazon.\nIn any business, you\u2019ve got to understand that discouragements are going to come. So what can you do to prepare yourself for the discouraging times? How can you set your mind in such a way that you\u2019re more likely to press forward than give up? One of the most important things you can do is to find yourself an encouragement partner. That could be a person who is committed to cheering you on during the difficult times, or it could be an actual business partner like the couple featured on this episode. They have found that when one of them is down the other is able to encourage so they keep moving forward together. What\u2019s your strategy for staying encouraged? Find out how it works for this couple, on this episode.\nDid you know that you can be rid of Amazon product hijackers once and for all?\nOne of the best things that has happened on the Amazon platform in a very long time is that the powers that be at the Big A have added a new perk to the benefits of brand registering your products. Once you have a brand approved on Amazon it is now impossible for anyone else to begin listing products under your product listings unless they first ask your approval to do so. That is an incredible benefit to private label sellers, virtually eliminating the possibility of hijackers taking over your listing. On this episode Scott and his guests talk about the safety and power of this new ruling, so be sure you listen.\nProduct research criteria #1: Less than 100 product reviews in all of the top 10 listings.\nWhen Scott asked this amazing couple what they were looking for when it came to product ideas one of the things they said is a non-negotiable for them is that every one of the top 10 products in any niche \u00a0they consider must have less than 100 reviews. If you\u2019ve been researching product ideas on Amazon for any length of time that may sound impossible to you but this couple says they find products that fall within that criteria almost every week. You can hear how they are finding them and the tools that make their search easy, on this episode of The Amazing Seller. \nHow poorly optimized Amazon product listing are something you can use to your advantage.\nWhen you\u2019re checking out the listings of the competition in a niche where you are considering a possible product launch one of the things you need to look at carefully is how well the competitor\u2019s product listings are optimized. If you find low-resolution pictures or a small number of pictures that\u2019s a sign that you might be able to quickly capture the sales in that category by optimizing your own listing much better than theirs. That\u2019s just one of the product research tips given on this episode by a couple who\u2019s become very successful at selling private label products without resorting to PPC or giveaways.

With changes happening that rapidly it\u2019s hard to keep abreast of everything and to actually KNOW how to apply the changes effectively for your brand and products. That\u2019s why these TAS Power Hour episodes are so helpful. Three experienced Amazon sellers unpack the current happenings in the Amazon ecosphere on the spot, as they are announced so you can get some perspective on what\u2019s happening and what it means to you. Be sure to listen - this is a great episode that covers a handful of very important topics that have happened lately.\nAre you using the enhanced listings for your Amazon products? Why not?!!!\nIf you aren\u2019t aware of it, you need to know, Amazon has now rolled out an amazing feature for anyone who has brand registered their products. You can now use the Amazon enhanced listing feature to build out your product listings very much like a long form sales landing page. The drag and drop format and enhanced formatting options like bold, underlining, and more make it possible for you to make your product listing incredibly attractive and powerfully effective as a sales tool. You\u2019ve got to hear the details from the TAS Power Hour guys, on this episode.\nNo more \u201cdollar off\u201d discount codes on Amazon products. It\u2019s true.\nIt used to be the case that you could create discount codes for your Amazon products in two different formats - dollars-off and percentage-off. But it\u2019s not that way anymore. Amazon has now restricted the options to only allow percentage-off discounts. Why is this a big deal? Because the percentage option allows those who receive it to game the system - sort of - and cost you some extra cash as a seller. The guys unpack the issue on this TAS Power Hour episode so be sure you listen so you can know the best ways to use your offer codes.\nDoes Amazon allow you to send discount codes to your email list?\nWith all of the changes going on surrounding review policies on Amazon and the use of discounts in exchange for a review (which isn\u2019t allowed anymore), many people are confused as to what is legal and what is not. One question that comes up over and over is whether or not you as a seller are allowed to send out discount codes for your products via your email list. On this episode of the TAS Power Hour the guys discuss that strategy - tell why it\u2019s so powerful - and what Amazon really thinks about it. You\u2019ve got to hear this one.\nIt\u2019s now possible to lock down your Amazon products to prevent hijackers.\nFor a long time now, Scott and his buddies have been recommending that every person who is selling products on Amazon go through the process of brand registering their products so they can get in on the many benefits it brings. Now there\u2019s another benefit that\u2019s been added to the brand registry perks - and it's amazing! You can now essentially lock down your products so that anyone who wants to list a product under that listing has to ask YOUR permission to do so. It\u2019s incredible.

He\u2019s making improvements to the quality and appearance of his product, which is always a great thing to do for the sake of customer perception of your brand and products. But does a change in packaging change the way Amazon handles his products? Does it affect his product listings in any way? Is he going to run into trouble because his products are not exactly the same as they have been in the past? Scott Voelker has a great answer about this issue and even gives some advice about how to go about deciding on the better packaging options for your products - it's all on this episode.\nUse existing products and reviews to magnify sales of product variations.\nWhen you\u2019ve got an existing product for sale on Amazon and the reviews have already been coming in, you\u2019ve got a great asset that you need to capitalize on.

That\u2019s pretty normal but could be a mistake. You\u2019ve got to begin thinking through your tax liability a long time before tax season comes. That\u2019s why Scott is doing this episode with his friend and business accountant, Josh Bauerle. Josh works with lots of online entrepreneurs and Amazon sellers and has a great deal of experience dealing with the tax implications of those kinds of businesses. You\u2019re going to learn some great things from Josh on this episode so make sure you carve out the time to listen and get yourself ready for tax season.\nOne of the biggest tax mistakes Amazon sellers make has to do with inventory.\nAs a seller of online products you naturally have inventory. Inventory is the products you purchase to resell through your online platforms. You can write off your inventory when it comes to taxes - BUT inventory for tax purposes is NOT what you might think it is. You\u2019ve got to know what the IRS considers to be inventory, how it handles these things, and how it requires you to keep your inventory records. Josh Bauerle is an expert on these things and he\u2019s got a very clear explanation of how you need to handle your inventory issues - and he shares it on this episode.\nSales tax is a real headache for eCommerce sellers. Do you know how to handle it?\nEvery person or company who sells products online is liable for sales tax on those products. It's not only a federal issue, it also varies with each state in which the products are sold. If you spend even a small amount of time thinking about that you\u2019ll realize that the potential sales tax liability for an Amazon private label seller can get pretty heavy, pretty quickly. And on top of all that, every state handles the rules differently. You\u2019ve got to get this one figured out though - it could make or break your business. CPA Josh Bauerle is Scott\u2019s guest on this episode and he\u2019s got lots of wisdom for you regarding taxes and tax liability.\nWhy it\u2019s legally vital for you to keep business funds separate from personal funds.\nMany people start out in business flying by the seat of their pants. Every business expense and every personal expense seem to be the same thing because they are living off of the money they make from the business. But today\u2019s guest, Josh Bauerle is a CPA who has worked with business people for a long time and he\u2019s got some horror stories about the kind of things that can happen when you co-mingle your personal and business expenses. On this episode, he highlights the reasons you need to keep those funds separate and how you can easily track and coordinate them to keep you out of tax trouble. This section alone is worth the time it will take you to listen.\nAre you getting all the business tax deductions that are rightfully yours?\nWhen you start a business of any kind you\u2019re going to spend money for a variety of things that go into the operation of your business. From office supplies, to educational resources, to trips, you can legally and ethically write off many of the expenses you have in order to decrease your tax liability. But there are guidelines for how you do it that you have to understand so that you don\u2019t get yourself in trouble with the IRS. Find out how to do tax deductions the right way from Josh Bauerle, CPA on fire, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast with Josh Bauerle.\n \t[4:00] Josh\u2019s experience with Amazon clients so far.\n \t[6:15] How you should track inventory for tax purposes.\n \t[11:18] The variety of business entity options you could form for your business.\n \t[16:30] The essential nature of using a separate checking account for your business.\n \t[20:00] The tax advantages of forming an S-corp.\n \t[25:50] What is sales tax and why it\u2019s a mess for Am...", "duration": "47:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS288.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1480325402, "title": "TAS 287 : (Mindset Hacks) How To Change Your Mindset to Achieve ANYTHING in Life and Business with Ryan Moran", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "In the business world these days you hear a ton of talk about mindset. There\u2019s a reason for that. Mindset is one of the things that determines your progress and your ultimate level of success. And the good thing is that it\u2019s one of the main things you can actually control. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott\u2019s going deep with a friend of his, Ryan Daniel Moran about the development of a strong, success-oriented mindset. Both of them are convinced that the true bottleneck to success and growth is right between our ears. If you want to know how to break out of the limiting mindset habits you have, you\u2019ve got to hear this great episode.\nOften, the bottleneck in growth and success is mindset.\nWhat you believe is possible for you will naturally limit what you find possible practically. It\u2019s a fact of life. If you don\u2019t think you can lift a 50-pound weight, you won\u2019t be able to do it. In fact, you might not even make the attempt. That\u2019s a simple example of how mindset can be the bottleneck to many things in our lives. On this episode, Scott chats with his buddy Ryan Moran about this issue of mindset - and they go deep. You\u2019ll learn a handful of strategies to help you reset your mindset over time and reach greater levels of success as a result.\nBeliefs TIMES strategy and execution TIMES time = results\nOne of the most powerful things Ryan Moran shares on this episode of The Amazing Seller is his formula for how our mindset impacts our results. Here it is: Beliefs TIMES strategy and execution TIMES time EQUAL results. What it means is that what you believe will be multiplied through the approach and actions you take and over time your results will come about. It\u2019s a bit confusing to see in print but Ryan explains it incredibly well on this episode, so be sure you listen.\nThe 10X exercise is a way you can stretch your perception of what is normal and possible\nOne of the things Ryan Moran does with those who he coaches and who attend his events is what he calls \u201cThe 10X Exercise.\u201d He has you write down the level of income you are experiencing right now. Then he has you write down where you want to be. Then - one more step - he has you write down 10 times what you want. A very interesting thing begins to happen as people write down that 10X number, something most people don\u2019t anticipate. Do you know what it is? On this episode, Ryan shares the story and tells you what it reveals about mindset, beliefs about possibility, and more - on this episode.\nAssociation and input determine what you believe is possible\nEveryone is a product of the environment they have lived within. The things you hear as \u201cnormal\u201d are the things you come to believe ARE normal. It\u2019s THAT perception of what is normal that dictates what you believe is possible. How do you stretch that boundary? How do you get yourself to believe that more is possible for you, for your business? On this episode Ryan Moran shares some of the ways he\u2019s found it possible to break through those perceived limitations for himself, so be sure you listen to find out how you can begin moving into a place of greater success and possibility.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode with his guest Ryan Moran of Freedom Fast Lane.\n \t[3:54] Why Ryan believes that you are wired for the results you are getting right now.\n \t[7:14] What does Ryan put into his head regularly (and why does he put on events)?\n \t[10:25] Beliefs TIMES strategy and execution TIMES time = results.\n \t[17:08] How you can break through the mindset limitations you have.\n \t[22:54] How tiny habits lead to greater success - eventually.\n \t[28:06] What happens when you attain your goal?

These Friday episodes of The Amazing Seller podcast are aimed at helping you learn how to do that by answering your Amazon private label or eCommerce questions.

You can learn a lot by listening to the questions and answers on this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode of the show. \nWhat\u2019s the best way to get my brick-and-mortar products selling on Amazon?\nOne of the callers on this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode is curious what he needs to do in order to bring his existing products - that he sells in his physical location - onto the Amazon sales platform. Scott thinks this is an amazingly helpful question because in his view, every person who is already selling things offline should immediately (if not sooner) get their products listed on Amazon. On this episode, Scott\u2019s going to share why he thinks this person should get his products onto Amazon and how he should go about it. It\u2019s a great response to a very good question that you\u2019ll want to hear.\nHow do I enter a market if I\u2019m concerned that it might be too saturated?\nIf you are curious about what it takes to build a successful product business on Amazon then you need to hear the question one of Scott\u2019s listeners asked on this episode. She\u2019s curious how she can determine if a specific market she\u2019s interested in is too crowded with sellers - and beyond that, she wants to know if there is a way that she can begin to offer products within the wider market without coming into direct competition with the big players. Scott\u2019s got some very creative and interesting approaches to this question and he shares his ideas on this episode.\nWhat are the best ways to work alongside your spouse in a business partnership?\nOne of Scott\u2019s listeners is eager to get started with Amazon private label sales. He and his wife have been listening to the show together and want to work on their Amazon business as a team. He called in to ask for Scott\u2019s advice regarding how to best work together with a significant other. He\u2019s concerned about the stress and potential for difficulty and conflict - so he wants to head those things off before they get started by applying Scott\u2019s great advice. What would you tell him? You can hear Scott\u2019s answer and suggestions on this episode.\nDo you have a question about business, eCommerce, or selling private label products?\nIt\u2019s always good to have an experienced person in your corner, a coach or advisor who can point you in the right direction and give you their lessons-learned from experience. That\u2019s what this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode of The Amazing Seller podcast is all about.

This episode of the show is exactly that - and it\u2019s a bit different than usual because the product they are looking at is in a very competitive niche with competitive products that are well established and making lots of sales. How would you approach the promotion of a product given those circumstances? You can hear how Scott and Chris would do it on this episode.\nIs it smart to go after a super competitive product niche?\nOn this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott and Chris are looking at an Amazon product listing that is in a very competitive niche. The product owner asked the guys to look it over and give some suggestions about how he can increase his sales and gain more of the market share. But neither Scott nor Chris would have tried to sell this product in the first place because the market is crowded with heavy-hitting competitors. But now that the product is established and selling what should the product owner do? You can hear how Scott and Chris would approach it on this episode of the show.\nWhy an external strategy is key for products in a competitive product market.\nMuch of the reason that new products in competitive niches don\u2019t have much chance of becoming popular with buyers is because of the social proof the larger, more established products have. They may have thousands of positive reviews when the new product is first introduced, which makes it an uphill climb to gain any share of the market. If a product like this is going to gain any traction it\u2019s going to come from building a mailing list and doing promotions outside of Amazon. On this episode Scott and Chris walk you through how they\u2019d do that and why it\u2019s so important - so be sure you listen!\nShould you create a lead-in product to stimulate existing product sales?\nIf you have a product that is being overshadowed by dominant competition there is a long-term approach you can take to gain ground in the market. Scott calls it a lead-in product. Here\u2019s how it works: You begin offering a second product that has a less crowded market but is related to your first product. You do the things you need to do in order to get it selling then offer the first product (the one that\u2019s difficult to sell) as an \u201calso bought\u201d or related product. It\u2019s one way to come at buyers from the back door, giving them the opportunity to see your great product through another product's channel. You can hear Scott describe how he\u2019d go about creating that kind of related product on this episode.\nDo you know how to target your Amazon product to a specific person?\nMany Amazon sellers feel that their product listings are optimized when there are many things they could do to make their listing more compelling. One of the things Chris and Scott suggest is to change the wording of your bullet points to reflect the benefits a specific type of person would experience if they were to buy your product. It\u2019s called targeting - aiming your product at the person most likely to purchase your product - and you do it by getting into their world and determining what would be of greatest benefit to them relating to your product. Scott and Chris give some great examples of how to do it on this episode, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[1:20] The hot seat topic: My competitive product is not getting sales.\n \t[2:59] Chris\u2019 impression of this product and market in question.\n \t[5:18] Is it smart to go after a very competitive product?\n \t[7:20] Why the \u201cexternal strategy\u201d is going to be key for this product\u2019s sales success.\n \t[9:38] The vital nature of Pay Per Click with a product like this.", "duration": "30:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS285.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1479720638, "title": "TAS 284 : (Highlights) TAS Breakthrough LIVE \u2013 Lessons Learned \u2013 Hot Seats and How to Grow Your Business", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "The second TAS Breakthrough LIVE event just wrapped up and the amazing conversations and ideas that happened are hard to describe after the fact. But on this episode, Scott and Chris are going to give it a shot! So take some time to listen in to find out if events like this are something that could move your online business forward in the future. These two guys are sold on the value of these events and even read powerful testimonials about how this event served to move the businesses of other people forward. So sit back, listen to what these two guys learned, and how you can get involved in a similar group or event in the future.\nThe important role that personal connections make in the advancement of your business.\nEveryone knows what it feels like to be discouraged. And conversely, everyone knows how good it feels to be encouraged by someone who is like-minded and gets where you are headed. There\u2019s nothing like it. Chris and Scott have learned that events like TAS Breakthrough LIVE are a wonderful place for people who are working in a specific niche to gather, learn from each other\u2019s experiences (successes and failures), brainstorm ideas for making each other more successful, and much more. But none of it will happen if you aren\u2019t in a situation where you can be encouraged in those ways. Find out how you can connect with these events yourself, on this episode.\nOnce you\u2019ve got a private label product on Amazon should you go wide or go deep?\nOnce you start to experience a bit of success selling private label products on Amazon you have a decision to make. Are you going to sit back and be satisfied with your current level of success or are you going to press forward to grow your success? If you\u2019re going to press forward you have another decision to make. Are you going to go wide by finding building new brands that are unrelated to your current product? Or are you going to go deep by adding adjacent products that make your current products even more effective? On this episode, Scott and Chris talk about a scenario they discussed with the group who attended the TAS Breakthrough LIVE event where a current successful Amazon seller was asking this question.\nShould you use Kickstarter to launch your products? It\u2019s possible, but not easy.\nIf you are looking to launch a private label product on Amazon there are many ways you can go about it. But every one of them is going to require hard work and effective marketing. At the latest TAS Breakthrough LIVE event, one of the hot seat sessions focused on a successful Amazon seller (he\u2019s making $25K per month presently) who has used Kickstarter to launch every one of his current products. In every case, he\u2019s had a successful campaign that fully funded his product launch, but he wants to do even more. The guys had a great time helping him think through his Kickstarter strategy, why he\u2019s doing things in that way, and what his end goal is for his Amazon business efforts. You\u2019ve got to hear this part of the conversation, it\u2019s a fresh look at the product launch approach that you\u2019ll enjoy hearing.\nThere\u2019s often potential to grow your brand even if you\u2019re already successful.\nAt the recent TAS Breakthrough LIVE event, one of the people on the hot seat was trying to decide how she could grow her brand even more, even though she was already selling $80K per month. What? Isn\u2019t that successful enough? Maybe, but it depends on your end goals. This seller wanted to build her brand even more and was unaware of some very obvious things she could do to make what she\u2019s currently doing even more successful and the hot seat session helped her get clarity on a game plan for moving forward and reaching even higher levels of success. You\u2019ve got to hear her amazing story.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[2:23] The value of sitting down around a table with successful people.\n \t[5:54] A powerful testimony from the last TAS Br...", "duration": "43:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS284.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1479461446, "title": "TAS 283 : Ask Scott Session #85 \u2013 Your Business and Marketing Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s always good to learn from the success and failure of someone who is already down the same road you\u2019re walking. That\u2019s one of the reasons Scott does these Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episodes of The Amazing Seller podcast. You can hear other real-life Amazon private label sellers call in to ask Scott a question about their private label sales issues - and who knows, you may hear a question that addresses an issue you\u2019ve been dealing with yourself. \nMy seasonal product has almost sold out. Should I replenish or wait until the next season?\nOn this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast a listener called Scott to ask what he should do in regard to his inventory. He sells a seasonal product that is very successful in the summer months, so it makes sense that in November he\u2019s almost out of stock. He\u2019s curious if it makes sense for him to replenish his product inventory now or to wait to make those purchases until right before his busy season. If you take the time to listen you\u2019ll get to hear how Scott thinks about it - why he believes he's got the best approach - and you might be surprised by his answer.\nCan I create a bundle as a variation of my existing product?\nA listener called in to ask if he can create a bundle product (more than one item included in the one product listing) but do it as a variation of an existing product. He wants to benefit from the reviews and sales he\u2019s already gotten on the \u201cmother\u201d product and would love to do so by adding this bundle as a variation. Do you know the answer to his question? On this episode, Scott answers the question and goes on to give some ideas about bundling products that will work for \u00a0Amazon sellers.\nIs it harder to get started on Amazon today?\nMany people out there in internet land have insisted that the Amazon ship has sailed. They say the market is too crowded, too many people are snatching up the good product ideas, and you don\u2019t have a chance to get significant sales from selling private label products through Amazon. On this episode of the podcast, a caller asked Scott if he thinks there\u2019s still room to successfully sell products on Amazon, and Scott\u2019s answer is a resounding, \u201cYES!\u201d You can learn why Scott feels that selling products on Amazon is still one of the best ways to get a business started by listening to this episode.\nWhy Amazon private label is a great place to start and a terrible place to stop.\nWhile the Amazon marketplace is still a viable option for starting your own product sales business (you can hear why Scott believes so in answer to a listener question, on this episode), Scott believes that Amazon is a terrible place to stop your business efforts. On this episode, Scott reveals why taking action is vital - and how Amazon private label can help you do that - but he also briefly unpacks why it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t plant your flag on Amazon alone.

They\u2019ve been having so much fun they decided to start recording them so you can benefit from their experiences and insights. On this episode, the guys talk about Amazon lightning deals, yet ANOTHER change to the Amazon Terms of Service regarding product reviews, product giveaways, off Amazon sales channels, and much more. Be sure to listen to their great conversation.\nWhat\u2019s an Amazon lightning deal and how do they work?\nOne of the ways Amazon enables sellers to move products is through offering lightning deals. You\u2019ve got to be approved to participate but once you are you can offer your products at discounted prices for a short period of time - but the bonus is that Amazon HELPS YOU promote them in a handful of ways. It\u2019s a great opportunity to sell a lot of products quickly if you know how to use them. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott and his buddies chat about some lightning deal experiences they\u2019ve had recently and how they didn\u2019t pan out as successfully as they had hoped.\nAmazon is changing the review policies AGAIN! Get the scoop on the most recent changes.\nIt was just a few weeks ago that Amazon changed its terms of service regarding product reviews that prohibits discounting products in exchange for reviews. Now it seems that those rules are changing again and it\u2019s surprising that this time it\u2019s AMAZON that\u2019s encouraging a certain type of discount in exchange for reviews\u2026 and it has to do with gift cards. Want to know the whole story? The guys chat about this new development on this episode.\nContests and giveaways: new ideas you can use to sell your Amazon products.\nMore and more creative ways of using contests and product giveaways are being devised where you can encourage people to enter your drawing - thereby building your email list - in hopes of winning one of your products. And there are ways of doing this outside of Amazon, including social media, that can really ramp up your opt-ins and sales at the same time. Find out some of the ways people are successfully using giveaways to promote their products, on this episode.\nIn order to move your business forward, you have to keep learning.\nWhen it comes to setting up contests and sales channels outside of Amazon it\u2019s easy for private label sellers to get intimidated and scared. There\u2019s a lot to learn and it can be a bit confusing when you first start. But on this episode, Chris Shaffer makes the point that everything is at least a little bit confusing when you first start. But once you make the commitment to dive in, learn, and master the process involved in learning the new system you\u2019re able to get it running and working for you in a relatively short period of time. If you\u2019re interested in finding out how to build your business outside of Amazon you\u2019re going to learn a lot from this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the TAS Power Hour.\n \t[4:10] How you can get in on the next event in Phoenix.\n \t[5:02] A lightning deal FAIL story - and why it happened.\n \t[14:09] Yet ANOTHER change to Amazon\u2019s review policy.\n \t[19:10] Giveaway ideas you can use to sell more products.\n \t[39:00] The learning curve issues of using new platforms.\n \t[43:10] TAS Canada.\n \t[49:20] Updates from Amazon about a variety of issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 282\nTAS 282 : (TAS Power Hour) Amazon Promotions - Contest Strategy - Instagram - Dom's 80 Year Old Grandma\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

People panicked, bailed out of Amazon, and encouraged others to do the same. But much of it was an overreaction. The companies and sellers who were doing well long before the policy changes adjusted their strategies and continued making a killing selling their products on Amazon. One of the people who was dramatically impacted by the change was Greg Mercer. His company, Review Kick had to entirely rebrand and change its business model but is still viable and running effectively. Today Scott is chatting with Greg about the things he\u2019s learned from the changes and how he sees Amazon handling the issues it affects.\nWhat did Amazon\u2019s attorneys have to say about the review policy changes?\nOne of the opportunities Greg Mercer had when the Amazon terms of service changed - no longer allowing discounts in exchange for product reviews - was to speak personally with attorneys from Amazon\u2019s legal team to understand the particulars of what the changes mean on a practical level. Today Greg shares what he learned from his conversation with the Amazon legal team and how he understands the terms of service now that they\u2019ve changed. You won\u2019t want to miss what Greg has to share. It could save you a bunch of headaches in the future.\nWhy private label sales on Amazon is an even better opportunity.\nWhen Scott asked his friend Greg Mercer if he still thinks Amazon private label sales is a good opportunity for those who want to start their own online business, Greg said that he believes it\u2019s an even better opportunity than before. He thinks that Amazon\u2019s penchant for changing the rules periodically has scared off those who are unwilling to work hard - those only looking for an easy buck. That leaves more room for those who understand what it takes to build a successful business and are willing to put in the effort. You can hear the ways Greg thinks the recent review policy changes will improve the ability to sell on Amazon on this episode.\nHow the policy changes at Amazon impacted a business built on Amazon reviews.\nGreg Mercer is the head of a company called Review Kick. The focus of the company was to help Amazon sellers get more reviews - and they did so by helping sellers effectively promote discounts in exchange for a review. But Amazon\u2019s terms of service recently changed and that practice is no longer allowed. As you can imagine, it was potentially devastating news for Greg and his team. But rather than throw in the towel they decided to pivot and make their business better than ever, even creating an avenue to expand their user base outside of Amazon sellers. You can hear how Review Kick became Jump Send, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nHow you can effectively use deal sites to promote your products.\nOne of the concerns about Amazon\u2019s changes to its review policy is that any discount offer sellers make might prohibit those discounted customers from being able to leave a review. But Greg Mercer doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. In fact, he\u2019s done a few product promotions on his own since the changes went into effect and has seen reviews of those discounted products post on Amazon. On this episode, Greg gives you his take on what the Amazon legal team says about the new policy changes and tells you how he\u2019s used deal sites like JumpSend to promote his own products.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast and his guest, Greg Mercer!\n \t[2:36] Why Scott invited Greg onto the show again so soon.\n \t[3:53] Greg\u2019s perspective of the day Amazon announced their review changes.\n \t[5:30] Why Greg believes Amazon private label is still a great opportunity.\n \t[7:40] Revealing conversations Greg has recently had with attorneys from Amazon.\n \t[14:20] Do purchases made with discounts limit the purchaser\u2019s ability to review?", "duration": "48:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS281.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1478856606, "title": "TAS 280 : Ask Scott Session #84 \u2013 Your Business Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Fridays are one of Scott\u2019s favorite days of the week because it\u2019s the day that the Ask Scott session of the podcast hits the airwaves. These episodes are designed to do nothing more than help you get your answers about Amazon private label or e-commerce sales answered. Scott\u2019s got years of experience in both realms and is eager to help you become successful selling your products online. If you want to ask Scott a question about your particular situation you can find out exactly how to do that on this episode of the podcast. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll be featured on a future episode of the show!\nI\u2019m having some issues with my supplier putting my logo on my product. Can you help?\nA listener called in to ask Scott about a problem he\u2019s having with his supplier. He\u2019s trying to get his product branded by having the logo imprinted on the product but the supplier is telling him there is not enough space to do a good job of it. He\u2019s curious how this will impact his possibilities of getting his product in Amazon\u2019s brand registry and if there are any other options Scott can think of to get his branding on his product. As you might expect, Scott\u2019s got a great answer for him that includes a couple of possible solutions.\nCan I get multiple manufacturers to work together to create product bundles for me?\nOne of the approaches to building a unique product on Amazon that Scott often suggests is through bundling your primary product with an accessory or other related product. When you do you\u2019re able to offer something that no other Amazon seller is able to offer. It\u2019s a great way to stand out. Today a caller asks if Scott knows of a way he could get his product suppliers (he uses more than one) to work together to bundle his products for him. That way he won't have to have the products shipped to his house and be required to do the work himself. Scott actually knows somebody who is doing that exact thing and has some suggestions for how the caller can handle the situation.\nHow can I discourage others from copying my product?\nAn Amazon seller who is just starting called Scott to ask if there is a way she can discourage others from copying her product now that it\u2019s selling pretty well (15 units a day). Without knowing the particulars of her product and market it\u2019s hard for Scott to give detailed answers but there are some guiding principles he has to share that might help this seller - so he shares them on this episode. If you\u2019d like to do your best to make your product the stand-out item in your market, Scott\u2019s answer to this question may be just what you\u2019re looking for.\nShould I work to keep ahead of my competition in terms of reviews?\nPositive product reviews are important when it comes to Amazon products. They lend a sense of legitimacy to your product, telling potential customers that others have bought and enjoyed your product. But is it important to make sure that you stay ahead of your competition when it comes to the number of reviews you have on your product? On this episode, Scott dives into the issue of reviews and outlines how good reviews help a product and at what point the number of reviews begins to lose its significance. Are you interested to know what he has to say about it?

They have been connecting on Fridays for a while now to do that and thought it would be great to record their conversations and publish them for you to hear. That\u2019s what this episode of The Amazing Seller is - and they\u2019re calling it the TAS Power Hour. And more than simply pontificating about what\u2019s going on they also field questions from people who are watching on Facebook Live and Periscope so you can \u00a0hear them address real-life scenarios and questions as well.\nDoes driving traffic to my Amazon listing help my ranking?\nIt\u2019s a good idea to drive traffic to your product listings on Amazon. No question about it. But you have to understand that while it\u2019s a great thing to get people to your product, if they don\u2019t actually buy the product you could be hurting yourself. On this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott and the guys chat a bit about how the Amazon Algorithm calculates a product\u2019s popularity from visits to the product page. It turns out the action visitors take from there has a huge impact on whether or not the product is ranked higher or lower. How long do they stay on the page? Do they buy? Do they click away from the page? All of it matters, so be sure you listen to discover the best strategies.\nWhat are the best ways to get my product to page 1 - besides pay per click?\nAmazon pay per click is definitely the simplest way to get your products listed at the top of the search rankings, but it costs money. Are there other ways you can rank your products without spending that kind of money? Scott, Chris, and Don say there are only two other ways. The first is to sell products. They don\u2019t say that in a smart alec way but because it\u2019s true. If you could sell products consistently without any PPC or advertising of any kind, Amazon would organically rank you at the top of your category because sales are the main thing the algorithm looks at. But there is another thing you can do to maximize your potential of landing your product on page one, and Scott and the guys tell you what it is on this episode.\nIs it OK to include inserts in my product packaging? What should I include on them?\nThere has been some debate about whether or not it\u2019s OK with Amazon\u2019s terms of service to insert some kind of promotional or call to action card inside your product packaging. Scott, Chris, and Don all feel that it\u2019s totally legitimate to do so. But if you\u2019re going to do it, what should you put on that card? The guys talk about insert cards at length on this episode and address a number of possible things you could include. If you want to know what they think is the absolute best use of insert cards, you need to listen to this Power Hour episode.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to create product giveaways?\nOne of the strategies that Scott, Don, and Chris recommend for promoting your products is the use of product giveaways. You\u2019re able to gather email addresses of people who are interested in your products and get eyes on your products at the same time. But there are ways of doing it that are not quite as good as others and the guys walk through the reasons behind using a professional giveaway service on this episode. If you\u2019re considering a product giveaway you\u2019ll get a good deal of insight from this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this TAS power hour edition of the podcast!\n \t[3:47] Clarifying the new review rules - from conversations with Amazon.\n \t[13:46] The best way to get ranking after running out of stock.\n \t[15:00] Does outside traffic help ranking within Amazon?\n \t[16:18] The only ways to get to page #1 besides pay per click.\n \t[19:34] Best practices for product insert cards.\n \t[21:02] Emailing your customers?

Some people feel that crowded product markets and Amazon\u2019s ability to change the selling platform at any time make it an uphill battle at best. Others feel there\u2019s still lots of opportunity for new sellers and existing sellers alike. On this episode, Scott talks with his friend Jeff Cohen, a man whose company is neck-deep in Amazon related issues. He\u2019s got lots of insight into what\u2019s going on within the inner workings of Amazon and what it takes to build a new product on the Amazon platform successfully. You will get TONS of value from what Jeff has to share, so be sure you listen.\nThere is still lots of optimism surrounding product sales on Amazon.\nWhen Scott asked Jeff Cohen whether or not he feels Amazon is still a viable place for new sellers to get started with an online business, Jeff said that he\u2019s still seeing lots of optimism when it comes to selling products on Amazon. He thinks the key is to learn how to minimize risk - which is what Amazon is doing with their ongoing policy changes - and work successfully within the rules that Amazon establishes. In his mind, the benefits of selling on Amazon far outweigh the negatives. You can hear Jeff\u2019s view on this episode.\nWhy Amazon private label is not a plug-and-play business.\nThere are many people who have started a business on Amazon with the false belief that it\u2019s a plug-and-play type of business. That means they think that putting their product on the Amazon platform will enable them to rake in the money without having to do much to keep the business running. Jeff Cohen says that Amazon businesses are no different than a regular brick and mortar shop in that business owners have to continually be tweaking, adapting, pivoting, and working to build a more successful business than they had the day before. You can hear how Jeff suggests Amazon sellers do that, on this episode.\nAs your Amazon business grows you must learn to reduce your risk.\nThere are many places in the product cycle where risk is part of the game. But as a business owner you have got to learn how to reduce your risks at every point you can. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Jeff Cohen and Scott Voelker chat about what it means to run a true business as a private label seller, working hard to make your processes and products more successful as you go. You will learn a lot from Jeff\u2019s insights as he works behind the scenes for Amazon sellers who use his software products.\nAny Amazon business that\u2019s focused on the customer is going to win.\nThe focus of your efforts promoting and marketing your Amazon private label products should not be about the money. Your focus should be about your customers. If you keep your eyes on what will make your products a better value to your customers you won\u2019t go wrong. Jeff Cohen mentions this powerful point as he emphasizes the importance of working WITH the Amazon terms of service instead of trying to game them to your own advantage. You can hear his insights into how you can do that in this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this interview session of the podcast!\n \t[3:18] Jeff\u2019s background online and with Amazon sales.\n \t[5:05] Why there is still a ton of optimism surrounding Amazon sales.\n \t[11:57] Two thoughts about the danger/concern of having all your eggs in one basket.\n \t[20:06] A big mistake many Amazon sellers make when it comes to quality and safety.\n \t[24:50] What does the review policy change mean for sellers going forward?\n \t[38:24] Scott\u2019s theory about the safest way to follow up with discounted customers.\n \t[47:30] Patience in light of Amazon\u2019s unintended consequences.\n \t[53:33] Jeff\u2019s best advice: Don\u2019t be scared by fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 278\nTAS 278 : How NEW Sellers Can Still Start on Amazon Even with Re...", "duration": "1:02:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS278.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1478248202, "title": "TAS 277 : Ask Scott Session #84 \u2013 Your Business and Marketing Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "If you\u2019ve got question or curiosities banging around in your head about selling products online, Amazon private label, online marketing or business, then you have hit the jackpot! This episode of the Amazing Seller podcast is aimed at answering questions that every day people ask about selling products online or anything else related to online business. You can ask your questions by listening to this episode and following the link Scott shares. Nothing is out of bounds so be sure you take the time to listen and then ASK your questions.\nWhat should I do? I\u2019ve found someone selling my products on eBay!\nA listener called in to ask Scott about something she\u2019s discovered: her products are being sold by someone on eBay. What many private label sellers don\u2019t know is that there are a handful of software packages out there that can be populated with information from an Amazon product listing and then posted automatically on eBay. These software packages can even monitor the price of your items and raise or lower the eBay price automatically in response. Is that something you should be concerned about? If so, what can you do about it? You\u2019ll get to hear Scott\u2019s response on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nI\u2019m trying to determine if a product niche is a good one to get into. Can you guide me?\nWhen you\u2019re considering a product to sell on Amazon as a private label item you want to do some careful product research. But you don\u2019t want to look ONLY at the product and similar products, you also want to look at the entire market surrounding that product. By doing that you can determine if there is enough demand for those types of products to expect that your product would be able to garner enough sales to make the work worth it. Scott goes deep into the issue on this episode so be sure you listen so you can learn how to research a product and market effectively.\nI got a sample product from my supplier and it doesn\u2019t look like the picture I was shown.\nWhen you order products from a supplier, whether a U.S. supplier or a foreign supplier, you want to ensure that you\u2019re getting exactly what you want - in terms of quality and appearance. If you ever receive a sample product or even your final product and it\u2019s not exactly what you want it to be like, you need to remember that you are building a business. You want everything to be top quality for your customers and for the sake of representing your brand. How should you handle a situation where the product you receive is not what you want? Scott\u2019s got the answer on this episode.\nI\u2019m ready to create a logo and packaging for my product. Where do I start?\nOne of the most important aspects of your overall product design is - believe it or not - the logo and packaging.

Remember, all of us are playing on Amazon\u2019s playground and they are the ones who get to make and enforce the rules as they understand them. That means that for any number of reasons the items you sell can be reviewed by the Amazon powers that be and be rejected - even after you\u2019ve been selling them successfully for some time. That\u2019s the exact scenario Eric experienced and he\u2019s with us to tell his story on this episode of the Amazing Seller. Scott isn\u2019t trying to scare you by highlighting Eric's story. He wants to help you avoid these problems with insights from Eric\u2019s experience.\nYou can\u2019t depend on Amazon private label as your only source of income.\nIf you do, it\u2019s only a matter of time until you'll wish you\u2019d diversified your sources of revenue. The reason is that Amazon can and does change things from time to time. The changes often come without warning and in areas that dramatically impact the way you sell and offer your products. Changes of this nature can impact your income dramatically overnight. On this episode, Eric shares a situation where Amazon\u2019s decision about his products slashed his income instantly, he lost his page 1 ranking, and almost got kicked off of Amazon entirely. Please listen to Eric\u2019s story to hear the reasons Amazon put his products on the chopping block so you can safeguard yourself and your products the best you can.\nThe choice not to inspect his products almost got him booted from Amazon.\nEric\u2019s products were selling like crazy. He had great revenue coming in every week, was ranked on page 1 for many of his keywords, and things were running smoothly. At one point he needed to reorder products and decided to shortcut his normal process by not doing an inspection of the products between the supplier and Amazon. In that shipment, some of his products didn\u2019t have a clearly stamped logo on them (they were blurry) and customers complained that they had received a \u201cgeneric\u201d product. Those complaints served as a red flag to Amazon and Eric\u2019s product was suspended without any questions. What did he do to rectify the situation? You can hear the entire process on this episode.\nMuch of the advice you read about importing products from China is wrong.\nSince building his successful Amazon FBA business Eric has moved on to become director of marketing for a company that is American owned but with boots on the ground in China. What he\u2019s come to discover since going to work for the company is that much of what he\u2019d read online by supposed experts about China manufacturing and sourcing is flat out wrong. On this episode Eric shares some great resources you can use to find out the truth about sourcing products from China and how you can safeguard your investment even more, so be sure you listen.\nLearn how to sell private label products on Amazon from this free workshop.\nEvery now and then Scott Voelker offers a free private label workshop that walks would-be Amazon sellers through the 5 steps he\u2019s discovered for researching, sourcing, purchasing, shipping, branding, and listing a product on Amazon. If you\u2019ve been eager to learn how to source your own private label products you won\u2019t believe how much incredible knowledge Scott shares for free in this workshop. Take the time to listen to this episode so you can hear how to get involved in the next private label workshop.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast about account suspension.\n \t[4:15] Eric\u2019s background: how he got started selling Amazon FBA.\n \t[8:08] The need for diversification in your online business efforts.\n \t[9:06] How Eric\u2019s account was suspended by Amazon.\n \t[12:33] The back and forth process with Amazon trying to reconcile things.\n \t[19:24] Tracking down the reasons his products were refused by Amazon.\n \t[22:24] Why the inspection process is so vital...", "duration": "41:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS276.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1477902634, "title": "TAS 275 : How to Liquidate Products to Get Your Cash BACK with Brad Kugler", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "More often than we\u2019d like to admit our choice of a private label product was not the best choice we could have made. It\u2019s either got too much competition or is not in a viable market to expect sufficient volume of sales. When that happens your sales can stall out or never get started at all. If you\u2019ve done everything you can to get your listing optimized and jump start sales but still can\u2019t get things moving, you may need to liquidate those products. On today\u2019s episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott chats with Brad Kugler, who is an experienced liquidator both online and offline. Brad shares some amazingly generous tips on things you can do to sell your products and cut your losses. You won\u2019t want to miss this one.\nWhat does it mean to liquidate your products?\nAnytime you run into a situation where your products are not selling as quickly or for as much as you had anticipated and you forecast that future sales will not be much different, you may be in a situation that requires that you liquidate your products, cut your losses, and move on to another product. Liquidating is the process of selling your products at the best price you can in order to recoup some of the money you\u2019ve spent on the products so you can move on. Today\u2019s episode features a professional liquidator, Brad Kugler. He\u2019s got lots of tips to share about how you can do your own product liquidation quickly. \nCan you use eBay to get rid of products that aren\u2019t selling?\nBrad Kugler says that one of the best tools that you can use to sell products that you want to get rid of is eBay. The platform seems to work very well for product liquidation and he has found that the buyers on eBay are very different from those who typically purchase through Amazon. Therefore you are able to get your products onto Ebay quickly, sell them faster, and get back the money you\u2019ve invested so you can cut your losses and move on. On this episode Brad shares some tools you can use (most of them free) that will help you get your products on eBay and sold as quickly as possible.\nIs retail arbitrage success still possible on Amazon?\nOne of the things Brad Kugler deals with often is the process of doing retail arbitrage. That\u2019s because he often purchases bulk lots of items from stores or vendors that are liquidating and will resell those in whatever way he can. One of those ways is through retail arbitrage. When Scott discovered that Brad is familiar with the current state of retail arbitrage he asked what he thinks about the possibilities of successfully running a retail arbitrage business today. You might be surprised at what Brad has to say, so be sure you listen.\nDo you know about the Amazon Giveaways feature?\nOne of the great Amazon tools that Brad Kruger recommends on this episode of The Amazing Seller is the \u201cAmazon Giveaways\u201d option. It\u2019s a way that you can use the power of Amazon to promote products that you\u2019re willing to giveaway to one winner. But all the other people who enter the contest receive a discount on the same product. This enables you to move a good number of units quickly because Amazon is the trusted source that\u2019s promoting your contest. You\u2019ve got to hear the tricks Brad has discovered to make the giveaway feature work for liquidations, so be sure you listen. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast about product liquidation!\n \t[2:51] What\u2019s the best way to eliminate the need to liquidate products?\n \t[8:31] What Brad has been doing in the liquidation space since 1997.\n \t[13:23] What Brad\u2019s business does today and how he recommends you liquidate.\n \t[19:44] What does Brad do with inventory he purchases?\n \t[22:53] What Brad thinks about the possibilities of retail arbitrage.\n \t[26:48] Tips for retail arbitrage on eBay.\n \t[32:00] Taking advantage of the Amazon Giveaways feature.\n \t[39:06] Using Facebook Groups to help you get rid of products.\n \t[42:20] Scott\u2019s summary of the conversation.", "duration": "47:23", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS275.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1477643432, "title": "TAS 274 : Ask Scott Session #83 \u2013 Your Business and Marketing Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Many people who get started selling products online, whether on eBay, Amazon, or other sites run into snags and obstacles that they can\u2019t figure out how to overcome. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if someone who\u2019s been in those shoes would advise you on what to do to overcome your obstacles? That\u2019s why this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode on Fridays exists.

Be sure you listen so you can learn how to ask Scott a question.\nUnder what circumstances can you place the \u2122 symbol on your products?\nA listener called in because he has a pending trademark application submitted to cover his private label product but he\u2019s not sure what the rules are for whether or not he can include the trademark symbol on his product yet. Thankfully, this guy was smart enough to ask somebody who\u2019s been down that road before - Scott Voelker. Scott\u2019s got a very helpful answer for this listener but he also throws in some thoughts about whether or not worrying about those kinds of little details is really worth the energy and effort. You\u2019ll find out what Scott thinks about it on this episode.\nCan Amazon re-sell your products they have damaged?\nIf you are selling products on Amazon, every now and then you will receive a notification that one of your products was damaged in Amazon\u2019s warehouse. When that happens the company typically asks you what you want to do with it and one of the options is to have Amazon reimburse you for the sales price of the product. What happens if you decide to take the reimbursement? Could Amazon then relist the product as \u201cused\u201d and list it under your original product listing? A listener to the show called in to say, \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happened to me!\u201d and wants to know what he can do about it. You can hear Scott\u2019s answer on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nIs there such a thing as automated product discount codes?\nOne of the strategies that many sellers follow during a product launch is the creation of discount codes to encourage initial sales of their product. A listener called in for this Ask Scott session to find out whether Scott knows of a way that he can produce single-use discount codes and distribute them without having to manually create them and send individual emails to every single person who wants the code.

Since everyone is still rebounding and trying to figure out what the new rules mean for sellers Scott thought he\u2019d take some time to chat with his friend Chris Guthrie who has made it his business to help sellers communicate with their customers. The two of them chat about what these changes mean practically for sellers on this episode. These two guys know their stuff so you\u2019ll get some great insights from what they are thinking and the strategies they are putting in place to help their businesses continue moving forward.\nWhen you play on somebody else\u2019 playground the rules change.\nIf you are going to try to sell your wares on a platform you don\u2019t own (like Amazon, or Facebook, or eBay, or whatever) you\u2019re going to have to play by their rules. And they get to set the rules. And change them. That\u2019s what has happened on Amazon lately and though many people are crying that it\u2019s not fair what you need to understand is that the people who run Amazon get to decide what they are going to require you to do as a seller on Amazon. Period. So you\u2019ve not only got to learn to play by the Amazon rules, you\u2019ve got to adapt each time they change them. Chris and Scott think it\u2019s good for you and for your business to have to pivot like that. It keeps you on your toes and makes you get creative when your competition may not do the same level of work to stay alive.\nThe Amazon review changes kill the strategy of approaching top reviewers.\nIt used to be a great strategy to contact the top Amazon reviewers and offer them a free product if they would leave a review. The belief was that doing so added some clout to your product if a top reviewer left a good review. But with the recent changes to Amazon\u2019s review policy that strategy is out because you can no longer give a discount on your products in exchange for a review. You can hear other effects this change has on the way you build your business and market your products, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nA new way to promote your products to your email list and boost sales.\nEven though you are not allowed to give a discount in exchange for a review, if you\u2019ve done the work of building up a mailing list you can use it to get some spikes in your product sales. For example, you could contact your list and tell them that on this upcoming Saturday you\u2019re going to be offering a $10 off price for 6 hours only. Those people will be the only ones who know about the discount and will go to get the deal. You should sell a good number of products over that time span and your sales ranking will rise accordingly. Then you just need to follow up via Amazon email and your own list to encourage those purchasers to leave a product review. Scott and Chris have more ideas like this on this episode of the podcast.\nPrivate Label sales on Amazon are far from over.\nMany people are all doom and gloom about the recent changes on Amazon but on this episode, Scott and his buddy Chris Guthrie chat about why there is still plenty of opportunities for people to get started selling products on Amazon. The recent changes actually make thing similar to how Amazon was when both Scott and Chris began their sales journey on Amazon. In that respect the changes don\u2019t seem all that bad to them. They share some new strategies and approaches to building an Amazon business on this episode so be sure you listen.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast discussion with Chris Guthrie!\n \t[3:40] A shout out to the iTunes reviewers and Facebook community.\n \t[6:20] Chris\u2019 initial thoughts about the changes happening on Amazon.\n \t[9:20] How this change is similar to changes Google has made over the years.\n \t[13:20] The reason top reviewer requests are not possible anymore.\n \t[19:30] Why building an email list is your best a...", "duration": "48:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS273.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1477297813, "title": "TAS 272 : How to Prevent Being Bullied by Sellers and Know Your RIGHTS!", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s becoming more and more common that unscrupulous Amazon sellers are sending letters to their competitors that sound very official and legal but are fakes. These letters are sent to intimidate competitors into taking down their listings and eventually removing their products from Amazon altogether. The practice is a kind of bullying that Ted Luymes, an attorney who deals with Amazon related issues in his practice sees all the time. On this episode, Ted shares some of the things to look for if you receive a letter like that and gives advice on what you can do to make the bullying stop.\nWhat if somebody says you\u2019ve infringed on their product\u2019s patent?\nEven if you were very thorough when you went through the product research phase it\u2019s possible that you have infringed on someone\u2019s patent, but you won\u2019t know unless you did an actual patent search, which can be expensive. On this episode, Ted Luymes talks about the steps you can take to assure yourself first of all that your product is not stepping over legal lines, but also what you can do if someone accuses you of doing so. He\u2019s got great advice for you so be sure you take the time to listen.\nWhat does Amazon do if a complaint is made that you\u2019re infringing on a copyright?\nAny Amazon seller has the right to file a complaint with Amazon that claims another seller has infringed on their product patent, copyright, or trademark. When this happens Amazon typically doesn\u2019t ask questions first, they just take the listing down. Then they begin an investigative process. On this episode of The Amazing Seller attorney Ted Luymes shares what you can do to expedite the process if this happens to you. You\u2019ll want to hear this because the longer you are on the Amazon platform the more likely it is that you\u2019ll experience things of this nature.\nDo you know how to use a DMCA counter-notice?\nIf Amazon happens to suppress your product listing or take your listing off of their platform because of a copyright or patent complaint, you have the right to file a DMCA counter-notice. By law, the person or entity who filed the claim that you\u2019ve violated their copyright or patent has a limited amount of time after that to prove their claim. If they don\u2019t, Amazon must put your listing back on the platform. That\u2019s how the law works. But there are a number of steps you should take before you resort to the DMCA notice. Do you know what they are? Attorney Ted Luymes is on the show today to give us the answers.\nWhen you deal with people regarding your Amazon business, learn to be professional.\nImagine this scenario: You\u2019ve just opened your mail and find a cease and desist letter from another Amazon seller. They say you are selling an unauthorized version of their product that infringes on their copyright. If this happens to you the last thing you should do is write a snarky or angry email reply. There are much better ways to deal with the situation. On this episode, Attorney Ted Luymes gives some solid advice about how you should respond to those kinds of letter or notices and tells why it\u2019s so important to do so if you want a favorable outcome to the issue.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this podcast episode with Attorney Ted Luymes.\n \t[2:38] The reality of the bumps in the road that come in business.\n \t[4:20] The kinds of bullying Ted has been seeing.\n \t[9:10] What can be done if a product is infringing on a patent?\n \t[11:28] How does Amazon respond to accusations of copyright or trademark infringement?\n \t[14:28] What should you look for if you receive a cease and desist letter?\n \t[21:00] What is a DMCA counter notice and how should it be used?\n \t[24:56] Advice about how to learn to write messages and emails that are professional.\n \t[28:55] Why is it good right to buy out a competitor\u2019s inventory if they hijack your listing.\n \t[36:24] Get in on the next TAS LIVE event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 272", "duration": "39:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS272.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1477038638, "title": "TAS 271 : Ask Scott Session #82 \u2013 Your Online Business Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s time for the next Friday episode of The Amazing Seller podcast - the \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode where Scott Voelker, an experienced online business guy and Amazon seller answers listener questions.

You may not be thinking about that possibility now but the opportunity may come your way someday. That\u2019s why Scott wanted to have someone on the show who is experienced at buying and selling online businesses who could shed some light on what can be done ahead of time to ensure that should the time come that you want to sell your business, you\u2019ll be able to do it with the least amount of trouble and the greatest amount of profit. You can hear more about this exciting possibility on this episode of The Amazing Seller. \nIf you do the right thing by your customer, you won\u2019t have any problems.\nToo often businesses are built on the strategy of doing everything possible to take advantage of the loopholes in a sales platform\u2019s terms of service. The practice may result in huge profits in a short amount of time but as soon as the platform learns that sellers are abusing the system you can be sure that changes will be made and those businesses will be dramatically hurt, and possibly kicked off of the platform. Today\u2019s guest has tons of experience buying and selling e-commerce businesses and his advice is simple: Do the right thing by your customers and you\u2019ll be OK when it comes to surviving whatever changes do come. You can hear more sage advice like this on this episode.\nSet up good clean financials to sell your business more easily and get more offers.\nMany entrepreneurs start out doing whatever it takes to make a buck. They may set up one umbrella LLC or Corporation and run all the finances for many smaller business ventures through that one entity. That\u2019s OK at first. It\u2019s entirely legal and most people have to do that to get started. But if you ever want to sell one of those businesses you\u2019re going to discover that there will be fewer buyers interested because you won\u2019t be able to clearly demonstrate the profits of that business on its own. So today\u2019s guest has some tips on how to set up good clean financials for your business so that you can be ready to sell it easily and for more when the time comes.\nA business that is successful both on and off of Amazon sells faster and for more.\nIf you\u2019re considering the sale of your Amazon private label business it\u2019s entirely possible. But will you get top dollar? You won\u2019t if your business is only selling on Amazon. A potential buyer will be more averse to buying your business if you are selling your products on only one platform because if something on that platform changes in a way that adversely impacts your business, their revenue stream could dry up if they were to buy your business. But if the risk is spread out over many sales channels, they\u2019ll be more open to considering your business. On this episode of the podcast, you\u2019re going to learn how important it is to start building those sales funnels and establishing an off-Amazon presence for the sake of selling your business in the future, on this episode.\nBuying an existing business can be a very good investment.\nThere\u2019s so much emphasis these days on building a great online business, and it\u2019s a great strategy for many people. But what if you\u2019re a person who doesn\u2019t really want to go through the hassle and hard work of building a business from the ground up but would be open to buying an existing business and growing it? That\u2019s a great strategy, one that today\u2019s guest sees implemented all the time. If you\u2019ve got money to invest in a business and are curious how it works you can learn a lot from Scott\u2019s guest today, so be sure you listen.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[4:23] How Joe developed his expertise selling online businesses.\n \t[5:36] How updates on web platforms can impact ecommerce businesses.", "duration": "41:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS270.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1476693055, "title": "TAS 269 : Is Private Label DEAD Now? (New Plan)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "There\u2019s a lot of stress being felt in the private label community since Amazon has made changes to its product review policy. But is it living up to the doom and gloom we\u2019ve heard from some people? Scott doesn\u2019t think so. In fact, he believes this is a good thing for anyone who wants to be successful in private label sales. On this episode of the podcast, Scott is going to tell you why this policy change is a good thing and what you can do to make the most of it.\nWhat would you do to sell a product if Amazon didn\u2019t exist?\nIf there was no Amazon - what would you do to sell a product online? You\u2019d probably figure out a different way to do product research. You\u2019d learn about other platforms where you could sell your products online (Etsy and Ebay come to mind). You\u2019d figure out what it takes to sell on your own website and drive traffic to it using Facebook Ads or Google Adwords. The point is that even if Amazon was totally gone you\u2019d still be able to sell products. It may be a bit more difficult than it is now, but it would be possible. That\u2019s why you need to understand that the recent change to Amazon\u2019s product review policy is not the end of the world. Find out how Scott is moving his private label business forward in spite of the changes, on this episode.\nPrivate Label will never die. Here\u2019s why.\nThe term \u201cprivate label\u201d means that somebody is selling a product of their own. They\u2019ve sourced it. They are packaging it. They are distributing it. It is THEIR product. That happens every day and you see the outcome of it on the shelves of Walmart and other stores across the nation. You will always be able to create your own product and sell it. The recent changes to Amazon\u2019s review policy don\u2019t change that at all. It only limits the WAY you can go about promoting your products. So what are you going to do? You\u2019re going to have to figure out ways to advance the sales of your products within the boundaries you have - and part of that is Amazon Terms of Service. Find out how Scott recommends you take advantage of the new changes, on this episode.\nGaming the system only lasts so long. That\u2019s what the Amazon review policy is about.\nNo matter what the rules are that govern an online platform, somebody will work the rules to their advantage and do everything they can to milk that advantage for as long as possible. We call it \u201cgaming the system\u201d and those who run the platform in question will eventually make changes to keep people from unfairly using their systems. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened with Amazon\u2019s recent changes to product review policies. On this episode, you get to listen in as Scott thinks out loud about what these changes mean for him and his business as well as discover what he plans to do to keep his products selling like normal.\nThis Amazon review change is good news. It levels the playing field.\nThere was a time when companies that had deep pockets were able to offer dramatic discounts in order to entice people to leave them a review on Amazon. That, in turn, made it look like many people loved their product, when in fact, it may not have been the case. As a result, the little guys were not able to keep up and fell further and further behind the sales curve. But not anymore. The recent policy changes to Amazon\u2019s Terms of Service have put an end to that practice so now everyone has an equal chance of getting favorable reviews from legitimate buyers. Find out what the changes are and how they impact your Amazon private label business, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[5:36] Understanding why people buy products online and what would it be like if Amazon was not even part of the equation?\n \t[8:45] The role affiliate sales could play in business success.\n \t[12:00] Why it\u2019s good news that Amazon still exists as a sales platform.\n \t[16:00] The importance of building an email list.", "duration": "35:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS269.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1476433826, "title": "268 : Ask Scott Session #81 \u2013 Your FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Scott is back with another \u201cAsk Scott\u201d session of the podcast. Be sure you listen to these real answers to real listener questions, submitted by Amazon private label sellers. On this episode, Scott answers questions about product photos, what to do to increase your ranking once you\u2019ve run out of product inventory, how to modify your products to be a feasible offer in a different country, and how to build an email list as an ongoing asset to your business. As usual, you\u2019re going to get a truckload of value from this episode, so be sure you listen.\nShould I switch my product into a different market?\nImagine that you sell an electrical adapter. As you probably know, it would have to be a different model adapter if it was going to be used in Europe than if it was to be used in the United States. Today's episode features a question from a private label seller who has a product that has similar unique qualities that vary from country to country. He's got questions about what he should do to generate more sales when his product details don't exactly match the country he's selling in. It's an interesting conundrum that Scott answers, on this episode.\nMy product ranked well before I ran out of inventory. Now I can\u2019t get it selling again. Help!\nThere are times when your products on Amazon sell faster than you expected (a good problem to have). But it causes issues because you run out of product, which in turn causes your sales rank and organic search ranking to go down for as long as you are out of inventory. When the product is back in stock, it\u2019s sometimes hard to get the product ranking and selling again. On this episode, Scott answers a listener question about how to get a restocked product selling again. It\u2019s a problem you\u2019re bound to run into eventually so be sure you listen to find out how to handle the situation.\nShould you put a watermark on your product photos to keep them from being stolen?\nMany Amazon sellers know about the possibility of someone hijacking their products. It\u2019s something we are all vulnerable to but there are things you can do to protect yourself. A listener of the podcast called in to ask if one thing that could be done is to watermark his photos. That would make it easier for him to prove that the photos belonged to him. But Scott\u2019s not so sure it\u2019s a good idea and says that he will probably never do it himself. Find out why Scott is not too keen on the idea of watermarks on product photos, on this episode of the podcast.\nI need to start building an email list. What\u2019s the best way to do it?\nIt seems like every episode Chris Shaffer is on lately he harps on the fact that an email list is your single most valuable asset as an Amazon private label seller. The reason he believes it so strongly is because it\u2019s the only way you can contact your customers and prompt sales of your products anytime you want to do so. Today\u2019s episode features a question from a listener to wants some tips about how to go about building his first email list. Scott\u2019s covered the issue before but thinks the issue is so important he was willing to address it again. You can hear how he suggests you get started building your own email list, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:46] Thoughts on the big changes to the review policies on Amazon.\n \t[2:50] The upcoming TAS Breakthrough LIVE.\n \t[4:07] QUESTION ONE: Do you think photos on Amazon should be watermarked?\n \t[8:35] QUESTION TWO: I sold out of my first product in a month and had no inventory for 2 weeks.

What Amazon has said is, \"No, you can't.\" that's going to be a problem for many private label sellers because they have centered their entire product launch sequence around the allowance of reviews for a discount. So how does this impact the way we go about launching a new private label product on Amazon? That\u2019s what this roundtable discussion with Scott Voelker, Chris Shaffer, and Dom Sugar is all about. The guys chat about the actual policy change, what it means for product launches, and why in some ways, it\u2019s a better thing for the private label community overall. You can hear the entire conversation on this episode of the Amazing Seller podcast.\nThe recent Amazon review changes actually level the playing field for all private label sellers.\nIt\u2019s important to look at the recent changes to Amazon\u2019s review policies from the perspective of a brand new seller. Before this change the climb to a successful product launch was made very difficult because competitors with bigger budgets were able to invest lots of cash in building reviews through giving huge discounts to potential customers in exchange for a review. But now, Amazon has removed that possibility so everyone is required to launch their product without the benefit of huge discounts in exchange for a review. In short, the big boys in any niche now have to deal with the same limits as the little guys. You can hear more insights into the ways the little guy seller benefits from the recent Amazon review changes, on this episode.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about reviews, I care about sales!\u201d\nThe strategy of getting lots of reviews on Amazon for your products is meant to build the social proof for the value and quality of your products. That way more people will possibly feel comfortable buying your product because others have done so, and are happy with it. But that\u2019s all assuming that more reviews equal more sales. But it\u2019s not always the case. Scott has interviewed plenty of sellers who have launched and gotten a huge jump on product sales without any reviews. On this episode, both Chris and Dom agree that sales are much more important than reviews, not only because sales put cash in your pocket but also because sales are what causes your product to rank higher in the Amazon search results. Reviews don\u2019t do either of those things for you. Find out more about how the guys view this Amazon policy change, on this episode.\nWhy did Amazon make its change to the review policies?\nEverything Amazon does is to increase the ability of sellers to sell quality products. That\u2019s how Amazon makes its money, through sales of truly helpful, high-quality products. The recent changes to the \u201creview in exchange for a discount\u201d policy is aimed at making sure that the reviews given for products actually reflect the product quality, instead of being done in exchange for a personal benefit to the reviewer. That should enable the reviews on any product listing to be more honest, giving potential buyers more assurance that the products they buy from Amazon are something they will be happy with. Amazon will have fewer return issues and the platform itself will become better trusted and more effective. But the change will require sellers to come up with new ways to launch their products and use reviews effectively. You can hear how Scott, Chris, and Dom are thinking about the issue at this point, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nIf you\u2019re going to run your own private label business, you\u2019ve got to learn how to flex with the changes.\nAs with any business, Amazon private label sellers have to learn how to adjust to the market and selling platform changes.

My guest today is Paul and he built his own private label sales business from scratch - and started out with only $30. That\u2019s right - $30. On this episode, he debunks many ideas about getting started with online sales by sharing exactly how he took each step to move from a $30 investment to thousands of dollars in sales every month. You can hear the whole thing on this episode of the podcast.\nOvercoming the fear and roadblocks to building your own private label business.\nFear is a natural response to something you don\u2019t understand. You wonder if you\u2019ll have what it takes to handle the difficulties and challenges the situation may bring. But fear is also something that you can use to your advantage to motivate and drive you forward. On this episode, Paul shares how he stepped past the fear he felt by taking small, less risky steps to assure himself as he went along. It\u2019s a smart strategy and one that worked out very well for him. You can hear the entire story on this episode of the podcast.\nStarting small from where you are is the key to success.\nThere\u2019s nothing that can really hold you back from becoming successful at private label sales if you really want to be successful. Paul\u2019s story is a great example of that. He started out very small, with only $30 worth of product. As that began to sell he purchased more with the profits and scaled the business larger and larger over time. You don\u2019t have to order tons of product right off the bat and Paul\u2019s story demonstrates how true that is. You\u2019ll get to hear Paul\u2019s story, the steps he took all along the way to success, and where he\u2019s come over time on this episode. You can also hear what he\u2019s doing now to expand his business beyond Amazon, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nWhy you need to think outside Amazon with your product sales.\nAmazon is a wonderful place to get started with online product sales. The FBA setup is one of the simplest and easiest ways to get started and everyone interested in product sales should at least look into it. But Amazon is not the end game - or shouldn\u2019t be. There are many risky aspects to using Amazon that you want to consider when it comes to the long-term sustainability of your business. On this episode Scott and his guest, Paul talk about the kinds of things they\u2019ve seen that have caused them to look outside Amazon to establish their own, entirely controllable platform for generating income for themselves. You\u2019ll learn a lot just from this short part of their conversation.\nBEST ADVICE: Take it step by step to get started building your own business.\nAs Scott wrapped up this interview with his guest, Paul he asked what one piece of advice Paul would give to people who are considering Amazon private label sales. Paul\u2019s advice flows right out of his own experience: take it step at a time and go slowly. Nobody says you\u2019ve got to invest tons of money or do highly risky things to get a business going. Amazon FBA makes it possible for you to start as small or as large as you are comfortable starting and to grow your efforts from there. If you wonder if it\u2019s really possible to succeed at private label sales, you need to hear Paul\u2019s story. He\u2019s got a great one to tell and it will benefit you to hear it.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[3:40] \u00a0How you can get into the TAS Breakthrough LIVE.\n \t[6:34] Paul\u2019s income through e commerce and private label: how he got started.\n \t[14:34] The road toward his own products.\n \t[16:30] Paul\u2019s first attempts in paying for his products and why he went slowly.\n \t[21:19] Why you don\u2019t have to start with a huge order of products.\n \t[24:29] How Paul gets his traffic back after running out of products.\n \t[26:43] Paul\u2019s efforts to add a second product: frequently bought together.", "duration": "52:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS266.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1475829012, "title": "TAS 265 : Ask Scott Session #80 \u2013 Your FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s time for Scott Voelker to answer your questions about Amazon Private Label sales because this is the Friday episode of the Amazing Seller Podcast.

Listen to this episode to find out how you can ask your own questions.\nA new idea for using another product for building a sales funnel for your product.\nA listener called into the show to share a strategy he\u2019s been using to promote his products and build his email list -and it\u2019s not the normal thing that you hear of people doing. He\u2019s creating a giveaway contest where people who enter have to submit their email address to be entered - but the giveaway item he\u2019s using is not his product. It's a very desirable one in the same niche as his product. That enables him to follow up via an email list to all the contest entrants with pitches and helpful information that relate directly to his product. You\u2019ll not only hear how the strategy is working for him but you\u2019ll also get to hear what Scott thinks of the idea, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to assess if a product idea is a good one?\nWhen it comes to product research there are so many things that you need to take into consideration that it\u2019s impossible to cover them all in a short blurb like this. But what we can say is this: There\u2019s more to it than simply looking at sales numbers. You\u2019ve got to be able to look behind the numbers to understand the sales cycles of the product niche you have in mind so that you can make a better-informed decision. On this episode, Scott points you to a powerfully helpful resource that can help you do product research and make better decisions about the products you offer on Amazon private label.\nMy sales conversions are low. What can I do to improve sales?\nThe sales conversion numbers you see relating to your Amazon products have so many moving pieces that it\u2019s almost impossible to talk about all of them on one podcast episode. But the main thing you need to keep in mind is that sales are ultimately an issue of traffic to your product listing. If you can get the eyes of people who are interested in your product to actually see it, then you have a much better chance of selling them the product. But if they never see your product then naturally they won\u2019t become a customer. On this episode, Scott talks about the main strategies you can pursue to get more eyes on your products. \nDoes the amount of inventory I have available on Amazon impact my search rank?\nToday Scott fields a very interesting question that he\u2019s never been asked before. Here it is: \u201cIf I have a low amount of product on the shelves of Amazon\u2019s warehouses but my competition has a high amount of product available in Amazon\u2019s inventory, does my low inventory number negatively impact my search ranking?\u201d Scott admits this is a question he\u2019s never really given much thought to but after being asked about it, he decided to ponder it a bit. You can hear his answer on this episode and find out what he recommends to keep your product inventory higher regardless.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:40] Scott\u2019s disclaimer: it has to do with juicing!\n \t[2:46] QUESTION ONE: A tip for building product sales funnels.\n \t[9:33] QUESTION TWO: How do you verify that a product is a good product?\n \t[13:07] QUESTION THREE: I\u2019m having very low conversions on my products.

This episode of the podcast is a replay recording of one of the recent power hours where he and his friend Chris Schaeffer discuss a handful of important strategies you can use to increase product sales on and off of Amazon. You\u2019ll probably hear some ideas on this episode that you\u2019ve not heard before and Scott and Chris walk you through the steps it takes to put most of them in place and begin profiting.\nThe benefits of live events and why TAS Breakthrough LIVE is a BETTER event.\nScott and Chris recorded this episode of the podcast live at a conference that the two of them attended together. The things they heard and experienced at the event caused them to chat about the benefits of that kind of event and why Scott has put together a different kind of event. You\u2019ll be intrigued by their ideas and the benefits of a low number, hands-on event like Scott and Chris hold frequently. Find out how you can get into the next TAS LIVE event on this episode.\nHow content overload can lead to content paralysis.\nOne of the things Chris and Scott realized as they experienced the Content and Commerce event was that events (and podcasts) can provide so much content and great information that the people attending or learning can become a bit paralyzed. They don\u2019t know where to start, what step to take first, how much of what they\u2019re learning applies to their current situation, and more. On this episode the two of them talk about that situation and why they take care not to let themselves get into a place of paralysis. You\u2019ll learn a lot by listening to this one.\nThe impact of variations in product sales.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard Scott talk about the addition of product variations to your product line. What are the benefits of adding variations to your products? Does a variation actually add to your workload of stocking product SKUs without adding much financial benefit? There are many concerns about the approach of product variations and Scott and Chris address all of those questions on this episode of the show.\nWhy an email list is your most valuable asset.\nChris Shaeffer has said it before and he\u2019ll continue to say it: Your email list is the greatest asset your business owns. On this episode, as he and Scott talked about the importance of an email list for any business that sells products or services, Chris covered how you can use your email list to target your audience through platforms like Facebook and how you can also use it to create what\u2019s called a lookalike audience of potential customers who could quickly and naturally opt-in to your email list - and it all starts with compiling your own customer list in the first place.

But they take far too long to get started. There are reasons they hesitate and reasons they never get started. On this episode, Scott is going to talk about the fear that accompanies the dream of starting a business and how to overcome it. You\u2019ll benefit a ton from this episode so you should make the time to listen, learn, and take action.\nWhy is Amazon the best way to get started selling online?\nThere are many reasons Amazon is the ideal place to begin selling for the first time. First off, the traffic on Amazon already exists. People are there looking for products without you having to go find them. There\u2019s no fancy website needed so you can get started with less upfront work. You also don\u2019t need a shopping cart so the learning curve is even smaller! Here\u2019s a big one\u2026 You don\u2019t have to store products at your house. And finally, you can do this yourself. In other words, you don\u2019t need employees. Today Scott is going to tell you how to step past your fear to get started with Amazon private label sales.\nThere are reasons people fail at Amazon private label sales.\nMuch of the time the fear of failure is a primary reason people don\u2019t get started selling their product ideas on Amazon. But that fear can be dealt with powerfully if you understand the most common reasons people fail and avoid the mistakes they make. On this episode, Scott is going to walk you through some of the most common mistakes that lead to failure and tell you how to avoid them. You\u2019ll get an earful of insight through this episode, so be sure you listen.\nAre you looking at product reviews as part of your product discovery process?\nPretend for a moment that there\u2019s some reason that you can\u2019t sell products on Amazon. But you still have access to the reviews people leave regarding products they have purchased on Amazon. Do you see that the data you are able to glean from the reviews about existing products are a wonderful way for you to research whether people want a specific product? It also tells you some of the main issues purchasers are having with the products as they currently exist. Once you know those things you could create the same product with improvements and sell it on your own website or another channel. Scott gives some great ideas about how to use reviews for product research, on this episode.\nThe fear you feel about choosing private label products is not unique to you.\nIn fact, if you didn\u2019t feel fear about making a wise product choice you would be in a dangerous place and you'd likely make some dumb decisions as a result. The fear forces you to do your homework, to look at all the indicators, to examine the data about whether or not the product you have in mind has the possibility of being a winner at all. On this episode, Scott\u2019s insight into the process of selecting a product for private label sales will help ease your mind and give you the confidence to step past your fears.

That\u2019s what you get on this episode of The Amazing Seller. These Friday episodes are \u201cAsk Scott\u201d sessions where Scott Voelker answers questions listeners submit, in detail, and completely. No half-measures here. You\u2019ll be benefitted by what you hear others going through and what Scott has to say to advise them. Be sure you take some time to listen.\nHow do review groups work and is there a way I can pay Amazon fewer fees on promotions?\nWhen you do a promotion or giveaway to get your products noticed or reviewed, there are costs you still have to pay Amazon for the privilege of using their platform. It\u2019s just a cost of doing business. Among the misconceptions is that people feel like since they\u2019re giving away a product, they shouldn\u2019t have to pay fees. But any brand new business needs to make sure they let others know they exist - and that\u2019s called marketing. It\u2019s an expense of any business. You can hear how Scott addresses reviews, discounts, and giveaways and the fees involved, on this episode.\nHow to list a product on Amazon that is already there under a brand name.\nA listener just purchased a company that owns a patented product and some of his existing distributors have the product available on Amazon. He\u2019s curious if he should set up his own brand listing or if there is a way to combine their listings with his since it\u2019s his product. Scott\u2019s got a very helpful, clarifying answer to situations like this on this episode. Make sure you listen to this response because there are multiple applications of this concept to product sales on Amazon.\nHow soon should I start building an email list for my products or brand?\nA listener today has heard Scott talk about the importance of building an email list but he\u2019s a bit confused about why it\u2019s important for a beginning private label seller, whether it\u2019s worth his efforts, and how he should go about it when he begins using it. There are some great questions there. Is it really necessary for a new seller to begin creating an email list from the beginning? You can hear Scott\u2019s in-depth response to this important question on this episode. He even tells you how to go about getting people to opt-in to your email list.\nHow would it benefit you to be in a room with experienced Amazon sellers to get their feedback on your products?\nWhat benefit would you receive to sit with 20 to 30 experienced Amazon sellers as they analyze and give feedback about your product listings to help you optimize them for more sales? How would it benefit you to sit in the room as the same thing is done for others? You can probably see that you\u2019d get a ton of value from seeing through the eyes of other sellers. The good news is that you can do this coming up November of 2017 at Scott\u2019s live TAS event in Phoenix, Arizona.

They\u2019re calling these \u201cTAS Power Hours\u201d and they\u2019ve been a lot of fun so far. Today\u2019s podcast episode is a republication of one of those power hours that was done recently and it has some incredible content about current issues being experienced selling on Amazon. You\u2019ll get to hear a lot about new ways people are hijacking listings, brand registry, product research, and more.\nIs Amazon hijacking listings?\nMany people who sell private label products on Amazon are concerned about people hijacking their listing. That means that a person comes into your listing and offers similar, but not the same products under your listing. There are ways they can do that and gain control over the product listing to change things and potentially damage your brand. It turns out that there are some new ways that hijackers are taking over listings using some of Amazon\u2019s own tools - so it looks like Amazon has taken over the listing. It\u2019s a bit confusing so make sure you listen to this episode.\nAmazon brand registry is even more important for private label sellers these days.\nBecause of the more creative ways that black hat folks are taking over product listings (hijacking) it\u2019s more important than ever that you get your product brand listed on Amazon\u2019s brand registry. It\u2019s not a defense against being hijacked but it definitely gives you the right to get the control of your listings back if they are hijacked. You\u2019ll want to hear this discussion about brand registry and how you can take steps to get your product line registered with Amazon.\nAre you afraid of choosing the wrong private label product?\nOne of the things that Scott hears often is that many people see the opportunity of selling private label products via Amazon but are scared to take the plunge because they are concerned that they will choose the wrong product. It\u2019s a reasonable fear, and one that Chris Schaeffer says he feels every time he chooses a product. But should that be a reason not to get started? Everybody on the podcast today says, \u201cNO!\u201d You\u2019ve got to hear why they say that on this episode.\nShould you try to launch a product on Amazon that isn\u2019t there at this point?\nSome people who consider selling products on Amazon think that their wonderful new idea or invention is a perfect fit for Amazon private label. But if the product is brand new to Amazon - there\u2019s nothing even close to it already selling - there are reasons to be cautious. What you might do first is launch a product in the same niche that IS already on the platform, then once it\u2019s rolling and you have a good email list and customer base, launch your new product. You can hear how the guys would go about doing it on this episode of the podcast.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this power hour episode of the podcast!\n \t[2:54] The next TAS live event on November 5 & 6, 2016.\n \t[6:44] Getting hijacked by Amazon?

One of the ways he\u2019s able to do that more effectively is to pass along what he\u2019s learned by teaching you about it. Lately, he's been learning quite a bit concerning retail VS online sales from the television show, Shark Tank. He\u2019s hearing some repeated themes and stories from the show and wants to pass along his observations to you so that you can learn some of the things he\u2019s noticed. So take a few minutes to invest in your own education by hearing what Scott has noticed from the experts on Shark Tank. You\u2019ll be glad you did.\nDo you understand what \u201cproof of concept\u201d means?\nOne of the things Scott has noticed when he watches Shark Tank is that the investors always ask about sales numbers right from the start. Why do they do that? It\u2019s because sales numbers indicate that there is already interest in the type of product that the newcomer is proposing. That\u2019s called \u201cproof of concept\u201d and it means that there's good reason to expect success with the product you\u2019re wanting to create and sell. Scott\u2019s got some ideas about how you can use the tools provided on Amazon to discover if there\u2019s adequate proof of concept for the products you want to sell, on this episode.\nDo you have to educate people about your product before they will buy?\nPeople come to Scott all the time with a great new product idea that is entirely original. He\u2019s all for new products coming to the market but he also knows that if there're no other products in the market like it then there may not be enough demand to warrant creating the product in the first place. On this episode, Scott\u2019s going to talk about that situation and give you some ideas for what you should do if your DO indeed have an entirely new product.\nWhat should you do if you have an entirely original product?\nAnytime a world-changing new development or technology comes on the scene there\u2019s a ton of work and money that goes into helping the public understand exactly what it is, why it\u2019s needed, and how to use it to best effect. As Amazon sellers, few of us have the resources to launch that kind of product on the scale needed to accomplish all of those things. What should do if you have a world-changing product that nobody\u2019s heard of? On this episode, Scott gives you some suggestions regarding what he would do if he was in that situation.\nWhy do you want your products to be in retail stores?\nMany of the people who bring product or company ideas to the Shark Tank TV show are seeking investment money because they want to get their products into retail stores. That\u2019s not a bad idea but many times it\u2019s premature given their situation. On this episode, Scott shares what he\u2019s noticed about the advice the \u201csharks\u201d give those people and relates it to Amazon sales and business. You\u2019ll learn a lot from what he has to share so be sure you listen.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[2:52] A shout out to some recent iTunes reviewers.\n \t[5:33] The concept of \u201cproof of concept\u201d and what it means.\n \t[9:40] Do you have to educate people about your product before they buy?\n \t[14:30] What to do if you have an entirely original product.\n \t[17:03] Should you shoot for getting your products into retail stores?\n\n********PLAYER & RESOURCE BANNER/TRANSCRIPT HEADER - SAME EVERY TIME***\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 260\nTAS 260 - 3 Things Millionaires and Billionaires Taught me about Choosing Good Products and Retail vs Online Sales\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

And the person answering your questions is Scott Voelker, an experienced online businessman, and Amazon seller. You can also hear how to ask your own questions, so be sure to listen and learn!\nThe power of surrounding yourself with like-minded people.\nScott has recently moved from upstate New York to South Carolina and he\u2019s noticed the difference his surroundings are making on his own mindset. In particular, he\u2019s aware of the people in his neighborhood. Their focus on fitness and healthy eating are impacting Scott and his family, encouraging them toward their own version of fitness and health. It\u2019s an example of why the people you surround yourself with are hugely important for your life - and Scott's got some encouragement for YOU along that line, on this episode. \nWhat are the pros and cons of listing a new product as a variation VS a stand alone product?\nMany people are discovering opportunities to create multiple products based on their first product. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as creating a variation of the product (color, size, etc.) and other times it\u2019s a new product that is different in a unique or significant way. On this episode, Scott covers the advantages of variations VS new product listings and encourages Amazon sellers to think about who they are targeting with their product as one way to decide whether there are advantages to one approach over the other. Be sure you listen if you\u2019re interested in creating multiple products as a spin-off from your original product. \nHow does my product rating relate to my number and quality of reviews?\nThere isn\u2019t any way to know for sure how your product rating relates to your reviews simply because Amazon doesn\u2019t reveal how its algorithm works when it comes to product ratings. But there are some things you can focus on to help you improve your product rating. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott gives a couple of very practical things you can focus on to improve your product rating overall. Both are simple but do take some time. So make sure you listen and commit yourself to doing the work to improve your business and products.\nI\u2019m creating product packs from a bulk quantity but I\u2019m having trouble scaling.\nA listener called in to ask for help from Scott concerning scaling his sales to a higher level. He\u2019s purchasing bulk size orders of various products and breaking the bulk packaging apart to place the individual products into smaller quantity packages. The problem is that the labor of doing so is slowing down his ability to scale his sales. It\u2019s a very creative and intriguing idea that\u2019s getting good sales traffic but he wants to have more opportunity. Scott\u2019s got some great ideas about how he can leverage others to help him scale the business.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[2:20] The TAS power hour - a Facebook/Periscope broadcast - Fridays 1PM Eastern.\n \t[4:01] The power of surrounding yourself with like-minded people.\n \t[9:12] QUESTION ONE: What are the pros and cons of listing variations VS stand alone products.\n \t[16:08] QUESTION TWO: My product rating is at 3.9 out of 5.

Many people experience brain-lock when it comes to figuring out what to offer for sale. On this episode, Scott\u2019s got a couple of great stories of how he figured out some product and business ideas that should help you see the kinds of real life things that can help you discover product ideas. You won\u2019t want to miss this one. It covers some of the most practical ways you can discover unique products to serve a particular market.\nWhat are you good at?\nThere are many people in the world who are also engaged with the exact areas where you have skill and expertise. They need resources to help them become even more accomplished in that niche. What knowledge, skills, or expertise do you have that can be turned into a product that you could sell to those people on Amazon or other online platforms? You have a leg up on the competition because you already know the market and need. That\u2019s just one way that you can create a product that you can be fairly certain is going to be a success. Listen to this episode to hear the whole story of how you can discover product ideas.\nWhat do you want to learn more about?\nEvery one of us has our interest in a new topic piqued from time to time. When that happens there are many things you have to learn or resources you need to purchase in order to get started in that area. Right there are a handful of product ideas that you could possibly begin selling through private label on Amazon. What are you interested in right now? Are there any new hobbies or areas you\u2019re about to step into? Listen to Scott\u2019s ideas on this episode to help you sort out the many opportunities that exist around you right now. \nWhat are your kids or friends\u2019 kids into right now?\nScott\u2019s daughter has just begun to get involved in two new activities - playing the piano and volleyball. In each of those areas, she\u2019s got to gather the resources she needs in order to be equipped for the activity. For piano lessons and practice she may need a metronome or staff paper. For volleyball, she may need specialized shoes or knee pads. Those pieces of equipment are some of the things that many people need when they are interested in the same activity. On this episode, you\u2019re going to learn how you can observe the things you\u2019re already doing or just getting started with so that you can generate product ideas to sell on Amazon.\nDo you have friends or neighbors who have a skill that could help you launch a product?\nScott just moved to a new home in South Carolina. As a result, he\u2019s meeting lots of new people and getting to know his neighbors. In almost every conversation he\u2019s noticing skills, interests, or knowledge that his new friends have that could be leveraged into a product idea to sell on Amazon. On this episode, he\u2019s not only going to tell you a handful of stories about those encounters but also give you some ideas about how you can begin to pay attention to the relationships you have that could be tapped into for the sake of product ideas.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[1:08] The upcoming LIVE event in Phoenix, AZ in October 2016.\n \t[3:52] Scott\u2019s story about how he got started online.\n \t[21:23] 4 questions to ask yourself.\n \t[30:39] Why you should be a good listener who understands other people\u2019s lives.\n \t[36:12] Do an internal \u201caudit\u201d of your interests and connections to discover product ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 258\nTAS 258 : Product Discovery Story + 4 Questions to Ask Yourself to Help Discover Products\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well, hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

One of the reasons it can be so confusing is because every State has its own set of regulations surrounding sales tax as well as its own process business owners need to go through in order to register and pay their taxes. That description alone should show you how difficult it is to remain in compliance. State sales tax issues are one of the most frequently asked questions Scott receives so he decided it was time to get someone on the show who could answer the basic questions about sales tax. That someone is Mark Faggiano of Taxjar. You can hear their conversation on this episode.\nI have to collect State sales tax? Really?\nSometimes the fact that the internet is worldwide makes it seem like State and National jurisdictions don\u2019t apply to what goes on, on the World Wide Web. But the fact is that when a product is purchased that transaction is taking place in a particular place. In other words, the purchaser is sitting at a computer or other device within a specific jurisdiction. It makes sense that States would want to collect sales tax when that happens. So yes, as a seller of products you really do need to be collecting sales tax with each product you sell. But how do you do it? That\u2019s what this episode of The Amazing Seller is all about, so be sure you listen.\nAs an Amazon seller, what States do you need to collect sales tax for?\nWhen it comes to knowing what States you should collect sales tax for it comes down to a couple of issues. First is the issue of \u201cnexus.\u201d Nexus refers to the place where you as a business are actually doing business. The most obvious qualification for where your business nexus is located, is the State in which you reside and do your work. But what if you have employees in a different state, or a warehouse in yet another State? And what if Amazon is warehousing your products in a number of States? As you can see, it gets very complicated. But Mark Faggiano from Taxjar is on the show to help us sort it all out. He\u2019s Scott\u2019s guest on this episode.\nDo I really need to register with a state to pay a very small amount of sales tax?\nWhat if you discover that you\u2019ve sold enough products in a particular state - let\u2019s say Maine - to owe $15 in tax to the State of Maine. Does that mean that you should register with the State of Maine so you can fork over that $15? Technically, probably so. But there\u2019s another way to look at it that most people who do product sales for a living feel is safe and ethical. You can hear abou the varying approaches to the issue on this episode as well as hear all of them explained in detail. What are you waiting for? You should listen to this one.\nWhat if I had lots of sales in the past and never collected sales tax at all?\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that many people who sell products on Amazon - either private lable or retail arbitrage - are just now hearing about the possibility that they may owe sales tax to various States. If that\u2019s you, here\u2019s something important you should consider. What kind of sales volume have you done in various states in the past? That may impact whether you should be concerned about the issue or not. But at the very least it\u2019s an issue you should look into because of the possibility that a given State may decide to audit you to come after their Sales tax money - and that could be even more costly than paying the tax of your own accord.

Find out how to ask your questions directly to Scott by listening to this episode.\nI\u2019m not quite sure why Pay Per Click is important? It seems like a huge expense?\nA listener to this episode of The Amazing Seller asks why it\u2019s important that private label sellers use Amazon Pay Per Click. It\u2019s quite an expense over the long haul and she\u2019s not quite sure why it\u2019s beneficial. On this episode Scott answers her question, telling her why PPC is vital to getting your product started generating sales from the beginning, which in turn will drive your organic sales higher in the Amazon search rankings.\nWhat is BSR ranking and why is it important?\nThe BSR ranking on any product in Amazon tells how often and well the product is selling. There are ways you can track the sales ranks of your products and your competitor\u2019s products manually, but it is tedious and requires a good deal of discipline. On this episode Scott describes how he did this using a spreadsheet when he first began selling products on Amazon. He also tells how you can use software to do it much quicker - and offers an affiliate link for you to get the software to try for yourself. \nI\u2019m about to launch a clothing product. When should I use variations and when should I create a new listing?\nA listener called in for this episode of the podcast to ask about her product launch. She\u2019s going to be selling items that belong in the clothing category and is curious when she should create a parent product with variations underneath it for size, color, etc. - and when she should start an entirely new listing for products. It can be a bit confusing so Scott tells her what he\u2019d do if he were in her shoes, and more importantly, why. You can hear his answer on this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode of The Amazing Seller.\nThe next TAS LIVE event is on the calendar.

On this episode, he\u2019s recorded their conversation which was originally published to Facebook Live and Periscope. You\u2019ll hear Scott, Chris Shaeffer, and Don Sugar chat about some of the things happening around the Amazon private label space and how the issues impact private label sellers and retail arbitrage accounts. Stick around for this one, there\u2019s a lot of insightful thoughts to learn from and some cautions that could save you some real headaches.\nWe\u2019re hearing that changes are happening in the Amazon terms of service.\nMuch of what\u2019s going around in the online communities that surround Amazon private label is not verified by Amazon yet, but nevertheless, there does appear to be some changes happening. What is the stink about? Most of it surrounds the issue of brand registry and the conditions Amazon is requiring. There are also many brand products that Amazon is bringing into the issue, requiring that sellers prove their right to sell the product. It could be a mess, or it could be a blessing. Find out why on this roundtable episode.\nHow to the recent Brand Registry changes impact private label sellers?\nMany private Label sellers are concerned about the brand registry requirements Amazon appears to be enacting but Chris Shaeffer says that it\u2019s a blessing more than a curse. Why? Because it is going to make it more difficult for hijackers to take over the listings of private label products. In fact, that could very well be the issue Amazon is trying to address with the new actions they are taking regarding brand registry. You can hear Chris\u2019 argument on this episode and find out other things going on in the Amazon universe, on this episode.\nWhy is it vital to capture email addresses of potential customers?\nPart of the discussion on this episode of the podcast surrounds the tactic of building an email list of potential or previous customers. Email list building is a proven online sales strategy that many private label sellers have not tapped into. On this episode, the guys chat about why email lists are so important, how to go about building one, and how you can use them to generate sales and build your brand.\nHow many potential sellers are using these issues as an excuse not to start.\nOne of Scott\u2019s concerns when things in the Amazon community begin to get stirred is that people who might be considering private label sales might use the confusion as an excuse not to get started. If you\u2019ve listened to this podcast for any length of time you won\u2019t be surprised to hear Scott addressing that issue. After all, he\u2019s the guy who\u2019s coined the term, \u201cTake Action.\u201d No matter what\u2019s going on in the Amazon space there are always going to be hurdles. But don\u2019t let them scare you away. Everything is going to take some hard work, diligent research, and learning.

On this one, Scott chats with his friend Chris Schaeffer about a product one of their listeners is selling. The listener feels that she might want to liquidate the products to get rid of them so she can start over with an entirely new product. Scott and Chris talk about that approach but also give her some ideas about what she might be able to do that could increase her sales.\nJust because you launch a product on Amazon doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a winner.\nMany people who try to sell products through Amazon Private Label if you don\u2019t take the time to do the research required. You\u2019re going to need to know what products are selling well and how much room there is for you to introduce another of those products. Just because you don\u2019t launch a product on Amazon doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a winner. On this episode, Scott and Chris talk about what can be done if you didn\u2019t do your product research properly to make something out of the loser products you have listed. OR - you may want to liquidate the product altogether. Scott and Chris talk about both options on this episode.\nHow can you formulate an exit strategy for loser products?\nSometimes in spite of your best efforts and product research, you\u2019ll get a product listed on Amazon that isn\u2019t selling well - and won\u2019t - no matter what you do. That\u2019s when you want to create an \u201cexit strategy\u201d to get rid of those products. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, you\u2019re going to hear how Scott and Chris would go about selling off unsuccessful products in order to get as much out of the failed effort as possible. That way you can begin to invest your time and resources in another product that might be able to do better for you.\nIs it better to continue PPC or to do a new promotion?\nThere are two ways you can drive people to your products on Amazon using the Amazon tools provided in your seller account. The first is PPC (pay per click). That\u2019s an ad platform that enables you to place your products on the top or side of the search page when people search for the keywords you want. PPC is great - but it can be expensive. The other option is doing promotions - which can cost you much less. When should you do PPC and when should you do promotions? On this episode, \u00a0Scott and Chris answer the question.\nWhat is this thing I keep hearing about called a \u201csales funnel?\u201d\nWhen you begin selling products through your own website you\u2019ll want to take advantage of every opportunity you have to sell products to the people who join there. One of those opportunities revolves around your creation of a sales funnel. It\u2019s a simple but powerful tool you can create to capture email addresses and market to people in a way that is appealing and helpful to them. Scott and Chris walk through a real-life scenario, telling a listener what they would do to create a sales funnel for her products, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[1:07] The upcoming LIVE event you can get involved in.\n \t[5:20] How can you get out of a product that is a loser?\n \t[13:53] Is it better to continue PPC or do a new promotion?\n \t[17:12] A plan to improve an existing product.\n \t[23:54] Building a sales funnel: What is it?\n \t[38:20] Using Facebook retargeting pixels.\n \t[42:24] Follow up email sequences on sales funnels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 254\nTAS 254 : (Hot Seat) Failing Products + Advice on Future Product Plan and Sales Funnel Mapping\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

It\u2019s The Amazing Seller with Scott Voelker. This is one of our Friday episodes where Scott answers real life questions from private label sellers like you. If you\u2019d like to ask Scott a particular question about what you\u2019re experiencing, the challenges in your business, or the Amazon sales platform itself. If you\u2019d like to ask your own question, you can listen to this episode and hear how you can do that!\nWhy you really need to figure out your \u201cwhy\u201d if you\u2019re going to move forward.\nScott has found it incredibly helpful to keep a clear sense of why he\u2019s doing his Amazon business in \u00a0mind at all times. A clear and compelling \u201cwhy\u201d fuels your business and motivates you to keep working on the things that really matter. On this episode, you\u2019re going to hear Scott riff on why his \u201cwhy\u201d is important - and he\u2019s going to tell you how you can develop your own compelling why that will keep you moving forward and taking action.\nTwo separate listings for variations, one sells better. How can you increase traffic?\nA listener has a pretty interesting situation - he\u2019s got two products that are identical in all other ways except that their colors are different. One of those colors sells very well and pretty consistently. The other doesn\u2019t. His question is this: How can he optimize or promote the product that is not selling as well to get its sales numbers higher like the other product. Scott has a great set of suggestions for this listener and there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll hear something that\u2019s helpful for your business as well.\nI\u2019m launching a product in a gated category that doesn\u2019t allow PPC.\nOne of the best tools provided on the Amazon sales platform is the pay per click tool that can help you drive sales to your products. But there are some product categories that do not allow sellers to use PPC. What do you do then? Scott\u2019s got a handful of suggestions that center around optimizing the listing, researching your top 5 competitors, doing some sales promotions, and running ads on Facebook that go to a Leadpage. If you don\u2019t know what all that means - you need to listen to this episode. Scott breaks it all down for you.\nWhat is your daily routine to run your private label business, Scott?\nRunning a business of any kind can be quite a challenge. And if you\u2019re a solopreneur or solo entrepreneur like Scott is (and many of you are), it can be especially tough. That\u2019s because when you don\u2019t have anyone telling you specific things to do in order to move the business forward, you\u2019ve got to figure all of that out for yourself. On this episode, Scott is asked what his daily routine looks like, and in typical Scott style he doesn\u2019t answer the exact question - but what he does have to say is worth its weight in gold.

Jarret Colton is a guy who went to Scott\u2019s LIVE event in 2016 with his head spinning. He\u2019d listened to almost every TAS podcast episode and knew a lot of information, but it was all a grable in his head. Once he was able to talk with other sellers who had seen success and glean a lot of tips from the speakers at the event, he took action - and that action translated into incredible sales. You can hear how Jarret did it, on this episode.\nWe sometimes overthink these things and need to go back to basics.\nJarret is an example of a person who got his head crammed full of information and began to overthink things. There are too many things you CAN do to attempt to make your private label products sell, but there are not a lot of things you SHOULD do at first. So the back to basics mindset that Scott talks about on this episode is the prescription for many people. Be sure to listen to Jarret\u2019s story so you can be inspired by what\u2019s happened in his business - and get some ideas about what you can do to move your sales forward.\nWhat is YOUR next move?\nEvery person who has placed a product on the Amazon sales platform has a next move that they need to take. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re selling lots of products or very few. You have something you can do to move your product sales forward. On this episode you\u2019ll hear how Jarret made the decision to shut off all the noise and information that was clogging up his mind and simplified his process so he could simply do the next thing. You may be in the same place Jarret was - so be sure to hear how he got himself taking action on the right things.\nThe power of professional product photos.\nOne of the most important things that Jarret and his wife decided to invest in was professional photos for their product. He knew that once a person searches for his products he had to have some way to catch their eye and get them to click on his listing instead of the listing from his competition. The photos were exactly what did it for him. You can hear how Jarret found his photographer, the difference the professional photos made, and how he uses them within his listing, on this episode.\n4 of his main products appear on page 1. Wow.\nAfter applying the tips and strategies that he learned at the TAS LIVE Breakthrough event, Jarret was able to increase the search ranking of his product listings. In fact, he was so successful at optimizing his listing that he\u2019s now got 4 out of 6 of his main \u201cparent\u201d products showing on page 1 for their primary keyword. You should take the time to hear Jarret\u2019s story. It\u2019s inspiring and instructional for anyone who\u2019s looking to rank their listing higher and get more product sales.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to his next guest, Jarret Colton.\n \t[3:12] Jarret\u2019s experience before jumping into Scott\u2019s live event.\n \t[8:14] Why Jarret attended Scott\u2019s live event in Denver in 2015.\n \t[11:35] The mess Jarret was facing with all the products his wife ordered.\n \t[14:12] Where Jarret found the photographer for his product images.\n \t[15:30] Jarret\u2019s game plan and what actually happened.\n \t[17:11] Spending time figuring how to solve people\u2019s problems.\n \t[19:57] Jarret\u2019s beginning goals and the competition he was facing.\n \t[25:23] Jarret did not conduct any giveaways.\n \t[34:10] The next steps for Jarret and his wife in the business.\n \t[37:40] Why Jarret wants everyone interested in private label to take action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 252\nTAS 252 : How Jarret Went from Confused to $20k in Sales on Amazon\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what\u2019s up everyone!

There are all kinds of things you have to keep track of including taxes. There are many common mistakes made when it comes to taxes and on this episode of the podcast, Scott is talking with his friend Josh about the common questions that come to him when it comes to business text questions. Being a CPA, Josh has the actual answers you need in order to do things legally and ethically. You can hear all of these common questions and their answers on this episode of the podcast.\nAre you calculating your product inventory the RIGHT way for tax purposes?\nMany people think that in order to calculate their taxes correctly when it comes to inventory they simply need to add up how much they have spent on products during the calendar year. Scott's guess today is a certified public accountant and he says that is actually not the right way to do it. You will find up providing wrong figures to the IRS if you do so, and you could be liable for a much larger payment, plus penalties by doing it. On this episode, you were going to learn the right way to calculate inventory for tax purposes.\nIs an IRS audit something you should be afraid of?\nWhen you hear the phrase, \u201ctax audit\u201d it may cause you to break out in a cold sweat. But do you really need to be so concerned? What is the likelihood that you were really going to be audited? And if you are, which kind of audit is it that you should be concerned about? And this great conversation with a certified public accountant you were going to hear about the different kinds of audits, what each of them really is about, and what you should do if you are audited. It's a great episode to dispel a lot of the myths that are floating around in the business community, so make sure you take the time to listen.\nWhat meals and entertainment are deductible?\nMany people who run a business have been told that they can deduct meals and entertainment that have to do with their business with no problem. But is that entirely true? When this episode of the podcast a certified public accountant is going to tell us that you actually only get to deduct 50% of your meals and entertainment, and you can only do that if those are directly related to a business activity of some kind. If you want to hear the full story on this important issue, make sure that you listen. It could save you a lot of money in the end.\nWhat business entity is best for your business?\nThere's a good deal of confusion about which business entity you should choose for your business activity. Should you be a sole proprietor? What about an LLC? Or maybe an S corporation or C corporation? If you're confused by all of these possibilities you are not alone. On this episode of the podcast, you will hear the definitions of each of these, what their advantages are, and how you should go about choosing the one that is right for you and your business.

It\u2019s always a great experience where you get to learn what you don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the flavor of what happens on these Friday episodes of the Amazing Seller podcast. Scott answers questions that are submitted via voicemail to give you an idea of how he thinks about the challenges and obstacles that you come across when selling private label products on Amazon. Today\u2019s episode includes questions about saturated markets, international sales, keyword usage, and more. Be sure you take some time to listen to this one. You\u2019ll get lots of great insights from Scott\u2019s responses. \nI know a certain market very well, but it\u2019s extremely saturated. Should I jump in?\nHere\u2019s a very interesting question about choosing a market: A listener has been working in a particular market outside of Amazon for some time and feels that he knows a lot about it already. But the market on Amazon is incredibly crowded and he\u2019s not sure if he should take the risk of putting a product onto Amazon in that market. Scott\u2019s got some ideas about how he could do it that may not be typical. It\u2019s likely that you\u2019re going to get your wheels turning about your own products after hearing the answers Scott gives to this great question - so be sure you listen.\nMy product sales are going quite well. I\u2019m curious if I should expand my product to Canada or the UK.\nOn today's episode, a listener asked about expanding her product line into sales platforms outside of the United States. She is getting an average of 20 sales per day and thinks that expanding into Canada or the UK may be a good step for her at this time. Scott has some great insights into what it would take to become successful in other countries and gives her some tips on what to look for as indications that she could be successful doing so. If you've never sold your products in countries other than the United States you will want to hear what God has to say to this listener.\nHow should I best use the keywords and search terms in the Amazon backend?\nOne of the many confusing things about the Amazon platform has to do with the use of keywords and Search terms in the back-end of the Amazon seller account. There have been quite a few theories and opinions shared about how to best use those fields for the best results. On this episode, a listener asks about how those fields should be used and Scott gives an answer that covers all the bases. If you've ever been confused about the search term fields in your Amazon seller account, this is a response you will want to hear.\nScott got to appear on Pat Flynn\u2019s show, Smart Passive Income!\nIt's not often that your success is noticed by people who are further along the path than you are. But that happened just this past month when Pat Flynn reached out to Scott to ask him to submit a response for one of his podcast episodes. It was a great honor and Scott was excited to condense some of his hard-learned business lessons into a short sound byte for Pat\u2019s podcast.

One product can\u2019t sell on a sustained basis - you need related and sibling products that can fill in the gaps of what people who use that product need on a regular basis. On this episode, Scott wants to walk you through 7 steps that he suggests for building a brand from the ground up. It\u2019s a step by step process from product and market research all the way to ongoing sales and customer retention. You\u2019ll get a lot out of this episode of the podcast - in fact, you should be sure to grab the transcript so you don\u2019t miss anything.\nDo you understand the difference between a product and a market?\nScott talks about this a lot on the podcast because it is vital: are you building a business based on a product or aimed toward a market? It is entirely possible to build a business around one product. But in Scott\u2019s view, that is not a long-term solution that you can count on. The reason is that one product can lose its appeal over time but if you have multiple products within the same product in it or Market you will be able to maintain consistent sales in spite of downturns in the sales of one product line. \u00a0On this episode of the podcast, Scott wants to help you understand the difference between a single product and a product line that can take over a product market so that you can be even more successful in your online ventures.\nYou need to know who your ideal customer is.\nOnce you have done the research to know the product line and Market that you want to reach with your products, you need to discover who is buying those products. That doesn't mean you need to know names and email addresses but it does mean you need to know the common characteristics of the people who are regularly buying those items. Are they men or women? How old are they? What other types of things are they interested in? As you are able to answer those questions you will find yourself getting a clearer picture of who your ideal customer is. When you know the characteristics of those people you will be much better equipped to position your product in the market in ways that are attractive to them. Make sure you listen to this episode so you can hear Scott's explanation of how to discover your ideal customer.\nContent marketing can set your brand up for success.\nIf you are not familiar with the term \u201ccontent marketing\u201d you need to make sure that you understand it and know how to use it to advance your brand. The concept behind content marketing is that you are providing value to people through your resources and tools that help them understand the product market better and begin to view you as a valuable authority or resource within that market. When you can effectively do that you will gain the trust of the exact people you were trying to sell your products to and they will become more prone to purchase your product as a result. Content marketing is one of the most effective ways of building a loyal following of customers who believe in your product line. Listen to Scott\u2019s explanation of how to use content marketing to advance your business and brand, on this episode.\nImplement these 7 steps to build a brand that lasts.\nSelling products online is not that difficult if you're willing to put in the work to build the foundation's necessary to support the success of the business over the Long Haul. On this episode is Scott is walking you through 7 steps that you can use to build an online brand that will weather the ups and downs of Market swings. None of the steps can be successful on their own, and none of them are easy. But if you break them down into bite-sized chunks you will be able to accomplish one at a time with the end result being an established brand and a somewhat automated system by which your products are promoted and sold.

On this episode, Scott walks through 5 ways to generate more revenue that you may not have considered, and many of them are able to be attached to your existing brand by going for a market, not just a product. You can hear it on this episode.\nThe importance of multiple streams of income for everyone.\nThink this through for a moment. If you put all your eggs in the \u201cselling products on Amazon\u201d basket, and Amazon changes things in a way that impacts your success, you\u2019ve just lost all of your eggs. That means the money you were once making dries up overnight. Scott\u2019s a great advocate of creating multiple streams of income to support your business and personal life. The more you have your income spread out the less vulnerable you are to the changes in any one platform. Today\u2019s episode is filled with Scott\u2019s insights into the ways you could launch some additional streams of income and support your life and business even more successfully.\nIs there a book opportunity you could build off of your current products?\nYou probably haven\u2019t thought of it this way but no matter what your product niche is, there are people who need to know more about that niche. There is probably an opportunity for you to create a digital book that you could sell on Amazon that covers some of the most important elements of the niche. You\u2019d be providing a great service to would-be customers and creating an additional stream of income for yourself. Listen to Scott\u2019s ideas about how to understand your market so that you can come up with ideas for additional streams of income.\nIf you have physical products is there a way to create a digital version of it?\nIt might require some creative thinking but many physical products can be pivoted into a digital version or a related product that is digital. There are so many ways you can create helpful things for people who are using your existing products and offer those items for sale. Creating additional streams of income is not as difficult as it might sound. You can do it - and this episode is full of ideas for how you can rethink what you do to increase your revenue.\nYou probably have a video course inside you. Yep. It\u2019s true.\nYou may not be a technically oriented person. You may not know a thing about video. But you can be assured that there\u2019s something you know well that others would pay money to learn. And more importantly, they would pay money to learn it in the WAY that you teach it. Scott\u2019s got lots of ideas to give you about how you can create additional streams of income, and one of those is a video course that you can offer online or via DVD.

We call these the \u201cAsk Scott\u201d sessions because it\u2019s exactly that - your opportunity to ask Scott Voelker anything you want about selling on the Amazon platform. From product research and selection to shipping issues, to Amazon seller accounts and terms of service, to packaging, promotion, reviews, seller feedback - you name it and Scott is willing to address it on these Friday episodes. Be sure you ask your question. Who knows? Maybe it will be featured on a future Ask Scott episode.\nWhy results bring confidence in business and in life.\nEveryone knows this but it\u2019s true nonetheless. When you get results in any area of life you begin to gain confidence in that area. But you\u2019ll never get the results if you never start. That\u2019s why one of Scott\u2019s biggest mantras is #takeAction. So if you\u2019re struggling with confidence when it comes to your Amazon sales simply because it\u2019s so new to you, you may need to simply take a step into the unknown so that you can gain the results you need to build that confidence. You can hear Scott\u2019s thoughts on how he\u2019s experienced this dynamic in business and in life, on this episode.\nHow can I best use Pay per Click to get myself to page 1 of the Amazon rankings?\nAmazon\u2019s pay per click tool is an amazing way to quickly make your product visible in the Amazon search rankings. But it\u2019s not a normal listing that your potential customers see, it\u2019s a promoted listing. But it\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do in order to get your first sales. The first part of the launch is not about ranking, it\u2019s about getting initial sales and reviews. That is where \u00a0Amazon PPC comes in as a powerful way to drive those sales. The next part of a launch is about ranking higher and that doesn\u2019t happen through promotions, it happens through organic sales. And those organic sales are fueled partly by the existence of good reviews. Reviews serve as proof that your product is quality and actually something others want as well.\nWhen I have variations on my products will my Best Seller Rank (BSR) apply to all variations or does each have it\u2019s own BSR?\nEvery product in the Amazon catalog, including yours, has a seller rank. Every seller wants their product to achieve a best seller rank that shows potential customers that their product is worth buying. A listener asks about how variations of a product impact BSR. Do the variations each \u00a0have their own BSR or is the overall \u201cparent product\u201d the only one that has a BSR to be concerned about? It\u2019s a great question and Scott has one of his \u201cit depends\u201d answers for you on this episode.\nShould I have my products shipped first to my home address or directly to Amazon?\nIt may seem like a sensible shortcut to have the products from your supplier sent directly to the Amazon warehouse. After all, why would you want to keep inventory in your own home? Isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re trying to avoid through FBA? But the issue is that when you send products directly to the Amazon warehouse you have no quality control process in place to ensure that your products are free of defects. The only way you know is that customers begin leaving negative reviews on your products - which is never a good thing. On this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott outlines some of the options for shipping that make sense for international sellers and domestic sellers.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[2:28] Random thoughts from Scott: results build confidence.\n \t[5:28] QUESTION ONE: How do I get to page 1 using PPC and how l can I track it?\n \t[12:18] QUESTION TWO: Questions about product variations and shipping.\n \t[19:16] QUESTION THREE: My products are large and heavy but sell well.

A HUGE part of doing that is getting honest reviews from your customers. If you don\u2019t know how to effectively get those reviews you\u2019re going to have a very hard time building a successful sales channel. On this episode, Scott and his friend Chris Guthrie are here to walk you through the ins and outs of reviews - what makes a good one, why you need them, and how to get them. Be sure you take the time to listen. It could increase your sales tremendously.\nWatch the \"Review Getting Workshop\" to see these strategies in Action + Download the email Scripts.\nAmazon is cracking down on reviews. Here\u2019s how to keep your product reviews safe.\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk lately about Amazon\u2019s attitude when it comes to product reviews - and it\u2019s actually more than JUST talk. Amazon has adjusted its terms of service and is cracking down on reviews that it considers being fake or in some way manipulated. There\u2019s only one way to ensure that your product reviews are safe from the Amazon crackdown and that\u2019s to get real, legitimate reviews in the first place. This episode of the podcast is dedicated to making sure you understand the right and wrong ways to go about that - including some thoughts about the use of review groups, so be sure you listen.\nWhat makes a real review and what makes a fake review?\nYou hear the terms \u201creal\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d applied to product reviews on Amazon all the time. But do you know what constitutes a real or fake review? On this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast, Scott has asked his buddy, Chris Guthrie to come on the show and unpack the details of what makes a good review and what contributes to the kind of reviews that Amazon has been removing from product pages. It\u2019s their hope that using the information you hear on this episode you\u2019ll be able to not only safeguard your product reviews from being removed but also get better quality reviews in the first place.\nWhy you need to follow up with your customers via Amazon\u2019s integrated email.\nYou may not even have known but Amazon provides an email contact option within your seller account that you can use to directly contact your customers. Using that email tool is the best and most effective way to follow up with your customers once they\u2019ve purchased your product - and part of that follow-up strategy can and should include a reminder to your customers to leave an honest review for your product. We all need reminders now and then, right? Your customers are the same way. Find out how you can use the email solution Amazon has provided on this episode - and learn how you can automate it so you don\u2019t have to worry about it ever again!\nKeep seller feedback in mind - not just reviews.\nThis episode of The Amazing Seller podcast is all about product reviews - OK, well not ALL about reviews - there\u2019s a section right toward the end of the conversation where Scott and his buddy Chris Guthrie chat a bit about seller feedback and its role in making sure your account and products stay in Amazon\u2019s good graces. Sometimes in the rush to get good reviews we forget about seller feedback, which can be a mistake. Be sure you hear this part of the conversation. It could keep your account from being banned for shut down temporarily.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:30] A LIVE review workshop coming up that you can attend for free!\n \t[4:10] Review clubs: should you be using them?\n \t[5:58] Does Amazon respect reviews that come from product promotions?\n \t[7:37] The purpose and reason behind getting legitimate reviews (social proof).\n \t[11:25] Why follow up email to customers is crucial - and how to do it!\n \t[14:58] Gifts you can expect from the upcoming free webinar.\n \t[25:30] Things to be careful of when asking customers for reviews.", "duration": "45:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS246.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1471854620, "title": "TAS 245 : NEW Optimization Updates \u2013 Avoid an Amazon SLAP and Best Practices to Rank Products and Convert with Karon Thackston", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "When dealing with a huge platform like Amazon you've got to expect that there will be places where confusion sets in. This episode is an example of that very thing. Karon Thackston is with us today to help us understand the new items within the Amazon terms of service. Not everything is coordinated and not everything makes sense but if you learn how to operate within the Amazon guidelines your products were ranked better and your sales will increase. Karon Is here to help us navigate the changes and make sense out of all of it.\nAmazon says you should make sure your title is less than 200 characters. Period.\nThe rules have changed many times over the years but now Amazon has a new guideline when it comes to the length of your product title. 200 words is the new limit and you have to be careful because the back end will not stop you from putting in more characters. But if you do you could be subject to a suppressed listing or even worse, Amazon could change the title for you and not allow you to change it back to something of your choosing. You've got to hear this one to believe it, and you can hear it on this episode of The Amazing seller.\nBe sure to watch the Amazon style guide for what is allowed. Nothing else.\nYou can take a few minutes to click around the Amazon website and find conflicting guidelines for how you should list your products on their platform. But today's guest, Karen Paxton believes that you should only pay attention to the Amazon style guide when you are trying to conform your listing to the Amazon standards. The things Karon shares on this episode are from the Amazon style guide and as you will see, are not all that simple. But Karon is a pro and can help you navigate it more simply, so be sure you listen.\nWhy you should contact seller support over and over when you have issues.\nIf you run into issues with any of your product listings and need to contact Seller Support it is likely that you will run into a support agent who doesn't know the facts of how Amazon runs. Why would we say that? Because it's absolutely true. You can call Seller Support and talked to two or three different agents and get two or three different answers to your questions. That's why our guest today, Karon Thackston, \u00a0recommend that you continue to call Seller Support until you get help with the things that you need. Eventually you will be able to talk to supervisor and get things straightened out. \nYou should be careful with those search term fields from now on.\nIt wasn't too long ago that Amazon increased the number of Search terms you could enter in the search type fields in your product back end feels. But now they have come out saying that the search term fields don't really need to be used at all as long as your keywords are included in your description and bullet points. But Karon Thackston doesn't believe you will be penalized if you leave words in the search term fields, and is not recommending that any more experienced sellers go through their listings to remove them. You can hear the entire fiasco on this episode of The Amazing Seller. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode with Karon.\n \t[5:00] Karon\u2019s summary of what she\u2019s covering for you today.\n \t[8:15] Another reason to build a platform of your own off Amazon.\n \t[9:56] The issue of title suppression (titles over 200 characters).\n \t[13:45] Why you should contact seller support if your backend doesn\u2019t reflect the 200 character limit.\n \t[20:40] The new guidelines for search terms to optimize your listings.\n \t[25:40] Is any aspect of the product listing weighted more than anything else?\n \t[27:33] Scott\u2019s recent keyword test.\n \t[29:04] Amazon\u2019s latest guidelines for keywords (to kill keyword spam?).\n \t[34:34] And Amazon still says you should not use commas in keyword fields.\n \t[38:02] What Karon recommends to sellers who have been around a while.\n \t[41:14] The importance of split testing to ensur...", "duration": "58:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS245.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1471595443, "title": "TAS 244 : Ask Scott Session #73 \u2013 You Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Nobody knows it all.

We all need to ask for help from time to time and these Friday episodes of the Amazing Seller Podcast are an opportunity for you to ask your questions about Amazon sales and private label products. Scott LOVES these episodes where he gets to sit down and deal with the real life situations that you and many other sellers like you are facing each day in your business. You can listen to the questions people have already asked and even ask your own questions, right here on the Friday episodes.\nWhen should I start PPC (pay per click) on my new products?\nOn today's episode a listen to the podcast asked whether he should wait to start his pay per click campaigns until he has a significant number of reviews, or whether he should begin PPC immediately once his product is live on the Amazon platform. What would your answer be? Today, Scott has an answer for this listener and has advice for you if you are trying to determine when and how to start your PPC campaigns. You can hear it all on this episode of the podcast. \nIf I rank for a long tail keyword will I also rank for shorter keywords within it?\nDo you know what a long tail keyword is? A long tail keyword is a keyword phrase that uses a primary key word with other qualifying words added to the beginning or end. For example, garlic press maybe the base keyword. But long tail keywords would be, \u201cstainless steel garlic press,\u201d OR \u201clong handled garlic press.\u201d On today's episode a listener asks if he will rank for all of the keywords within a long-tail keyword phrase, or only the long tail keyword phrase itself. It's a great question and Scott has a great answer. Be sure you listen to find out what it is. \nDo I have to set up multiple seller accounts if I want to sell more than one brand?\nThe first thing you need to do in order to sell products on Amazon is to create a seller account. Today a listener asks if he should set up multiple seller account if he is going to be selling products under multiple brand names. It's a great question and one that can have many answers depending on what your and goals are for your business. On this episode, Scott answers the question with a good deal of insight and foresight, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nIs it a good idea to enter a market when there are 3 to 4 pages worth of sellers in the niche? What if I did a bundle?\nA listener today has found a product possibility in a niche where there are many, many sellers of the product. But he's curious if it is a good opportunity anyway since there is only one seller who is providing the product in question in a different color, while all the rest offer the exact same product. He is curious if he could create a bundle that includes both colors, or even add additional colors to make a bundle that is more attractive.

That\u2019s OK. Nerves and fear are natural in any new endeavor but they aren\u2019t the thing that determines success. What determines your success is your own mindset. On this episode Scott chats with a successful Amazon seller, Bobby Jacques and the two of them agree that mindset is crucial. You can hear how both of these guys approach their business in light of mindset, on this episode.\nWhy you have to just do it and simply take action.\nWhen people talk about mindset they\u2019re addressing the issue of belief. If you are going to attempt a business on Amazon or any other platform you\u2019ve got to first believe in your ability to learn, to grow, and to pivot through the disappointments and obstacles until you reach success. It\u2019s a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude that you have to develop - and today\u2019s episode is one that can help you do that. You\u2019re going to hear from a very determined Amazon seller who made it his goal to replace his full time income in a very short period of time. He did it, and is a testimony to the fact that you can do it too, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, learn, grow, and keep going.\nThe importance of mindset to believe that you can accomplish things.\nWhen it comes to building an online business, whether through private label sales on Amazon or some other approach, you\u2019ve got to believe that you can do it. The person who doesn\u2019t believe in their ability is the one who will give up quickly after they hit the first obstacle. And you WILL hit obstacles if you take the entrepreneurial route. Bobby Jacques shares his story on this episode and tells how he went from nothing to $50K per month in sales on this episode.\nDialing in your pay per click (PPC) is important for product visibility and profits.\nOne of the tools that makes private label sales on Amazon such a successful thing is Amazon pay per click. PPC is one of the tools Amazon provides to help you get people's eyes on your products when they are searching for exactly what you have. Make awesome money and takes time to figure out, but one You can be the pot at the end of the rainbow. On this episode Scott's guest is going to tell us how he manages his pay per click campaigns and what you can do to organize your campaigns properly from the start. \nIf you\u2019re going to start, you\u2019ve got to determine that you will start and succeed.\nDetermination in any business is huge. You can't be the type who will give up at the first sign of trouble or difficulty. No difficulty can stop you if you are convinced that you can learn and grow for the sake of overcoming any obstacle. Your job as an entrepreneur is to make yourself successful so that you are able to bring great value to the world. \u00a0On this episode of the podcast you're going to here a great story of success from a guy who started with no money in the bank and is now bringing in $50,000 per month in sales revenue.

It\u2019s a real life Amazon product that is already selling that is submitted for review and suggestions to increase sales. Scott and Chris are looking at a product today that is in a tight niche and is very low priced - both of which are problems from the get go. But there are some things that can be done to improve the sales of this product regardless. You can hear Scott and Chris\u2019 suggestions on this episode.\nA bad thing will happen when you\u2019re product price is low to begin with.\nIf you get into a market where the sales price for the product is $7 or so, you\u2019re going to run into a problem. Even if your product only costs you $1, you\u2019re going to pay a lot in Amazon fees and not have much product margin to play with. That\u2019s why Scott recommends that you look for products that will sell for $15 or more most of the time. You can hear more insights into the way the product cost impacts your profits and success, on this episode.\nThe first thing your potential customers see is the photo. Make sure it\u2019s a good one.\nWhen you\u2019re putting together your Amazon listing one of the most important things that can\u2019t be underestimated is the photo you use to highlight your product. Amazon requires that your product photo is the product alone on a white background - and Scott and Chris both feel that it\u2019s vital that the photo be high quality and positioned in a way that shows it as large a possible. Today\u2019s hot seat product needs a better photo and Scott and Chris will tell you exactly what they\u2019d do to make the listing photo better.\nProviding a bonus item for freer is a great idea - but this seller didn\u2019t use it well.\nThe product that\u2019s on the \u201chot seat\u201d on this episode of The Amazing Seller also includes a free ebook to help the user learn how to use the product. It\u2019s a great idea and is a powerful way to increase the perceived value of the product. However, this seller hasn\u2019t taken advantage of the bonus. How did they miss the opportunity? The bonus item is not mentioned in the title of the product OR shown in the product image. Both of those are great opportunities to stand out from the competition. Find out how you can use this example to improve your product listing on this episode.\nBundling may be the key to increasing your private label product sales.\nOften, once a private label product is introduced into the market others begin to jump on board and offer the same product. Before long that niche is flooded and the price begins to race to the bottom. It\u2019s not a good situation for anyone but there are ways to become the dominant seller in the market, and the main way is by bundling your product with accessories or related products that purchasers might need in order to use your product.

This is where you\u2019re able to ask your very own questions about Amazon Private Label sales, online sales in general, and how to do your pay per click, promotions, and more. If you\u2019ve got your own questions about selling on Amazon you can ask Scott directly and possibly be featured on an episode just like this one. You can find out how to ask your question by listening to this episode!\nI have an online following and want to promote a private label product through it. Is that a good idea?\nOne of the listeners to the Amazing Seller is a guy who does his own podcast and has his own online following established already. He wanted to know if there is a way that he could effectively begin selling physical products that he lists on Amazon through his other brand. Scott\u2019s answer to his question was a big, fat, enthusiastic, \u201cYES!\u201d and you can hear why Scott\u2019s so excited about this kind of opportunity by listening to his response.\nCan I get a Chinese supplier to customize a product for me in unique ways?\nOrdering products from China is one of the most affordable and easy ways to get a private label product brand started. But are you limited to the products the suppliers have on hand? Nope. You can take any product idea - even one you haven\u2019t seen on their platforms - and send them sketches, schematics, etc. and ask if they can build it for you. You\u2019ll go back and forth with the supplier for a while getting the details right, then you\u2019ll have to front some cash to get a prototype made. You can find out what comes next by listening to Scott\u2019s answer to this great question - on this episode.\nIs it OK for me to copy the URL of my Amazon product and ask people to go there to buy?\nIt\u2019s the most natural thing in the world to ask people to buy your product. It\u2019s also natural to make it easy for them to purchase by sending them the direct link to your product on Amazon. But the way Amazon\u2019s algorithm works that\u2019s not always the best idea. Why? It\u2019s because Amazon continually calculates how many purchases of your product happen based on the number of views it receives. So if you send someone directly to the product and they don\u2019t purchase, you could be hurting your product rankings. Find out how it all works out on this episode.\nIs it OK for me to try to sell a product where the competition has more than 100 reviews?\nA listener has been doing his product research and wants to know if he would be safe to try to enter a product into a market where the competition has over 100 reviews. Scott says it\u2019s OK but more important than the reviews the competition has is what he calls the \u201cdepth of market.\u201d What is that and why does it matter? You can find out all the details by listening to this episode of the podcast.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:34] Scott\u2019s recording on his birthday to spend time with his family later!\n \t[5:09] A question to ask yourself right now.\n \t[7:42] QUESTION ONE: I have an online presence and brand already.

But today Spencer is with us to help us understand how you can build your own website that sells your own products - independent of Amazon. Interested? Be sure you listen to this great episode.\nWhy you need to move your success to your own platform.\nSpencer strongly believes that you need to take your success to a different platform once you\u2019ve gotten your feet wet on Amazon. Why? Because you want to build something that you have entire control over, no matter what. On Amazon you have to follow the constantly changing rules and make sure you\u2019re not making any mistakes. On your own site you are the king of the castle and you make up the rules. And maybe just as important, you\u2019ll be cutting out the Amazon middleman that bites into your profit margin. Hear how Spencer and Scott suggest you take that step, on this episode.\nWhen is the right time to build your own website store?\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve had a private label product on Amazon for a while and you\u2019re selling a decent amount of products every day. Should you take the step of creating your own website and trying to sell your products independent of Amazon? Spencer Haws says that once your products are selling well on Amazon you\u2019ve got a great test case that shows that your products could sell independent of Amazon as well. Find out exactly how Spencer says you can know if you should take the step to build your own sales platform, on this episode.\nUsing long tail keywords you can get lots of traffic.\nYou may not even know what a long tail keyword is, but Spencer Haws believes that you\u2019ve got to become skilled at identifying and using them if you\u2019re going to have success building a sales site for your products that operates independently of Amazon. Spencer has proven on his own sites that going for the lesser known long tail keywords can be very successful in the long run. You can find out how Spencer does it, step by step, and the software tool he uses to do his research on this episode of The Amazing Seller. \nHow you can get specific training to build your own niche website.\nIf all of this website building talk sounds a bit scary to you, relax. Spencer Haws has created two ways you can learn everything you need to know to build a website the right way and start selling your products independent of Amazon. First is an internship where over the course of 4 weeks you\u2019ll learn how to do everything you need to make your site stellar. Second, if you can't do an internship there\u2019s an 8 week course that covers the same content.

While the fear may be an obstacle, it doesn\u2019t have to be such a big one. You can reduce the chances of failure (what you\u2019re really afraid of) by checking out what\u2019s already working in your product niche and duplicating those things for your product. On this episode Scott goes way outside his normal topics to show you how he looks at products and marketing approaches so that you can learn how to use other people\u2019s hard work to make your own business less risky and more profitable.\nHow to use Amazon and eBay as incredible marketing research tools.\nMost of the time Scott is talking about Amazon as a sales platform - and that it is. But you may not have considered that Amazon\u2019s setup is also designed in a way that you can use it to research product ideas and market trends. On this episode Scott talks about how you can use reviews, data, and the \u201calso bought\u201d section of Amazon, eBay, and other platforms to make smarter decisions about your products and business.\nPay attention to the customer experience you have relating to products you buy.\nWhen you buy any product - from Amazon or even your local Walmart - you should pay attention to the way the company has positioned your buying and follow up experience. Is the packaging appealing and cool? Does the verbiage on the package give you clear instructions? Does it encourage you to submit contact information so you can receive more from them? Does it offer you other ways you can benefit from your product or receive more information? Scott has begun observing these kinds of things and it\u2019s given him all kinds of ideas for his own business and products. What about you? Learn more on this episode.\nWhy you should intentionally buy your competition\u2019s product.\nOne of the best things you can do for your business is to know your competition. Not just who they are or what they sell, but also HOW they sell it and WHAT they do to follow up with their customers. The best way to do that is to become a customer. When you purchase one of your competitor\u2019s products you\u2019ll get to see exactly what they do to connect with their customers, follow up with them, offer them related products, and more. Then you can reverse engineer it to include those things in your process OR you can improve on it and blow your competitors out of the water. Find out more about tweaking your competition on this episode.\nDon\u2019t forget about print magazines and TV. They are great at marketing.\nWhile you may never consider advertising your Amazon private label products on TV or in a magazine you would do well to pay attention to what advertisers on TV and in magazines are doing to sell their products. Advertisers have been using print and video for years and they really know what works. You can borrow their ideas and apply them to your promotions and advertisements to up your game. Scott goes through a ton of ideas for promoting and presenting your products better, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[2:07] This episode was sparked by questions from listeners.\n \t[5:36] The importance of using Amazon.com and eBaby.com for data and insight.\n \t[9:21] Using product reviews to refine products and build new ones.\n \t[11:00] Buy a similar product and go through their customer experience.\n \t[12:33] Search Google to find a product similar to yours and buy it through their website.\n \t[15:32] Click a Facebook Ad for a similar product to yours and go through the process.\n \t[24:16] Why you should pay attention to magazine advertisements.\n \t[28:16] Opt in to somebody\u2019s email list and observe their follow up process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 239\nTAS 239 - 5 Tips to Reduce Failure and Model What Works (Success Hack)\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, he what\u2019s up everyone.", "duration": "40:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS239.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1470385807, "title": "TAS 238 \u2013 Ask Scott Session #71 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Amazon private label sales is one of the best ways to get started with online business. You don\u2019t have to have any experience because there are many good hearted people like Scott Voelker who are eager to walk you through the ways you can get started with even a small amount of cash. This episode is one of Scott\u2019s weekly \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episodes where anybody who has a question about sales on Amazon is able to ask their questions. This episode highlights listener questions about product categories, shipping costs VS storage fees, responding to bad product reviews, and using the keyword fields in the Amazon product backend wisely.\nI\u2019m not sure which categories I should choose for my private label product.\nA listener asks a very good question today about product categories. It\u2019s often the case that one product could legitimately belong in more than one category. When that\u2019s the case, how do you go about choosing which category you should designate as your \u201cprimary\u201d category. On this episode Scott answers the question and encourages the listener who ask it to focus on keywords and optimized listings more than the category - though he does give some tips on how to choose the most effective category as well.\nShould I pay increased shipping or storage fees to house my products?\nA TAS community member called in to ask Scott about his situation - he\u2019s got a great product but in order to get his best price he\u2019d have to order 2000 of them! He\u2019d be saving enough money that it seems like a wise thing to do, but he doesn\u2019t want to keep them at his home and doesn\u2019t believe that Amazon would allow him to send in that many at once. He\u2019s asking Scott\u2019s advice on whether storing those products at some warehouse would make sense. Scott\u2019s got his typical common sense answer to this one and you can hear it on this episode.\nCan I leave comments or replies to negative reviews I get on my products?\nA listener asks Scott if he is able to respond to the comments that are made to his products, and if so how? The tool you need to know about in order to do that is called Sales Backer (find it in this episode\u2019s resource links) and it\u2019s a great way to be active in the space surrounding your product and to do great customer service that can not only fix problems your customers are having but also get some of those negative reviews removed or changed. You can find out about Sales Backer and how you can use it on this episode.\nI heard you talking about keyword duplication on product listings? Can you tell me about that?\nThere has been a lot of confusion about keywords and how they are used in the Amazon product listings, and for good reason. It appears from trials that various Amazon sellers have done that some of the conventional wisdom surrounding keywords may have been incorrect. On this episode you\u2019ll hear Scott dig into the topic a bit in response to a listener\u2019s question about how to use keywords. It\u2019s a very helpful response so make sure you take the time to listen.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:25] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[1:29] Shout out to the TAS Facebook community.\n \t[4:10] QUESTION ONE: I\u2019m doing a new product launch and I\u2019m not sure how to choose the right category in light of competition, etc.\n \t[11:11] QUESTION TWO: I\u2019m having trouble figuring out if I should pay high shipping or buy more products and store them economically in the U.S. with arrangements to ship to Amazon monthly?\n \t[18:14] QUESTION THREE: How can I leave comments on reviews left on my products using Sales Backer?\n \t[24:04] QUESTION FOUR: I\u2019m curious about keyword duplication in the Amazon backend.

You\u2019ve got to be able to find out how to get your product in front of the people who are most likely to buy it. This episode is a chat with a TAS community member who took it on himself to find his own ways of doing that and he had some pretty significant successes. So sit back and relax, grab a cup of coffee and a pen and paper because you\u2019ll want to take some notes about what Kent did to get attention for his products which in turn ramped up his sales and built an interested email list of customers right from the start.\nAre you selling a product or the story behind the product?\nOne of the things today\u2019s guest did masterfully to build enthusiasm for his product was to create a story (a true story) around the product and even the process of how it came to be. He highlighted the story of his own family and the need they felt for a particular type of product that didn\u2019t exist - and followed up with a description of how they decided to create the product themselves. It\u2019s a beautiful demonstration of what\u2019s being called \u201cstory selling\u201d and you get to hear the inside scoop on how Kent pulled it off, on this episode of the podcast.\nUsing Facebook to enlist the help of friends, family, and associates.\nWhen Kent finally got his products ordered he wanted to start a pre-promotion phase to encourage interest in the product before he actually launched. He coupled the story behind the product\u2019s creation with requests to friends and family (and others) to help him get a good start with ratings and reviews. He invited those interested in helping to join the mailing list to learn more about the product and get a discount when the product launched. He was able to build a list of 130 subscribers before he even had product in stock at Amazon. You can hear his creative solutions to product promotion on this episode.\nThe up and down of a product launch\u2019s initial stages.\nAs Kent finally got his products listed on Amazon and began his launch he had an initial spurt of good sales and 25 reviews within the first week. But his sales began to slump fairly quickly once the first week launch was over. He was discouraged for a bit and quickly realized that the momentum of the launch was not something he could count on long term. But the fact that he\u2019d already built a list of interested customers - and that his product was one that needed to be replenished over time - enabled him to stay encouraged and keep moving forward. That\u2019s when he got the idea to do a different form of promotion that worked big time. You can hear him tell his entire story on this episode. \nDon\u2019t forget to try promotions through traditional media outlets.\nAfter Kent\u2019s initial launch week was over he started thinking outside the box to find additional ways to promote his products. One approach he thought of was to offer a \u201cfeature\u201d story to the local newspaper. He sent a very simple email that briefly outlined the story in an appealing way and got a great response from the paper. His product and family\u2019s story was featured in the Saturday edition and Kent got over 150 sales the day of publication. He\u2019s excited to see where his product will - and you can hear all the details of the journey so far on this episode!\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:25] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[1:02] The power of building an email launch list.\n \t[1:49] A shout out to a member of the TAS Facebook Community!\n \t[5:50] How Scott noticed what Kent was doing.\n \t[7:20] Kent\u2019s story of going from retail arbitrage to private label.\n \t[10:50] How Kent chose his first product for private label.\n \t[12:43] Kent\u2019s process for collecting email addresses.\n \t[16:40] The 6 part email sequence Kent used.\n \t[18:30] Getting purchases and reviews.\n \t[21:10] Asking people to purchase in the smartest way.", "duration": "48:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS237.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1470040218, "title": "TAS 236 \u2013 How to Create Custom Packaging to Increase Value for Your Products (Real Example)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Once you get started doing private label sales on Amazon and other platforms you need to understand the importance of how you present your products and brand to those who are considering a purchase from you.

He wants you to learn from some of the smart things the company did to increase his perception of their company and the product he purchased. It\u2019s all on this episode. \nPerceived value is one of the most important reasons to create custom packaging.\nScott recently purchased a lens for his iPhone to make his photos and videos pop a bit more. When he received it he was blown away by the packaging and all the little \u201cextras\u201d the company included with his order.

Why would you want to do that? Because you want your customers to have the impression that you are a real business (and you are, aren\u2019t you?). You\u2019re erasing any doubt or skepticism they may have had with every little value add you can provide. A help resource is a great way you can do that.\nGrab that email address with custom packaging.\nWhen you think about creating custom packaging for your private label products you may only be thinking of logos, colors, shape, etc. But did you ever consider that you can place some kind of call to action on the packaging that drives people to your website? That\u2019s a great way to encourage opt-ins to your email list so you can communicate directly to your customers. You don\u2019t want to draw them away from Amazon for the purchase of your product, but you can offer them something more such as product registration, help guides, etc. That enables you to get them on your site where they can be asked for an email address. You can hear Scott\u2019s thoughts on this great idea on this episode.\nGetting into the private label world? You need this free workshop.\nIf you are interested in selling products online it\u2019s always better if you don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel. Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to. Scott Voelker has put together a free private label workshop that he runs now and again and you are invited to register. You\u2019ll not only hear the 5 phases of getting a product for sale on Amazon, you\u2019ll also get to be part of the Q&amp;A session at the end of the workshop. It\u2019s all done live via video so you can attend no matter where you are in the world. On this episode you can get the details of how you can sign up to be a part of that event. And don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s free. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[3:30] Why you might hear some odd sounds in this episode.\n \t[4:29] Why the packaging to Scott\u2019s recent purchase mattered to him.\n \t[6:32] Right out of the box, don\u2019t worry about custom packaging.\n \t[9:45] Did you consider you could print things on the packaging?\n \t[11:50] Basic packaging options available.\n \t[15:28] Examples from a product Scott purchased.\n \t[24:13] The importance of a call to action on insert cards.\n \t[30:42] How to determine what content to place on your cards.\n \t[22:08] What\u2019s the best source for your packaging?\n \t[34:44] Why you have to order a larger quantity for custom packaging.\n \t[36:15] The power of bundling things together and the extras received.", "duration": "40:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS236.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1469781059, "title": "TAS 235 : Ask Scott Session #70 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "When it comes to researching and launching a private label product on Amazon there are many hoops to jump through - and the Amazon terms of service change often. How do you know that what you\u2019re doing is the right thing to do? One way is to find a trusted person who\u2019s already been down the path - and that\u2019s what these Ask Scott episodes are all about! You can ask your own questions of Scott Voelker, an experienced Amazon seller. He\u2019s got 4 questions today about PPC, unloading failed products, the impact reviews have on sales or PPC, and whether or not you should try to sell your products on platforms other than Amazon. It\u2019s all on this episode.\nHow to cut your losses to get out of a private label product you\u2019ve tried.\nA listener called in to ask Scott if he could walk through the various options when it comes to liquidating private label products that simply aren\u2019t selling. Scott understands the question and the need behind it. There are many reasons you might need to get rid of products that you\u2019ve been trying to sell and his answer to this question is one that will give you a head full of ideas to try out if you\u2019re in the same situation. Be sure you listen to find out ways that you can sell products to recoup the money you\u2019ve invested.\nI have hundreds of products on Amazon already. How should I approach PPC?\nOn this episode a caller asks about using PPC when she\u2019s already got an established and broad Amazon seller account. In her case, she\u2019s already listed hundreds of products on Amazon. Choosing how to approach PPC seems like a daunting task. But Scott\u2019s got some good suggestions for making her pay per click strategy effective and he shares them with her on this episode. Are you confused about PPC? As Scott answers this question you\u2019ll probably find some help to the issues that are hanging you up, too.\nWhat impact do reviews have on the success of my products and PPC campaigns?\nA lot of people who place their private label products on the Amazon sales platform don\u2019t understand how product reviews work in the Amazon ecosystem. It\u2019s not that your reviews directly get you a higher ranking on Amazon search results OR give you an increase in your sales numbers. Reviews serve more of a complementary function. Imagine this: You\u2019re searching for a product you\u2019ve been meaning to buy and there are two options. One of them has 3 product reviews, the other has 300. Which are you more likely to trust? The one with the 300 reviews. Do you see that the number of reviews your product receives serve as social proof that your product is a good one? Find out how Scott advises this caller who only has a handful of reviews on what she can do to get more social proof for her product by listening to this episode.\nIs your ecommerce business being held hostage by Amazon?\nSelling private label products on Amazon is really an ecommerce business. Since it\u2019s on Amazon you may not have thought of it that way, but it\u2019s the truth. Ecommerce can be implemented on a wide variety of platforms - Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, and more. But you have to understand that whatever platform you\u2019re selling on, you have to play by that platform\u2019s rules. It\u2019s understandable - and somewhat frustrating at times. Scott answers a listener\u2019s question today with a question of his own\u2026 Is Amazon holding your ecommerce business hostage?

But very few think as big as what actually happened for Chad Rubin. Chad\u2019s private label success forced him to create an amazing software solution for his biggest problems. You\u2019re going to hear Chad\u2019s story from the beginning until now - how he built an amazing private label business on Amazon, grew it to monstrous proportions, and then pivoted to create a software that is now leading the way in the ecommerce space.\nGreat ways to discover product ideas that actually sell.\nOne of the most difficult aspects of building an Amazon private label business is finding that perfect product that sells - and continues to sell. Chad Rubin says that those kinds of products require a lot of research into the market it will be serving. You\u2019ve got to make sure that you\u2019re actually meeting a real life need to ensure that there will always be a market for the product so you\u2019re not left with a huge investment that never pans out. You can hear Chad\u2019s advice for finding those kinds of products on this episode.\nCome up with an idea that solves a specific problem.\nYou can\u2019t expect to jump on Alibaba and choose the first product that looks like it might sell. You\u2019ve got to find one that truly meets a need that consumers are willing to pay to have solved. Chad Rubin\u2019s formula for private label success starts there. He suggests that you look at your own life - at the problems you face and the things you wish were different - and let those frustrations inspire you to create products that solve those problems. If you have the problem, you can bet thousands of others do too. Find out how Chad goes about his own product discovery on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nCome up with an idea that has to do with something you love.\nMany private label sellers fade away over time because they start selling a product they think will be successful, but it\u2019s not something they personally have an interest in. Chad Rubin says that long term success requires that you\u2019re working on something that you actually enjoy or have interest in. When you\u2019re passionate about the products you sell you\u2019re going to be much more motivated over the long haul and will be able to persevere to see your business thrive. If you want to be inspired by an incredible story you\u2019ll want to hear this episode.\nChoose a product that doesn\u2019t get you stuck in one narrow niche.\nSuccessful private label sales depends on building a brand, not just selling one popular or in-demand product. When you only have one product you get stuck in a one dimensional place where it\u2019s hard to branch out and create secondary streams of income for your business. Chad Rubin suggests that you start out with an eye toward building a brand that can span many different niches of products. That way you\u2019re able to pivot more easily, add complementary products to your product line in a natural way, and maximize your potential to cross sell to your existing customer base.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:04] Scott\u2019s introduction to this podcast episode.\n \t[1:46] An iTunes review left recently (leave your review over there, too!).\n \t[3:24] The upcoming workshop!\n \t[4:24] Scott\u2019s introduction to Chad Rubin and the beginnings of his story.\n \t[6:42] How Chad recommends someone get started when looking for products.\n \t[8:19] Why Chad focuses on products that bring innovation to the market.\n \t[9:18] The way that Chad began selling his inventory on Amazon.\n \t[10:55] How Chad pivoted his business to service existing brands.\n \t[13:27] The places Chad gets his product ideas.\n \t[15:26] Chad\u2019s recipe for e-commerce success.\n \t[17:30] The value of making sure your products are on more than one channel.\n \t[18:58] The process to getting products listed on Wal-Mart.\n \t[24:31] Choosing a brand that doesn\u2019t get you stuck in one small niche.\n \t[28:28] Is Alibaba the best place to find a good product?", "duration": "45:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS234.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1469435449, "title": "TAS 233 : (Hot Seat) Slow Sales After Running Out Of Stock \u2013 Now WHAT?", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Every Amazon private label seller is going to face this problem sooner or later: you\u2019ll run out of stock so quickly that you won\u2019t be able to get new products to Amazon in time. There are many ways you can deal with it, but what should you do to ensure that your sales resume at a good pace once you have products back in stock? On this episode Scott and his friend Chris - both experienced Amazon sellers - are looking at a real Amazon product that ran out of stock and is now having trouble resuming the good sales it had before. Both guys have great insights into the issues that are causing problems, on this episode.\nAlways check the trends surrounding a product\u2019s sales before you launch.\nYou may not think of your particular product as a seasonal item. But you might be surprised. Scott and Chris always recommend that a key component of your product research phase is to use a tool like Google Trends to research the trends of how your product has sold in the past. On this episode Scott and Chris discover that a product that was selling like crazy and suddenly lost it\u2019s momentum is actually seasonal in nature. It makes a huge difference in how you approach your product sales and sometimes impacts whether you choose to sell that product at all.\nAre you making this mistake with your product title?\nIn an effort to build brand recognition many Amazon sellers place the name of their brand in the title of their product. Both Chris and Scott believe it\u2019s a mistake to do that. Why? Because unless someone is specifically searching for your brand name you won\u2019t get any search juice out of having your brand name in the title - and the title of your product is one of the most important spots you want to have keywords that people may be searching for. On this episode you can learn some additional hacks you can use to optimize your listing for better search accessibility and greater sales.\nDo you have the right kind of pictures on your product listing?\nAmazon\u2019s terms of service make it clear what type of picture can be used for your primary product photo, but when it comes to your secondary photos there are many things you can do to make them stand out and attract attention. On this episode Scott and Chris analyze a real private label product that is having problems with sales and the images are one of the things they notice. Find out what remedies they recommend and get some ideas for how to improve your own product listing, on this episode.\nLook at the product that is selling the most in your niche and imitate what they\u2019re doing.\nIt only makes sense that if one product in your niche is dominating the sales, you should borrow from what they\u2019re doing. Never use the exact photos they are, but if you can create a photo that is similar in approach or feel, do it. Never completely copy their title or description, but if they are expressing the usefulness of your product in different ways, try to learn from what they are doing.

On this episode he\u2019s addressing some pretty interesting questions. Should you try to compete directly with Amazon when it is the only seller of a particular product? How can you go about coming up with a brand name? When would it be better to merge two identical products that only have one small variation? Those are just some of the things you\u2019ll hear on these Ask Scott episodes, so be sure to subscribe to the podcast so you don\u2019t miss an episode.\nShould you launch a product that is in direct competition with Amazon?\nThere are many products on Amazon that only Amazon sells - and it may be intimidating to think of going up against the mighty Amazon. But Scott thinks that if you approach it the right way and keep your head on straight. You can do it. On this episode Scott is asked about that issue and he gives a very clear answer to whether it\u2019s a good idea to compete directly with Amazon, what questions you should be asking, and what you should look out for if you\u2019re going to take it upon yourself to challenge Amazon\u2019s sales.\nMy products are duplicates except for their color. Should I merge them?\nWhen you list a product for sale on Amazon you have two options. You can set up every product you bring to the platform in its own listing, or if they are similar and only differ by variations such as color or size, you can place them under the same listing, but as variations of the same product. Which is better? It depends on a number of things that can sometimes be confusing. So on this episode Scott tackles the question and gives you his ideas on how to make the decision.\nI really want to find the brand name for my products that is just right. Do you have any tips?\nIn many ways naming your brand is just like naming your first child - you really want to get it right. But Scott doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s all that important at first. Instead he recommends that you get a trial run of your product on the way and experiment with its sales first to ensure that all your energy to name it is well founded. But he doesn\u2019t stop there - Scott does have some good ideas for how you can brainstorm brand name ideas, so be sure to listen to this episode.\nIf you are new to Amazon Private Label, here\u2019s a free resource for you!\nIt can be very confusing trying to figure out all the rules and steps involved in listing a product for sale on Amazon. That\u2019s why Scott Voelker has simplified things into 5 steps and put it into a free course. You can learn everything from researching product ideas, to choosing the product, to finding a supplier, to getting your first shipment and listing it on Amazon.

Hey, we all know what it\u2019s like to be tight on cash. But if you are honest with yourself you\u2019ll be able to look at the opportunities you have to get the extra cash you need to get started. That\u2019s what this episode of the podcast is all about. Scott\u2019s talking with his friend Dom Sugar about the way he\u2019s gotten started and the simple but significant things he has done to make cash when he didn\u2019t realize he had the resources. Anyone can do what Dom suggests on this episode so be sure you take some time to listen.\nFrom a retail store, to ebay, to retail arbitrage, to private label.\nDom Sugar grew up in an environment where business was a significant part of life. As he grew older he began looking for ways that he could \u201cset up shop\u201d for himself and one of the most significant in the early years was through eBay. He learned quickly that he could sell used and new items for a profit and began leveraging the opportunity to increase his own cash flow. As the online space grew and changed, so did he, and the success he\u2019s experienced in his business overall is a testament to the power of diligence and patience. You can hear Dom\u2019s story and get some ideas about how YOU can get started selling items online, on this episode.\nThere is no excuse for not getting started.\nIt seems that many of the people who say they want to get started selling products on Amazon just don\u2019t want it badly enough. Dom Sugar is convinced that anyone can scrounge up the money to get started, whether it\u2019s through a garage sale, through selling used or unused items on eBay, or beginning to step into the retail arbitrage area. On this episode he tells the story of how he got going with retail arbitrage, gives some great tips on how to go about it and the types of products to look for, and speaks to why he thinks RA is the first logical step into the Amazon waters. You can learn a lot from this conversation.\nWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. \nOne of Scott\u2019s favorite sayings is, \u201cTake action\u201d because nobody ever did anything by waiting for it to happen. If you want to get started selling products on Amazon there is a way. The question is, \u201cDo YOU have the will to see it happen?\u201d On this episode Dom Sugar shares with Scott how he\u2019s been able to make his business grow through consistent hard work and learning, and how he\u2019s now sending truckloads of products to Amazon to prepare for Christmas and the 4th quarter. It\u2019s a long way from where her started, but he\u2019s convinced that you can do it too - and on this episode he tells you where he\u2019d begin if he were starting all over.\nWhen things change in the marketplace, you\u2019ve got to learn how to pivot.\nFrom a big box department store chain to a mom and pop store on the corner of your town, any successful business has to pivot as the market changes. That means the leaders of the business have to adapt, come up with new strategies, introduce new products, whatever it takes to ensure that the business can continue to make sales and expand profits. Dom Sugar has done that as his online business efforts have changed time and time again over the years and on this episode he shares some of his ideas about how you can not only get started building cash for a successful Amazon business, but also how you can strategize to stick with it long term.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[3:02] Dom\u2019s background in business, retail arbitrage, and ecommerce.\n \t[5:12] Why Dom got into the online space with his retail businesses.\n \t[9:53] Why you can\u2019t stick with only one sales platform.\n \t[11:00] The difference Amazon FBA made to Dom\u2019s business.\n \t[15:20] The reason retail arbitrage is a good entry point.\n \t[21:25] The first place to go if you need cash to get started on Amazon.", "duration": "56:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS231.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1468830601, "title": "TAS 230 : 3 Types of Sales Funnels for Your Business (Survive without Amazon Sales)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Since the beginning Scott\u2019s blog, website, and podcast have been all about making money through Amazon Private Label sales.

But if you put all your eggs in one basket - even the Amazon basket - you are at the mercy of the platform where you\u2019ve put all those eggs.

You can hear Scott\u2019s outline of why this stuff matters, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nBlogging to provide valuable content to your ideal customers is a great way to build a sales funnel.\nThere are many people who have built a significant business on the back of a blog. But if you want to go this route to build your own platform for product sales you need to know that it\u2019s a very crowded space - which only means you\u2019ll have to do an excellent job at it. As you blog, adding valuable content that helps your ideal audience or customer you\u2019ll be building the trust your audience needs to feel comfortable purchasing your product. And in the meantime, you\u2019re building systems into your blog that captures the email addresses of those who come to your blog. It\u2019s an amazing thing that really works. You\u2019ll want to hear Scott\u2019s approach to this idea on this episode.\nYou can use a giveaway to build an email list and stimulate sales.\nIf you want to start building your own mailing list of people who are interested in your products you can do it right away by doing a giveaway. A previous guest on Scott\u2019s show - Mike Jackness - did this with amazing results and got thousands of email subscribers. You can use those emails later to provide a discount to those who did not win the contest, provide them valuable content to help them with their particular area of interest relating to your products, and to promote future products in your market to increase future sales. Scott walks through the details of how to set up an effective giveaway on this episode.\nIf you want to start building a business, Amazon is a great place to do it.\nIf you\u2019ve never sold a product or service online before, there\u2019s no better and easier place to get your feet wet than by selling on Amazon. It sounds intimidating at first and there are lots of things to learn and tweak as you go along, but you can do it. Scott\u2019s focus up to this point has been to help you build and maximize a sales channel on Amazon so that you can build the life and business that you truly want. If you\u2019d like to get in on one of Scott\u2019s live workshops that teaches you the 5 steps to building an Amazon sales machine, you can find out how to get in on the next workshop by listening to this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to thIs episode of the podcast!\n \t[3:40] How you can get into a free workshop about Amazon sales!\n \t[5:32] The best way to build a sustainable business (VistaPrint example).\n \t[8:11] What if you could pay $1 and make $5?\n \t[11:35] What if you could follow up with customers immediately and remarket to them?", "duration": "45:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS230.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1468571410, "title": "TAS 229 : Ask Scott Session #68 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s time for you to get your Amazon private label questions answered from Scott Voelker, an experienced private label sales professional who is actively building his business both on and off Amazon every single day.

If you want to ask your own private label questions, listen to this episode to find out how you can!\nIs it \u201clegal\u201d with Amazon to put my website URL on my product packaging?\nOne of the main ways you can build your Amazon private label business is to capture the email addresses of the people who purchase your products so that you can then remarket to them with discount offers, other product possibilities, and more. But how do you get the email addresses of your customers? One Amazon seller has the idea to put his website URL on his actual product packaging.But is that legal according to Amazon\u2019s terms of service? On this episode Scott is going to answer the question from his own perspective. His take is interesting because the answer is not very clear in the Amazon terms of service.\nI\u2019ve ordered my first private label product but am starting to feel like the market is too crowded. Help!\nIf you\u2019ve already got your products or they are on the way to you, that\u2019s great. Way to take action! But sometimes you might start to second guess yourself while you\u2019re waiting to receive your products. It\u2019s not unusual for people in that situation to continue to check their niche and begin to feel that they chose the wrong product because the market is too crowded. If that\u2019s you, what should you do? On this episode Scott fields that question and gives some hopeful answers to make the most of the products you already have. You won\u2019t want to miss this one.\nI\u2019m considering the purchase of Jungle Scout Pro\u2026 can you help me understand the options?\nTwo of the best tools out there to help Amazon private label sellers make the most of their product research and listings is Jungle Scout - but it comes in two versions - the basic and PRO. What is the difference and how do they work together? Scott is personal friends with the creator of Jungle Scout and he has used both versions of the product. That means he\u2019s got a very solid experience and opinion about the software and on this episode he shares the differences, similarities, and which you should get if you\u2019re looking to get into Amazon sales.\nShould I include multiple words in my search field to get exact match keywords set up?\nThere\u2019s been mixed advice over the years about how to use the \u201csearch terms\u201d field in the backend of your Amazon product listing. Some people have said that you should not repeat words in those fields while others say that it\u2019s OK to repeat words to maximize the possibility of being found for long tail keywords. Which is right? On this episode Scott outlines what he\u2019s heard on both sides of the argument and invites listeners to submit their split-test data regarding keywords so he can report on it to the rest of the TAS community.

On this episode he\u2019s going to say that over and over. But he also wants to be known as an Amazon seller who will speak the truth about what\u2019s really happening as Amazon gets more and more crowded and as Amazon adjusts its algorithms as a result. He\u2019s not abandoning Amazon (no way!) but is beginning to notice why he\u2019s got to think bigger, broader, and make things a little less dependent on Amazon alone. You\u2019re going to hear his latest sales numbers and what he is planning to do to adjust his strategy, on this episode.\nWhy would Scott share his own sales and expense numbers?\nOn any of the Amazon sales communities you find on Facebook or other places online you often see screenshots of amazing sales numbers that sellers are getting from their private label products. Great! That\u2019s what selling on Amazon is all about. But often those screenshots and brags don\u2019t tell the whole story. The costs, fees, and other miscellaneous things that go into running a successful business have to be clear as well. So that you can see the real situation that exists for most Amazon sellers, Scott likes to share his own expense and profit numbers. He doesn\u2019t do it to impress you but to impress upon you the realities of what it takes to sell on Amazon successfully. You\u2019re going to get a great education on this episode.\nAre you sick of the huge fees you\u2019re paying to Amazon?\nNext time you look over the reports Amazon provides about how your private label products are doing, take a look at the amount of fees Amazon is taking for every sale. Does that number make you sick? Recently Scott looked over his numbers and saw that almost 40% of his sales income was going to Amazon. That\u2019s OK, Amazon deserves something for helping him sell his products so successfully. But what would it be like if even half of the products Scott was selling were able to be sold independent of Amazon? That\u2019s a huge amount of profit back in his product. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear what Scott\u2019s going to be doing to break free of the Amazon fees, so be sure you take some time to listen.\nWhy content marketing is the best way to build a business long term.\nDo you know the term \u201ccontent marketing?\u201d It\u2019s one approach to getting people to look at the things you\u2019re doing online. But it\u2019s a long term game. It requires you to be producing quality information that educates people about the topics surrounding your product. It requires you to be working hard to produce lots of things that don\u2019t actually sell your product, but build the level of trust that people have when they see what you have to say about your market area. Can you create content around your market that helps your customer? Scott thinks you probably can and that you should be to begin building a sales channel that is independent of Amazon so that you can make greater profits. Business is business and you need to adjust as you go to make your sales go as far as they can. Be sure to listen to this one.\nWhy you need to focus on a market and not just on a popular widget.\nIt\u2019s great to get sales from selling lots and lots of popular products. Profit is profit. But if you\u2019re making those sales for only a short time, that\u2019s not a strategy that\u2019s going to last you. That\u2019s why you need to be focusing in on a market that will provide you with many product ideas that can create a sort of product line - not just one product that\u2019s popular right now. On this episode of the podcast Scott unpacks what it means to build a product line within a market and why it\u2019s so important so be sure you take the time to listen.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:04] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[1:10] Why Amazon is a lot like Google and what it means for our businesses.\n \t[5:30] What Scott is saying to new people to Amazon.\n \t[8:07] The importance of thinking long term when it comes...", "duration": "42:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS228.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1468225829, "title": "TAS 227 : 5 Tips to Find Your Work and Life Balance and not Get Overwhelmed", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Scott just completed a physical move of over 800 miles. He\u2019s in his new home office and doing his first recording of the podcast from there, on this episode. The planning, preparation, and pressure of the move got Scott thinking about the simple but important things he\u2019s been able to do that enabled the move to go smoothly\u2026 and as usual, he\u2019s got to share what he\u2019s thinking with you. So today you\u2019re going to hear Scott\u2019s thoughts about work life balance and how to avoid the overwhelm that can easily happen in life, and especially if you\u2019re trying to build a business while you enjoy your life. It\u2019s a great episode you can learn a lot of practical things from, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nEverybody who wants to accomplish specific things needs structure in their life.\nAnd isn\u2019t that everybody? All of us have dreams, but until those dreams have something behind them that pushes them forward, they remain dreams only. Scott\u2019s a \u201ctake action\u201d guy in case you haven\u2019t noticed. His belief that action precedes success has proven to be true in his business over and over. On this episode he\u2019s addressing the need for a balance between work and life, and like everything else in life he believes that if you\u2019re going to accomplish it, you\u2019ve got to structure things so that it comes about. Nothing happens by serendipity or chance, it happens because forces are at work that make it happen. You can be that force for your own life and business. You can be the one to impose a structure that leads your life and business in a direction you want. Find out more on this episode.\nTIP #1: Create a list of your current tasks and obligations.\nIf you were to take the time to create a list of all the tasks and obligations you have to do in any given day - work, family, social, religious - how long would that list be? For some people it\u2019s exhausting just to think about listing everything out, but there\u2019s an actual freedom and lightening of the load that happens when you do. Getting things on paper makes them a bit more manageable, a bit more \u201creal\u201d in terms of seeing them for what they are. It will help you think through everything at one time and recognize the things that need to come first, what is next, etc. Scott\u2019s 5 tips for achieving better life work balance are pretty simple, and if you apply them to your life and business you\u2019ll see some amazing results. Be sure you get to hear all 5 by listening to this episode.\nDeadlines don\u2019t have to be stressors. They can be your best friends.\nDo you remember your school days? You always had due dates for certain assignments, didn\u2019t you? Why did your teachers make you complete papers or projects within a certain timeframe? It\u2019s because they knew that non-time-based objectives are not really objectives at all. A task that has no time of completion attached to it floats around in your head and on the periphery of your personal radar and is easily bumped to a secondary place in your mind. You don\u2019t pay as much attention to it and it tends not to get done. Tip #3 on Scott\u2019s list of ways to find work life balance and avoid overwhelm is to set your own deadlines for the things you have to do. He\u2019s got some great ways of thinking about that, on this episode.\nDo you put your tasks into a daily schedule? You should if you want to get them done.\nThink about it. The major things we want to accomplish are often too big for us to get done all at one shot. That means they have to be broken up into smaller, bite-sized tasks. Those are the things we have GOT to insert into a daily workflow, a daily schedule that enables us to take those individual bites that enable us to get the whole thing done over time. It\u2019s a cooperation of time and task that chips away at a large thing until it is D-O-N-E - done.

Today\u2019s episode is filled with questions from real Amazon sellers who are in the trenches, building their own business to benefit themselves, their family, and the world. Today Scott answers questions about choosing a second product, aiming at a particular market, shipping to Amazon USA when you live in a different country, maximizing your PPC (Pay Per Click) campaigns, and how to use Camel Camel Camel. It\u2019s all on this episode of the podcast.\nI\u2019ve heard people say that launching a second product is a good way to increase sales, is that always true?\nThe short answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d A second product has to be researched effectively and tied into your current product line to make the most sense and give you the most return on your effort. You can\u2019t expect to simply pick a product, set it up on Amazon, and see sales come in. It simply doesn\u2019t work that way. It makes a lot more sense to research your market and to develop a uniquely branded product line within the market that feeds from one product to another within your brand. That way you can promote cross sales and related items to people who are already familiar and happy with your products and brand.\nI don\u2019t live in the U.S. How can I have my Chinese supplied products shipped straight to Amazon instead of to my home?\nA caller has heard that it makes sense to have your products from China shipped to your home before you send them to Amazon so that you can inspect them and assure that the quality is as you wish. But what if you don\u2019t live in the U.S. but are selling on the Amazon U.S. site? The answer is to find an inspection company that can go on site to your supplier and inspect your products to ensure their quality before they ship. It\u2019s an added expense and an added step, but it is a great way to enable your supplier to ship directly to Amazon and ensure that the quality of your products is high as well.\nMy Pay Per Click (PPC) budget is used up in the first day. What am I doing wrong?\nIf you\u2019re running a PPC campaign where the daily budget runs out quickly or almost immediately, you may have a very good problem. What\u2019s happening is either one of two things: #1 - You\u2019ve allotted a very small amount and it\u2019s running through it quickly - in which case you\u2019d need to increase your daily budget. OR #2 - There are many people searching for your target keywords and clicking on your ads as a result. How do you determine which it is and what can you do to take full advantage of it? You\u2019ll find out on this episode of The Amazing Seller when Scott answers a listener question about PPC.\nA great tool you can use to validate data about a new product idea.\nWhen you\u2019re considering a new product, it\u2019s easy to be misled by the initial research. The numbers can look very good at first until you dig a bit deeper. You want to use tools like www.CamelCamelCamel.com to look into the sales history and other facts surrounding similar products before you take the plunge. You can learn a lot that could save you from making a mistake that could cost you thousands of dollars.

Scott and his Dad, Papa V., were driving a moving truck to Scott\u2019s new home and decided to use the time on the road to record an episode of the podcast. It\u2019s a fun ramble around the topics of business building and pursuing a particular market niche for your business. You\u2019ll hear Scott and Papa V. brainstorm product and content ideas live as they drive (hey, that rhymes), on this episode of The Amazing Seller Podcast.\nBuilding a business long term is more than getting one product on Amazon.\nIt\u2019s a great thing to get your private label product onto Amazon and get it selling. Good for you. That\u2019s the way to take action. But just because you have one product that is selling doesn\u2019t mean you have a long term, sustainable business yet. You\u2019ve got to do some strategic thinking around that product to discover the vertical products or related products that you can offer to build an actual brand. When you\u2019re able to do that, you have a long term business that can serve you and your customers over the long haul. This episode of the Amazing Seller features Scott\u2019s ramble about how to get started moving toward a brand and building that long term business.\nThe best way to establish credibility and trust with your customers.\nYou remember the kid in elementary school who was always bragging about the things he could do or had done? Nobody really believed him, did they? That\u2019s because it\u2019s much more impacting to have others praise you. That \u201csocial proof\u201d serves as credibility for you that doesn\u2019t have to come from your own mouth. That\u2019s the power of reviews and testimonials - and once you\u2019re able to get them flowing, you want to keep them coming, because when potential customers see that other people have purchased and enjoyed your products, they are more prone to trust you too.\nA solid website outside of Amazon is the next step to building your own brand.\nAmazon is great. You\u2019ll never hear Scott saying otherwise. But he has seen enough to know that having all your eggs in the Amazon basket is not a good long term strategy. You need to be able to sell your products on a platform that you control so that you can have greater margins and greater flexibility in how you interact with your customers and serve them with new products. The first step toward that is building your own website. When you do that and begin getting customers on to your sales list, your sales can increase exponentially every time you have a new product or an addition to your product line. Listen to how Scott recommends you go about setting up your website on this truck-cast episode.\nHow you can build an email list of customers who love your products.\nWhen you are able to establish your own website that features your products, you\u2019re ready to begin collecting email addresses from your customers. But Amazon doesn\u2019t allow you to communicate directly with your customers - so how do you get their email addresses? One way to do it is through adding inserts to your products that ask your customers to register their product for future customer service benefits or information. That allows you to communicate directly with them without having to go through Amazon\u2019s systems. Imagine what you could offer your customers if you could communicate directly. And you can do it if you take action on the things Scott has to share on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:34] Why Scott\u2019s driving a moving truck for today\u2019s episode.\n \t[1:11] Today\u2019s topic: How to start a business that lasts long term.\n \t[2:21] The reason Papa V. was able to attract customers over other competitors.\n \t[5:07] How social proof and testimonials drives credibility and trust.\n \t[7:42] The importance of a solid website.\n \t[12:05] How can you best serve the market you are aiming at?", "duration": "35:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS225.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1467621029, "title": "TAS 224 : 3 Red Flags for Bad Product Selection and How to Avoid Them!", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "The number of questions Scott gets week after week about whether or not a product idea is a good one are so numerous that it\u2019s prompted him to record this episode.

It used to be an approach for sellers to simply grab the exact same product from a Chinese supplier that is already being sold on Amazon and put it up on Amazon. And believe it or not, they would get sales. But that approach doesn\u2019t work anymore simply because it\u2019s too easy for other sellers to sell the exact same thing and undercut you, steal your listing, and other problems. So if you look at a potential product on Amazon and see the identical product over and over and over, beware. Find more things to be careful of when choosing a private label product on this episode.\nProduct Research Red Flag #2: Pages and pages of the exact same product.\nIf you\u2019ve got an idea for a private label product and find pages and pages of the exact same product on Amazon already, you should be very careful. It will be very difficult for you to get your product to make any headway on that product. Why? Because there are so many of the same thing. But there is still a possibility and it lies in whether or not you\u2019ll be able to differentiate a product enough to make yours desireable in ways that the competition is not. You can hear Scott dive into the issue on this episode and ramp up your private label sales.\nProduct Research Red Flag #3: When you see the exact same product on the websites of suppliers.\nThe reason you don\u2019t want to try to start selling a new private label product when the images and product description on the suppliers website is exactly what is already on Amazon is because that product is easily copied. Not only will you have tons of competition for sales on that product, you\u2019ll also have a very high risk of your product listing being hijacked and you will lose control of the buy box and your overall ability to control your prospects for sales. You can find out exactly what all that means on this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast.\nHow can you sell a private label product successfully in a crowded market?\nThe answer is to make your product unique in some way that the buyers truly care about. How can you discover the ways you should differentiate your product? You\u2019ve got to a little legwork by reading through the reviews about similar products that have been left on Amazon. You\u2019ll discover things that actual buyers have complained about regarding the product which translates into improvements you can make to the product that will make yours more desireable. You can also look at related products that could be added to your product in a bundle so that your product is not only a greater value but also more unique. Scott has lots of ideas about this kind of thing and you can hear them on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:25] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the show.\n \t[1:57] How you can get transcripts and show notes.\n \t[2:16] Get in on the new Private Label Workshop.\n \t[3:21] Get into the TAS Facebook group.\n \t[4:17] Why Amazon is not too saturated for you to make it big.\n \t[7:30] Some promising results Scott has had recently on a new product experiment.\n \t[10:13] Red flag #1: Identical products.\n \t[11:53] Red flag #2: Pages of the identical product.\n \t[17:41] Red flag #3: The exact same product on supplier websites.\n \t[19:20] Considerations you should make about the...", "duration": "35:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS224.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1467361814, "title": "TAS 223 : Ask Scott Session #66 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "This is the Friday Ask Scott episode of The Amazing Seller podcast where you (and people like you) get to ask their particular questions about Amazon sales. On this episode Scott fields question about choosing a product when the market appears to be very crowded, how to differentiate products, and what to expect when having products shipped from China. You\u2019ll get a great taste from the type of things Scott is able to answer and learn how you can submit your own questions regarding Amazon private label sales, on this episode.\nI have found a product possibility that looks promising but the market is very crowded. What should I do?\nOne of the things that you need to research when it comes to finding a product that could be a good seller on Amazon is the market that product is within. You want a product that is already on Amazon and selling fairly well, but if the market is too crowded you\u2019ll have a very hard time getting your product to become a contender in that niche. BUT - that\u2019s not always the truth. If you find a crowded market but many of them are not optimized well or are not getting many sales, you might have a winner, especially if you can differentiate your product somehow. On this episode you\u2019ll hear Scott go over a number of ways a product can be created that is unique and draws in buyers, so be sure to listen.\nCreating a bundle may be your answer to entering a crowded market.\nIf you\u2019ve found a potential product that has great sales numbers in the highest selling products but is in a very crowded market, you can break in by offering a product bundle that meets more specific needs of the market. How do you do that? On this episode Scott talks through many of the things you can do to find exactly how you can make your products unique, get them into the market in a powerful way, and begin taking some of that market by adding value that nobody else is adding. You\u2019ll hear it all on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nI got a quote from my supplier for shipping of my products but now that my products are in production the shipping has doubled? Is that normal?\nA listener called in to ask Scott about what\u2019s normal or customary when it comes to working with overseas suppliers. She\u2019s already found her product and negotiated a deal on cost and features and the products are being produced now. But just recently she received an email from her supplier saying that her shipping costs had more than doubled - from $1000 to over $2500! She wants to know if that\u2019s normal or if she should be skeptical and ask more questions. In typical style Scott goes right to the heart of the issue and gives some clear and practical advice on what this listener can do to find out exactly what\u2019s going on. You can hear it on this episode.\nDo you have an issue with your private label product that you\u2019d like answered?\nThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t ask and get an answer. The Ask Scott sessions of The Amazing Seller podcast publish every Friday and are a great way for you to submit specific questions about Amazon private label sales and get an answer from Scott Voelker, and experienced Amazon seller. He takes questions from the most fundamental to the most advanced so don\u2019t be shy about asking.

When a product won\u2019t sell but it looks like the market is a pretty good niche to be in, there are usually some fundamental things wrong with the product listing itself. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott Voelker and his friend Chris Schaeffer look over a real life product listing of a product that\u2019s having those exact problems and true to form, the listing itself is much of the problem. You can hear all the details on this episode of the podcast.\nHow beneficial would it be to have an experienced seller tweak your private label product listing on Amazon?\nThat\u2019s exactly what you get from these Hot Seat sessions of the Amazing Seller podcast. Scott Voelker and Chris Schaeffer take their time walking through the fundamental and advanced steps to optimizing product listings of private label products that have been submitted for help. They normally find a little bit of both and help struggling Amazon sellers get over the hurdles so they can begin selling their products more consistently. There\u2019s not a regular schedule to these hot seat sessions so you should subscribe to the podcast so you don\u2019t miss them, and hear how Scott and Chris advise today\u2019s seller on this episode.\nIs the market of your private label product a good market to be in?\nHow can you know if a potential private label product is one you should take a chance on or one you should leave alone? The best way is to research the broader market that product is in and the current sales of that particular product or things that are similar. By using some simple software tools (many of them free) you can discover exactly what the market for that product is like and whether there is enough room in it for your product to push in and grab some of the sales. Scott and Chris chat about the details of doing that and a whole lot more on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nQuality, clear product images are vital to a good product listing.\nThe product listing that Scott and Chris are looking at today has one major problem that both of them notice immediately; the images do not possess the quality and clarity of any of the other products in their niche. It\u2019s the main reason Scott and Chris believe this product listing has only gotten one organic sale so far. You can hear what they recommend to upgrade the images and how they\u2019ve seen an improvement of the images change the sales of a product dramatically, on this episode. But that\u2019s not all. There are other suggestions for this seller that Scott and Chris make so be sure you take the time to listen. What they share could be the key to YOUR private label product getting even more sales.\nDon\u2019t start your exact match PPC campaigns too soon.\nAs Scott and Chris look over an actual private label listing on Amazon on today\u2019s episode they notice that the seller is already running an exact match PPC campaign, and both of them feel that he\u2019s probably wasting his money. Why? Because he\u2019s not taken the time needed in order to truly understand what his exact match keywords should be. It takes weeks and sometimes months of broad match campaigns to receive enough data to show exactly what keywords are most used when finding your products, and then it takes some time to discover where the actual clicks and sales are coming from within those keywords. Only when those milestones have been crossed you might be ready for an exact match campaign.

He spoke at the Seller\u2019s Summit, an event put on by Steve Chou of www.MyWifeQuitHerJob.com and was a great opportunity for Scott to meet many people interested in making money online. His talk was very well received and serves as a great introduction to those who are unfamiliar or new to the Amazon platform. Be sure to pass this episode along to those you know who have been talking about selling products on Amazon. There are some great insights on this episode.\nScott\u2019s journey to Amazon private label sales was not a straight line.\nScott had a significant business background when he first came upon the idea of selling products on Amazon. He had helped his father run a construction business, established and run his own photography business with his wife, and then moved into online sales. Private label sales made perfect sense to Scott because he saw it as a way to take advantage of Amazon\u2019s built-in mechanism for getting and selling to customers. You can hear Scott\u2019s journey and how he\u2019s come up with a 5 step formula for finding and launching products on Amazon, on this episode.\nNever forget that Amazon is a search engine for buyers.\nThink about that for a minute. Anyone who\u2019s doing a search on Amazon is doing so because they are considering the purchase of something. Millions of people have their credit cards on file with Amazon already so a purchase decision once they\u2019ve found the item they\u2019re searching for is that much easier. If there was a way that you could take advantage of that incredibly effective buying environment, wouldn\u2019t you want to do that? That\u2019s exactly what private label sales on Amazon allows you to do. Learn about the Amazon platform and how you can get your very own products for sale for searchers to find, on this episode.\nThere is only one thing that causes your products to rank higher in Amazon search.\nWhat is that? Sales. As your product sells the Amazon search algorithm considers that it\u2019s a product that people who are searching actually want to buy. Naturally, the more purchases of your product that happen, the more Amazon considers your product to be desirable by real people who are searching. With that in mind, it\u2019s vitally important that you know how to optimize your listing for the things people searching for it will be looking for. That means you have to learn how to use keywords in your listing and in your Amazon dashboard to make it clear to the algorithm what your product is and how it relates to the searches people are making on Amazon. Listen to this episode to get more detail on how you can make your products stand out on the Amazon platform.\nWhere do promotions (Pay Per Click) come in?\nWhen you have your listing optimized for search you still may not get many sales simply because your product listing is not being found frequently in the flood of products that are on Amazon. You need to do something to boost your product to the top of the search results. That \u201csomething\u201d is paying for your product to be promoted using Amazon pay per click. Amazon PPC enables you to choose the keywords you want to target and when people search for those keywords your product appears at or near the top of the listings. You can learn the entire simple approach Scott uses to set up his PPC campaigns for products, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:04] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode.\n \t[1:47] Get in on the next LIVE event.\n \t[3:17] Introduction to the topic.\n \t[6:30] How Scott got into selling on Amazon and why it was appealing.\n \t[10:26] The big thing you need to understand about Amazon sales.\n \t[15:00] Product research is the key to being a success on Amazon.\n \t[17:15] First you need to understand how the Amazon platform works.", "duration": "1:01:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS221.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1466757034, "title": "TAS 220 : Ask Scott Session #65 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "There are so many things to learn when it comes to selling a private label product on Amazon.

He is selling his first product at a rate of 30 sales per day. That\u2019s a wonderful start. He gets most of his sales through Amazon Pay Per Click and has established a daily budget to ensure that he doesn\u2019t spend more than his budget allows. The problem is that he\u2019s selling so much of his product that he runs out of budget by early afternoon each day. He\u2019s afraid to increase his PPC budget because he might run out of product. What would Scott do? You\u2019ll get to hear his answer on this episode.\nLaunching a product that is not on Amazon, but self-created.\nA listener called in to ask Scott about his situation, and it is a very unique idea. He and his wife have created a product of their own and would be able to source their product components from Alibaba in China. He\u2019s curious what they should do because there is nothing on Amazon that is even close to it but they believe that it would sell very well. He\u2019s curious about whether he should try to sell the product on Amazon or not? What would Scott do? As always, you\u2019ll hear Scott\u2019s response on this episode of the Amazing Seller Podcast.\nPay Per Click headaches and figuring out the problems.\nWhen you first begin running pay per click to promote your Amazon products you need to start with broad match categories using the keywords that you are hoping your product will rank highly for. You let that run for around 7 to 10 days to discover which of those keywords are actually converting into sales. Once that happens, you should take the keywords that have gotten sales and put them into their own broad match campaign to put your entire budget toward those keywords that work. Once you do that for another 7 to 10 days, you\u2019ll need to take the winners from that campaign and put them into an exact match campaign to crank up your sales on your most profitable keywords. You can learn a lot from this episode as Scott answers a question about Amazon PPC.\nHave you gotten your basic education by receiving Scott\u2019s free private label course?\nWhat are you waiting for? Scott has created a free 10 day course to help beginners to the Amazon private label community learn how he\u2019s gone about researching, buying, packaging, promoting, and selling his own private label products on Amazon.

Mike got into private label sales when he purchased a website that was already selling its products on Amazon. Over time, he replaced all of those products with his own private label products and began working to drive traffic to his products outside of Amazon through Facebook Ads, contest, and much more. This episode is not for the newbie, it\u2019s stuff that experienced sellers who are already having success can apply to increase their revenue over time.\nWhat is a sales funnel?\nThe term Sales Funnel has to do with getting people who are interested in your products onto an email list and using a progressive series of emails to build a relationship with them with the end result of them becoming a customer, and hopefully, a repeat customer who tells others about your products. Mike Jackness tells the details of how his team set up their sales funnels, how they got their initial email subscribers, and how they used a variety of tactics to give them great content that was truly helpful and build the relationships that translate into trust and then sales. You can hear all of those details on this episode of the podcast.\nBuilding an email address through contests.\nMike Jackness has used an online contest platform to drive two vital things: his number of email subscribers and the social sharing and social proof of his brand\u2019s reliability. On this episode Mike shares the details of how he ran his contests, the timing of the rewards and winner announcements, and how they leveraged the social component to greatest advantage. This is some advanced, high level stuff that you\u2019ll want to hear, especially if you\u2019re already experiencing a good deal of success as a private label seller on Amazon.\nHow to build trust through your automated emails.\nWhen you get someone to subscribe for your email list, the last thing you want to do is send them a series of emails that ask them to do things for you. Instead you want to provide them tons of value, tons of helpful things that make them wonder why you are being so generous. You want them to know that you care about them, that you want to give to them in a way that is related to your products or niche. Once you\u2019ve established that trust, then you\u2019re ready to ask them to do things for you - leaving reviews, buying more products, taking advantage of discount codes, and more. You can hear Mike Jackness describe how his company did that very effectively, on this episode.\nUsing an email list to create new product ideas.\nMike Jackness has been learning from his email list processes daily for some time. One of the things he discovered was that his mailing list was a great resource for helping him narrow down the ideas for new products, and it\u2019s not only helped him produce items that are tailored to his audience but also to avoid mistakes that would have cost them thousands of dollars. It\u2019s a great way to poll your users and customers to not only make smart business decisions but also to be of greater value to your audience or customer base. Mike\u2019s insights are very helpful and you can hear much more than what has been described here on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the episode and his guest!\n \t[2:30] Get into the free private label course.\n \t[4:20] Why Scott wanted to have his guest on the show.\n \t[5:51] The site purchased and how Mike\u2019s gone about replacing its products with his own.\n \t[7:45] Not wanting to be relying on one channel of revenue.\n \t[9:42] Building a funnel to capture email addresses: at the right time.\n \t[10:31] How Mike went about building his email list: the first steps.\n \t[12:48] The task of building a contest to fill their email list (and get some orders).\n \t[22:41] Different approaches to driving traff...", "duration": "47:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS219.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1466409640, "title": "TAS 218 : 5 BIG Takeaways from Seller\u2019s Summit Conference", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "One of the most powerful things that any entrepreneur can do is to make sure they are around others who are of the same mindset that they are.

You can hear Scott\u2019s thoughts about Pinterest and how he\u2019s going to be moving into PInterest marketing in the months ahead, on this episode of the Amazing Seller.\nAre Facebook Ads relevant for private label sales?\nFacebook Ads are one of the things out there that can be a bit intimidating at first. It requires money, it requires a bit of knowledge about how the platform works, and it takes time to learn. But it\u2019s one of the most powerful ways to drive very targeted, specific traffic to your webpage or product sales page and in time, you\u2019re going to have to get going on Facebook Ads.

For most of us that\u2019s going to mean setting up your own eCommerce store on your own website. These stores are very effective and many, many people are making incredible money building their own store that sells products independently of Amazon. Not only do you get to keep a lot more money (Amazon doesn\u2019t get any), you also get to interact directly with your customers - which is invaluable. Find out more about how eCommerce stores are rocking online sales on this episode.\nDo you have a sales funnel started? It could be one of your missing power tools.\nIf you don\u2019t know what a sales funnel is, here\u2019s the short answer: A sales funnel is a systematic, planned sequence that you take prospective customers through that narrows their focus from interest in what you have to say and sell, all the way to becoming a paying customer. You can learn how to build an effective sales funnel, and you should because it\u2019s such a powerful way not only to get sales, but to get repeat sales from loyal customers. On this episode Scott gives his thoughts about sales funnels and tells some of what he\u2019s doing to build out his funnels more, so be sure you listen.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[1:51] The biggest benefits of being at conferences, and the TAS online version.\n \t[3:06] How you can get started with private label sales.\n \t[4:10] Takeaway #1: The power of being around like-minded people is HUGE.\n \t[8:30] Takeaway #2: Pinterest marketing could be a powerful next step.\n \t[13:09] Takeaway #3: Facebook Ads is a viable way to increase product sales.\n \t[19:44] Takeaway #4: eCommerce stores are still a powerful way to build a business.\n \t[23:30] Takeaway #5: Building marketing funnels is a huge part of building a business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 218\nTAS 218 : 5 BIG Takeaways from Seller\u2019s Summit Conference\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:03] Scott: Well hey, hey what's up everyone.", "duration": "34:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS218.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1466150401, "title": "TAS 217 : Ask Scott Session #64 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Your opportunity to hear and ask your own questions from an experienced Amazon private label seller is here - it\u2019s the Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d session.

But the product that makes the most sense to add to her lineup is going to be difficult to sell simply because the market is very crowded and competitive. What should she do?

What have you done to check on that once you notice it? If you\u2019re not checking on it, you could be missing out on sales because your listing is suppressed by Amazon for not adhering to the terms of service. On this episode Scott shares his own story of how a new product he place onto Amazon was suppressed, why it was suppressed, what he did to fix the problem, and what he suggests you do on a regular basis to monitor your product listings and ensure that your products are always live and ready to get more sales.\nHow Scott discovered that his Amazon listing was suppressed.\nA normal part of Scott\u2019s day every morning is to log into his Amazon seller account to check the status of his sales, inventory, and products and to check whether any red flags or issues have come up - like returns, seller feedback he needs to respond to, etc. But while he was traveling he was unable to stick to that routine and while he was offline some strange things happened, resulting in one of his listings being suppressed. Essentially, his listing was offline, not allowing anyone to see his listing or purchase the product. How did Scott figure out that the listing was being suppressed by Amazon? Listen to this episode to get all the details.\nWhat can you do to unsuppress a suppressed listing?\nOnce you discover that your private label product has been suppressed by Amazon (taken off line) what can you do? First you need to scan through your listing in an effort to identify the things that might be wrong with your listing that is causing the suppression. It\u2019s not always an easy thing to do because Amazon may not always tell you the specifics. You may have to go tab by tab through the back end of your listing to find any warnings or highlighted areas. It\u2019s a tedious process but eventually you\u2019ll find the problem. Listen to this episode to hear how Scott corrected a problem on one of his own listings and what he suggests you do to avoid this problem on yours.\nTips on optimizing your private label listing.\nScott has talked about this issue quite a bit on previous episodes but since new people are coming into the Amazing Seller community every day, he feels it\u2019s appropriate to repeat some of the most important things. One of those is how to optimize your listing, including your titles, proper keyword formatting and completion, bullet points, images, descriptions, and more. On this episode Scott walks through those basic things again to help you first identify the problems your listing may have and second, to help you correct those problems so you can get your listing running as smoothly as possible, which will result in more eyes on your product and more sales.\nAdding your primary keywords in your title is a powerful tactic for listing optimization. \nIf you\u2019re trying to optimize your listing you have to start with your title. The title is the main thing that is going to be searched by Amazon to make keyword matches with search queries, so it\u2019s important that you craft a keyword rich but natural title for your product to make the most of the keywords that people are searching for. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll increase your chances of your product being seen by people who are searching for it or something similar. On this episode Scott gives you his best tips for optimizing your titles including the rationale behind them and how you can go about doing them on your listings.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:32] Get into the next upcoming workshop.\n \t[2:52] How Scott discovered his listing was suppressed by Amazon.\n \t[4:12] What could cause a listing to be suppressed?

There are so many opportunities that kind of approach can provide. When heading in that direction it might be tempting to open a second seller account with Amazon. Is it legal (with Amazon)? Should you do it? Scott\u2019s got some very clear ideas about the subject and is eager to share them with you on this episode, so be sure you listen to get some perspective on whether or not it\u2019s time for you to create a second seller account.\nWhy do you want to open a second Amazon seller account?\nMany people who are successful at Amazon private label sales are entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs are known for having tons of ideas bouncing around in their heads. One of the struggles every entrepreneur faces is keeping their own ambition and eagerness in check so that they don\u2019t get too strung out. It may seem like a great idea to build a new brand but most people take that on far too soon. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear Scott\u2019s thoughts about why you should reconsider that choice and what things you can do instead to maximize your profitability and business.\nWhat are some of the hassles of opening a second Amazon seller account?\nWhen you open a second Amazon seller account you\u2019re not breaking any rules. Amazon will let you do it, but they will want to see certain things in place. For example, you\u2019ll be required to have a different business entity for that account than the one you have on your first account. You\u2019ll also be required to provide different banking information. These are just two things you\u2019ll have to restructure in order to open a second account - and there\u2019s even more besides these. Scott\u2019s going to walk you through every one of the things he can think of that makes it difficult to manage and deal with two brands and two Amazon accounts. It\u2019s all on this episode so make sure you take the time to listen.\nBuilding out a product line instead of starting a brand new brand.\nInstead of building a second brand, what would happen if you totally maximized every opportunity you have in your current private label market? In Scott\u2019s experience, most people who are selling on Amazon have not done their due diligence to build out their product line and opportunities to the greatest effect. They\u2019re missing things like sales funnels, email lists, external sales channels, social promotions, and more. Where are you in the stages of building out your current product line? On this episode Scott will show you the kinds of things you need to consider when thinking through whether you should open a new Amazon seller account or not.\nWhy an external sales channel is the next step for any Amazon business.\nScott strongly believes that every Amazon private label seller should work hard to establish a sales channel outside of Amazon after sales on Amazon have become consistently successful. He subscribes to the idea that you should never put all of your business eggs in one basket - and though Amazon is a very LARGE basket, it\u2019s still only one sales channel. On this episode Scott walks through the main ways that you can build your own sales machine independent of Amazon and tells you why you should focus your efforts there instead of building a second brand on Amazon. It\u2019s a great summary for you to consider, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n \t[4:03] Starting two differing brands - Is it time to take that leap?\n \t[9:00] Considerations when growing/scaling a business - multiple accounts.\n \t[14:32] 5 reasons to reconsider opening a second seller account.\n \t[18:06] The complications that come from a second brand as opposed to a broader existing market.\n \t[19:45] Why the next phase for any Amazon business is external sales channels.\n\nRESOURCES MENTIONED:\n\n \twww.TheAmazingSeller.", "duration": "31:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS215.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1465632001, "title": "BONUS EPISODE : 2 Tweaks That Increased Sales Without Spending More Money on Ads with Greg Mercer", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Any little (or big) thing we can do to increase the likelihood of people who search for our products to actually click on our product is worth the time it takes to get it done.

That\u2019s what these Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d sessions are for\u2026 an opportunity for you to ask Scott the pressing questions that are on your mind about private label selling and selling on the Amazon platform in particular. There are many things Scott has learned the hard way that you don\u2019t have to learn that way. You can glean lots from what Scott has to share and he\u2019s happy to do it. Be sure to submit your questions to Scott to keep these Friday episodes going!\nWhat is needed to set up a seller account on Amazon?\nA listener has been doing some initial product research and hasn\u2019t set up his Amazon seller account yet. He\u2019s curious what pieces of information he needs to have in hand before he tries to create an Amazon seller account. It\u2019s a great question that Scott answers in depth on this episode. It starts with simply having a social security number and logging in, so depending on what products you\u2019ll be selling and what your overall goals are you may want to have some other pieces in place. What are they? Scott\u2019s going to cover all of it on this episode.\nThings you need to know about getting product reviews through review groups.\nA listener called in on this episode to ask Scott what she should do in her situation. She\u2019s a professional reviewer, reviewing products in all kinds of niches in order to receive free products. She takes the job very seriously and gives quality, unbiased reviews. But recently her account has been banned from doing reviews. She wonders if it\u2019s related to a review group she\u2019s been a part of in the past. Scott\u2019s got some very practical advice for the seller relating to review groups as well as some \u201cheads up\u201d info for Amazon sellers about what you should and should not expect about the results you get from review groups.\nWhat should I do if my product is being purchased in lots and resold on Ebay?\nA listener called in with an interesting situation that Scott was eager to tackle on this episode. His products have been selling well, even 4 or 5 at a time. He had a hunch that something odd might be going on so he checked up on it and found out that his products were actually being bought in lots of 5 or 6 at a time and resold on Ebay. He\u2019s not sure what to think of it. Should he contact the purchaser and tell them that they are not allowed to resell his product or is it a great asset to have someone buying his product in bulk? What do you think? Scott\u2019s got a very clear answer and he shares it with you on this episode.\nWhen a potential product has great cost margins, should you sell it in bundles of two?\nAnother listener has been doing her product research and has found a product that she believes will be a winner. Part of the reason she likes the product so much is that the cost and profit margins are very large. That means she\u2019ll be able to make a very good profit. She\u2019s wondering if it would be worthwhile to offer the product in bundle packages to differentiate herself in the market and gain more sales. Scott\u2019s advice is very helpful and gives a couple of options for this listener to consider, so be sure you listen to apply what he says to your situation.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:39] Scott\u2019s introduction of Chris Nelson, a TAS listener at the event Scott attended.\n \t[1:37] How you can leave a question for Scott and get into a live workshop.\n \t[3:28] QUESTION ONE: What do I need to have set up in order to create a seller account - and what legal issues do I need to be aware of?\n \t[8:55] QUESTION TWO: I\u2019m a legitimate reviewer but have been banned by Amazon because I was part of a review club.

They are trying really hard to get current sellers to expand into different marketplaces. For some time Scott has been giving that option some thought but when he received an email from today\u2019s guest, Nick Kemp, he was even more interested. Nick has been selling on the Amazon Japan marketplace for some time and is experiencing a good deal of success. In this conversation Scott and Nick chat about how it\u2019s working, how he got into the Japanese market, and his road to private label success.\nWhat do you do when your private label item is infringing on another\u2019s patent?\nToday\u2019s guest was beginning to sell a lot of his product and decided that it was time to get more listings on Amazon. He chose a related items that was very unique because of its design and sourced it from a China supply company. But he soon discovered that the supplier had signed an agreement that they would not sell the product in the U.S. but hadn\u2019t told him. He discovered that sad fact by receiving a letter from the patent owner\u2019s attorney telling him he had to stop selling the product immediately or he would be sued. It was a $10,000 loss for him and he\u2019s still recovering. Listen in to this conversation to get some tips on how you can avoid that sort of thing with your private label products.\nMaking money in the Amazon Japan marketplace faster than the U.S.\nWithin a very short amount of time after launching his products on the Japanese marketplace, Nick Kemp began to see sales. In his experience one of the advantages to selling on the Japanese marketplace is that you typically don\u2019t have to get near as many reviews to begin selling your products. A well optimized listing seemed to be all it took and Nick was selling a good number of items per day within no time. On this episode Nick tells you how he began selling on the Japan marketplace step by step, so be sure to listen.\nRanking on page 1 within hours on the Amazon Japan market.\nWhen Nick finally jumped through all the hoops to get his products listed in the Amazon Japan marketplace he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to expect. It was literally only a few hours after listing his products that his item was showing on the first page of the search results for his product niche. He was amazed, as most of us would be, and felt the impact of that in his sales almost immediately. But there are plenty of difficulties to face as well. You can hear Nick\u2019s story on this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast.\nWhy the difficulties of getting on the Amazon Japan market are worth it.\nIf you\u2019ve already experienced a good deal of success selling on the U.S. or U.K. marketplace and want to expand your sales, the Japan marketplace may be the way to go. Nick Kemp says that you\u2019ll have to jump through certain hoops to make sure you\u2019re doing so legally and in a way that works with the Japanese culture. That includes language barriers and other things as well. But he\u2019s convinced that it\u2019s worth doing simply because the Japanese marketplace is virtually untouched in terms of volume and competition. If you\u2019re at that point of expansion, listen to what Nick has to share so you can assess the situation for yourself.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast.\n \t[3:45] Who is Nick Kemp and how did he get started selling in the Amazon Japan marketplace?\n \t[8:00] A first product flops because of patent issues.\n \t[13:30] Getting into the Japanese marketplace on Amazon.\n \t[17:00] Particular things needed to sell in Japan.\n \t[19:20] How Nick researches sales prospects in the Japanese marketplace.\n \t[21:13] Dealing with language issues: listings, products, labels, etc.\n \t[24:38] Jumping into a super competitive niche in Japan.\n \t[29:50] First steps to getting your products on the Amazon Japan marketplace.", "duration": "57:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS213.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1465200009, "title": "TAS 212 : The Simple Process for Getting Ungated to Sell Your Products on Amazon with Chris Shaffer", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "The Amazon sales platform is open to 3rd party sellers (like you) to sell products to people who are already shopping for things they want and need. That\u2019s the amazing benefit it is to sell your products on Amazon. However, there are certain categories where not just anyone can sell products. Amazon\u2019s reasons for doing this is mainly to protect the consumer by ensuring that the people selling products in those categories are legitimate sellers who are not selling items that will be harmful or fake. Chris Schaeffer is a pro in these things and he unloads how he goes about getting products ungated, on this episode.\nThe category that I want to sell product in is blocked to new sellers (gated). How can I get in?\nIt happens quite often. Someone does their diligence in product research and discovers that the end of that process that the category their product falls into is blocked to new sellers. How can you get past that? Is there any way? That is exactly what this episode of the podcast is all about. Scott and his friend Chris walk you through 5 Steps you need to take in order to get your private label products into a gated category on Amazon. Be encouraged, their experience shows that you can always get into the category, it just may take time and some hard work. Be sure you listen to find out how you can get your product into the categories they belong in.\nHow does the Amazon Brand Registry fit into the ungating process? \nIf you have not gone through the steps to register your products and brand in the Amazon brand registry, that is one of the first things you need to do if you want your product to be considered for categories that are currently gated. Amazon will not consider your product if you have not verified your product through brand registry. On this episode of the podcast, Chris and Scott are going to walk you through the steps involved in getting brand registered, and show you that it really isn't as hard as it might sound at first. If you need someone to hold your hand, this episode does exactly that. \nMake it easy for Amazon to approve your \u201cungate\u201d request.\nAnyone selling products on Amazon is able to apply for their products to be considered for a blocked or gated category. Chris Shaffer advises that if you were going to do that, you make it easy for Amazon to say yes to you. How do you do that? By getting all of your documents and requested things in order before you apply to have your product considered. Amazon is very clear about what it takes to become eligible for selling in those categories, so you need to do your part to meet their requirements before you even apply. On this episode Chris walks through what those things are so that you will be able to gather your information and go in with your guns loaded.\nDon\u2019t let the gated categories on Amazon get you frustrated.\nThe process of getting your products into gated categories can be quite irritating and frustrating. Sometimes Amazon will reject your product request and not provide any reasons why they have rejected it. Other times, they will respond with very big reasons that don't make sense. It is important that you understand that those things are just part of how it is, and that you need to do everything on your end to make it easy for Amazon to approve your request. Keep going, walk through the things you have submitted very carefully to ensure that they meet Amazon's standards, and even follow the tips Chris lives in this episode to restart the process if need be. And his experience, every request can be approved if you approach it the right way. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[2:59] Why categories on Amazon are gated (to protect consumers).\n \t[4:58] How gating impacts pay per click (PPC).\n \t[5:40] Is it possible to place your product into a different category if you\u2019re gated out of the one it belongs in?\n \t[8:45] Select the category you want to be in.", "duration": "40:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS212.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1464940842, "title": "TAS 211 : Ask Scott Session #62 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "If you\u2019re an Amazon seller, either through Retail Arbitrage program or through private label products, you know how frustrating it can be when you hit a snag in your business and don\u2019t feel that you have anywhere to turn.

If you want to submit your questions for Scott to answer on one of these Friday shows, you can find out how to do it on this episode.\nHow can I improve my pay per click (PPC) campaign so it doesn\u2019t cost so much?\nA listener to the Amazing Seller recently called in with a question about his pay per click campaigns. He\u2019s at a point where 70% of his profits is being eaten up by the cost of paying for traffic through Amazon PPC. Something about it just doesn\u2019t feel right and he wants to know what he\u2019s doing wrong.

You can hear Scott\u2019s response on this episode.\nWhat warehouse should I send my products to as an international seller?\nAnyone who sells private label products on Amazon Has the option of sending their products to various Amazon warehouses for the option of making sales in various countries. On this \u00a0episode of the podcast, an international seller calls with a question about where she should send her products to get the best sales. She's also concerned about the kinds of taxes she will have to pay if she is going to send her products to the United States. Make sure you tune in to listen to this episode where Scott replies to her question. \nShould I go after a product with lower margins but higher volume?\nScott usually recommends that sellers look for products where they can make at least $10 of profit on each sale. But on this episode of the podcast listener calls in to ask whether it is worth it to sell products that only get $4 to $5 profit on each sale but has a very large volume of sales possible. You might think Scott would say to avoid that kind of product, but he actually says the exact opposite and gives you very clear reasons why he would go for it. You can hear his entire answer on this Ask Scott session of the podcast.\nHow long does it take for products to rank to page 1 after an initial surge of sales?\nOn today's episode of the podcast Scott reads A post from a member of his Facebook community, reporting how his product launch has gone. He had some great and initial sales and just looking forward to a very successful product line. But his product is still on page 8 of the Amazon search rankings.

Today\u2019s guest is a tremendous example of a person who was willing to put in the kind of hard work required so that she could do what she wanted in her life - stay at home with her kids. Raquel\u2019s story is one that we hear all the time, a parent who longs to have the time with her children and is willing to do anything to make that happen. You\u2019re going to hear a tremendously inspirational story as Raquel tells how she went from selling on Ebay to Retail Arbitrage on Amazon and why she decided to move toward private labeling, the decision that has so far grossed over $73,000 in sales. Make sure you listen tot his one - it\u2019s worth it.\nThe challenges with Ebay and Retail Arbitrage.\nFor a while Raquel was making a good amount of profit finding things to sell on Ebay. She had great margins and was able to find some things that were selling pretty well on a consistent basis. But the difficulty was that she had to take new pictures for every listing and had to do all the shipping herself. That led her to Retail Arbitrage on Amazon which was worlds better, but it still required the daily hustle out in stores and closeout sales that she was trying to get away from. That\u2019s when she began learning about private label sales and connected with the TAS community. You\u2019ll want to hear Raquel\u2019s story to hear another path that has been followed and how she began with $100.\nMultiple products within the same niche.\nRaquel\u2019s approach to finding products was to look through various resources to discover product ideas. One of those was a junk email that she received from a company that was unsolicited. That\u2019s where she found a bundled set of products that she felt she could purchase, split apart, and remake into her own bundles. That enabled her to have multiple SKUs to sell within the same niche, which was a great way to diversify her approach to the market. That has enabled her to get cross sales and to begin customizing products to offer in addition to the things she\u2019s already selling. Her first custom order from China is now underway. Be sure you listen to Raquel\u2019s story - it\u2019s full of insights into how things could work for you when you\u2019re just starting out.\nHow Raquel used reviews to determine what she could do to offer in-demand products.\nAs Raquel began offering her first products she spent time reading the reviews of her competitors. It was in those reviews that she discovered things that buyers of those products wished were different about the products they were already buying. That gave Raquel a lot of insight into modifications and unique tweaks she could make to her products to make them more desirable to buyers and thereby take over the sales of brands in her niche that are not providing those customized options. It\u2019s a \u201cgold\u201d way to create true value for customers and carve out a niche for themselves that will be sustainable long term.\nWe want to build a business that enables us to give powerfully.\nIn this conversation Scott asked Raquel about her future plans for her private label sales business. She and her husband have given a lot of thought to what they want to do with the successes they are experiencing. Her husband truly enjoys his job so there are no plans for him to quit. But the two of them have come to a place that they hope to pay off their house within a short time and then be able to meet needs of people they come across. That\u2019s a powerful \u201cwhy\u201d for anyone, being able to make the lives of actual people better.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast and Scott\u2019s guest, Raquel.\n \t[1:03] Why you don\u2019t need to start private label sales with a ton of cash.\n \t[2:47] Who is Raquel and why did she try her hand at Amazon sales?\n \t[5:50] From Ebay to consignment, to retail arbitrage on Amazon.\n \t[14:00] A junk email that offered some new possibilities for Raquel.", "duration": "44:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS210.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1464595245, "title": "TAS 209 : The Man That Taught Me How To HUSTLE and NEVER Give UP!

Sometimes those are negative influences, sometimes they are not so good. On this episode of the show Scott shares a conversation with his Dad that he recorded recently to share some of the legacy of his own life. In Scott\u2019s eyes his Dad is a great example of someone who was always willing to work hard and earn the money needed to care for his family and take care of his obligations. He\u2019s also the one who taught Scott to hustle and figure out ways to build his own businesses. You\u2019re going to enjoy the homespun wisdom and insights Papa V. has to share, on this episode.\nFrom egg sales to a chicken farm to a draft notice.\nScott\u2019s father was an entrepreneur from an early age simply because he had to be. He wanted extra money to buy his own lunch at school and his father didn\u2019t have the money to give him. So his dad arranged for him to get some chickens and begin selling eggs. That business grew into a chicken farm and in time he was doing quite well. When he was 22 years old he was drafted, but signed up for the Navy instead. Even in the Navy his Dad found an entrepreneurial opportunity sewing patches on uniforms, stocking up on cigarettes and reselling them to fellow soldiers at a higher price, and even making loans at interest. You can hear this powerful example of old fashioned entrepreneurial hustle on this episode.\nThere\u2019s always a way you can find to get the money you need.\nOn today\u2019s episode of The Amazing Seller Scott shares a conversation with his Dad who was his example of hard work and determination. He showed by his actions that he could always figure out a way to make the income needed to meet his obligations and take care of his family. As you listen to this episode, keep in mind the obstacles you face and think about the opportunities you may have every day to increase your income and make a way to build your income. There is a way. Find it.\nPartnership woes and things you should watch out for.\nNeither Scott nor his Dad believe that partnerships are always terrible or to be avoided. But they both have seen the negative side of partnerships and have lots to say about the various cautions that you need to be aware of when considering a partnership. On this episode you\u2019ll hear the story of their partnership woes and how you can avoid making the same mistakes. It\u2019s a great story of persistence, learning from mistakes, and building a successful business on the coattails of a business mess.\nHard work and persistence will ALWAYS pay off for you, if you take action.\nThe main purpose of this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast is not to teach you tricks and strategies for doing private label sales better. It\u2019s a deeper and more general lesson than that. This one brings you an old school example of how determination and drive to succeed will enable you to be successful in the end.

You can ask your own questions and have them answered on the podcast, so be sure you listen to find out how to do that!\nWhat\u2019s the best way I can order from a foreign supplier and protect my financial investment?\nThere are many ways you could arrange to make payments to your suppliers. Paypal - Western Union - Credit Card - Escrow - which should you choose? On this episode a listener asks Scott what his options are now that he\u2019s figured out the supplier he wants to work with and Scott has some great advice about the best and safest ways to exchange funds with suppliers from China and other places.\nWhen I complete the product listing fields, which of those fields are not needed?\nWhen you go into the backend of your Amazon product listing you\u2019re going to be faced with many tabs, options, and fields that can be completed. It\u2019s very confusing for a first time person. You may wonder, like the caller today, which of those fields really apply to your product and which of them don\u2019t. Scott\u2019s main advice on that issue is covered on this episode and it all comes down to doing this: Be sure to complete the search terms and keywords and fill out anything that honestly pertains to your product. Be sure you listen to get all the details.\nWhat are the risks of dealing with a supplier without using Alibaba?\nWhen you find a supplier from China that you believe is the one you want to use to source your product, there are many risks to you as the buyer. You want to make sure that your supplier is trustworthy and that you have a way to hold their feet to the fire in case there are issues with your product delivery or quality. In order to do that Scott recommends that you always stay within a sourcing website like Alibaba and that you ensure that the supplier works with you on an escrow basis. If all of that is confusing, be sure to listen to get clarity.\nIs there a way to know the overall costs I\u2019m going to need to pay before taking the plunge? \nThere are many ways to make mistakes as you get started selling private label products and most of them come from not understanding the fees and costs associated with selling your products on Amazon, including shipping, Amazon fees, customs costs, and more.

Without these three you\u2019re going to fail at some point along the line, so be sure you pay close attention to what Scott has to share here. The \u201cwhy\u201d has to do with the reasons behind building a business. If your \u201cwhy\u201d is not strong enough you\u2019ll give up when things get tough. Your \u201cwhat\u201d is the clear end-goal you have in mind, the thing(s) you want to accomplish. The \u201chow\u201d is the plan you come up with to make the \u201cwhat\u201d happen.

It\u2019s about more than simply making money\u2026 that\u2019s not specific enough. Figure out your \u201cwhy\u201d and you\u2019ll figure out the thing that will keep you going when the difficulties come (and they WILL come).\nAfter your WHY is in place, you can move on to the WHAT.\nGetting clear on WHAT you are going to do enables you to remain focused. It\u2019s your end goal, the thing you\u2019re trying to accomplish overall so that your WHY becomes a reality. When you work on your WHAT you need to do your homework. There\u2019s nothing about this part that comes easy, nothing about it that will magically happen. The information is out there, you simply have to go out and find it so you can make informed decisions and smart choices. Don\u2019t go by hunches or feelings, research it and find the WHAT that will fit you and enable your WHY to come to pass.\nTake action to make it a reality.\nOnce you get your WHY clear and your WHAT figured out, you\u2019re going to have to do something with it. You\u2019ve got to have a plan that you\u2019re going to follow to make them happen. That\u2019s where the HOW comes in. It\u2019s about taking action, putting in the work that makes success happen. Nobody got to any pinnacle of success by accident. There\u2019s lots of hard work in the back story and you are going to have to pay your own dues as well. Take action. It\u2019s one of Scott\u2019s main mantras that you hear over and over. And there\u2019s a reason for that. It\u2019s vitally important.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the episode!\n \t[2:09] Scott\u2019s story: no college education but lots of business experience.\n \t[5:15] Scott\u2019s experience selling door to door as a kid.\n \t[6:23] The danger of inaction from overwhelm.\n \t[9:35] It all starts with taking the first step into something different.\n \t[11:00] The importance of \u201cjust in time learning\u201d from Pat Flynn.\n \t[12:35] When you choose one thing and focus, amazing things happen.\n \t[14:09] The power of \u201cWHY - WHAT - HOW?\u201d\n \t[15:00] WHY: Getting clear and specific brings focus.\n \t[23:10] WHAT: You have to know where you\u2019re going.\n \t[25:10] HOW: Making a plan is essential.\n \t[28:11] Case study: Bob - and how it can help you build your dreams.\n \t[30:30] Scott\u2019s 10-10-1 strategy as an example of simplifying the process.", "duration": "1:04:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS207.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1463990458, "title": "TAS 206 : Why Some People HATE Me for Helping YOU (Should I Stop?)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Over the years Scott has gotten tons of great encouragement about the efforts he\u2019s making to help others learn from his mistakes and the path he\u2019s taken to build a successful private label sales business. He loves the positive feedback and would never stop doing what he does. But sometimes there are people who urge Scott to STOP giving away so much free information. They believe that he\u2019s doing a disservice to those who are already selling on Amazon. Scott disagrees wholeheartedly and on this episode he tells you why.\nWhy Amazon is the best place you can validate and test product ideas.\nIf you think you have a great idea for a product, there\u2019s no better way to test that product than to put it onto the Amazon sales platform. It doesn\u2019t even need to be finished, tweaked exactly like you want it, or the final version\u2026 it just has to be some variety of what you have in mind. The reason Amazon is such a great place to do this is because you\u2019re putting that product in front of people who are actual buyers - they are only ON Amazon to buy something or research a future purchase. On this episode Scott is going to tell you how you can use Amazon to validate your product idea and how you can move past Amazon when the time is right.\nWhen people push back against generosity, it\u2019s usually because they are scared.\nScott Voelker's been sharing his insights into the Amazon private label sales platform for many months now. He doesn't absolutely free and expecting nothing in return. Why does he do it? Because he believes he is supposed to help people get ahead in life. It's what he would want someone to do for him if he were in that place. But there are many people who don't agree with Scott's approach. They believe that his generosity is hurting everyone it was already successfully selling on Amazon. On this episode of the podcast you were going to hear why Scott doesn't agree with that and why he believes that those who are telling him to stop giving away so much free content are actually scared. \nThere is still PLENTY of opportunity to build a successful business on Amazon.\nScott hears it all the time: Amazon is getting too crowded, there isn't enough room left in the platform to be successful a private label sales. But Scott doesn't believe it. Yes, it is harder to be successful than it was at the beginning, but that's the way it is in every Market at every stage of its history. Those were going to be ultra successful are those who are willing to put in the hard work to figure out the best ways to be successful in that niche. Are you one of those? Or are you one of those lazy ones who won't put in the effort and will only complain that it's getting too crowded? On this episode you were going to get a great challenge from Scott about the work you're going to have to put in if you were going to be successful in private label sales. \nYou are the average of the 5 people you hang around with most.\nIf you pay attention to those who are complaining and hating on others who are doing great things, you will notice something. They typically hang out with other people who think small like they do. There's an old saying that you are the average of the 5 people you hang around with most. It is true almost every time. If you were going to be successful, you have got to put yourself around people who are successful. You've got to learn from them, you've got to grow from their interaction, you've got to ask their advice and put it into action. On this episode Scott is going to talk about what it takes to be successful in Amazon sales \u00a0and in life. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:05] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[2:25] Why there are always opportunities to build a business.\n \t[4:15] Why Amazon is the best place to test and validate product ideas.\n \t[6:49] The power of hanging out with people who bring you down (or lift you up).\n \t[8:37] People are afraid of competition and how it creates \u201chaters\u201d out there.", "duration": "27:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS206.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1463731254, "title": "TAS 205 : Ask Scott Session #60 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Many people ask why Scott\u2019s invested so much time and energy into putting out this podcast and doing his free workshops. Is it to sell his course? No, it\u2019s not. Scott recently ran into a woman who reminded him why he\u2019s doing all the work he is for the TAS brand. Her husband had just quit his job because their private label business, built according to Scott\u2019s instructions and tips, had finally made it possible for him to quit and work the FBA business full time. That\u2019s what Scott is about - helping real people get some freedom and a sense of personal control over their destiny. You can find out how Scott could help you with that, on this episode.\nDifferent product categories have different fee structures. What fees do I pay if my product is in two categories?\nIf you didn\u2019t know, you need to know that Amazon has different fee structures for products in different categories. For example, products in home and garden may have one fee and products in kitchen may have different fees. If your product is in multiple categories it can get a bit confusing as to how Amazon is going to charge you. On this episode, Scott reveals how to go about determining the fees you will pay for products in multiple categories, so be sure you listen to get his answer.\nI\u2019ve researched my product and sent them into Amazon, but I\u2019m not getting sales? What can I do?\nA listener feels that he did a pretty good job of researching his product. He got samples, tried them out on \u00a0Amazon, and felt that he\u2019s got a good product. But now that he\u2019s shipped his products to Amazon, it\u2019s been a few weeks and he\u2019s not gotten one sale. Is his product simply a bust? Should he give up and move on to something else? What would you do? Scott\u2019s got quite a few suggestions for this seller, including an explanation of how PPC works and why it\u2019s important to use pay per click to begin generating sales. You can hear it all on this episode of the podcast.\nMy product is selling well but is on page 3. What can I do to move it up?\nOn this episode of the podcast a listener calls in to describe her dilemma. She\u2019s got a product that\u2019s been on Amazon for 3 weeks and it\u2019s already selling 10 to 15 units a day. But she ranks on page 3 and would like to get to page 1. What\u2019s wrong to cause such great sales but such a low search ranking? Scott doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily anything wrong with her listing or product. In fact, he thinks she\u2019s got some great things to celebrate and suggests a very few minor tweaks that could push her onto page 1. Do you want to hear his answer? You can, on this episode of the podcast.\nWould you like to ask your private label questions?\nIf you are curious about private label sales on Amazon, or if you\u2019re new to the Amazon sales platform and would like to know more about how it works, you can do that by listening to this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d session of the Amazing Seller Podcast.

Well, even though Scott Voelker has been doing private label sales on Amazon for some time, he\u2019s still starting new products and ideas now and then to experiment and to expand his business model. On today\u2019s episode Scott walks you through his latest product launch and hones in on the things he did differently this time. The results he\u2019s gotten have been spectacular, including ranking his product on page 1 of Amazon\u2019s search rankings in short order. You\u2019ll want to be sure to listen to this one.\nWhy Scott aimed at a product with low reviews but good sales.\nOne of the ways that Scott searched for his latest private label product was to filter in Jungle Scout for products that were selling a decent amount, say 5 to 10 sales per day, but had low numbers of reviews. Why did he aim at products like that? The sales show that the product is in demand to a certain degree, but that the people selling the products are not spending a ton of time promoting their products. So Scott feels that if he\u2019s able to sell the same product but add PPC promotions to his launch, he should be able to get higher in the rankings almost immediately - and his strategy worked. Find out exactly how Scott did it, on this episode.\nA keyword optimization trick for the backend of your private label product listings.\nA student in the private label workshop was having trouble getting her product to show as relevant for many keywords, even though she\u2019d filled the keyword area of her listing with relevant keywords. Scott was curious why she wasn\u2019t getting better results so he asked her to show him the way she\u2019d input her keywords. She had placed a comma between every keyword and Scott suggested that she remove all the commas. Within an hour her product began ranking for those keywords and something important was discovered: commas are not only unnecessary in your keyword fields, they actually hurt your listing. Find out more tips like this on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhy Scott launched with only 25 product giveaways.\nOn this product launch Scott decided to try something a bit different than he\u2019d done before. He determined that he\u2019d only give away 25 products to launch and that he\u2019d drip those out at the rate of 5 per day for the first 5 days. This enabled him to monitor his organic sales a bit more easily, determining how many of his sales were organic and therefore gauging better whether he actually needed to continue giveaways in order to get his product ranked as high as he wanted. The result this time was a good amount of organic sales apart from the PPC, which is very good news. You\u2019ll find out more about how Scott did his launch on a new product on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nIf you\u2019re new to the private label sales world, you need Scott\u2019s free workshop.\nAt least once per month Scott holds a free private label workshop for anyone who is interested in private label sales. It\u2019s an opportunity for you to learn the 5 phases of a successful product launch and to ask questions from Scott and many other experienced Amazon sellers who are hanging out during the course.

It\u2019s taking alot longer to increase in sales than he expected it would. He\u2019s just about ready to find a second product and let this one languish, but Scott\u2019s not so sure that\u2019s the right thing to do. The situation doesn\u2019t sound as hopeless as it seems. Listen in to hear what Scott thinks can be done in order to make this product rank higher and get more sales, on this episode.\nThe only thing you can do to rank for your main keywords.\nThe main thing you need to focus on in order to hit your main keywords, you\u2019ve got to optimize your listing for that keyword and push sales toward that keyword using PPC. But your main keyword isn\u2019t the only thing you should be trying to rank for. You need to be aiming at other long tail keywords, things people could be searching for related to your main keywords. The cool thing is that PPC is what enables you to know what those keywords are. You can find out the details of how to use pay per click to your advantage on this episode.\nThe duds may be your cash cows!\nAlex feels that his product is a \u201cdud\u201d simply because it\u2019s only selling at a rate of $1,000 per month. But the key to a prosperous Amazon private label business is not to find the \u201cperfect product\u201d that brings in millions every month. The key is to get a handful of moderately successful products that together build the income and success that you need. It\u2019s an amazing thing to watch when the collective sales begin to creep up over time and each one is an integral part of the whole. Don\u2019t be afraid of the duds, they may be the pieces to your overall success.\nThe power of being part of a great community of like minded people.\nToday\u2019s episode was spawned from a post and its responses within the TAS Facebook Community.

He\u2019s curious how to go about putting branding of various kinds, UPC codes, and other identifying markings on his packaging. Does the supplier do that? Does he have to do it himself? On this episode Scott\u2019s going to answer this question by walking through the variety of ways these issues can be addressed and the pros and cons to each one. Be sure you listen so you can know the options for packaging and branding on your products.\nMy product lends itself to variations and individual listings. How do I choose which to do?\nThere are many kinds of products that could possibly be listed as a \u201cvariation\u201d of the original product. A great example is a garlic press that can come in different colors, or styles, or materials. They are all garlic presses, but have varying qualities that make them slightly different. When you have variations in a product you can list those variations on one product listing But even in that situation, it\u2019s possible to list those products individually in their own listings. What are the benefits of each approach? Scott\u2019s got the answer for you on this episode.\nA listener has a few negative reviews about his products. What should he do?\nNo matter how good the quality of your products are, you\u2019re eventually going to run into a situation where someone leaves a negative review. Maybe something broke during shipping, or there was a cosmetic issue with that individual product that was shipped to the customer. Is there a way that you can deal with negative reviews to mitigate their effect on your sales and brand? On this episode Scott fills you in on what he does when negative reviews come in and how he uses a software solution to make it happen. You can even get a discounted version of the software by using Scott\u2019s affiliate link - available on this episode.\nFree Private Label workshop!

Be sure you listen to this episode where Scott asks Jon all the details.\nThe role Amazon\u2019s Brand Registry plays in preventing product hijackers.\nIf you\u2019ve not registered your private label products with Amazon\u2019s Brand Registry you need to do it today. It\u2019s one of the ways that Amazon has created for you to give yourself some security when it comes to the ownership of your brand. You do some specific things to prove to Amazon that your products are indeed your very own branded products and Amazon places you in its database as the \u201cowner\u201d of that product. This helps with the eventuality of hijackers trying to take over your episode so that you can maintain control of your brand, product, and sales. Discover the steps to protecting your listing with Brand Registry on this episode.\nA security system for your Amazon product listings.\nIf you lived in a high crime area in your city you would likely have a home security system installed to monitor your home. A security system doesn\u2019t keep criminals from breaking into your home, but it gives you a warning immediately when it happens and might even notify the police. Jon Haver has developed a \u201csecurity system\u201d of sorts for Amazon listings to give you notification when a potential hijacker has jumped on your product listing. This enables you to take immediate action to protect your listing and your product brand. Find out how you can use Jon\u2019s service to protect your product listings.\n\nReceive a special Discount for being a TAS listener - www.ListingEagle.com/TAS (my affiliate link)\nWould you like a discount on your own \u201cwatch dog\u201d for your private label listing?\nOne of the most important things you need to do when a hijacker begins tampering with your product listing is to take action immediately. But you can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t know that a hijacker has begun making changes on your product listing. What can you do to find out sooner? You can get your very own watchdog that will \u201cbark\u201d to let you know that a potential hijacker is on your site. Jon Haver has created a great software solution to enable you to take immediate action when a hijacker shows up and he\u2019s giving a special discount to everyone in the TAS community.

That\u2019s why he\u2019s doing something a bit different - a solo show - that covers the information he spoke at the Rocky Mountain Resellers conference in Denver, Colorado at the end of April, 2016. It\u2019s a motivational, inspirational, get started talk that will give you practical ways to get started making money online.\nYou\u2019ve got to be clear on why you want to build a business.\nEverybody has dreams of doing something of their own, making a product, running a shop of some kind, making a business work on their own. But very few of them who get started actually keep going long term. Why is that? Because they don\u2019t have a strong enough sense of WHY they are doing what they are doing. It has to be about more than the money, more than the success, more than the creative outlet it might be. You\u2019ve got to have a \u201cwhy\u201d that will motivate you to keep going when you hit obstacles and difficulties. On this episode Scott goes deep into the issue of \u201cwhy\u201d and gives you practical ways to develop your own \u201cwhy\u201d that will fuel you long term.\nA key element in your success is keeping short term goals in mind.\nWhen Scott was a young man he worked with his father in his construction business. He did well, worked hard, and loved the work, but he knew in a short amount of time that he didn\u2019t want to do that kind of work long term. That\u2019s when Scott and his wife started figuring out how much cash it would take for him to step out of that role in his father\u2019s company and work full time in his own business. That\u2019s an example of a short term goal that gives you something to aim at and move toward. You need to know where you\u2019re going if you are going to get there.\nYou don\u2019t need to have everything figured out - just enough to get you started.\nMany people never start a business because they think they have to have all the details figured out before they can get started. The problem is that they never will get everything figured out because life and business don\u2019t work that way. On this episode of the podcast Scott is going to walk you through how to figure out the basics of how to simply get started and then pivot and make adjustments as you are going. It\u2019s the best way to build a business because it takes advantage of momentum and enables you to learn in the crucible of actually doing it. You\u2019re going to learn a lot from Scott\u2019s experience and insights on this episode, so be sure you listen.\nThere\u2019s lots of power in focusing on the stage you\u2019re at instead of moving ahead.\nNobody can deny that there are thousands of things to learn as you build a business of your own. It\u2019s true. But you don\u2019t have to learn all of them at once. That\u2019s the beauty of the things Scott has to share on this episode. Scott talks about real life examples of how he\u2019s learned only the things he\u2019s needed for the project he\u2019s working on at the time. That enables you to specialize in what\u2019s most important at the moment and to make adjustments to your learning and processes as you go. You\u2019re able to keep moving without getting sidetracked and make the most of the time you\u2019re dedicating to the business. On this episode Scott shares his insights about how anyone can get started on their own business dream.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:41] Scott\u2019s ideas for episode 200 and how he got to this episode.\n \t[4:10] The presentation Scott gave for his speech at the Rocky Mountain Retailers conference.\n \t[5:29] Have you ever felt overwhelmed?

So make sure you take the time to listen to this episode to get an education from the experience of thousands of Amazon sellers, in one episode.\nHow can I add my product to different subcategories inside the Amazon interface.\nWhen you set up your product listing on Amazon you\u2019ll be able to choose the individual categories that you feel best represent the niche your product is in. However, you won\u2019t always be able to select all of the subcategories that you see when searching for items on Amazon. Where can you find those mysterious subcategories and how do you get your products listed there? On this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott is going to walk you through the steps he\u2019s taken over the years to get his products into subcategories, and so far they\u2019ve worked every time. \nI\u2019m getting overwhelmed by the Alibaba listings. Is there a way to filter the results?\nWhen you are doing product research for private label products to sell on Amazon there are a lot of options. One of the common sources of good products is Alibaba. But when you search for something on Alibaba you\u2019ll often see the same company multiple times in the listings. It\u2019s enough to make your head spin! How can you narrow the search results to get a simpler view of the product offerings that are available? On this episode Scott gives some tips about how to do product research in the simplest ways so that you can avoid overwhelm.\nI\u2019ve never done Amazon FBA but want to get started. At what point should I invest in software?\nThere are lots of software tools out there to help with almost every aspect of running a private label sales business on Amazon. For somebody starting out it could seem like the costs of subscribing to all of the tools will mount up pretty quickly. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott walks a newbie through the steps he would personally take if he were starting all over, and he includes his opinions about a handful of software tools and tells when he\u2019d look into purchasing them for us in his business. If you\u2019re new to the private label game you\u2019ll get a lot out of this answer.\nAmazon private label sales is not the only viable online business.\nAs you listen to the Amazing Seller you naturally are going to get lots of tips and tricks for approaching the private label sales world. But Scott takes a few moments near the end of this episode to point out that much of what he talks about are simple business principles that apply across the board in any online business enterprise. If you want to start your own online business but don\u2019t want to be limited to private label sales on Amazon, you might want to hear what Scott\u2019s got to say about how to transfer many of the concepts he teaches into your other online businesses.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:45] How to get your questions answered.\n \t[1:10] How to get Scott\u2019s free private label course.\n \t[2:55] QUESTION ONE: How can I add subcategories to my product listing?\n \t[10:55] QUESTION TWO: Is there any way to filter by company in Alibaba?\n \t[15:28] QUESTION THREE: Should a person use Amisuite as a person who hasn\u2019t begun?\n \t[24:15] Using what you learn as an Amazon seller to build any kind of business online.\n\nRESOURCES SHARED ON THIS EPISODE\n\n \twww.FreePrivateLabelCourse.com\n \twww.Periscope.tv (@ScottVoelker).\n \twww.TheAmazingSeller.com/143 - Episode about tax tips and business entities.\n \twww.Alibaba.com - sourcing website from China.\n \twww.TheAmazingSeller.", "duration": "25:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS199.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1462348856, "title": "TAS 198 : (Loop Hole Exposed) How Amazon Paid Me $958.05 Without Selling More Product", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "This one is no joke. Scott was able to get money from Amazon that was rightfully his, without selling a product. It has to do with product refunds and damaged products that Amazon has processed in the past, and he owes it all to Jacob, today\u2019s guest. The cool thing about it is that today Jacob is going to give you the step by step process for getting the money that is due to your seller account and he\u2019s going to show you how you can use his automated service to get those refunds credited to your account without you having to lift a finger. It sounds too good to be true but it\u2019s not. You can find out the details on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nStumbling across a cash cow in his Amazon seller account.\nJacob sort of accidentally came across a situation in his refund reports that tipped him off to the fact that Amazon was holding some money that was due him in a suspension account. It was money that came as a result of customer refunds that were reconciled but Amazon had never given back to him. All it took was a simple inquiry to \u00a0Amazon\u2019s seller support and Jacob was able to recover that money on the spot. The more he dug into his reports, the more money he discovered that Amazon had not credited to him properly. On this episode Jacob will show you how he discovered his \u201ccash cow\u201d and how you can use the same tactics to get money that is rightfully yours.\nHave you checked out your Amazon Seller Refund Report?\nInside your seller account you can run all kinds of reports that show you the status of your sales, damaged products, refunds, and other variables that have to do with your products on Amazon. One of those is the \u201crefund report.\u201d It has to do with refunds that have been issued to your customers and the credits and debits to your account that correspond to those refunds. It may sound odd, but quite often you are credited money through the refund process and Amazon lists that money on your refund reports. By comparing that number with actual money you\u2019ve been credited, you can find money that Amazon owes you but you\u2019ve never received. Check out this episode to find out how you can get that money back immediately.\nInventory damage is another area where you might be owed some money by Amazon.\nWith any massive warehouse operation like Amazon you are going to eventually have some of your products damaged during handling. It\u2019s part of how the business works. Amazon is usually very good about noting damage and giving you credit for it so that you don\u2019t lose money because of their mistakes. But you don\u2019t always actually receive that money, even though Amazon has noted the damage. On this episode Scott\u2019s guest is going to show you how to investigate damaged products to discover if you\u2019re owed money from Amazon. You\u2019ll want to listen so you can get the cash you\u2019re owed.\nA software product that retrieves the cash from your Amazon Seller account automatically.\nAs Jacob\u2019s Amazon business became larger and his sales grew, he was having more and more situations where his refunds from Amazon were not being processed in a way that credited his account. The time it was taking to stay on top of those important issues was mounting - so he decided to work out an automated system to search his refunds for him. Now he\u2019s taken that system into a commercial software application that you can use to get back your own refunds from Amazon - and it will only cost you pennies on the dollar.

On this episode Scott and Chris chat about how to use PPC to make that happen and how it can fuel a surge in \u00a0your product\u2019s sales and popularity.\nAre you doing good follow up with your prior customers?\nIt\u2019s true that Amazon will not give you the contact information of people who purchase your private label products. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t follow up with them. Amazon will allow you to contact them through the Amazon system to offer product support, ask for reviews, troubleshoot product issues, and much more. On this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott and Chris give some options about how to follow up effectively so that you can increase reviews, seller ratings, and increase repeat sales of your private label products and related products.\nDid you get in on Scott and Chris\u2019 live event?\nThere were only 30 spots for the live event in Denver on May 1st.

Because these Friday editions are the \u201cAsk Scott\u201d version of the show where Scott Voelker answers your questions questions from real life Amazon sellers who have run into a snag, hurdle, or issue of confusion in their Amazon Private Label business. Scott\u2019s got over a year of experience doing his own private label business and has also had the opportunity to learn from numbers of experienced guests as he\u2019s interviewed them on his podcast. You\u2019ll find Scott\u2019s answers revealing, helpful, and timely, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nIs there a way to dominate ALL the PPC ad spots for a product?\nA listener to the podcast wants to know if there is a way he can structure his PPC campaigns so that his ads show up in all of the ad boxes available for his product keywords. Why would he want to do that? \u00a0If he could do so, he would have his product shown on the page more than any other products. That translates into a higher percentage chance that he will get the purchase rather than some of his competition. Although Scott is not entirely sure if this can be done, he does give some good advice on how to go about trying on this episode of the podcast.\nHow should I go about determining the colors for my product?\nWhen you sell a product that can come in a variety of colors, how should you go \u00a0about determining which colors are the best ones to offer? Today a listener asked that very question and Scott has some very practical advice on how to go about choosing the colors that you were going to sell. You shouldn't guess, and you shouldn't do what feels right to you. You should do what the facts tell you. On this episode Scott is going to tell you how to find out the facts and how to apply them to your own color choices when it comes to variations on your products.\nI have closely related products. Should I create variations or individual listings for them?\nIt's a great idea to have products on the Amazon selling platform that are closely related to each other. This enables you to get cross sales from one product to another, which increases your profitability. But at some point you're going to need to decide if those products are so closely related that they are actually variations of each other, or if each one is unique enough that it deserves and should have its own listing. On this episode of the podcast Scott answers a question about that issue and gives some very practical advice. \nYou can get a free private label course in your inbox for the next 10 days.\nIf you are new to the world of private label sales on Amazon you can get a free 10-day course from Scott that walks you through all the steps you need to take to find your product, research whether it is worth investing in, get it established on the Amazon platform, start to drive sales through promotions, and follow up with your customers, as well as much, much more.

But that is the furthest thing from the truth. On this episode Scott he's going to give you an inside look into his income figures for the first quarter of 2016. He's doing this to show you that even those who seem to be successful have their down turns in both profit and success. He wants you to go into your private label business with your eyes wide open so that you can prepare yourself for the obstacles you will inevitably face. So grab a drink and sit back and listen to this great episode where Scott bares all.\nBusiness profits on my private label business are down.\nThe personal revenue Scott is receiving from his private label sales are down from what he desires and expected. But it's not something he\u2019s letting himself get down about. Instead, he\u2019s taking it as an opportunity to up his game. What happened is pretty simple. When he started this podcast a little over a year ago he began to focus on many things besides his private label business. His time was divided and he began to coast when it came to paying attention to the business. This downturn is showing him that he needs to pay more attention and that he has to be more diligent. On this episode Scott is going to share his plans with you about how he is going to turn around his profit figures. \nDifferentiating your products is key.\nWhen Scott first started selling as a private label seller on Amazon he chose a product and got it on to the Amazon platform quickly. As he went along he discovered that products are more successful when they are differentiated within the niche. His first product wasn't standing out enough and consequently his profit figures have begun to drop. On this episode you will hear the steps Scott is going to take to address that issue and make his product a one-of-a-kind item within his niche. It's a lesson all of us learn sooner or later and you can walk right along with Scott as he makes improvements.\nBuilding a brand means more than one product.\nIn the big picture the health of the business is more important than the health of one particular product. That doesn't mean you want your product sales to get any of your individual items, but when one does dip it isn't the end of the world if you have other products to back it up and pick up the loss. On this episode Scott emphasizes the importance of building a brand that includes multiple SKUs within your product line. You're going to learn a great deal by listening to the hard lessons Scott has endured over the past quarter.\nPretend you\u2019re in danger of going out of business every day.\nOne of the pieces of advice that Scott has received from Gary V. is to pretend that your business is in danger of going under every single day. That mindset will force you to up your game, increase your effort, and be smarter about the way you run your business overall. You can learn a lot from Scott's example and the illustrations he gives of how he is going to implement that advice if you listen to this episode.

On this episode of the podcast Scott is talking with an expert at social media about how to use it effectively to increase traffic to your website and product listings. Laura Roeder joins us today to share about her experience with social media and to give some great tips on how to advance your business using her tool for social media management.\nThe importance of having content to share.\nMany people try to use social media as a bullhorn to blast out promotions and offers about their products. Well that can work to a small degree it is not the way social media actually works when done right. Social media is meant to be social, that means people building relationships with people. In order to do that in a way that is adding value to those natural conversations you need to have content to share that is both promotional and helpful at the same time. On this episode Scott's guest shares some great tips about how to create that topic surrounding a product or niche that you want to promote. \nHow to promote physical products on social media.\nEvery Amazon Seller wants to get their product in front of people who love that type of product or niche. But doing so is the tricky part. You don't want to blast your product in front of people repeatedly, they will turn you off if you do. But you also don't want to be shy about telling people about your great product when the timing is right. That balance can be very difficult to attain. \u00a0Scott decided to go out and find a social media expert who could help clear the air on this important subject and help you develop a game plan to promote your product the right way on social media. That's what this episode of the show is all about.\nBuild relationships with thought leaders in your niche if you want to gain traction.\nBy taking the social aspect of social media seriously, you can do a lot to promote and build your brand over time. And notice, it does take time. That's because relationships that are valuable and trusted take time to build, you can't just share your product with an influencer in your niche and expect them to share it right away. There needs to be a relationship that is foundational to that conversation. On this episode of the podcast Laura Roeder shares her insights into building those kinds of relationships with key people in your product in it so that you can build your business on the backs of those important personalities, and do it the right way.\nA warning to those new to the private label arena.\nIf you are just getting started with private label sales on Amazon Scott has a very wise caution for you. The contents of this episode are likely not something you need to focus on right now. Your first step is to get a product onto the Amazon platform and use the tools that Amazon provides to get your sales going. That is the best way to verify whether the product you're selling is a good choice, and to start your business rolling in the right direction. Once you've done all of that, the social media tips on this episode may be relevant to what you are doing. So don't get overwhelmed thinking that you need to do everything on this episode.

Would that be something you'll be able to use? In today's episode Scott is doing exactly that. He takes you through every tiny step he goes through to research a potential product and ensure that it is the best chance he has of launching a great, profitable product. There are no guarantees, but this is the best way Scott has found to make sure he's not stepping into a difficult niche or product align. Be sure to listen so you get all the details.\nWhat if the initial numbers look good for a potential private label product?\nImagine that you have found a private label product that is potentially a good seller. It has low reviews and high sales numbers. Is that all that you need to look at? On this episode Scott will tell you why that approach can be deceptive if you don't go a little bit deeper into your product research. He's going to show you what you should do next to ensure that you were looking at numbers that realistically represent the actual sales of that product. That's a step you won't want to miss and one that can make the difference between a failing product and a very successful one. \nThe pricing history of a potential private label product is important for you to know.\nAs you investigate the possibility of adding a product to Amazon, you need to understand the pricing history of other products that are similar. \u00a0Has the pricing been fairly consistent? Has it increased? Has the price dropped from the time the product was initially introduced to the Amazon platform? All of these questions are ones that need to be answered before you take the leap into sourcing that product for yourself. On this episode Scott is going to explain to you why you need the answers to those questions and how you can get them.\nHow you can determine the sales trends a specific product has experienced.\nOkay, say that you have found a great product, the reviews and sales seem to be legitimate, and you are getting excited about sourcing that product for yourself to get into an Amazon private label business. But there is one more thing you should consider. Have the sales trends of the product demonstrated that it is a niche that is actually growing? Or is it declining? If you don't know the answer to those questions you could be stepping into a market that is not going to be sustainable long-term. On this episode Scott will walk you through how you can discover if a product is one that you can count on looking into the future. That is something you really need to know.\nHas your competition gotten organic sales or promotion based sales?\nWhy is it important for you to know if products that compete with your potential product have gotten their sales through organic search results or through promotions? It's because cells that have been supported solely by promotions are not the kind of sales you want to count on. That would mean that if you enter that niche you would be spending money on promotions consistently rather than building a product base from organic searches. Be sure that you take the time to listen to this episode, Scott is showing you exactly how to determine the reality of the sales you see for the products within the niche you're considering. \n\n\n\n\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n \t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n \t[0:33] How you can get a cheat sheet and see a video walk-through of this episode.\n \t[1:44] How to connect with Scott and Snapchat.\n \t[3:08] Why just looking at the numbers of low reviews and high sales is deceptive.\n \t[6:20] Getting started with the evaluation of a potential product.\n \t[10:42] How to verify that the numbers you\u2019re seeing in Jungle Scout are true.\n \t[14:00] How to verify a product\u2019s pricing history.\n \t[15:50] Using Google Trends to assess the product sales throughout th...", "duration": "28:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS189.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1460361645, "title": "TAS 188 : (Hot Seat) Is My Product Still Worth Selling on Amazon?", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Being on the \u201cHot Seat\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like a pleasant thing. But in this case it could be a powerful helpful place to be. Today's episode of the podcast is a \u201chot seat\u201d edition where Scott and his friend Chris look over an existing Amazon product listing to supply tweaks and suggestions on how to maximize sales. Today's hot seat participant has a product that has begun to sell much less than it once did and he's curious if he should even put in the effort to maximize its potential, or to just give up and choose different product. Many Amazon sellers ask that same question, so you can learn a lot from this episode.\nWhat if I picked a trendy product?\nWe've all seen those trendy products that sell like hot cakes for a short time and then fall off the face of the Earth. Selfie sticks are one example that are mentioned in today's episode. What do you do if your product is one of those trendy items that may not be popular a year from now? Are there ways to leverage it differently so that you can continue to get sales? Are there ways to couple it with other things to create bundles? On this episode Scott and Chris are going to deal with those exact issues relating to the product on the hot seat today. Make sure you listen to get some tips about what you can do with your products, where they are trendy or not.\nThe main image of your product is critically important.\nThe product listing on today's hot seat edition of the podcast is a great example to teach you the importance of the primary image on your listing. This product is unique in some of its design characteristics, but the main image does not clearly show what it is. When Scott and Chris each went to the product listing page neither of them recognized the product for what it really is. They feel that switching the main image to one that is similar to those of the competitors would be a great step in increase in sales. It's a simple step that could make all the difference. Find out more of the tweaks Scott and Chris suggest on this episode.\nYour product category matters - a lot.\nWhen setting up your product listing on Amazon you need to be careful about the category you select for your product to be listed under. Today's hot see participant has chosen a category that is related to the product and both Scott and Chris can see why he chose that category, but most of his competition is in a different category that is more clearly related to the product. They feel that in order to be competitive he should be in the same category as his competition. On this episode will get to hear how they suggest he makes that transition and what effect they think it will have.\nPPC is not always the answer.\nThe listener who is on today's hot seat edition has spent more and more money on pay per click and is seeing very little results. Scott and Chris both feel that part of the reason his pay per click campaigns are not being effective is because his listing is not fully optimized. On this episode Scott & Chris walkthrough the listing and give quite a few tweaks that can be done to maximize effectiveness of the natural key words and images in the listing to make the PPC campaigns as effective as they should be. If you struggled with spending too much on PPC you may find some answers to your problems on this episode. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[0:18] Who is Chris Schaeffer?\n\t[2:50] How you can get involved in future live events.\n\t[5:41] The scenario addressed today: Is my product still worth selling?\n\t[9:50] Chris\u2019 thoughts about the situation: It\u2019s a trendy product\u2026 that\u2019s a problem - AND the price point is very low.\n\t[12:39] Scott\u2019s thoughts: Is his niche the right one?\n\t[14:13] A tweak to the main image that could make a big difference.\n\t[18:00] Clarifying your target market and optimizing your listing and price point.\n\t[20:18] Should the seller scrap this product or are there changes he can make?", "duration": "33:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS188.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1460102408, "title": "TAS 187 : Ask Scott Session #54 \u2013 Your Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Wouldn\u2019t it be great to have experienced advice every step of the way as you launch your business?

He\u2019s found one that meets all of the criteria that Scott typically recommends but isn\u2019t sure if the pricing is viable. Every seller at this point is only selling at $10 which would only allow him $5 profit per unit. He\u2019s curious if that is enough profit and if Scott would take the leap. You might be surprised by Scott\u2019s response on this one, so be sure you listen to get the insights he shares.\nWhich is more important - seller feedback or product feedback?\nA listener asks whether or not he should be asking his customers to leave feedback on his seller account or to leave reviews on his actual products. It can be a confusing thing because you need both in order to convince the Amazon search algorithm that you are both a reputable seller who is selling valuable products. On this episode Scott\u2019s going to answer the question by giving a few different approaches that he\u2019s seen work to garner both seller feedback and product reviews. You\u2019ll get lots of good ideas from Scott\u2019s response to this great question.\nI see two types of Pay per Click ads (at the top and at the side). Is there a way for me to choose which I want to use?\nAmazon has created an ingenious service in their promotional to all. Using pay-per-click you can run ads for your product to place them with in plain sight of people searching for the keywords you were trying to rank for. For new sellers this is one of the best ways to begin getting sales, which in turn will help you rank organically for the keywords you are pursuing. On this episode Scott talks about the placement of those pay-per-click ads and gives you some strategies you can use to maximize the use of PPC. You'll want to hear his insights on this difficult part of the Amazon private label process.\nThe best way to rank for a specific keyword.\nIf you are not able to get your private label products to rank for your preferred keywords, you will not make any sales. But the best way to rank for your targeted keywords is by selling your products. How do you get out of that catch-22? You do it by promotions and giveaways that enable you to make sales in spite of the lack of organic ranking. That is the best way to start ranking for the keywords you're targeting. On this episode Scott is going to cover this issue in depth and give you some strategies to approach your promotions and giveaways successfully.

One of those has to do with three legal areas: patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Today\u2019s episode is not meant to scare you but to make you aware of the issues involved in those three areas and equip you to protect yourself and protect your own rights when it comes to the use of your product and brand names, images, and unique characteristics. You\u2019ll want to listen carefully to this episode to learn what you need to know.\nWhat\u2019s the big deal with patents, copyrights, and trademarks?\nThe reason you need to be aware of these three important legal terms is because you have the possibility of either being in violation of another company\u2019s trademark, patent, or copyright, or will be violated in regards to your own products or brand. If you\u2019re not aware of the differences between these 3 things you could be in danger on either side of the issue. Today\u2019s guest, Ted Luymes is an attorney who knows these issues backwards and forward and can help you understand the places you may be vulnerable. You\u2019re going to learn a ton from this conversation.\nHow can you know if a product is patented?\nPatents are difficult to research to ensure that the product you\u2019re wanting to sell is not already patented by someone else. Today\u2019s guest, Ted Luymes is an attorney who deals with these issues and says that even patent attorneys can have a hard time discovering whether a specific type of product is patented or not. You have to do your own research to make sure that your potential product is not shaped like other products and avoid any possible patent violations. You should also deal with your supplier about this issue to ensure that you\u2019re aware of their experience and knowledge of patent issues relating to the product. You\u2019ll learn a lot on this episode so be sure to listen.\nWhat IS a product trademark and how is it used?\nA trademark is something a company registers with the U.S. trademark office to affirm that their company and products are certified as belonging to them. It can include the name, logo, label design, and fonts used in those things. There is legal protection for you if you don\u2019t have the official trademark registration but the registration enables you to establish your claim as of a particular date to ensure that your rights are not being violated. Today\u2019s guest, Ted Luymes is going to walk us through the dos and don\u2019ts of trademarks.\nWhat IS a copyright?\nA copyright is a legal title used to delineate ownership of a particular item or photo to an individual or company. Copyright is important for Amazon sellers in terms of photos. Ideally you should be taking your own photos or ensuring that the photographer who takes your photos knows that you want the rights to the photos. The \u00a9 mark can be used liberally on your product listings and your photos to ensure that you are the owner of those images and items. You\u2019ll learn some very helpful things from today\u2019s guest, attorney Ted Luymes about trademarks, copyrights, and patents. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:03] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[2:44] Introduction of today\u2019s guest Ted Luymes, attorney.\n\t[3:38] What Ted has been up to since being on the last episode - #152.\n\t[5:44] The current status with product hijacking issues & what Ted\u2019s seeing lately.\n\t[9:33] Ted\u2019s understanding of patents, trademarks, and copyrights.\n\t[17:32] Why research alone may not be enough.\n\t[19:45] What is a trademark?\n\t[23:00] The proper way to use a trademark on your packaging and products.\n\t[24:40] Things to avoid that relate to trademark issues.\n\t[27:37] Trademark issues relating to \u201ccut and paste\u201d sellers.\n\t[31:00] Ways to enlist Amazon\u2019s seller support to help with trademark violations.\n\t[31:44] What is a copyright?\n\t[37:45] Common sense things relating to these issues.\n\t[40:20] What you need to do if someone violates your rights.", "duration": "49:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS186.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1459756850, "title": "TAS 185 : NEW Tweak on Amazon Product Launches (I\u2019m trying this)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "For very long time Scott has recommended a specific approach to launching new products on the Amazon platform. But he's making some adjustments based on the feedback and input he's received from some of his friends who are selling products on Amazon as well. On this episode of the podcast Scott is outlining the specifics of these tweaks and telling you why they work as well as they do. On future product launches he's going to be trying the suggestions and will report back to you in the future about the success he's he's on his personal products.\nHave you gone through Scott\u2019s free 10 day course?\nIf you are brand new to the world of Amazon private label sales, you don't have to reinvent the wheel or start from square one. Scott has put together a tremendous resource for you to help you understand and apply the principles behind everything from finding a great private label products to getting it listed on Amazon and making sales. You can find out how to get Scott's free 10-day course by listen to this episode of the podcast. Be sure you do so that you don't have to learn all of the hard learned lessons the hard way.\nAn adjustment to using promotions to launch a product.\nSo far when Scott has launched a new private label product he has done a very large promotion at the beginning to get quite a few reviews on the product listing so that the social proof for the product will be higher and therefore spawn more sales. But he's taking a new approach now based on the feedback from some friends. He's going to be doing a smaller promotion at first to get the ball rolling and wait for a bit to see if it prompts organic sales. If it does he will wait before he does any further promotions if it doesn't then is when he will put together his larger promotional strategy. You can hear all the details of this new approach on this episode of the podcast.\nDo you understand WHY product reviews are so important?\nOne of the key components to a good product launch strategy on Amazon is facilitating a way for your buyers to give you reviews on the product. Reviews are vitally important, not because they cause your products to rank higher in the Amazon search results, but because when people do search on Amazon and find your product there is more social proof behind your product that will prompt him to become a purchaser. It is those purchases that rank your product higher in organic search. On this episode of the podcast Scott walks you through the new approach he is taking to his product launch so that you can understand the benefits of the adjustments.\nThe Amazing Seller Facebook Community is ready to welcome you!\nIf you have not joined The Amazing Seller Facebook Community you are missing out.

On this episode Scott is addressing questions about keywords and product rankings (and gives tons of resources on that one), whether potentially great products should be pursued if the competition for sales is high, how to do market research effectively, and the best margins for an Amazon private label product.\nWhy you need to focus your efforts on a more specific niche of products.\nYou may find a product that looks like a great possibility for sales but the general category is filled with competition and lots of product reviews. But you\u2019ll find that the competition will thin out when you\u2019re able to provide a product within that area that is more specific and specialized. A differentiated product will always enable you to have a better opportunity for good sales on Amazon and will make it more difficult for others to copy the exact thing you are doing. Find out more on this episode. \u00a0\nThe best approach for choosing keywords to rank your private label products.\nKeywords are one of the most important parts of private label sales on Amazon. If you don't choose the right keywords you will have a very hard time making sales. So how do you go about finding those keywords? Scott was asked that very question on this episode of the podcast and goes into great detail about the resources you can use and the websites that are available to help you discover the best keywords for your specific product. If you don't listen to any other part of this episode you will want to hear of this one. It is worth gold.\nThe best margins for private label sales.\nWhen considering a product to sell on Amazon you want to make sure that you're going to have an adequate margin of profit to make the selection, purchase, shipping, and sales of the product actually worthwhile for you. Naturally, you want the margin to be as high as it can be, but what is an acceptable margin given all the fees and shipping costs that are involved in selling a private label product on Amazon? On this episode of a podcast Scott walks through his thoughts regarding the margins that are acceptable for him and what he shooting for with every product that he sells.\nThere are lots of different keyword fields in the Amazon backend. Which ones do I use?\nWhen you begin to fill out all of the fields on the back end of a product listing in Amazon, you'll discover there are many of them that you may not understand or do not know what they are for. On this episode a listener ask Scott about the various keyword fields and how they should be completed. Scott gives a very good answer regarding the use of those fields and make some suggestions on how you can find keywords to place in them that will be effective for the search functions on Amazon.

One of his products, a bundle of items, was suspended by Amazon and he was being required to rectify the situation that caused the product to be suspended. On this episode Scott is going to walk you through the exact steps he took to address the situation with Amazon and give you a ton of things to think about when it comes to dealing with Amazon directives like this. If you haven\u2019t had this issue yet, you will, so be sure you listen to the episode so you can be ahead of the game!\nThe importance of some kind of product inspection.\nWhen Scott received a notice from Amazon that one of his products had been suspended, it was because his return rate was at 13%. Why was it so high? Some of his products were missing pieces and the customers were returning them. Scott learned that his practice of having his items shipped directly from his supplier to Amazon was not working. He was going to have to figure out a way to ensure that every product was inspected before it was shipped. On this episode Scott\u2019s going to tell you how he addressed the issue and give you some resources to check out to set up your own product inspections.\nYou need to set up variations on every product.\nWhen Scott received a notice from Amazon that one of his products was suspended he had a few options he could pursue. One of those was to set up a variation of the same product and then ship in some products he had in hand to replace the ones that were being suspended. That would enable him to get a listing for that product back up in a rather quick fashion. Scott suggests that every time you set up a product listing on Amazon you create it with the option for variations, even if you don't think that product will ever have a variation. This enables you to address issues like he faced if it should come up.\nThe tax implications of products you can\u2019t use.\nOne of the things Scott was concerned about when he got a notice from Amazon that a product was being returned by customers because it was missing parts, was the loss he would have to take on those products. It amounted to $7,000 worth of products and he didn't want to take a hit that large. He called his tax accountant and discovered that he would be able to write those off as a loss and benefit himself on his taxes to some degree.

He\u2019s not sure if he should start selling in his local Amazon market or try to get his products set up on the U.S. Amazon market.

Today's episode deals with that exact subject in the experiences of one Amazon Seller who had trouble getting his product payments refunded after he decided the products were not up to his quality standards. You are going to learn a lot of lessons from his hard learned experience.\nHow do you know the products your supplier gives you are the quality you want?\nThe first thing you should do when you find a product that might be a potentially good fit for your business to feature on Amazon is to have a sample sent to you. That's a very needed and necessary first step, but it may not be the total solution. The process of sending a sample can be manipulated by the supplier sending you the very best one that they have, giving you the impression that all of the products they produce are the same quality. Today's guest decided to have an inspection company check out his products prior to them being shipped from the supplier and that one step saved him a thousand headaches. You can hear his entire story on this episode.\nWhat is Trade Assurance and why you should only use suppliers who are verified through it.\nWhen you are seeking a supplier for the products you want to sell through Amazon private label you will come across many options on the Alibaba website. You need to make sure that you were only looking for products among sellers who are certified by Trade Assurance. Trade Assurance is Alibaba's way of verifying suppliers and is a way that you can have peace of mind that you're dealing with reputable companies. On this episode Scott's guest is going to share his experience with Trade Assurance and why it was an invaluable part of the process when seeking a refund from one of his suppliers.\nIf you have to ask for your deposit back, expect a long process.\nIt doesn't really matter how you pay the deposit for your first round of products, whether by wire transfer, escrow, or PayPal, if you need to request a refund you will have a long time to wait. Refunds come through a multi-stage the process of verification and investigation about what was actually done by the company and by you. It's very important that in that entire process you document every communication and every step along the way. Today's guest is going to share with you how he did that and the results that came of it.\nHow to effectively use an escrow account.\nOne of the tools you can use when paying a supplier from China through Alibaba is called an escrow account. Escrow accounts basically hold the funds that you have sent for your deposit until you indicate that you are satisfied with the product you have been supplied. It's a way to ensure that your money is going to be returned to you if the product you receive are not up to the quality standards that you were led to believe. On this episode Scott shares why he values the escrow functionality so much, and how you can be sure to use it in your interactions with suppliers. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:04] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[0:50] An introduction to the voicemail Blair sent to Scott.\n\t[1:43] How you can get started with Amazon FBA and join the free live workshop.\n\t[3:30] The voicemail itself.\n\t[6:21] Blair\u2019s conversation with Scott.\n\t[7:59] How Blair began his Amazon private label business.\n\t[9:53] Blair\u2019s process for discovering his first products.\n\t[12:20] The plan behind Blair\u2019s variety of product offerings.\n\t[13:59] The situations with suppliers.\n\t[15:15] The situations Blair experienced that caused issues with his payments.\n\t[17:10] The Trade Assurance dispute process.", "duration": "44:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS18020.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1458547218, "title": "TAS 179 : Top 10 Takeaways: The First 3 months in the FBA World!", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Welcome back to the show notes page of The Amazing Seller Podcast.

The problem is that many people don't recognize that the figures they hear from success stories don't typically reveal the costs involved in the research, packaging, shipping, and fees related with feeling that product on Amazon. The end result is you may have an unrealistic idea of what the actual profit margins for a product are. On this episode of the podcast, Scott is going to point out some of the things you need to consider when calculating profit margins so that you can know and accurate estimate of what your profits will be. \nDon\u2019t be fooled by seasonal products.\nYou may find a product to sell on Amazon that appears to be a wonderful opportunity. But always take into consideration whether or not that product and its related products are seasonal in nature. Seasonal products are great for a very short time but throughout the year don't provide the consistent income that you really want to achieve an Amazon private label sales. On this episode Scott is going to give you some things to watch out for when considering the possibility of selling products that are seasonal in nature. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:25] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[1:34] A shout-out to a TAS community member.\n\t[3:11] How you can get in on one of Scott\u2019s live workshops.\n\t[4:04] Why giving up during product research is a huge mistake.\n\t[14:30] If you forget about the depth of your market, you\u2019re going to blow it.\n\t[18:30] The pain of misunderstanding profit margins.\n\t[24:26] Be sure to pay attention to issue of seasonal gifts.\n\t[29:17] There\u2019s a strong tendency to overthink and over complicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 177\nTAS 177 : 5 FBA Rookie Mistakes and How To Avoid Them\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\n[00:00:04] SV: Hey, hey what's up everyone?

You\u2019ve got a great opportunity today to hear another of those Hot Seat sessions - this time relating to an existing retail business that is trying to get onto the Amazon platform. There are some tweaks and tips you may have never heard before taken from Scott and Chris\u2019 experience so be sure you listen.\nWould you like to be a part of a \u201cHot Seat\u201d event coming to a town near you?\nScott and Chris are already doing a hot seat event in Denver Colorado in May of 2016. But that event is already booked solid. They plan to do future events in cities across the United States. If you would like to be a part of 1 of those events, you can get your name on the notification list so that you will be among the first to know where and when those events are going to happen. Listen to this episode to find out where you can go to put your name on that list and being part of an event just like the evaluation and suggestions you were going to here on this episode of the podcast. \nOptimizing product listings is huge.\nOn this episode of the podcast, Scott and Chris are taking a look at some existing listings of a retail business that is moving its products on to the Amazon platform. One of the first things I notice is that the product listings are not optimized as well as they could be. There is only one picture, very little in the description, and they suspect that the back in the keywords are not optimized very well. Looking at the company website, they see a beautiful presentation of the products that are offered and suggest using some of the same principles from the website on the Amazon listing. You can hear the specifics of what they suggest on this episode of the podcast. \nImages are powerful in presenting a profession product on Amazon.\nAs Scott and Chris evaluate a product listing on this episode of the podcast, but they notice that the seller is not making the best use of the images on their listing. Their website for the products display all kinds of beautiful images, but very few of those are included on the Amazon listing. As well, the website includes many testimonials and logos from industry platforms where the products have been featured, and Scott suggest the seller create images from those and include them on the Amazon listing as well. You can hear more great suggestions like this for how to optimize your Amazon listing, on this episode of the podcast. \nHow to figure out the keywords you should go after.\nOn this episode of the podcast, Christie has asked Scott and Chris to evaluate her product listings. One of the questions she asks has to do with how to determine which keywords she should be trying to rank for. Scott and Chris suggest some great tools for her to use, and also how to use her existing website for the products to find even more possible keywords. Chris also makes a good point about utilizing the many variations she has of her product to find even more relevant keywords. It's too complex to describe here, but if you listen to this episode you won't have any trouble figuring it out. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:04] Scott\u2019s introduction to another \u201cHot seat\u201d session regarding a real Amazon business.\n\t[1:30] The upcoming TAS Breakthrough Live event.\n\t[2:15] How you can get transcripts or all the episodes.\n\t[3:04] Introduction to the Hot Seat for today.\n\t[4:10] A retail company that wants to get going on Amazon.\n\t[11:30] Chris\u2019 first thoughts about the situation.\n\t[12:40] Why optimizing product listings is one of the most powerful things you can do.\n\t[17:33] Scott\u2019s suggestion about including testimonials and additional images in your description.\n\t[24:10] How to figure out the keywords you should go after.", "duration": "46:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS174.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1457341206, "title": "TAS 173 : Small Budget Product Launch by and Average JOE (Case Study)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "There are lots of people who hear of what\u2019s going on with Amazon private label sales and think that they can\u2019t get into it without a huge investment. But that\u2019s not true, and this interview episode is proof. Today, Scott is chatting with Travis, a normal guy who calls himself an \u201caverage Joe.\u201d Travis heard about private label sales on Amazon and decided he was going to make it work even though he didn\u2019t have software to research his product ideas or a huge budget to do it. You\u2019re going to be blown away by the success Travis has had simply by following some common sense steps.\nGetting the product idea first.\nTravis\u2019 first private label product idea was a product that is a popular trend right now, so he wasn\u2019t sure if he should go with it or not. But getting a good price on the product and the possibility of a good sized margin prompted him to take the leap. So with $1500 spent in products and fees Travis was able to get his first product onto Amazon. His story is an amazing one because his approach was truly a \u201cbare bones\u201d attempt and his hard work and risk taking has paid off. You can hear the exact steps Travis went through on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nPlaying with the price to get his product off the ground.\nWhen Travis first got his bare bones product onto the Amazon selling platform, his competition was pricing their products are around $15 each. He decided to go below that at \u00a0$9.99 each. He wasn't sure what kind of effect that would have but went to sleep after posting his product consoling himself that he shouldn't expect much the first few days. He woke up to 5 sales of his product and he didn't even have any reviews on it yet. You can hear Travis\u2019 amazing story as he shares it with Scott on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nPay per click right away and no reviews.\nOne of the things Scott recommends to new sellers is to get their product onto the Amazon platform and then do a couple of giveaways to prompt reviews for the product. \u00a0But Travis wanted to see what would happen if he didn't have any reviews but started with PPC right away. That's what he did, just using a broad search PPC campaign, and his sales began almost immediately. In his first month he sold over a thousand products and still has not secured any reviews for his product. He's hoping that organic reviews will happen soon, but \u00a0also knows that he eventually needs to get a giveaway going to get his review started. Travis's gutsy approach is one you'll enjoy hearing about it, on this episode.\nProof that private label sales can be done with a small budget and low amount of experience.\nToday's guest has never done Amazon private label sales before. He did not have a large bank row and had absolutely no experience sourcing or selling products online. The only education he had was listening to the episodes of this podcast. the results he's gotten are amazing. Within his first month Travis has well over $1,000 worth of sales and is already ordering more products to replenish the ones that have been sold. He expects to expand this product into multiple products, possibly variations of the same product, and even adding accessories to his product line. It's proof that Amazon private label sales is the real deal and anyone can do it.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[2:52] Get in on Scott\u2019s free live workshop.\n\t[3:21] Travis\u2019 background and how he got into Amazon private label sales.\n\t[7:00] The small start Travis had getting into Amazon.\n\t[8:21] How Travis got his product ideas.\n\t[9:52] Finding the right manufacturer for his product.\n\t[12:00] How Travis first developed his packaging ideas.\n\t[14:00] Travis\u2019 price point and why he priced his items lower than the rest of the market.\n\t[16:14] Getting into the brand registry.\n\t[18:34] Travis turned on PPC from day 1 and got some good results.\n\t[22:00] 20 sales per day with no reviews to date.", "duration": "42:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS173.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1457082005, "title": "TAS 172 : Ask Scott Session #49 \u2013 Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s time for another episode of The Amazing Seller podcast and this session in particular is an \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode where Scott Voelker answers your questions week after week.

What should I do?\nScott has addressed the sale of vitamin or health supplements before and he\u2019s never recommended that a person who\u2019s never done private labeling start out with supplements. Why? Because it\u2019s one of the most crowded markets on Amazon and will cost you tons of money to get yourself recognized and ranking for keywords. But this listener already has a supplement business, so Scott takes a bit of a different approach to that. Listen in to this episode to see how Scott would go about it.\nWhat are the different \u201clevels\u201d or \u201ctypes\u201d of private labeling?\nOne of Scott\u2019s listeners is curious how to think about private labeling in terms of the different \u201clevels\u201d of involvement that private label sellers may be involved at. There appears to be a \u201cfull blown\u201d level that includes branding your own products, getting custom packaging, etc. but there\u2019s also the level that buys products from a site like www.Aliexpress.com and resells them without doing any kind of branding at all. Scott gives a great overview of the different ways it\u2019s possible to do a private label business, so be sure you listen.\nAmazon support advised me to delete my listing. I\u2019m a bit hesitant. What should I do?\nA listener has his product listed on Amazon\u2019s brand registry but due to a little bit of missing information he\u2019s being advised by Amazon seller support that he should delete his listing, create another one for the same product, and include the missing information on that listing. He\u2019s hesitant to delete a long-standing product listing and asks Scott\u2019s advice. Scott has plenty to say about this one and is NOT sure the guy should do what he\u2019s been told. Do you know why? You can hear Scott\u2019s reasons on this episode.\nI\u2019m trying to dial-in my PPC campaigns and am not sure I\u2019m doing it correctly. Can you help?\nOne of Scott\u2019s listeners is doing a great job analyzing and optimizing her PPC campaigns week to week, but she doesn\u2019t feel she\u2019s getting everything out of it. In order to respond to this question, Scott asks his buddy Chris Schaeffer to come on the show to give his insight because Chris is an expert at PPC.

But how do you get that attention? Keywords get your products found, but your image is what gets it the attention it deserves. Think about what you do when you shop Amazon. You punch in your keywords and find the products you are interested in, then you scroll through the results looking at images, don't you?

On this episode Scott is going to tell you everything you need to know about optimizing your Amazon product images.\nWhat impact does a great image have on your Amazon PPC?\nIf you're utilizing Amazon's pay-per-click platform to drive traffic to your products, you need to keep in mind that the primary Image you upload to your product page is the same image that PPC will display when your dad comes up on a search results page. That image needs to be the very best image you can make it. It needs to highlight your product\u2019s strengths and features in a way that draws people to move from prospective buyer, to actual buyer. On this episode of the podcast you are going to learn 7 product Image tips that should bring you higher conversions.\nWhen you\u2019re taking pictures of your product, lighting is everything.\nIn years past Scott built up a six figure photography business in his local community, so he knows a thing or two about good photography. One of the key things you need to understand is that good photography requires good lighting. You can't expect to get good images if your environment is dim or without adequate lighting. On this episode Scott is going to tell you the very best things you can do to get great lighting for your product images, so that your photos will pop off the page and get the attention you want them to get.\nPlay by the rules when creating your product images.\nThere are many Amazon sellers who play fast and loose with the Amazon guidelines regarding images. You will see product images with text on them, without white backgrounds, and many other things. The plain and simple truth is that these things are illegal when it comes to Amazon Terms of Service. Scott recommends that you always stick with the guidelines because Amazon will find you out sooner or later in your listing will be shut down. On this episode Scott reviews the Amazon image guidelines and gives you tips to maximize your images within those guidelines to optimize your sales conversions.\n\n\n\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[1:15] How you can get your free transcripts to these episodes.\n\t[2:07] The importance of keywords and how they relate to images.\n\t[3:31] What the image does on your listing.\n\t[5:40] The impact of images on Amazon PPC.\n\t[6:30] How you can tweak your images to track effectiveness over 7 to 10 days.\n\t[8:04] Best practices for images and things you can and can\u2019t include.\n\t[9:15] Amazon\u2019s guidelines.\n\t[12:20] Main images are different than additional images.\n\t[16:20] 7 tips for creating the best images.\n\t[17:29] Lighting is everything.\n\t[19:44] Use natural light (sunlight).\n\t[20:58] You have to use a great camera.\n\t[23:42] Pay attention to details (scratches, smudges,", "duration": "39:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS171.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1456736455, "title": "TAS 170 : How To Find NEW Product Suppliers to Expand Your Brand", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Welcome back to The Amazing Seller Podcast and thanks for checking out the show notes page for this great episode about product sourcing. In this great conversation I\u2019m talking with Peter Zapf, an employee of Global Sources, a company that works directly with Chinese and other Asian manufacturing companies to make their products available to retailers, ebayers, and Amazon sellers. We\u2019re going to take a deep dive into the process that Global Sources has put in place to enable to you to skip the middle man (agents) and talk directly to the supplier of the products you want to sell.\nHow is Global Sources different than Alibaba?\nGlobal Sources is a company that\u2019s been around for many, many years and today\u2019s guest, Peter Zapf has been working with the company for over 15 years. He tells us on this episode that the primary difference between Global Sources and other suppliers for the Asian manufacturing market is that GS works directly with the manufacturer - no agents involved at all. So if you were to search for a supplier for your product, you\u2019d be dealing with the actual company that makes it. You can see how that could cut down on the possibility of confusion when ordering customized aspects of your products. Listen in to this episode to find out how Peter suggest you best utilize the platform.\nHow does Global Sources work with test orders?\nToday's guest, Peter Zapf says that his company, Global Sources, is a great platform for working with manufacturers in Asia to find products that you can trust. Very much like Alibaba, Global Sources manufacturers enables you to order smaller quantities as a test order so that you can get to know the product quality and understand the process of each manufacturer that you contact. Peter suggests that you contact more than one manufacturer as you research your product ideas to make sure that you are getting the best deal and the best quality on the product. Hear about this new supplier that you may not of heard of before, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhat are the benefits of working directly with a product supplier? \nGlobal Sources is a China based company that works directly with Asian manufacturers to provide products for retailers and independent sellers. Their connections are with the manufacturers, not independent agents or agencies. That means that when you work with a supplier through Global Sources, you are able to work directly with the people who are creating the product you want. That makes modifications and customization much easier, and the communication process more smooth. Find out more benefits of working with a company like Global Sources on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nScams to watch out for when working with product suppliers.\nFor even experienced private label sellers, sending a large chunk of money to accompany across the ocean that you have never visited seems like a pretty sketchy deal. How can you be sure that you're not getting scammed? How can you be confident that you're going to receive the products that you are asking for? On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Peter Zapf, of Global Sources, tells some of the most common scams that he sees when it comes to ordering products from overseas vendors. You will be helped by the things he has to share, so be sure to listen. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode of the podcast!\n\t[2:01] Who Peter is and how he got started with Global Suppliers.\n\t[3:12] The history of Global Sources.\n\t[3:25] The differences between Global Sources and Alibaba.\n\t[4:57] The process you\u2019d go through on Global Sources to find a supplier.\n\t[6:05] How does the communication process work, and can test orders be done?\n\t[7:58] Can products be customized via Global Sources?\n\t[9:58] How do test orders typically work?\n\t[11:40] Minimum orders from Global Sources - the typical scenario.\n\t[12:16] Payment options with Global Sources manufacturers.", "duration": "51:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS170.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1456563639, "title": "TAS Bonus: Update \u2013 January Income and Lessons Learned", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It may sound strange to you to hear that Scott likes to share his exact costs, profits, and other numbers with anyone who listens to this podcast.

If you\u2019d like to submit a question for Scott to answer about your private label efforts on Amazon, you can submit your question by going to www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask - and let Scott know what you\u2019re having trouble with.\nMy manufacturer asked me a strange question about \u201cshipping marks.\u201d\nA listener to the podcast was working with her supplier to get the products shipped and the supplier asked her what \u201cshipping marks\u201d she could supply for the packaging. She\u2019s not sure what that really means so she turned to Scott to get his input. You\u2019re going to be surprised at the simple advice Scott has for this listener and how easy it might be for her to get this issue resolved, so be sure you listen to this episode in case you ever run into this issue with your supplier.\nAmazon assigns products their own barcode, so why do I need a UPC number for each product?\nThe issue of UPCs and Amazon assigned barcodes can be one of the most confusing things for new private label sellers. Why do you need a UPC if Amazon assigns its own? The simple answer is that Amazon requires you to have a unique UPC code for each of your products before you\u2019re able to create a listing for the product on the Amazon platform. So you\u2019ve got to do it. Period. Beyond that, Amazon does use its own barcode for internal and sales purposes. You can hear why this is the case and how it impacts your product selection and bundling of products on this episode.\nI understand why it\u2019s important for me to capture my customer\u2019s emails, but I\u2019m not sure how to do it.\nOnce you have people buying your products on Amazon you want to create a way to capture their email address. Why? So that you can market to them the next time you have a new or related product to sell. Those people who have already purchased from you are most likely to buy your new product. But how do you get those emails? What\u2019s the best system to follow in order to make it easy, and to do it within Amazon\u2019s terms of service? Scott\u2019s got an in depth answer for you on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nI\u2019m ready to decide on my first product. Should I select a product that has variations like size, color, or style?\nThere are so many options when it comes to selling products on Amazon through private label sales. How do you go about picking the right one with the right features. A listener to the podcast asks Scott if she should steer clear of products that have variations like size and color - and Scott recommends that she DOES steer clear of them for her first product. Do you know why he\u2019d say that?

It\u2019s a response to some of the most frequent myths Scott hears during the Q&amp;A of his private label workshops (they\u2019re free, by the way). Today Scott is not only going to tell you what these common myths are, but also WHY they are myths and what you can do to make sure that none of them happen to you. It\u2019s a practical episode with lots of great resources you can use today to make your private label business more successful. \nMYTH: Amazon is too saturated to get new products to take off.\nIt\u2019s true that there are more products appearing on Amazon every single day. But it\u2019s also true that more people are shopping on Amazon every day. The ratios of each are not the same by any stretch, but it\u2019s clear that Amazon is still a vibrant place for businesses to be built and profit to be made. Scott\u2019s got some very strong opinions on why people think Amazon is too saturated, and it has a lot to do with what they\u2019re expecting as they begin to build their business. Hear the entire response to this myth, on this episode.\nMYTH: It takes a lot of money to start an Amazon business?\nIf you had a lot of money to get started on an Amazon private label business, sure, you\u2019d be in much better shape from the beginning. But that\u2019s the case with any business venture. This myth is actually very foolish because it\u2019s very easy to get started on Amazon with little to no money. In fact, Scott\u2019s going to put you onto a case study that demonstrates that to be true. Be sure you listen to hear how Scott blows this myth right out of the water!\nMYTH: The flop of a first product means Amazon private label doesn\u2019t work.\nAny product idea can flop the first time and there are a number of reasons for it. Sometimes the person didn\u2019t follow the best practices for getting a product launched. In other words, they tried to shortcut the process. Other times the person didn\u2019t research the depth of the market well enough to ensure that their attempts had a good chance of success. As a result, they moved into a market that was too crowded for them to get a foothold. And there are more reasons products flop on the first try, but none of that means that Amazon doesn\u2019t work. Be sure to listen to Scott\u2019s product launching advice so you don\u2019t become one of the statistics.\nMYTH: Amazon PPC (pay per click) is too complicated and ineffective.\nIt\u2019s true that Amazon PPC is a bit complicated. But it\u2019s not so terrible that you can\u2019t learn it. It only takes time and experimentation to figure it out, and Scott\u2019s confident that anyone can do it. Once you understand the system and are able to begin using it, you\u2019ll find it to be extremely effective in helping you gain sales, which translate into a higher ranking for your product, and in turn, more organic sales coming to your listing.

(What To Look Out For)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "On this episode of the Amazing Seller podcast you\u2019re going to learn all about the power and importance of reviews on your Amazon products. Danny Brewer and Scott Voelker have a lot of experience soliciting and promoting reviews and both of them have tons to share about reviews and review groups and how they can help and hurt you when you\u2019re trying to get your products out to the world.\nWhat do reviews accomplish for your products?\nReviews are one of the most important parts of getting your product moved to the top of the page when someone searches for keywords related to your product. But there\u2019s not a direct correlation. Reviews encourage potential customers to buy your product. Why? Because it appears to be more legitimate, more trustworthy. It\u2019s THOSE sales that push your product higher in the organic search results. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear two experienced Amazon sellers chat about the right and wrong ways to go about getting reviews for your Amazon products.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest reason reviews are deleted by the Amazon powers?\nAmazon\u2019s policies require reviews to be posted within certain guidelines. If your reviewers are not following those guidelines, the reviews they leave will eventually be deleted, which is of no benefit to you. The main reason for deletions is that people who receive a product for free (through one of your promotions) in exchange for a review do not say so in their review. Amazon requires that. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear how you can encourage and even help you reviewers leave their response to your product without it being deleted.\nBe careful of the trolls that lurk in public review groups.\nWhen you post a free code for your product in an effort to promote it, you may get a great response. But consider what could happen (and often does). The people who see your free promo are not only potential customers, they could be potential competitors - and some of those competitors will do anything to hurt your sales, even buying your product using your promo, and leaving a bad review. It\u2019s something that happens and that you should be very leary of. Today\u2019s episode features some ideas you can put into place to make it where you don\u2019t have to use public groups.\nHow can you find good, quality places to ask for good reviews?\nDanny Brewer learned early on that promoting Amazon products with free or discounted coupons is problematic at best. Not only can trolls buy your product and give you bad reviews, people who are not serious about reviewing products can get in there, give you bad or lackluster reviews, and hurt your product in the end. Danny\u2019s got a group that he\u2019s been able to develop that is a powerful way to get quality reviews, and you can submit your products for consideration. The group doesn\u2019t accept every product, so know that going in.

This episode includes questions about handling returns through Amazon FBA, product categories as it relates to seller accounts, product selection tips, and customizable product offers. This episode is going to ramp up your ability to make your private label business rock!\nWhat happens when a customer returns one of my products?\nOne of the aspects of Amazon private label sales that is seldom talked about in depth is the issue of product returns. It\u2019s going to happen. You are going to have products returned either because they are broken in shipping or have some sort of flaw. What happens at Amazon when somebody returns one of your products and what can you do from there? Scott\u2019s going to walk you through every step of the process so you know what to do, on this episode.\nShould I keep all my products in the same categories?\nA listener has noticed that some Amazon sellers have their products listed in a variety of categories. She\u2019s wondering if there\u2019s any advantage to this, or if it\u2019s a waste of time. Scott\u2019s got a definite opinion about this and it all centers around the use of keywords and how they impact what a searching customer is going to find when they are looking for a product. There is some powerful food for thought in Scott\u2019s response to this question, so be sure you take some time to give it the thought it deserves.\nIs there any way to make a customizable offer to an Amazon seller?\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if you could offer your products in a customizable format of some kinds? A listener today asks if there is a way to make a custom offer to particular Amazon customers. While Scott\u2019s not sure exactly what will come of it, he chats a bit about a new Amazon program that\u2019s still in beta mode, called Amazon Custom.

This episode is all about finding product ideas. That\u2019s really the first and most important step to a successful private label selling business. You can\u2019t even hope to make a living doing Amazon sales if you don\u2019t have a product that people want to buy. So take this step seriously. Scott\u2019s got some great tips for you about how to find product ideas that you KNOW will sell. Be sure to listen. This one\u2019s full of great value.\nFirst, think about serving a market.\nYou want more than one product that sells on Amazon. You want a brand, a business. If you\u2019re going to build a line of products like every brand does, you need to think in terms of the overall market you\u2019re going to serve. Are they hunters? Knitters? Chefs? Parents? Athletes? Drill down even further. Is there a subset group within that market? The more specific you can get the more clearly you\u2019ll be able to discover specialty products that niche can use and will be willing to pay for. Think about the market and the wide variety of products they need and you\u2019ll be on your way to finding a successful product you can private label on Amazon.\nIf you want to find great products to sell, start with a daily \u201ctouch list.\u201d\nYou may have heard Scott talk about a \u201ctouch list\u201d before, but it bears repeating because it\u2019s so important. Everyday you touch thousands of things that you use to make your life work. Computers, clothes, toothbrushes, and more. Spend time over the next few days looking at everything you touch. Is there an item you use that\u2019s kind of unique? Interesting? Popular? Is there a way you could come up with a product idea centered around a product like that? Take the time to make a touch list and you won\u2019t be short of ideas for great products.\nYour hobbies or passions may be the very best place for you to find a product idea.\nThink about that one for a minute. If you\u2019re already passionate about something you\u2019ll know it better than most people. Start digging into those hobbies that you love so much to consider what items or products other people who like it would buy. Is there any way a product could be modified or tweaked to serve the market better? Is there something everyone wants but nobody can find? Do you see how this works? The more questions you ask about your hobbies the more you\u2019re going to be able to find product ideas that can really work. Listen to this episode to get more great ideas from Scott about how to make your hobbies and passions into a business.\nWhat have you purchased in the last 7 days?\nAsking yourself this one question - and making a list - is going to open your mind to the possibilities of things that people buy regularly, over and over, for the daily business of life. Those are the kinds of things that will help you get your mind going to find those products that can be consistent in their sales and demand. Don\u2019t be lazy and just try to think about it, write it down. Then expand your question to the last 30 days. You\u2019ll be amazed at all the ideas you come up with from this one simple exercise.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:25] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[0:39] How you can get transcripts of every episode and cheat sheets of certain episodes.\n\t[1:54] The one year anniversary of TAS!\n\t[3:59] An inspiration from the TAS Facebook group.\n\t[6:12] When Scott first started Amazon private label sales, there were no tools.\n\t[8:10] How to think about the market you\u2019re going to be serving.\n\t[9:15] Why service one particular market is vital.\n\t[17:00] Do your own personal \u201ctouch list.\u201d\n\t[18:20] Consider passions or hobbies you have.\n\t[21:24] Browse shopping sites and networks to get ideas.\n\t[22:50] Walk through the big box stores to get ideas.\n\t[24:50] Infomercials and TV shows.\n\t[27:40] Listen to what people are talking about.\n\t[29:27] Check out the magazine racks at the store.", "duration": "38:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS165.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1455526851, "title": "TAS 164 : How To Improve Your PPC Campaigns To Perform Better (my new secret weapon)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Pay Per Click on Amazon is one of the most difficult and time consuming things that run behind a successful Amazon sales business. And you can\u2019t do without it, it\u2019s what makes your private label products pop up on the first page of Amazon before you\u2019re able to get there through pure organic sales and recommendations. But how can you learn it and invest the time you need to in order to make it work without breaking the bank. On this episode, Scott Voelker and his guest, Ty Rooney, are talking about ways to amp up PPC campaigns on Amazon.\nStarting your Pay per click campaigns the smart way.\nThere\u2019s no reason the average person can\u2019t manage their own PPC campaigns wisely. But you\u2019ve got to get started in a smart way if you\u2019re going to receive the benefits your products need. How do you start smart? The first thing is to set up an \u201cauto\u201d campaign and a few manual campaigns, then let it run for a while. Most people start tweaking things too early, before they get enough data to make some wise decisions. So be sure you don\u2019t jump into the changes too soon. Hear how Scott Voelker and Ty Rooney think about PPC and what\u2019s working for them.\nWhat are you looking for in your PPC data?\nWhen you open the Amazon PPC dashboard after a week of letting it run on an auto campaign and a couple of manual campaigns, you\u2019re going to see a lot of numbers there. How do you know what to look for, and how do you know what those numbers mean? First, you\u2019re going to start at the top and look at every single keyword. Your goal is to find the keywords that are getting the actual traffic to your product. Those keywords (and possible variations of them) will be the ones you\u2019ll want to focus on as you adjust things. It\u2019s way too complicated to explain here, so make sure you listen!\nThe new \u201cBid Plus\u201d feature in Amazon PPC is here!\nIt was only a few months ago that Amazon provided some new features to the PPC dashboard that have made it a much more usable and powerful tool to drive traffic to your products. But now they\u2019ve added another feature, called \u201cBid Plus.\u201d What is it? We\u2019re not exactly clear on that yet, but the first looks into it are promising. You can hear what Scott Voelker and Ty Rooney think about the feature and the other adjustments that Amazon is making to their platform all the time, on this episode.\nYou can be part of a special \u201cbeta program\u201d that Ty Rooney has created to manage your PPC campaigns for you!\nIt\u2019s official. Ty and Scott have been working together to figure out a way to handle the intricacies and headaches of Amazon Pay Per Click for clients. It\u2019s a great idea and they are hoping it will be a great service as well. Ty\u2019s announcing it on this episode and giving you the opportunity to be a part of the beta launch group.

Welcome! We\u2019re so glad to have you here for another episode of The Amazing Seller podcast. This is a Friday episode - an \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode that answers your Amazon sales questions each week. If you want to get your questions answered, you can submit them for consideration by going to www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask - and your question will be in the cue. So sit back, grab your pen and paper, and make sure you take good notes because you want to be sure you\u2019re able to take action on what you learn!\nShould I start Amazon sales with clothing as my first product?\nEveryone needs clothes. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But does a large demand for a product make it a good fit for you? Not necessarily. Clothing, for example, is a VERY saturated market. There are so many companies offering similar products that putting out a new product yourself will be an uphill battle at best. Besides that, there\u2019s the issue of variations and sizing. It\u2019s likely that clothing will be returned far more often than other items. Listen to Scott\u2019s thoughts about whether you should choose clothing for a product line, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nI want to offer a product that is very similar to a patented product. Should I move ahead?\nPatents are something you don\u2019t want to play around with. The legal trouble you could get into is more than you are prepared to face - trust us. But it is important to understand exactly what a patent is and what it means if a product is patented. A patent says that \u201csomething\u201d about a product is unique and that company has the rights to use that \u201csomething,\u201d but not necessarily the entire product. The patent might cover a particular style of grip, for example. So you could offer a similar product, just not one with the same grip. Scott\u2019s got some great insights on this episode so make sure you take the time to \u00a0hear what he\u2019s got to say on this one.\nI just learned about the Chinese New Year break. Is this going to keep me from getting my product restocked?\nYou heard right. New Year celebrations in China are a huge deal, so huge in fact that the working force typically takes off work for 2 weeks or more to celebrate. What does that mean for your inventory and product ordering? It means you\u2019ve got to think ahead. You\u2019ve got to plan ahead. You can use previous sales to estimate how many products you\u2019ll need to last you through a time like Chinese new year, and you should. Scott tells his experience and approach to these kinds of inventory issues on this episode, so be sure to listen.\nAll these numbers: Barcodes, UPC, AISN - what are they and when do I need them?\nYes, there are lots of little codes and acronyms that you\u2019ll have to learn if you\u2019re going to do private label sales on Amazon. But once you know what each of them is and when they are used, it\u2019s really not that hard. On this episode a listener asks Scott to explain all the codes and acronyms and in characteristic style, Scott gives a very thorough and helpful answer. You can learn this \u201cnewbie\u201d issue too by listening to this podcast episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:25] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[0:42] Why Scott got goosebumps from one of his listeners who submitted a question on today\u2019s show.\n\t[1:51] How you can get your transcripts of Scott\u2019s episodes.\n\t[2:40] Don\u2019t let perfection get in the way of progress.\n\t[4:10] QUESTION 1: A question about clothing as a product: dealing with varieties, returns, etc.\n\t[11:41] QUESTION 2: A question about patents and the possibilities of violating patents.\n\t[19:44] QUESTION 3: How does the Chinese New Year impact your inventory?\n\t[26:48] QUESTION 4: What is the difference between a barcode, a FNSKU, and a ASIN?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 163\nTAS 163 : Ask Scott Session #46 - Amazon FBA Questions\n[00:00:03] SV: Hey, hey.

What\u2019s up everybody! It\u2019s wonderful to have you back on another episode of The Amazing Seller. On today\u2019s show, Scott has invited his buddy, Chris Shaffer to join him for a very special, first time experience. Scott and Chris are going to be doing what Scott\u2019s come to refer to as a \u201chot seat.\u201d They\u2019re going to take a real product, sold by a real TAS community member, and are going to evaluate the strategies being used to sell the product. This is the same format Scott\u2019s going to do at an upcoming live event in Denver, Colorado, so listen in to get a taste for how this event could benefit YOUR product sales.\nThe product is live, the listing is good, but it\u2019s not selling very well.\nToday\u2019 Scott Voelker is doing a \u201chot seat\u201d where he and Chris Shaffer are evaluation a real \u00a0Amazon product to help increase sales. Ebony has submitted her product for evaluation because she\u2019s got plenty of reviews, a good product listing, and can get to page 1 with PPC, but the minute she stops doing Pay Per Click campaigns, the product drops to page 3 or worse. What should she do? Scott and Chris have some very helpful insights for Ebony that are likely to help you do it right the first time, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nConsider seasonal products a second time.\nOn this \u201chot seat\u201d session of the Amazing Seller, Scott and his friend Chris Shaffer are evaluating a product that isn\u2019t selling very well in hopes that they can increase its ranking on Amazon and increase sales. As they look it over, it\u2019s clear that this is a seasonal product, which is not entirely bad, but it\u2019s also not a product you can expect to have consistent sales all year round, which would be very nice, wouldn\u2019t you say? So when you\u2019re thinking about selling a seasonal product, you might want to think again before you pull the trigger. Or, you may want to consider other products you could offer to fill in the gap during the down times.\nDepth of market is the HUGE issue for most products that don\u2019t sell as expected.\nWhen Scott Voelker talks about product research, one of the terms you\u2019ll hear him use over and over is \u201cdepth of market.\u201d What does he mean? He\u2019s talking about determining whether or not there is actually \u201croom\u201d in a particular product market for you to introduce another of the same type of thing and legitimately expect that you\u2019ll be able to gain a significant foothold. If you don\u2019t do your market research well and for a long enough period of time, you may be setting yourself up for frustration. On this episode Scott and his friend Chris Shaffer give a good amount of time to the process of market research, so make sure you listen so you can understand how to do it the right way!\nWhat kind of 2nd product should you offer?\nToday\u2019s \u201chot seat\u201d participant has a product that isn\u2019t selling as well as she\u2019d hoped. One of the solutions to the issue may be to offer a second product to her offerings. That way she could either bundle it with her original product to offer a completely new product, or she could choose a product that offsets the down-time of her original product, which is seasonal. Scott\u2019s got some good insights into how you should think about the process of choosing a second product, and he\u2019s going to share it with you on this episode, so be sure to listen! \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:25] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[1:20] Scott\u2019s first \u201cHot Seat\u201d session, featuring a real Amazon seller and his friend,.

Scott loves to hear from people who have been doing Amazon private label sales for some time and one of those people he\u2019s chatted with before is Greg Mercer, creator of Jungle Scout and Amazon seller himself. This conversation is a bit of an update to a previous episode (Episode 56), where Greg and Scott share their current tips about choosing products, launching, and the lessons they\u2019ve learned over the years.\nGreg Mercer\u2019s criteria for good products to sell on Amazon\nThere are some common sense things you should be aware of when choosing products to sell on Amazon. Many people don\u2019t think of these but would be hugely benefitted if they did. Here they are: Smaller products that weigh less than a pound - this keeps your shipping costs and fees lower. Nothing that can be easily broken in shipping or by use (that means electronics among other things). There\u2019s really many more than we can cover in a short paragraph so be sure you take the time to listen to this value packed episode.\nYou\u2019ve got to know how to research the depth of product markets to sell successfully.\nYou hear Scott talk about this issue quite often. It\u2019s the role that depth of market plays in discovering if you have indeed found a true opportunity in a particular market. On this episode of the Amazing Seller Scott and his guest, Greg Mercer, go into quite a bit of detail about how each of them does market research, why it\u2019s important, and the pitfalls you can avoid if you do this step the right way. Get ready to take some notes because these guys unpack it all the way!\nOnce you start ranking on Amazon you\u2019ve got to keep your products near the top.\nIt\u2019s one thing to enter a new market with your brand new product. It\u2019s an exciting thing when you start to see your product sell. It\u2019s even more exciting when you find your sales pushing your product toward the top of the search rankings. But how can you keep it there? That\u2019s one of the many things Scott Voelker and Greg Mercer talk about on this episode of the Amazing Seller. They\u2019re going to cover reviews, PPC (pay per click), and product sales, in depth. You won\u2019t want to miss this one.\nJungle Scout: One of the best Amazon Private Label research tools out there!\nWhen Scott first started selling on Amazon there was no software available to help with product and market research. He literally created a spreadsheet and tracked things day after day after day to find out what he needed to know.

That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to hear on this episode\u2026 real Amazon sellers or potential private label sellers who are just like you, asking questions about the way forward into Amazon sales. Scott answers them honestly, from his experience and from what he\u2019s learned relating to other successful Amazon sellers and running his own business. If you want to ask your own question, you can do that by going to www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask\nI\u2019ve only got $1,000 to get started with. How would you stretch that money as far as possible if you were beginning again?\nThere are many ways you can get started with building your own business by selling on Amazon. Scott\u2019s not so arrogant as to think that there\u2019s only one answer to the question. But some of the things he recommends are these: retail arbitrage as a way in and a way to get started - and you can do it today! From there you could move toward finding lower priced products on Alibaba or Ali Express to head toward private label sales. In all of this there are a variety of things you can do to trim costs, so be sure you listen to this episode to get the full picture of what Scott advises.\nMy products are running out of stock. What should I do to address this?\nIt\u2019s a great problem to have when your products are selling at such a rate that you\u2019re running out of stock before you can get more products in from your supplier. What should you do? Well the first issue you need to look at is your price. Is it possible that your product is prices way too low for the market? In response to this question Scott\u2019s not only going to share a smart way to start increasing your price to discover your ideal price point, he\u2019s also going to give you some other strategies for managing your inventory and keeping products in stock at all times.\nYou used to use Feedback Genius but have switched to Salesbacker. Can you tell me why you switched and what the differences are?\nThis listener is correct. Scott used to use and promote Feedback Genius in the early days of his Amazon private label sales business, but he\u2019s made the switch to a different piece of software, Salesbacker. On today\u2019s episode a listener asks what the differences are between the two and why Scott made the switch. Scott\u2019s answer has more detail than we can cover here (so you should listen to his response), but the main reason is that Salesbacker was created for specific use with Amazon private label sales. The features and functions are specifically designed to give sellers exactly what they need in a variety of ways.

It\u2019s how Amazon knows what you have to sell. It\u2019s now customers find your products. It\u2019s how you drive traffic through PPC and organic search. Knowing that, it should be clear how important keywords are to the product listings you place on the Amazon platform. On this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott is going to share 7 tips to find and use the best keywords for your product, and he\u2019s also going to share some bonus tips for you regarding exactly what you should do with those keywords once you find them.\nHow would YOU search for your product?\nToo often Amazon sellers forget that the reason keywords are important is because it\u2019s the main things searchers use to find the products they are looking for. That means that the best way to approach keyword research is to get inside the heads of your ideal customer. What would THEY be searching for if they were looking for your product? You can start answering that question by asking YOURSELF what you\u2019d search for if you were trying to find it. Then expand your question to your spouse, your friends, your coworkers. There\u2019s no better way to find relevant search terms and keywords than to ask real live people. Get more great tips like this, on this episode.\nDid you know that Amazon will GIVE you the keywords you should pursue?\nMost people don\u2019t think of it in those terms, but really, Amazon will give you its most searched keywords. How? Begin typing your primary keywords into the Amazon search field as if you were a customer searching for that product. You\u2019ll notice that once you complete the word and hit the spacebar (like you were going to add another word), a list of search terms will be suggested to you. THOSE are additional keyword ideas that Amazon is telling you are commonly searched for surrounding your primary keyword. You\u2019d be foolish not to use those in your PPC and listing optimization. Scott\u2019s got lots more tips like this to share, on this episode.\nGoogle search is still a great place to get keyword ideas.\nWhen you search for anything on Google, you\u2019ll notice two things if you pay attention. #1 - Google fills in your search box with suggestions as you search. Those suggestions are searches that other people have made using the same words you\u2019re using. Write those down. #2 - Once you enter your search terms and hit \u201creturn,\u201d you\u2019ll notice that there is a list of \u201crelated\u201d searches at the bottom of the first page. You should write those down as well. All of the things listed there are actual searches that have been done for the keywords you\u2019re targeting. Take a few minutes to listen to this episode and learn even more simple ways you can find the keywords you need to include in your Amazon product listings and PPC campaigns.\nDo you know HOW you should use the keywords you discover?\nIt\u2019s one thing to find a bunch of great and unique keywords for your product. But do you know what to do with them once you have them? It\u2019s not as simple as cramming your product title and listing full of them. There are certain ways to use them, particular places to put them that bring you the most bang for your buck. That\u2019s what you want to do rather than waste the space you have on your listing with unneeded keywords. On this episode, Scott walks through some \u201cbonus\u201d tips about using keywords in the right places and at the right frequency. That section alone is worth the time it takes you to listen to this episode.\n\n\n\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:04] Scott\u2019s introduction to the podcast!\n\t[2:03] Shout out to the TAS Facebook community.\n\t[3:50] How would you search for your product?\n\t[6:17] Looking at your competitor\u2019s listings to see what they are using for keywords?\n\t[8:32] Use Amazon\u2019s suggested keyword suggestions.\n\t[11:00] How to use Google search and Google\u2019s keyword planner.\n\t[15:14] Use Merchant Words software.\n\t[17:29] Using Google Trends.", "duration": "32:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS159.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1454317214, "title": "TAS 158 : When and How to Build an Authority Website for Your Brand with Jon Haver", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Many new private label sellers feel overwhelmed right from the start. There truly IS a lot to learn and a lot to do in order to build an Amazon sales business that truly thrives. For that reason, Scott wants you to know that the topic for this episode is one you DON\u2019T have to do right away. This is for down the line, when you\u2019re products are already on Amazon, your brand is already solid, and your sales are going well. THEN, you may want to consider building an authority website for your brand. What IS an authority website? You\u2019ll learn all the details in answer to that question on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOK, what IS an authority website?\nAn authority website is a website built to teach, share, or promote expert level content on a specific topic or niche. It\u2019s a go-to source for information about that issue. A site of this nature typically consists of various pages about the basics of the issue, and a blog that provides ongoing posts about the subject. A good authority site truly has useful content that people find helpful for their lives. How does creating an authority website benefit your Amazon private label business? Today\u2019s guest, Jon Haver, is going to walk you through that question and give you an idea of what it takes to build your own authority website.\nThe first step: Getting a site built that can get you approved in Amazon\u2019s brand registry.\nAmazon\u2019s Brand Registry is one way that the Amazon powers attempt to verify that the products being sold on their platform are legitimate, and being sold by real businesses. Anyone can register with the brand registry and it\u2019s free to do so. The benefit to you is to verify that your products belong to you, which could help if you find your products being hijacked in the future. One of the significant things needed to apply to the brand registry is an independent website that lists your product and company. In this episode, Jon Haver is going to walk you through the basics of what is needed on that website so that Amazon will approve your application to be included in its brand registry.\nThe power of building an email list through your company website.\nOne of the greatest advantages to building a website associated with your Amazon products is the ability to secure email addresses for people who are interested in your products. Why is this such an important tool? Because it enables you to send promotions and announcements about your product directly to people who have already expressed an interest in your products. Naturally, your sales conversion rate will be higher when you\u2019re selling to people who already like what you have to sell. On this episode Jon Haver shares how he\u2019s used an email list on his own authority sites to get great sales upon the release of new products, so much so that he didn\u2019t have to do much in the way of paid promotions through Amazon PPC.\nThey key to a successful authority site.\nJon Haver has built many authority sites and feels that he\u2019s got a pretty good handle on what it takes to make one successful. His philosophy is very simple. Create quality content, consistently, and your authority site will eventually rank as an authority in Google. The reason he\u2019s so confident about this approach is not only because he\u2019s seen it work, but because it\u2019s consistent with the way Google works in the first place. Google (and other search engines) are looking for great content to provide to searchers, so giving Google that content is the main part of what you need to do.

If you\u2019re a seasoned Vet at private label sales, or brand new, chances are that you\u2019re going to hear a question on these Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episodes that helps you move your Amazon business forward. And if you\u2019d like to ask your own question, Scott\u2019s going to tell you how you can do that on this episode, so be sure to listen.\nHave you heard of Scott\u2019s \u201c999 Method\u201d of tracking your competitor\u2019s sales?\nA listener wants to know if there is a way he can estimate how much of a product is being sold by one of his competitors. There are all kinds of reasons you might want to do that, and Scott walks through them briefly on this episode. But he also points out two ways you can do that very thing, one using software (Jungle Scout) and another that you can do on your own, over a period of just a few days, and it will cost you nothing. Scott calls it the \u201c999 method\u201d and you\u2019ll find out how you can do it, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nI hear you talk about waiting for UPS to pick up some of your items. How do you get a UPS account and how much does it cost?\nWhen the time comes to ship your products to Amazon\u2019s warehouse, there are a couple of ways you can do it. First, you can load up the boxes in your car and drive them down to your nearest UPS store or packaging store and let them take it from there. Or, you can have UPS come to your house and pick up the products. If you\u2019re only shipping one box, it may be a bit too costly to have them come to your house, but if you have multiple boxes, it may be the most cost effective. Hear Scott\u2019s explanation of this simple task, on this episode.\nI\u2019m about to start using Amazon PPC. What kind of conversions am I looking for to know if I\u2019ve got a good campaign going?\nOne of the most confusing parts of promoting your private label products on Amazon is learning how to build and manage effective pay per click campaigns. A listener who is just starting out on PPC asked what kind of conversion numbers she should be looking for from a campaign, and even though the variables are many, Scott\u2019s got a general guideline that he suggests any Amazon seller should look for. He\u2019s also going to explain what those numbers mean for you and your product sales.\nDo you know how to dial in your Amazon PPC campaigns to be the most effective?\nNo matter how cool or beneficial your private label product is, you\u2019ve got to get people to your product page before you\u2019re going to make much profit selling it. That\u2019s where Amazon PPC comes in (pay per click). It\u2019s Amazon\u2019s tool for placing advertising on a customer\u2019s search results page that has to do with the items they are searching for\u2026 and it\u2019s YOUR way to get your products seen by people who are looking for exactly what you\u2019re selling.

It\u2019s nice when that happens, but the truth is that it doesn\u2019t happen very often. There\u2019s lot of hard work required to get to the point that truly significant profit is coming in\u2026 that\u2019s because most people don\u2019t take into account the product costs, FBA fees, advertising costs, and other variables that bite into your profit margins. On this episode Scott reveals his December 2015 numbers, sales and costs, so you can get a realistic picture of what a successful Amazon business is really like.\nThe 4th quarter was not the outstanding success for Scott that some sellers experienced.\nMost of the buzz in the Amazon sales community is that the 4th quarter is a time of incredible income and sales. The reason for the expectation is that Christmas (gift giving) is part of that time frame. While it is true that retail sales are generally much higher than normal, the 4th quarter is not that way for everyone. Scott\u2019s one of those people. Why wasn\u2019t it a big gain for him? The reason is very simple\u2026 and one Scott intended. What? Why would he intend to make less sales during the 4th quarter? Listen to this episode to find out his well reasoned purpose behind it.\nOne of the effects of competition in your niche.\nWhen Scott first started his Amazon business in the fall of 2014, he got into a niche that didn\u2019t have much competition. His products were seeing $10 to #12 margins regularly at that time. But as time has gone by more sellers have entered that niche area. As a result, the competition has become as much about pricing as anything else. What happens in that case? Everyone starts dropping their prices in an effort to get the lion\u2019s share of the market, which isn\u2019t really very good for anyone. Scott\u2019s margins have dropped significantly since then. On this episode Scott talks for a good while about the dynamics of pricing wars and what you can do to protect yourself (and your private label products).\nWhy Scott believes it\u2019s good to have a number of unique products for sale simultaneously.\nIt\u2019s always better to NOT have all your eggs in one basket. Not only are you vulnerable to greater loss when your income is dependent on one product line, you\u2019re also not enjoying the stability that can come from having multiple products. Why stability? Because the down trends in one niche will likely be offset by the \u201cup\u201d trends of products in another niche at any given time. That means your overall income is less of a roller coaster and more of a gentle incline. Scott\u2019s got some intriguing thoughts on this subject and shares what he\u2019s doing to expand his products on Amazon, so be sure you listen.\nIt\u2019s easy to get discouraged when you\u2019re selling private label on Amazon.\nAlmost every week in the TAS Facebook community somebody shares a screenshot of their product sales. It\u2019s not uncommon to see $20K months, $30K months, and even more. It\u2019s fine to have that as an ambition, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind so that you don\u2019t become discouraged that your product sales are not at those levels. #1 - Those numbers don\u2019t show all the fees and costs associated with making the sales. The actual profit is much less than those numbers. #2 - The people who are getting those kinds of sales have likely been working at it for a good deal of time. You can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t expect your sales to match theirs right off the bat.

That means Amazon makes the rules, and man, do they set the rules! There are all kinds of guidelines and rules that govern how you list your products and a host of other things. You want to make sure you\u2019re doing things right. Amazon is not shy about banning people from their sales platform for breaking the rules. Recently, some changes are happening within those rules, and they\u2019re things you need to know about if you\u2019re going to stay within the guidelines. Today\u2019s episode features Karon Thackston, an Amazon listings copywriter whose business creates done-for-you Amazon listings for sellers. She\u2019s got the low down on all the changes, so make sure you listen. \nRolling it out changes a little bit at a time.\nKaron Thackston and her team deal with Amazon listings all day, every day. It\u2019s their job to write incredible product descriptions and copy for Amazon sellers. As part of her role she interacts with seller support technicians often. Lately, she\u2019s struck up a relationship with a support guy named Peter who\u2019s been helping her address some of the inconsistencies within Amazon\u2019s rules and system. Many of the changes we\u2019re beginning to see are a result of these interactions. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear how Amazon is rolling out small changes in certain product categories and how they might wind up being added to other categories as well. \nWhy do some product listings have images in their descriptions but I can\u2019t put them in mine?\nListing your products on Amazon means that you have to play by Amazon\u2019s rules. One of those rules has to do with the way product listings are formatted. Up until this point, basic Amazon sellers are not allowed to put images within their listings. But you still see images in some listings. That\u2019s because Amazon extends special privileges to big name brands and what they call A+ sellers, as well as their own Amazon branded listings. It\u2019s somewhat of an unfair advantage those companies have, but again, it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s rules that govern the listings.\nCharacter restrictions for bullet points in your product listing have changed!\nPreviously, bullet points could only be so long, but Amazon has increased those (in certain categories) to 200 characters. Now your bullet points can be longer. But don\u2019t get too excited. Today\u2019s guest, Karon Thackston recommends that you not overstuff your bullet points with unneeded words and descriptions. She believes it will actually detract from your listing and cause shoppers to click away. Find out why she thinks so on this great interview episode of the Amazing Seller.\nEntering your keywords on the Amazon backend is not as simple as it may look.\nThere can be lots of confusion about what format your keywords should be in when you enter them in your product description. Should they be comma separated? What about spacing? Should I include multi-word keywords? These and other issues are very important because the Amazon software handles each of them differently. Karon Thackston is on the show today to clearly define these keyword issues to help you get your products seen and purchased. You\u2019ll want to hear this one, for sure. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Scott\u2019s introduction of his guest, Karon Thackston.\n\t[1:49] Overview of what we\u2019ll be talking about today.\n\t[2:00] Your invite to Scott\u2019s live Q&amp;A workshop online.\n\t[3:55] The new changes to the Amazon listings guidelines.\n\t[8:00] Changes to formatting that are likely to roll out across all categories.\n\t[11:00] Why some listings have images in the product descriptions and why you SHOULDN\u2019T do it.\n\t[12:35] The top conversion tips for Amazon product listings.\n\t[16:16] Character limit changes for titles and bullets (in some categories).\n\t[18:55] Additional dos and don'ts for the title.\n\t[23:21] What if your competitor is breaking rules?

It\u2019s coming up soon in Denver, Colorado and the space is limited due to the type of event it is. You can find out how to get yourself on the list to attend that live event by listening to this episode!\nThe Amazon stats dashboard is not all that great. Any suggestions for finding daily product stats?\nA listener is a bit frustrated by the lack of usability of the Amazon stats dashboard inside his seller account. Scott agrees, the Amazon dashboard is not exactly user friendly. He\u2019s got a great little hack to help you discover your daily product sales rather than seeing only the total sales of all their products. You\u2019ll want to know how to do this, especially once you have more than one product in your Amazon lineup. Get all the details on this Q&amp;A episode.\nWhen should I promote my seasonal product?\nA listener called in with a question about his seasonal product. It\u2019s based around students, so the time of year it will likely sell more is right around the middle of August or the end of September when school is starting up. He wants to get his products ready and his listing live, but isn\u2019t sure when he should begin promoting the product using Amazon PPC (pay per click) to drive traffic to the product. Scott loves the question and has a very specific answer for this listener, so be sure you check out what he\u2019s got to say.\nOnce my products got to Amazon, the MSKU changed? How can I correct the problem?\nA caller just shipped in his first set of products in two different boxes. When the boxes arrived they were checked in to the Amazon system, he can see that from his seller dashboard. Since both boxes were identical products with the same SKU numbers, they should look identical in the Amazon dashboard, but they don\u2019t. One has a different MSKU number assigned to it and he\u2019s being told that it\u2019s a problem that he needs to fix. What\u2019s he supposed to do? Scott\u2019s got a simple solution for the guy, so be sure you listen to find out what he suggests. \nCould my product idea be too soft? There\u2019s not many products or reviews.\nA listener who\u2019s been doing retail arbitrage on Amazon is considering giving private label sales a try. He\u2019s doing his product research and has found a product in the \u201chobbies and sports\u201d category that he thinks might be a good one. But there are very few other products in the niche, none that have many reviews, and the sales rank is only average. He\u2019s curious if the market for this product on Amazon is too soft, or if it\u2019s a winner waiting to happen.

But is it really all that risky or bad? On this episode Scott wants to address some questions he\u2019s been getting about the wisdom of getting involved in a partnership for an Amazon business. There are pros and cons and you need to be aware of all of them going in. So take some time to listen to this episode, even if you\u2019re not considering a partnership. You never know what\u2019s going to be on your radar sometime down the road.\nThe first question you want to ask yourself about a partnership possibility.\nA partnership may sound very tempting for a variety of reasons. But you need to go into it with your eyes wide open. The very first question you need to honestly ask yourself is the very simple \u201cwhy.\u201d Why do you want to go into a partnership. Are the reasons you\u2019re considering a partnership important enough? Will those reasons sustain you throughout the course of your partnership? There\u2019s lots of difficult decisions down the road that you may not be aware of, IF you\u2019re not aware of the possibility ahead of time. That\u2019s what this episode is all about, so be sure you listen.\nWhat are the advantages of entering into a business partnership?\nThere are many advantages to partnerships, and Scott covers three of the biggest ones on this episode. One of the most obvious is if your partner is bringing in the cash to get your product purchased, advertised, and online to make profits. Clearly, if you\u2019re struggling to get started, that\u2019s a huge plus. You can also share the load of work and planning. But there are some disadvantages too, so be sure you take the time to listen to what Scott\u2019s got to share on this episode.\nWhat are the disadvantages of a business partnership?\nIt\u2019s clear that one of the biggest disadvantages of a partnership is that you have someone else\u2019s opinion and concerns to consider in every situation. You can\u2019t go out and make decisions on the business the way that you think is best without discussing it with your partner. It\u2019s like a marriage. You need to be willing to operate together in a way that is beneficial for both of you. Beyond that, you\u2019ll have to share the profits, so the income opportunity is cut in half and as a result you\u2019ll have to wait longer to see the personal benefit of your Amazon business. Listen in to this episode to hear the whole list of things to consider about partnership possibilities.\nThe three different types of partnerships.\nPartnerships are not all the same. There are at least three different ways you could be involved in a partnership. Some allow both partners to have a say in the business activities and directions, others do not. How do you know which type is best for your situation? What are the pitfalls of each that you should watch out for? On this episode of the Amazing Seller, Scott is going to walk you through all three types of partnerships and give you tangible examples of how each one would work. If you\u2019re going to step into a partnership, Scott wants you to do it with your eyes wide open. \nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:03] \u00a0Scott\u2019s welcome to this episode about partnerships.\n\t[1:00] How you can get into Scott\u2019s Free Workshop!\n\t[2:10] The first question to ask yourself when considering a partnership - Why?\n\t[2:30] Advantages to partnerships: reasons why you\u2019d want to get into one.\n\t[11:53] The disadvantages of a partnership.\n\t[21:02] The three types of partnerships.\n\t[24:30] Making the decision in light of what you know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT TAS 153\nTAS 153 : 3 Things You NEED to Know about Partnerships (The Good and Bad)\n[00:00:03] SV: Well, hey hey.

It\u2019s called hijacking and can be a very serious problem. Scott\u2019s addressed this issue in a handful of episodes lately and today he\u2019s chatting with an attorney, Ted Limus, who\u2019s helped some clients of his take on hijackers and get them off the product listings. Scott\u2019s got lots of questions for Ted about best practices for addressing this important issue in an effective way. Be sure you listen to get some great tips for handling hijackers.\nThe \u201cramp up\u201d strategy this attorney uses to address product hijacking.\nAttorney Ted Luymes has discovered that the best way to approach the hijacking of one of his client\u2019s listings is to start with the least threatening approach first, then escalate things as needed. He begins with a simple and kind email to the hijacker, asking them to do the right thing. The assumption is that the person on the other end of the communication has made a mistake and is giving them the benefit of the doubt. It\u2019s a kinder, gentler way to approach the issue that gets results 50% of the time. You can hear how Ted escalates the process from there, on this episode.\nYou can write your own cease and desist letter.\nA Cease and Desist letter is simply a documented correspondence that you send to a person who is breaking Amazon\u2019s product listing rules, notifying them that you are aware of their infraction and that you are warning them that they must stop their activity on the listing or else you will take legal action. It\u2019s fine for you to write your own C&amp;D letter, but there are certain things you need to make sure you do in that letter to keep yourself out of legal trouble. On this episode, attorney Ted Luymes shares the basics of what can and should not go into a cease and desist letter, so be sure to listen.\nIs a Trademark really necessary?\nToday\u2019s guest, attorney Ted Luymes, recommends that Amazon sellers who are making a decent profit on their product sales consider going through the process of registering a Trademark for their brand name. Doing so gives you a very strong legal footing, should a hijacker try to take over your listings. Amazon is much more likely to take action against a hijacker if you can easily prove your ownership of your brand through a trademark. But it\u2019s important to note that you aren\u2019t required by anyone to get a trademark, it\u2019s just a good idea. Hear Ted speak to the process of securing a trademark and what to expect as a benefit, on this episode.\nThe best prevention against hijackers.\nIf you want to keep hijackers from taking over your product listings, there are some specific things you can do to make it less likely that your products will be targeted. First off, make sure your product is unique. Logos on the product, specialized packaging, combinations of unique products into bundles, and many other things can help. On this episode Ted Luymes also shares something you can do with your product listing to inform your buyers of a way that they can watch for counterfeit products masquerading as yours. You can get those details by listening to this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Introduction of the topic and guest, Ted Luymes, attorney.\n\t[2:03] How you can attend one of Scott\u2019s free workshops.\n\t[2:45] An upcoming event in Denver, Colorado on May 1st - Limited space!\n\t[5:02] What is product hijacking?\n\t[6:12] How Ted got into helping Amazon sellers with hijacking issues.\n\t[9:59] Ted\u2019s \u201cramp up\u201d strategy.\n\t[14:00] A kind approach is the first step.. and how it works 50% of the time.\n\t[18:20] The next step: Cease and Desist.\n\t[20:20] Tips for using a cease and desist letter.\n\t[23:00] The next step: Following Amazon\u2019s process for disputing an issue.\n\t[27:57] The process of following Amazon\u2019s process.\n\t[30:46] Dealing with counterfeit situations.\n\t[33:30] Why bundling,", "duration": "51:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS152.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1452848450, "title": "TAS 151 : Ask Scott Session #42 \u2013 FBA Amazon Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Today\u2019s show starts out with a great testimonial from a TAS listener who\u2019s rocking it on Amazon with private label sales. It\u2019s proof not only that this show is helping people take action every day, but also that Amazon private label sales is the real deal! You CAN make more than just a decent living, you can make a VERY NICE living selling on Amazon. This is the podcast that teaches you how to do it, step by step. Nothing is held back. Nothing is hidden. This particular episode is the weekly \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode where you can ask your own private label questions. You\u2019ll learn a lot from listening to these Friday episodes, so sit back, grab a pen and paper, and get ready to take notes because you\u2019re going to learn a ton about Amazon Private Label.\nWhat is the easiest way to figure out taxes and customs on imported products?\nOne of the places new Amazon sellers often make mistakes is in cutting their margins too close. One of the main things that goes into figuring out those margins is the \u201ccost\u201d of doing business. What goes into that cost? Lots of things: taxes, Amazon fees, shipping, customs fees, etc. On today\u2019s episode a listener is trying to understand those margins before hand (a very smart idea) and asks Scott how he goes about determining the costs of his import fees and duties when importing products from China. You\u2019ll learn a ton from Scott\u2019s answer.\nWhat determines your pricing changes throughout the year?\nPricing is one of the most undefinable things in building an Amazon private label business. How do you determine a good price? Does that price stay the same throughout the year? If it changes, when should you make those changes, and why? None of these question has easy answers and no one answer will fit all businesses and products. But there are some general approaches to pricing that prove to be helpful for most people. On this episode, Scott\u2019s asked about how he prices his products and he shares a handful of helpful principles and tactics that most Amazon sellers find work most of the time.\nI bought an Amazon business with 4 existing product lines. How should I proceed?\nWow, this listener has his work cut out for him. He bought an existing Amazon private label business that has 4 different product lines already on the Amazon catalogue. How should he proceed? It\u2019s a great question, and Scott\u2019s answer centers around discovering which of those product lines will get the biggest bang for the buck. He walks through how he\u2019d go about doing that on this episode, so be sure to listen - you\u2019ll learn a lot!\nDo you use product management software?\nA listener asks Scott if he uses any product management software to keep his product lines, vendors, invoicing, etc. straight. Scott\u2019s simple answer? No. Scott doesn\u2019t have anything against project management software but he finds that given what he\u2019s doing, there\u2019s only one tool that he needs to keep all of the things for his private label business organized: Google Drive and it\u2019s suite of tools.

But that is seldom true. Most people who are very successful got to that point because of determination, a positive, can-do mindset, and hard work. That kind of mindset doesn\u2019t come naturally for most people. We tend to let discouragement, difficulties, and missed opportunities sidetrack us from the goals we desire to reach. In this episode, Scott\u2019s going to talk about the importance of mindset, surrounding yourself with the right people, and how each of those things impact your success in Amazon sales, and in life.\nWhat kind of mindset do you have?\nIs it a positive, can-do mindset, or is it pessimistic one? Your mindset is one of the things about you that most determines your level of accomplishment, success, and happiness. And the good news is that it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s well within your control to change. It\u2019s not always easy to change\u2026 in fact it can be quite hard, but it\u2019s a change that will revolutionize your life once it\u2019s made. So how do you go about changing your mindset? Scott has some great, actionable advice about that very subject, on this episode of The Amazing Seller, so make sure you stick around.\nYou are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\nJim Rohn is credited with this timeless statement, and its truth resonates deeply in most people. So look around you. Who are you spending your time with? How are the impacting the way you look at life? The way you behave? The opportunities you have and the things you attempt? If you\u2019ll take the time to look, you\u2019ll begin to see just how true this statement is, and hopefully you\u2019ll also begin to see that you can actually do something about it. On this episode Scott talks about how to surround yourself with people who are supportive of your private label dreams and gives you three practical ways you can begin to do it today.\nHow to meet great people who will support your dreams.\nWe\u2019ve all met a \u201cDebbie Downer,\u201d someone who seems unable to say anything encouraging about the ambitions you\u2019re pursuing. That\u2019s not the kind of person you want to hang around for very long because she\u2019ll begin to rub off on you, even if you\u2019re the most positive person. How do you get out of those kinds of relationships and find relationships that will support you as you move to the levels of success you desire? One way is through the TAS Facebook community. It\u2019s a place where so many like minded people hang out that you\u2019re sure to find at least a few who think like you do and want what you want. Listen to Scott\u2019s advice about how to use the community to find supportive relationships, on this episode.\nDo you want to attend a Q & A hotseat event?\nScott\u2019s been thinking how fun it would be to host an event for Amazon private label sellers, a sort of Q & A hotseat event where everyone could interact, help each other brainstorm issues and problems, and learn from each other as well as from a couple of speakers. It\u2019s not an idea that\u2019s fully formed yet, but Scott would like to know if you\u2019re interested. It would be a very limited capacity event, and would be an event that would have an entry fee. If you\u2019re at all interested, you can get your name on an information list to find out more details as they become available.

This episode of the podcast should be of great encouragement to international Amazon sellers because it features a guy from the U.K. who has launched his Amazon business to over $250,000 in sales in the U.K. alone. There are all kinds of lessons to learn from this one, so make sure you listen.\nFrom dropshipping, to FBA, to Private Label sales in the future.\nThat\u2019s the road Francisco followed, and he\u2019s discovered that compared to everything else he\u2019s done in terms of product sales, Amazon is THE best opportunity that exists, even in the U.K. market. He\u2019s worked his butt off to get his products onto the Amazon platform and is now seeing the fruits of his labors. On this episode he shares the journey he\u2019s been on, the things he\u2019s learned trying to run a seller fulfillment business, and tell you exactly why he\u2019s switched to FBA.\nWhat might happen if you could get exclusive sales rights to your products?\nFrancisco did a very smart thing when he approached his suppliers about gaining exclusive rights to sell their products on Amazon. Why would he want to do that? First off, it eliminates the issue of bidding wars over identical products. Secondly, it gives him more leverage when hijackers come around and try to take over his listing. And he doesn\u2019t have to worry about someone else buying the same product from his supplier and becoming his competition. You can hear how Francisco did it, on this episode.\nAnother way to deal with product listing hijackers.\nOnce Francisco had his products on Amazon, and had gained exclusive rights from his supplier to sell the products, he was making incredible numbers of sales every day (in the 100s). When someone tried to hijack his listing, he responded with a new tactic. He looked over the hijacker\u2019s other items, and realizing that they were nothing special and that he could easily find the supplier of those products\u2026 you could say he made an offer to the hijacker that he couldn\u2019t refuse. Find out exactly what he did to get rid of his hijacker immediately, on this episode.\nWhy there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cLUCK\u201d when it comes to success in Amazon sales.\nMany people say that they got lucky at various stages of their Amazon sales journey. But Scott doesn\u2019t buy it. The fact is that the supposed \u201cluck\u201d wouldn\u2019t have happened at all if people like today\u2019s guest hadn\u2019t taken action in the first place. It\u2019s action that matters, not luck.

This is where you, and sellers like you are able to ask their practical questions about private label sales on Amazon. Scott Voelker has learned stuff the easy way, the hard way, and by interviewing experts on Amazon and related issues. He\u2019s got a lot of advice regarding a variety of issues surrounding Amazon sales and would love to answer your question. Find out how you can ask your own question on this episode of The Amazing Seller!\nWhen should I decide it\u2019s time to give up a product due to competition?\nOn this episode a listener asks a question that almost everyone faces at some time. He created a product, got it listed and was making decent sales, then temporarily ran out of funds. When he was able to get back to the product, he found a ton of competition and his product is far down in the search rankings. He\u2019s wondering if he should just give up on this product and try another, or are there ways to test a comeback of sorts? You\u2019ll love to hear Scott\u2019s \u201ccan do\u201d answer to this question, on this episode of the show.\nI love books and hear that selling used books on Amazon is pretty profitable. Could you talk about that?\nThis is a great question, and from what Scott has heard, selling used books on Amazon is still a pretty profitable way to make some cash. But it\u2019s not the private label model that Scott focuses on. That approach is called arbitrage and there are lots of great podcasts and resources that teach how to effectively do retail arbitrage. On this episode, Scott recommends a great resource for learning about selling used books on Amazon, especially textbooks, coffee table books, and others.\nHow is promoting a product off of Amazon different than promoting on Amazon?\nScott often recommends that Amazon sellers also expand their brand to places other than Amazon, for the sake of stability and reach. A listener asks about the ways Scott recommends promoting and marketing products that are not on the Amazon platform. It\u2019s amazing to hear Scott riff on this subject even though he doesn\u2019t do any sales off of Amazon currently. He\u2019s got tons of knowledge about the online space overall and gives some very practical, actionable things this listener can do.\nThe next Private Label Workshop is going to start soon!\nIf you\u2019re new to Private Label sales on Amazon, the best news in the world is that you don\u2019t have to figure it out on your own. Scott regularly holds private label workshops where he walks through the details (yes, the details) of the 5 steps he takes to launch every one of his new products on Amazon. He includes finding the right product, dealing with suppliers, promotions, product listings, packaging - everything you need to get started doing your own Amazon private label business. If you\u2019d like to attend one of these interactive video workshops, be sure to listen to this episode to find out how.

On this episode of The Amazing Seller you\u2019re going to get the full story of this underhanded practice and come to understand why people do it, what they\u2019re trying to gain, how it happens, and most importantly, what you can do to protect yourself.

The tool is like a watch dog that notifies you by text and email if there's been any intruders.\nTry ListingEagle.com Here\n\n\nWhat does it mean for your product to be hijacked?\nYour product listing can be hijacked when another Amazon seller comes onto the listing and claims that they are selling an identical product as yours, but really are not. They will send in their products to Amazon, begin changing details on your listing, maybe even the pictures, and in time, will completely take over the listing and rob you of your sales. In this episode you\u2019re going to learn how to setup your listings and your brand in a way that will make the likelihood of someone hijacking it much less, and will set you up for greater security in your Amazon business.\nWhat steps should you take if your listing is hijacked?\nScott\u2019s guest, a previous Amazon employee named James, shares a number of simple, common sense steps to take if your product listing becomes hijacked. Many of the steps work best if you\u2019ve kept accurate records of the process and details you went through as you set up your product. On this episode you\u2019ll learn what those steps are, why they are important, and how you can prepare for the day your listing may be hijacked. This is powerful information, and you\u2019ll only hear it on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhy getting your brand into Amazon\u2019s brand registry is vitally important.\nAmazon\u2019s brand registry is the company\u2019s way of identifying brands and linking them to their own products within the Amazon catalogue. Private Label sellers who are serious about getting their product listings the fullest amount of protection from hijackers need to make sure that their brand and each of their product listings are submitted to the Brand Registry. In this episode an Amazon specialist is going to tell you how to do that, step by step.\nHow to prove that an imitation of your product is not the real thing.\nMost product listing hijackers take over a listing in order to sell their product that is similar to the one originally on the listing. If your listing is hijacked, you\u2019ll need to be able to prove that the product being represented in the hijacked listing is not your product. There are some simple but very effective things you can do to customize your product and packaging that makes it a slam dunk to prove that a product is or is not yours.

As a result, many people are creating their own substantial income through Amazon private label sales. Today\u2019s episode is about equipping you to be one of those action takers, one of those people who experiences the kind of success that you dream of. Toward that end Scott is chatting with John Lee Dumas, entrepreneur and podcaster about his new \u201cFreedom Journal\u201d and how it can help you accomplish your #1 goal within the next 100 days.

Simply, it\u2019s John\u2019s version of what Scott\u2019s been saying: Follow One Course Until Success. There are many, many \u201cweapons of mass distraction\u201d out there (John\u2019s phrase) and they will pull against your desires to accomplish significant things in your life. You need to learn the discipline to overcome those distracting things so that you can reach the level of success you want. This episode is a primer for you, leading to understand that kind of focus and how you can begin taking steps to developing it in your everyday practices. Be sure you listen.\nThose who are successful know how to set and accomplish goals.\nIn interviewing thousands of successful entrepreneurs John Lee Dumas has discovered one commonality between them all. Those who are successful on any level are the people who know how to set and reach goals. For those people there are no excuses. No turning back. They wisely set S.M.A.R.T. goals (more on that in a bit) and take action. Today John Lee Dumas shares why he\u2019s so committed to helping people discover how to set and accomplish those kinds of goals and what he\u2019s doing to ensure that more and more people can learn the skills necessary to enable them to add that skill to their toolbox. It\u2019s an important episode Scott\u2019s got for you today, so be sure you take the time to listen.\nWhat are S.M.A.R.T. goals?\nS.MA.R.T. is a tried and true acronym that many people have used to help themselves set and accomplish goals, and it\u2019s one John Lee Dumas recommends and uses in his new book \u201cThe Freedom Journal.\u201d S.M.A.R.T. stands for \u201cSpecific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. If you create goals that adhere to those 5 characteristics you\u2019ll have no problem accomplishing them. John is so convinced of that he\u2019s included the S.M.A.R.T. methodology as a key component of his new \u201cFreedom Journal.\u201d Find out more about the journal below and by listening to this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhy John created the \u201cFreedom Journal\u201d and what it can accomplish for you.\nWhat difference would it make if you knew without a doubt that you would accomplish your #1 goal within the next 100 days? What would it do for your confidence? Your work ethic? Your commitment to success? John Lee Dumas is convinced that certainty like that will move you to take action like never before and make the world a better place in the long run. That\u2019s why he created \u201cThe Freedom Journal,\u201d a practical, daily tool to help you set your goals and systematically accomplish them day by day. He guarantees that if you follow The Freedom Journal, you WILL accomplish the #1 goal on your list within 100 days of beginning. He\u2019s tested it with many users so far and stands by that statement.

Taking action on your Amazon Private Label business is the most important thing you can do to see success happen. As you listen today, carefully listen for the things that Scott\u2019s suggesting in his answers that you can do. Today. Now. To get your Amazon private label business moving forward in a new way. You can make changes now if you\u2019re just willing to take action and put things to work for you. So don\u2019t just be a consumer, be an action taker! It could be the difference between huge success and none at all. \nDone is better than perfect, so don\u2019t wait to take action.\nOne of the most crippling mistakes Amazon private label sellers make is to try to get all their ducks in a perfect little row before they take any action. That\u2019s a mistake. You won\u2019t know if what you\u2019re investing all your time in is actually worth it until you start taking action. That means that it\u2019s possible that all the work you\u2019re putting into getting things perfect are wasted efforts. You won\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case until you get things out there to start testing the market. Done is better than perfect. Scott\u2019s got lots of passionate things to say about that topic at the beginning of this episode, so be sure you give it a listen to get your dose of inspiration for the day!\nWhy am I not getting enough impressions on my Amazon PPC campaign?\nA listener called in to ask Scott about a PPC campaign because the impressions being received were not as many as expected. What are the reasons a PPC campaign could NOT be driving traffic? Scott\u2019s got some insightful things to share about this issue and one of the main things has to do with keywords in your listing: where you use them and how you use them. You\u2019ll get all the details on how to maximize the money you\u2019re investing in PPC and how to make sure the keywords you\u2019re using are the right ones, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nAmazon Seller Support tells me not to do PPC for variations? Is that right?\nA listener has a few products that are similar, but are slightly different (color, size, etc.). Those differences are what Amazon considers to be \u201cvariations.\u201d This listener wants to drive traffic to all of his variations using Amazon PPC but is having trouble doing it. The seller support folks at Amazon have told him that setting up PPC campaigns on products that are variations of each other will cause him to compete with himself for those keywords - costing him money and cutting down on his effectiveness. Is that right? Hear Scott\u2019s answer and how you can tweak things just a bit to get the most bang for your PPC buck, on this episode.\nWhat are the pros and cons of starting with a minimum budget?\nOne of the strategies Scott recommends often is to set a minimum budget and get started with a private label project in order to prove to yourself that the model is real and can work. It\u2019s worked for many people who are now successful at Amazon private label sales, but is it the right way for everyone to get started? On this episode a listener asks a question about that approach. She wants to know the pros and cons of starting that way VS a traditional product launch approach.

He put up two listing for two new products, one that is slightly different than the other. He started a PPC campaign for one of them, but the OTHER one (the one without PPC driving traffic) started ranking on Amazon. How could that be? On this episode (right about 4:01) Scott\u2019s going to share that tip with you just to show you how the things he\u2019s stressed in his previous episodes still hold true today and to help you maximize your own efforts so that your business can thrive.\nWhat is YOUR favorite TAS podcast from the past year?\nThe stats don\u2019t like and this year they show that Scott\u2019s conversation with Greg Mercer, creator of Jungle Scout is one of the most downloaded and listened to episodes he did this year. Scott learned a ton as Greg shared, not only how Jungle Scout works, but also how he\u2019s been able to teach people to use it. There\u2019s a video on the show notes page for that episode where Greg walks you through the steps for using his amazing product. No wonder it was such a popular episode\u2026 it\u2019s packed full of goodness. Be sure to listen to this episode where Scott unpacks the reasons behind the popularity of his most downloaded episodes of the year.\nDo you know how to make your Amazon listing the very best it can be?\nWhen you\u2019re adding a new product to Amazon it might seem like you\u2019re just filling in blanks. But there\u2019s tons more to it than that. One of the favorite episodes this year was episode 86, where Amazon copywriting expert Karon Thackston shared some of the top things you can do to make your Amazon listings more searchable, findable, and powerful in the Amazon search engine. As you listen to what she has to share, it\u2019s a lot more than filling in blanks, and the better you know how to do it the more powerful your product listings will be. You can hear Scott\u2019s explanation of why this episode was so popular and how you can get the most out of it, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nHere is proof that Amazon Private Label businesses actually work.\nOne of the features of the Amazing Seller Podcast is that Scott regularly highlights people who are doing private label sales successfully. But it\u2019s not \u201cpie in the sky\u201d stuff; he shares the ups and downs, the successes and the mistakes. He wants every listener to get a realistic view of what private label sales is like and how they can make the most of the experience others have had to move their own business toward success. On this episode you\u2019ll hear about a handful of the many, many case studies Scott has featured where Amazon sellers have been able to pull in over $10K per month or more creating and selling private label products. It\u2019s more evidence that Amazon private label sales is the real deal.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:00] Scott\u2019s invitation to join his free, 10 day course to learn how to sell private label products on Amazon.\n\t[0:47] Introduction to this \u201cbest of\u201d episode from 2015!\n\t[2:40] A shout out to the TAS Facebook community!\n\t[4:01] An Amazon ranking tip Scott learned by mistake!", "duration": "29:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS144.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1451293208, "title": "TAS 143 : KILLER Tax Tips and What Business Type to Form \u2013 LLC?", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Taxes. Uggghh. But it\u2019s part of life that is certain, and that you have to deal with or else. This episode of the Amazing Seller is perhaps long overdue because it walks us through the details of business taxes, business structures, and the decisions you need to make in order to remain compliant with the U.S. laws regarding income and expenses in your business. For that important topic Scott asked his new CPA, Josh Bauerle to come onto the show to share from his expertise about all of these issues and a whole lot more. You\u2019re going to get great, professional advice that can save you thousands - yes, THOUSANDS of dollars if you do it right. Be sure to listen so you can get all the details.\nWhat are the differences between an accountant and a CPA, and how do I know if I should be using a CPA?\nMost of us don\u2019t know the answers to these questions, and many of us don\u2019t need to know because our businesses are still on the small side. But once your business begins generating profits of $50K or more per year, you\u2019re going to need to understand these questions and make sure you\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for you and your business. An accountant is someone who simply keeps accurate record of what comes in and what goes out. A CPA has gone through specified training and has specialized knowledge on tax laws and much more. Listen to Josh Bauerle\u2019s explanation of what he does as a CPA and how businesses can benefit from his kind of services, on this episode of the Amazing Seller.\nSole Proprietor? C-Corporation? S-Corporation? LLC?\nThere are 4 basic kinds of business entities that you could form your business as, but how do you know which is right for you? Today\u2019s guest, Josh Bauerle, is a CPA who says that much of the decision depends on the size of your business and your entity decision may change as your business grows. On this episode Josh walks through every one of the options in details and tells you the pros and cons so that you can make an informed decision. He\u2019s also got a very strong opinion about the best one and tells you why he feels so strongly about it. You can hear all of that by listening to this episode of the podcast.\nWhen do I need to invest in a payroll company?\nJosh Bauerle\u2019s experience as a CPA has given him the opportunity to observe how many businesses approach this question. And in his experience he\u2019s come to some pretty firm conclusions about the answer. He believes that given the small expense that payroll companies are nowadays (you can find one for $30 a month, online), every business, especially LLC and S-corps should invest in the service to make sure everything is being handled correctly. It\u2019s one of the many things you\u2019ll hear on this episode that could not only save you money, but also keep you out of trouble with the IRS. Take the time to listen to this long-overdue episode!\nWhat documents do I need to keep?\nBusiness expenses do need to be documented, should the IRS ask to see the proof of the expense. Since that\u2019s the case, how should you be organizing and keeping those records? The main thing is to keep a list of expenses and income, categorized so that you can know what you\u2019ve spent on what. Today\u2019s guest, CPA Josh\u00a0Bauerle, suggests that you keep those records regularly, and keep all receipts in a shoe box or some other catch-all system so you can produce them if needed. That way you have everything you need, if and when you need it, and your accountant will be able to do a good job with the records you provide.\n\nHang around to listen tot his great episode.

On this episode you\u2019re going to hear Scott\u2019s weekly Q&amp;A session, which he does every Friday. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear questions and answers about Amazon PPC, Product research and selection, logos and branding, and more! Be sure to stick around and listen to this practical episode of the Amazing Seller!\nCan my Pay per Click (PPC) campaigns wind up competing with each other for keywords?\nThe short answer: Yes. If you use exact keyword matching on more than one campaign you could wind up competing with yourself, costing yourself money. If you\u2019re using other forms of PPC, it\u2019s possible you won\u2019t be competing with yourself, but to make sure, there\u2019s a simple little tool you can use to ensure that you\u2019re not competing with yourself. It\u2019s called \u201cnegative keywords\u201d and on this episode Scott is going to share how to use them to maximize your keywords in your pay per click campaigns.\nI found 4 or 5 versions of a product in Jungle Scout that all look like the very same product. One of them has lots of reviews and sales, the others hardly have any. Why is that?\nIf you\u2019ve spent any time at product research you\u2019ve likely seen a similar situation. Many of the products can wind up looking the same simply because the same suppliers are being used. But one of them always seems to pull out in front to be the dominant product. There are lots of reasons for this, but rather than focusing on what that one product is doing, Scott wants to know how the others are doing. Can you guess why? Scott\u2019s going to tell you all about it on this episode in answer to a listener question, so be sure you stick around to hear the details.\nI think it\u2019s time to design my product/brand logo. Any suggestions?\nWhen it comes time to put a \u201clook\u201d to your brand or product, there are no easy avenues to getting it done. You\u2019re typically going to have to spend the bucks to hire a professional designer to produce the look and feel you\u2019re looking for. On this episode Scott mentions some of the places he\u2019d go to find that kind of help, but he\u2019s also going to put the focus on something else you need to make sure you nail down far ahead of your logo. Care to guess what it is? You\u2019ll hear Scott\u2019s words of wisdom on this episode.\nI think one of my competitors is doing something against the Amazon terms of service. When is it OK to report them?\nIt\u2019s not supposed to happen but sometimes Amazon sellers do things against the rule to try to game the system and gain an advantage. If your competition is doing that, it can cost you some revenue at times, depending on what it is they\u2019re doing. This listener thinks his competition is listing the exact same product with the exact same UPC multiple times. He\u2019s curious if it\u2019s OK for him to report this seller, or if he should. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear Scott\u2019s candid reply based on his own ethics and experience.

Take some time to listen to this episode and you\u2019ll understand the incredible value that is packed into every one of these episodes.\nThis episode: How to find a sourcing agent for your products.\nOne of the most important but most uncertain parts of any Amazon based business is finding and sourcing products. If your supplier is in China or some other part of the world, that interaction becomes more and more difficult. To make this piece of the process easier, you might want to consider finding an agent in country who can work with you to get your products sourced. It\u2019s a great step toward simplifying your product selection and ordering process and could serve to further your business both now and in the future. Scott gets questions about this often, so be sure you listen to get all his tips.\nConsider finding a sourcing agent to be the same as conducting a job interview.\nWhen you\u2019re looking for a sourcing agent, you want to get the very best person you can. This person will be an integral part of your team, someone who could make your business grow at a much faster rate and in unique and powerful ways. You want to take great care in finding just the right person. Scott\u2019s got some very practical tips to help you go exactly that, on this episode, so make sure that you find the time to listen to Scott\u2019s tips - and begin brainstorming how these principles might be a benefit to your business.\nIs pricing the main thing to be concerned about in finding a sourcing agent?\nYou might think that the main thing you\u2019re going to be looking at in finding an agent is the price they can get for your products. While that is a very important thing to consider, you also want to consider a handful of other things that have nothing to do with price. Is the agent easy to work with? Are they able to offer you additional products that go along with your product line? Can they combine products, provide printing, packaging, and other things essential to your business? If you want to know the kinds of things you should consider, listen to this episode!\nHow well can a potential sourcing agent work with you? It\u2019s vitally important that you know.\nThe questions you ask as you interview potential sourcing agents will help you know if they are the right fit for your company. You want to know if the person is going to be easy to work with overall. That means they have to be able to communicate clearly and understand what you are saying as well. Can they follow directions? Can they get things done that you need to be done? Are they flexible and responsive. All these issues and more need to be considered and you can hear Scott\u2019s take on every one of them, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Welcome to this episode: Do you need a product sourcing agent?\n\t[0:58] Thanks to the TAS Facebook community and the new criteria to allow people into the group.\n\t[2:46] A great success story from a Facebook TAS group member!\n\t[4:14] How you can get into the TAS Facebook group.\n\t[4:20] How you can find a sourcing agent for your overseas products.\n\t[5:00] Some of the best places for you to find a sourcing agent.\n\t[12:00] How to screen or interview your prospective agent.\n\t[17:39] The email Scott sends to potential suppliers.\n\t[20:17] How to move to the next level in your negotiations.\n\t[22:00] Discovering how well your agent is able to work with you.\n\t[27:30] Questions Scott gets often that have to do with this issue.", "duration": "32:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS141.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1450688439, "title": "TAS 140 : How Amber Discovered her $20k per Month Product (You\u2019ll Be Surprised)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "There are many people who don\u2019t believe that making a very good living by selling products on Amazon is really possible. They\u2019re the doubters, the ones who don\u2019t know the reality of what is possible by leveraging the amazing Amazon platform to their advantage. Today\u2019s guest, Amber, was one of those people. She heard about FBA from a relative and had her doubts. But over time she decided to at least give it a try, and began with just over $1,000. Her success has been amazing - over $20,000 in product sales already! In this conversation she tells Scott how her journey has progressed, what\u2019s going on now, and and how you can get involved if you\u2019re willing to take action!\nFrom doubter to amazing seller in 6 month\u2019s time.\nWhen Amber first heard about private label sales on Amazon she thought it couldn\u2019t really work the way she was hearing. But once she gave it a try, she discovered that she was wrong. Her products have taken off in an amazing way, selling as many as 200 items per day. Since that time she\u2019s begun a second brand and product line, aiming to build her business to even greater heights. Amber\u2019s experience demonstrates that if you are willing to take action, you can build your own business to support yourself and your lifestyle. Listen to Amber\u2019s story and get some inspiration about what you can achieve!\nWhy taking action is the most important step.\nSince Amber was a skeptic when she first heard of Amazon private label sales, she could have easily sat back, watched things happen, scoff at the amazing stories she heard, and left it at that. But she didn\u2019t. She took some action steps to try it out for herself, to test it out to see if what she was hearing was reality. What she discovered is that selling on Amazon is even more lucrative and powerful than she thought. She\u2019s gone from skeptic to sold out believer, in just 6 month\u2019s time. You can hear her story on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhere did Amber get a product idea that sells $20K a month?\nAmazingly, Amber didn\u2019t get her product idea from using a fancy software package and doing a lot of research. She simply paid attention to the things that were going on around her, saw a product someone she knew was using, and thought it might be a good product to offer on Amazon. Turns out she was right. That product is now selling to the tune of over $20,000 per month. How is that possible? For sure, she happened to hit on a great product at the right time, but she also had the benefit of being an action taker. If that product hadn\u2019t worked out nearly as well, she likely would have tried something else. You\u2019ve got to take action. It\u2019s really that simple. Take some time to listen to this episode so you can hear Amber\u2019s entire story.\nScott\u2019s 10X10X1 strategy has multiplied itself over and over for Amber.\nThe basic structure Scott suggests new Amazon sellers aim for is 10 products, selling 10 per day. But because she took action Amber has seen that kind of success with only one product and a few variations. Her success is obviously not something that anyone can guarantee for new sellers but it clearly demonstrates that even without a ton of research, great product ideas and lucrative income can be a reality. Think of what might happen if you DO put into practice all the research and tips that skilled and seasoned sellers like Scott are teaching? Your success could be greater than Ambers!\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Welcome to this episode of The Amazing Seller - introduction to today\u2019s show!\n\t[1:33] Your invitation to the TAS Facebook group!\n\t[2:27] Scott\u2019s introduction to Amber, a member of the TAS facebook community.\n\t[3:30] The unreal experience Amber is having.\n\t[4:13] How Amber was introduced to private label sales on Amazon.\n\t[9:00] Amber\u2019s first order and how she got started.\n\t[11:10] How Amazon\u2019s removal of family and friends reviews affected Amber.\n\t[12:50] Starting Amazon PPC and the beginning of sales.", "duration": "40:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS140.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1450429256, "title": "TAS 139 : Ask Scott Session #38 \u2013 FBA Amazon Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "The most amazing part of having an Amazon Private Label business is that it allows you to build your own real business to support your family and the lifestyle you desire.

Be sure to listen to this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode to hear that shout-out and to hear some very practical questions answered.\nWhat kind of budget should I have to get started with an Amazon private label business from scratch?\nA listener to the show asks a very important question today regarding the beginning stages of beginning a business like Scott has on Amazon. It\u2019s all about budget. How much money should you expect to put into the launch phase of your new Amazon business? Scott says \u201cit depends,\u201d on your product, your niche, and lots of other things - but overall he thinks you should try for around $5,000 to get started, even though there have been some very successful sellers who began with much, much less. Listen to this episode to hear Scott\u2019s full answer and to get your head around the steps involved in finding a product, producing it, and getting it into Amazon to sell.\nI want to double check the quality of my products before sending them to Amazon, but I live in Sweden. What do you suggest?\nInternational Amazon sellers definitely have some unique hurdles to get past in order to build a successful business that sells on the U.S. Amazon store.One of those has to do with assuring product quality when it comes from an overseas supplier. Scott typically recommends that you have your products sent to you before sending them to Amazon, exactly SO you can check the quality before it goes to Amazon. But for international sellers that requires an extra shipping step and therefore an extra expense. There are some creative ways current international sellers have dealt with that issue, and Scott highlights some of those things on this episode, so be sure to hear his explanations.\nI\u2019m new to this Amazon private label thing. What\u2019s a UPC code and what is it used for?\nAhhh...the mysterious UPC code. What is it that\u2019s encoded into that numeric and striped barcode? It\u2019s not really all that difficult and Scott\u2019s going to cover it on this episode. Basically, Amazon uses the UPC code to ensure the proper identification of your product. For that reason, every product or variation of a product has to have its own unique UPC code. That means that a bundle of products would need an individual UPC code that is different from each of the products inside that bundle. It sounds confusing but it\u2019s not. Listen to this episode to hear Scott\u2019s run down of how Amazon uses UPC codes and how you can get UPCs to go on your products.\nHow do you determine what product supplier to use when they all are vying for your business by dropping the prices on each other?\nA listener has a very good problem. He\u2019s been researching his products from a handful of suppliers and each of them keeps dropping their prices based on the quotes the others are giving him. He\u2019s trying to decide which supplier he should use and feels bad to turn down these suppliers that he\u2019s had such long conversations with. Scott\u2019s got some great insights into this issue and points out that it\u2019s not only a pricing issue. There\u2019s also supply issues, turnaround time, shipping methods and times, and more.

Scott\u2019s focus on this episode is to help you get yourself ready to achieve some amazing things in the next 12 months. He wants to see your Amazon business thrive and even explode in 2016. Listen in to hear how Scott suggests you go about setting yourself up for massive success in the coming year.\nQuestions are powerful, if you\u2019ll take the time to ask the right ones.\nIf you\u2019re going to see your business (or your life, for that matter) grow, you\u2019re going to have to begin asking questions about what\u2019s been happening so far. On this episode Scott\u2019s going to walk you through some of the basic questions you need to ask yourself to prepare for things to be different this coming year. The very first one you\u2019ve got to ask is \u201cWhere am I now?\u2019 If you don\u2019t clearly understand what\u2019s been working and what hasn\u2019t been working in the way you do your Amazon business, you won\u2019t know what tweaks you should make to improve things this coming year. So take the time to listen to this powerful episode, then take the time to ask yourself the right questions to enable your success.\nGoal\u2019s without actions steps are just dreams.\nIf you\u2019re going to make your dreams come into reality, you\u2019re going to have to take action. That\u2019s Scott\u2019s favorite saying because it\u2019s one of the most common reasons that people\u2019s dreams don\u2019t come true. They don\u2019t do anything about it. Scott\u2019s got a very practical way of defining and outlining goals so that they can be broken down into step by step processes that allow you to take action to see your dreams come into reality. It\u2019s not complex, but it does require work. So be sure to listen to this episode to find out how Scott does it and to begin your own process of improving your own goal setting techniques and make those dreams come to life!\nA 90 day sprint is a powerful way to move your business forward!\nProjects are powerful. Think about a home improvement project\u2026 you set aside a certain amount of money and a certain amount of time to dedicate yourself to focusing on getting the project done. If you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019ll wind up with your house demolished for months on end. But if you do, you\u2019ll soon be enjoying the benefit of a newly renovated house. That very same thing can happen in your business as you set shorter, concentrated periods of time to work on an accomplish your goals. It requires a lot of hard work and dedication, but you\u2019ll be amazed at the powerful and important things you can get done within the next 90 days if you set your mind to it and get started. Scott\u2019s got a real life example from the Amazon private label world to help you think it through, so be sure to listen tot his episode.\nA real-life example helps things make sense\u2026 so here\u2019s one you can relate to.\nScott\u2019s not one to deal in abstract terms, so he\u2019s decided to conclude this episode with a real-life, Amazon based example of how you can ask the right questions, set the right goals, break down those goals in actionable steps, and then put all that effort into a 90 day sprint in order to get some amazing things accomplished. It\u2019s an amazing tool for you to apply to your own business and products so that you can set yourself up for great success in the coming year.

He did the research, chose his product, and got rolling with practical actions right away. Today you\u2019re going to hear Andy Irvine\u2019s story of how he made it past $10K in just 30 days of selling his Amazon product. He walks through the process step by step, prompted by Scott\u2019s questions. You\u2019re going to learn a ton from this conversation, so be sure to listen!\nCan international sellers really make it big with Amazon private label sales?\nToday\u2019s conversation should leave no doubt about the answer to that question because Andy Irvine, Scott\u2019s guest today is from Australia. He ordered his products from China and worked very carefully with his supplier to have his products shipped directly to the Amazon warehouse in the U.S. It took hard work and lots of careful research to make sure he was operating according to Amazon\u2019s terms of service, but he did it. You\u2019re going to hear it all on this episode, so don\u2019t miss it!\nThe 2nd product launch and a massive giveaway.\nAfter his first product was selling pretty well, Andy Irvine decided that on his second product he would do a big giveaway. He chose to use promotions to give away 100 products and within days his product listing went from barely being able to be found, to the first page for his main keyword choice. He was very happy with the decision because of the jump start it gave his product, and the addition of a second product seemed to increase the sales of his first product as well. Andy\u2019s very generous to give away all his secret and mindsets for why he did what he did, on this episode.\nWhat if you want your China supplier to ship directly to Amazon?\nIf you\u2019ve listened to The Amazing Seller for very long you know that Scott and others who have been on the show have recommended that you always have your products shipped to yourself before you send them to Amazon so that you can ensure that everything is as it should be. It\u2019s a quality control step that is very wise. But since Andy Irvine was operating in Australia and the double shipping cost would have been prohibitive, he took a number of specific steps to allow for his products to be shipped directly to the Amazon warehouse without any problems. On this episode you\u2019re going to hear the details of what he did, how he did it, and the phenomenal results he experienced.\nThe importance of getting started even if you don\u2019t have your brand figured out.\nWhen Andy Irvine started his Amazon business, he and his wife both wanted to create a specific brand of products, eventually providing many products in a larger product line. But they didn\u2019t have all those ideas figured out yet. Andy wasn\u2019t content to wait until they got their act together, so he decided to simply research a good product and take action. Putting that product onto the Amazon sales engine was the best thing he could have done. The sales from it, and a second product shortly after, have given he and his wife time to figure out the brand issues, start ordering products to fit that brand, and do it all with profits from their Amazon sales. You\u2019re going to be inspired by \u00a0Andy\u2019s \u201ctake action\u201d attitude.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Introduction of this episode with a special guest: Andy Irvine (an international seller from Australia).\n\t[2:26] Andy\u2019s story of how he got started selling on Amazon and why Amazon was the choice he made.\n\t[9:00] The particular hurdles Andy has to get past in order to work out of Australia and sell on the U.S. store.\n\t[11:16] Andy\u2019s first steps of product research, when he first began, and now.\n\t[15:42] The importance of cross referencing sales history on potential products.\n\t[16:55] Andy\u2019s first order of products - 2000 units!\n\t[18:00] Working with suppliers.\n\t[19:31] What Andy did in regard to packaging for hi...", "duration": "1:01:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS137.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1449910816, "title": "BONUS Episode: Income + November 2015 Lessons Learned", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "One of the best things about Scott\u2019s experience as an Amazon Private Label seller is that it\u2019s been a great learning laboratory\u2026 not just for him but for you!

It\u2019s where you get the opportunity to ask an experienced and successful Amazon seller how he does the things he does to make his Amazon business successful. In this episode Scott answers real questions sent in from real listeners like you so get ready to hear practical responses to real life scenarios. And you can also find out how to ask your own questions, so be sure to listen.\nHow can I find the right graphic designer for my images, graphics, box, etc.?\nThere are lots of people who say they are graphic designers, but you\u2019ve got to know that if you pay a small amount you\u2019re not going to get good quality. This is a very important issue for Amazon sellers. You\u2019ve got to have professional looking product logos and labels, and promotional materials so you don\u2019t want to skimp on this. But how do you go about getting those things created in a way that gets you the quality you need? On this episode Scott answers a listener question about that issue and has a great recommendation of a place to go to find the right designer for you.\nI\u2019ve already launched one product that didn\u2019t work out, so I\u2019m looking at another. Should I delete the first product listing before I have my second ready?\nScott was very impressed with this listener. He followed through with the launch of a \u201ctest product\u201d just to learn. The product didn\u2019t sell as well as hoped but he took it as a learning experience and is giving Amazon sales another try. His question centers around what he should do with his previous product and its listing during the interim when he doesn\u2019t have his new product ready yet. Scott\u2019s answer, as usual, is common sense and very helpful. Find the time to sit down and listen to his response to this question. You\u2019ll be glad you did!\nI really believe that my product can change it\u2019s market, but the market is very, very competitive. Is it unrealistic to think I can do that?\nThere are certain categories or niches on Amazon that are very, very crowded and competitive. It\u2019s not typically a recommendation to try Amazon private label sales in a niche that is so crowded. It\u2019s going to be harder than it needs to be and success will come very slowly. But this listener is convinced that his product idea is a game changer, but it would be in a very, very competitive niche. Scott gives advice about how to go about launching that kind of product and talks about the different sorts of tactics that you could take to get your game changing product the exposure it\u2019s going to need. You won\u2019t want to miss this one!\nDo you have a question you need answered about Amazon Private Label sales?\nSometimes the best thing for you as you learn a new skill or area of expertise is to simply sit down with someone who\u2019s been there and done that.

As your daddy used to say, \u201cThe right tool for the right job,\u201d and it applies to your Amazon private label business as well.

On this episode Scott\u2019s going to share his top 8 tools, the ones that he feels he couldn\u2019t live without. Get out your laptop or paper and pencil so that you can jot down the tools Scott\u2019s using and how he\u2019s doing it.\nDid you know that Google Drive is a powerful tool for Amazon sellers to use?\nIf you\u2019ve got a gmail account you are already connected to Google Drive and it\u2019s full of tons of tools that can make your business more productive and effective - and it\u2019s FREE!

Tools can be a huge part of working smarter. They enable you to automate processes that you do frequently, find data and information more quickly, share things with team members or others with a click or an automated notification, and tons of other things.

Scott asked the community to share any product flops they\u2019ve had in the past and exactly what went into the product\u2019s failure. The major things that were shared in that comment thread are what Scott\u2019s sharing on this episode. It\u2019s the top 7 reasons that the entire Facebook community came up with as to why products have failed. This isn\u2019t theory, this are real life scenarios that real Amazon sellers have experienced. You\u2019re going to get a ton out of this episode so make sure you listen.\nHow important is it for your product to be in demand on Amazon?\nScott has covered this issue many times under many different names or descriptions, but the main point is this: You have GOT to know how to determine what the true demand is in the product niche you\u2019re considering. It\u2019s about MARKET, not about individual sales. If your product is going to be successful you\u2019ve got to know how the product is selling throughout the entire market. That will tell you the demand for your product and whether it\u2019s even worth it to pursue the product at all. Scott walks you through exactly how to figure out this issue on this episode, so don\u2019t miss this fundamental step.\nWhat is considered copyright infringement on Amazon?\nDid you know that if you include the brand name of any of your competitor\u2019s products in your product title or listing, you could be banned for copyright infringement? It\u2019s true! Some of the TAS community members were humble enough to share that as a reason their product flopped. Amazon takes this issue very seriously so make sure you listen to this episode to hear how Amazon views the use of trademarked or copyrighted names and how you can avoid any kind of Amazon-slap on your products!\nSeasonal items are a blessing and a curse at the same time.\nIt is great to sell something that you can count on having a high sales volume at a certain time of the year. Snow shovels would be a great example: You know you\u2019ll get a ton of sales during the winter\u2026 but you also know that it bites the other way, you\u2019ll get absolutely NO sales the rest of the year. Some of the TAS community members said that their biggest mistake was relying too much on seasonal items without other products to fill in the lean times in their revenue stream. You can hear their lessons learned on this episode and receive Scott\u2019s input on how to avoid that kind of bottleneck on your own product line.\nWhat does it mean if all your competitors have 500 Amazon reviews?\nImagine that you\u2019re researching a new product possibility. You find one that you really like, can get at a very affordable cost, but aren\u2019t quite sure if you should do it. When you look at the competition, you see lots of sellers and even the ones who are 9th or 10th in seller rank have 500 or more product reviews. What are you supposed to make of that? On this episode of the Amazing Seller Scott reveals that it\u2019s an issue of TOO MUCH competition.

Friday. You\u2019re almost calling it \u201cgood\u201d for another week of hard work on your Amazon Private Label business. But don\u2019t call it quits yet, Scott\u2019s got another great episode of The Amazing Seller for you today, and ask you know, Friday\u2019s are the Q & A episode so there\u2019s lots of goodies in store for you today. And in case you didn\u2019t know, Scott takes every Friday\u2019s episode to answer your Amazon FBA questions. It doesn\u2019t matter how specific they are or how \u201cnewbie\u201d or expert you might think they are, Scott\u2019s here to help you out. Listen to this episode to find out how you can submit your private label question for a future episode!\nMy private label product is in a category that doesn\u2019t allow PPC. What can I do?\nDid you know that Amazon does not allow their own PPC on certain categories? It\u2019s true! That means that if you try to sell a product in one of those categories you\u2019re going to be losing out on one of the best sources of lead generation and conversions you could have. But, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t sell products in those categories. What do you do in that case? First off, you need to make sure your product listing is optimized to the keywords your buyers would use to search for your product. That\u2019s the only way they\u2019re going to find it (organically). You can also do promotions on your products or drive traffic from the outside using ads or an email list. You can hear Scott\u2019s entire answer to this question on this episode. (By the way, you can see the categories where PPC IS allowed on the graphic below.)\n\n\nA black hat tactic many unethical competitors are doing to dis your reviews.\nHave you noticed that on the reviews of your Amazon product, people are allowed to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to the reviews themselves? It\u2019s a way Amazon tries to make your helpful reviews available for new customers. The problem is that unethical competitors may go onto your listing and \u201cthumbs down\u201d your best reviews to keep them buried at the bottom. What should you do? The best advice Scott can give you is likely not what you want to hear, but you need to hear it anyway\u2026 on this episode.\nI\u2019m trying to keep better track of my inventory alongside my accounting. How do you do it?\nScott believes that simple is better when it comes to keeping records for your business. Inventory is an important part of your entire business and you need to be ethical in the way you keep track of it and report it for tax reasons. There are lots of tools you could use to help you keep track of your inventory and in this episode Scott avoids talking about them simply because he doesn\u2019t use them. He\u2019s going to tell you exactly what he does\u2026 and it\u2019s so simple you\u2019ll love it.\nIs the 4th quarter a great enough sales time that my products will sell without much PPC?\nThe 4th quarter is traditionally the time when retail sales (including Amazon) spikes in all niches and markets. That\u2019s because of the holidays surrounding Christmas. A listener asks if the 4th quarter might be a time that he could save a bit of cash by not doing PPC ads on his products, since sales are likely to be higher naturally. Scott\u2019s answer includes that issue but also covers whether or not competition is involved, and how much there is. It\u2019s a very good questions and \u00a0a very helpful answer, and you can hear it by listening to this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Scott\u2019s welcome to this \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode!\n\t[1:16] A shout-out to a TAS community member, John.\n\t[3:18] QUESTION ONE: My product category does not allow PPC.

You need good products if you\u2019re going to make a run at an Amazon business. But finding those ideas is not as hard as you might think and on this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott Voelker is going to walk you through the way his brain works when it comes to finding new product ideas and niches (scary, right?). You\u2019re going to see from a handful of real life examples Scott\u2019s come across that finding ideas for new products is not as hard as you think.\nFor Private Label product ideas, nothing works better than a \u201cDaily Touch List.\u201d\nOne of the exercises Scott Voelker teaches in his private label workshops is the creation of a daily touch list. It\u2019s a list you make as you go through your day where you write down every, single thing you touch during that day. It takes a while and is a bit nit-picky but what you\u2019ll discover by doing it is that through the course of just one day there are thousands of product niches and ideas that you could investigate as possible private label products. As you analyze your basic list a bit further you\u2019ll begin to see spin-off ideas and possibilities that you never would have thought of without making the list in the first place. Be sure to listen to this episode\u2026 Scott even gives away a few of the ideas he\u2019s had in the past few months.\nYou\u2019ve got to keep your eyes and ears open\u2026 private label product ideas are all around.\nScott was chatting with his buddy John a while back. They were just shooting the breeze, drinking a beer together, catching up on life. John\u2019s in the extermination business and as the two of them chatted about John\u2019s work and the various problems he faces, Scott remembered that one of the best and biggest sources of product ideas is the problems people face. He began to wonder what products might be needed in John\u2019s particular niche and his brain started racing. Scott\u2019s not going to create a line of pest control products, but he shares the example to show you that as you talk with people in the course of everyday life, product ideas spring to life if you simply know how to listen.\nAre there local businesses in your area that make specialty products?\nIf so, you could be onto a new product idea for Amazon private label right there! Check out the company. Do they have a webpage? If not, they probably aren\u2019t very internet savvy. You could potentially partner with them to get their products on Amazon and work out a deal where you get a certain amount of the profit they make from their overall Amazon sales. Or better yet, they might be willing to set up a wholesale arrangement with you so that you could private label their products and sell them as your own on Amazon. They\u2019d get the wholesale profit and you\u2019d have an almost \u201cinstant\u201d Amazon brand that can\u2019t be duplicated. Scott\u2019s got lots of ideas like this to share, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nLearning to live life on purpose and product ideas will spring up everywhere!\nWhat does your sister or brother do for a living? Are there needs in that industry that you could service with a private label product? How about your neighbor or friend? What are the hobbies your grandparents enjoy? Is there a product idea there? Do you see how you can simply begin looking around and find many, many areas where product ideas might exist. You\u2019ve just got to put in the time to think about it and ask some questions to discover if there\u2019s potential for an Amazon product that could make you some cash. Be sure to listen to this episode to hear Scott\u2019s suggestions for how to stimulate your brain to find more product ideas!\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Scott\u2019s introduction to this episode and how he came up with the idea.\n\t[2:16] A highlight from episode 125 that inspired a TAS listener.", "duration": "29:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS132.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1448874038, "title": "TAS 131 : How and WHEN to Use SEA Shipping for My Products (Step by Step Instructions)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "This episode of The Amazing Seller Podcast is one that\u2019s been asked about time and time again but Scott simply couldn\u2019t speak to it because he\u2019s not done it. The topic? Shipping your Amazon products by sea. But in typical fashion Scott didn\u2019t let it rest there, he found someone to talk to who has not only done sea shipping, but continues to do it and has a refined system for how to do it successfully every single time. So fasten your seatbelt and get ready for this firehose session of The Amazing Seller as Scott quizzes his guest, Derrick Miller on the issue of sea shipping.\nYour foreign supplier might suggest shipping by sea. What should you do?\nWhen first time Amazon Sellers start interacting with suppliers from China they eventually come to the question of how they are going to get their products from China to the U.S. The supplier will often say that they ship by sea. But is that the best route for you? On this episode, Scott\u2019s guest, Derek Miller, says that for first time or new Amazon sellers you should always push to ship your products by air at first. The reason is simple: You have more control over the process at the outset and your products will get to you faster, so you can start making money and scaling your business. The time will come for sea shipping as your business continues to grow but at the beginning it\u2019s not the best idea.\nLessons learned from a sea shipping disaster!\nThe first time the guest on today\u2019s show shipped his products by sea, it was an example of \u201cwhat can go wrong will go wrong.\u201d But it was as learning experience that he\u2019s maximized to his benefit. Now Derek Miller has a process and system in place that takes into account every negative thing he experienced with his first sea shipping attempt to make sure that none of the problems that happened then, happen with future shipments. And he\u2019s not through learning. If things he hasn\u2019t experienced yet go wrong, he tweaks his system to ensure that it\u2019s the last time that problem occurs. Derek got tons of experience with this and can teach you a lot, so be sure you listen to this episode if you\u2019re at all considering delivering your products by sea.\nHow expensive is it to ship by sea?\nThe main reason any Amazon Seller would want to ship by sea is for cost savings. But that cost savings comes at least partly because you\u2019re getting many more product at once - buying in bulk. So if you\u2019re not ready to buy thousands of products at one time, sea shipping is probably not the way you want to go. But if you are at that point you\u2019ll\u0192 save a good deal of money on the transportation side of your products even if you have to hire freight forwarders to handle the customs and shipping issues as your products are in route. There\u2019s a lot to consider and understand when it comes to shipping by sea, and today\u2019s guest knows it backwards and forwards, so make sure you listen so you can learn the pros and cons of sea shipping.\nHow to ship your Amazon Products by sea, step by step.\nOne of the defining characteristics of Scott and the TSA community is generosity. Everyone is eager to help each other create successful Amazon businesses. Today\u2019s guest, Derek Miller, is no exception. In this episode he shares his step by step process for shipping his products by sea. He covers lots of things you wouldn\u2019t know about if you\u2019ve never done sea shipping before so the value in what he\u2019s giving us today is incredible. So before you order your products to come to you by sea, make sure you listen to Derek's explanation of his sea shipping process so you can avoid the mistakes he\u2019s made and take advantage of his generosity and experience.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Introduction of the topic of using sea shipping of your products.\n\t[0:49] Scott\u2019s live workshops will go on \u201cpause\u201d for a bit, so get in while you can!\n\t[1:54] Scott\u2019s introduction of Derek Miller, his guest.\n\t[2:32] Derek story of getting started with Amazon FBA.", "duration": "41:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS131.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1448616659, "title": "TAS 130 : Ask Scott Session #35 \u2013 Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "You\u2019ve landed on the Friday edition of the Amazing Seller podcast where Scott does his \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode. It\u2019s an opportunity for up and coming or veteran Amazon sellers to ask their real life questions of Scott Voelker, a successful Amazon seller who is making it his job to teach and inform about Amazon sales and Private Labeling on Amazon. If you\u2019ve got a question you\u2019d like to ask Scott, you can find out how to do that on this episode, so make sure you listen and ask your questions! Maybe it will be featured on this Friday slot!\nIf I log on to Amazon using different IP addresses, is that going to cause me problems?\nWhen you log on to any account, Amazon or another site, the website logs what IP address you are logging in from. An IP address is the internet address where your particular computer is located. A coffee shop will have a different IP address. The library will have a different one. Your parent\u2019s house will have yet another. Are there problems that arise when you log into your account from multiple IP addresses? It\u2019s an interesting question that Scott takes on. If you\u2019re curious, take some time to listen in to this episode!\nIf I\u2019m an International Seller, what can I do to maximize my U.S. Sales?\nInternational sellers have a lot of additional hoops to jump through in order to sell their products in the U.S. market. A listener tells Scott he\u2019s doing great so far selling products from Australia, but wants to know what things he should watch out for in order to be successful at his U.S. sales. Scott\u2019s got two great resources to share that should help international sellers make the best of the opportunity to do private label sales on Amazon. If you live outside the U.S. and would like to sell on Amazon, you\u2019ve got to hear about these resources!\nI created my own product but am not being allowed to use PPC. Can you help?\nThis listener from Colorado has created his own product and loves that it\u2019s the only product on Amazon like it. He got his first 5 reviews and then went to set up his first PPC campaign just like Scott suggests. When he started the process he discovered that Amazon would not allow him to set up a PPC campaign because he did not have the \u201cbuy box\u201d inside the Amazon product listing. That doesn\u2019t make sense. If it\u2019s his product, he should be the only one on the listing and should have that buy box. What\u2019s the catch? Scott\u2019s got plenty to suggest to this seller in regards to tracking down this strange problem, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nIs it a major hurdle to start my Amazon sales in a restricted product category?\nRestricted categories in Amazon are certain product niches, like health and beauty, where Amazon will not allow new sellers to enter without approval. A new Amazon seller wants to know if it\u2019s a major problem for him to try to get approved for a \u201cgated\u201d or restricted category within Amazon in order to start with his first product. Scott\u2019s advice is that he not try to get into a gated community like this for his first product and he has plenty of reasons why he gives that advice. You can learn a lot from Scott\u2019s reply so make sure you listen in to hear all the details. \u00a0\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Welcome to the episode!\n\t[1:10] A graphic shared on the TAS Community on Facebook.\n\t[4:30] QUESTION 1: Can I use various IP addresses when accessing my Amazon account?

In this episode, as always, Scott has got a great show in store. He\u2019s going to talk to you about some amazingly simple things that most people do wrong when it comes to optimizing their product listings. The reason it\u2019s so wrong is because it not only hurts their organic search in Amazon, it also makes their Amazon PPC not work correctly. You won\u2019t believe how simple it is and the dramatic impact it had on one student\u2019s account in a very short amount of time. Hear all the details for yourself on this episode.\nHow Scott discovered these simple product listing mistakes.\nDuring one of Scott\u2019s private label classroom sessions a student mentioned that when she tried to do a \u201csuggested keyword\u201d PPC campaign, she was only given 2 keyword options. That didn\u2019t seem right to her or to Scott. At Scott\u2019s suggestion, she looked at the keywords in her product listing and removed all the commas in between the words. When she did that it was only a short matter of time before things changed dramatically. Scott thinks this could not only have been impacting her PPC campaigns but also her organic search in Amazon. In this episode you\u2019re going to hear all the details of the tweaks they made to her account and the actual results she got by doing it.\nAmazon Product listing mistake #1\nEvery Amazon seller has GOT to learn how to use PPC in order to make their product listing visible and attractive to every Amazon search that has to do with their product. Many people step into using PPC without taking the time to learn how to use it wisely. And among those who do use it wisely for the most part, there are small mistakes that can cause the entire PPC campaign to be ineffective. This first mistake is so easy to make and so simple to correct. It has to do with a tiny little thing called a \u201ccomma.\u201d Want to know all the details of how one student in Scott\u2019s private label class went from 2 keywords available in a suggested PPC campaign to hundreds? You\u2019re going to find out on this episode!\nYou want to make the most of the space you have for keywords and product listing titles\nAnd not everyone knows that one of the main ways you can do that is to make sure you\u2019re not repeating words. For example, if you\u2019re selling garlic presses you want to make sure that you only use the word \u201cgarlic\u201d and the word \u201cpress\u201d once each in your title and keywords. Many sellers would use those words again coupled with other words to try to rank for a different keyword phrase, but that\u2019s not how Amazon works. When Amazon sees the word \u201cgarlic\u201d the first time, it shuffles it around with all the other keywords and makes up all the phrases it can using those keywords\u2026 so you don\u2019t have to. Find out exactly how Scott recommends you make the most of your keyword and title space on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nBe careful how you phrase your product titles on Amazon.\nYou may feel it\u2019s important to use words like \u201cquality\u201d and \u201cbargain\u201d in your product titles in order to give those searching adequate reasons to click on your listing title. But when you do that you\u2019re actually wasting space that the Amazon engine is looking at to determine whether your item is something to show at all. People won\u2019t be searching for \u201cquality garlic press\u201d - they\u2019ll be searching for \u201cgarlic press.\u201d So leave out the filler words so you can maximize that space with better, more relevant keywords and get your products found in the Amazon search more easily. Scott walks you through these 3 simple mistakes that you can easily fix, on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS INTERVIEW EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Welcome to the episode!\n\t[0:50] How you can connect with Scott on Periscope!\n\t[2:19] Getting into the topic of PPC mistakes.\n\t[4:02] The BIGGEST MISTAKE and the story behind how it was...", "duration": "20:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS129.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1448269243, "title": "TAS  128 : Amazon Lightning Deal Sold 490 Units and Produced $10k in 4 Hours", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Today\u2019s guest is no stranger to the Amazing Seller Podcast - not only has Danny Brewer listened to the show from almost the beginning, he\u2019s also been featured on the show as a guest twice, back on episodes 17 and 100.

Scott and Danny both participated, not necessarily giving discounts on their products and the sales were tremendous! Both of them saw much greater returns during a time of the year when sales are not typically the best. In this episode Scott and \u00a0Danny spend a little bit of time discussing the pros and cons of the Prime Day event.

The initial contact would come from Amazon via email and you\u2019d be invited to participate. At that point you\u2019ll be asked to fill out forms regarding your products, pricing you\u2019re willing to offer, and other information. If you\u2019re product qualifies and Amazon accepts you into the program, you\u2019ll be assigned a specific day and time slot when your product will be offered as a \u201clightning deal.\u201d You\u2019ll have to have your inventory in Amazon\u2019s warehouse 48 hours before the deal goes live. Find out more about these incredible opportunities for Amazon to promote your products on this episode.\nThe power of building relationships that keep you moving forward.\nDanny Brewer, today\u2019s guest on The Amazing Seller, is a great example of a person who takes action in partnership with other people who are doing the same kind of sales he is doing. He\u2019s a very active member of the TAS Facebook community and also has been involved in a local meeting group of Amazon sellers who share information and keep each other accountable. If you are not part of a group that can help you push forward when you hit your own internal resistance, you have got to find that place. The TAS Facebook group is an amazing option where you\u2019ll find people who are all about helping each other move their Amazon businesses forward.\n\u201cTAKE ACTION!\u201d It\u2019s Scott\u2019s favorite phrase.\nMany people listen to podcasts all day long and do nothing with the information they hear. Others buy online courses or books and devour them, but don\u2019t move forward with any of the strategies they learn. Are you one of those people? If you are, you\u2019re probably making excuses as to why what you\u2019ve learned doesn\u2019t apply to you, or why you can\u2019t move forward into a business or life you feel you should have. That\u2019s too bad because good things happen for those who take action. You don\u2019t have to know everything, you only have to know the next thing. So find out what it is and get rolling. Take action to see your own Amazon Private Label business succeed! \nOUTLINE OF THIS INTERVIEW EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Scott\u2019s introduction of this episode with his guest, Danny \u201cNo B.S.\u201d Brewer.\n\t[1:49] Introduction of Danny and how he and Scott co...", "duration": "44:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS128.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1448010007, "title": "TAS 127 : Ask Scott Session #34 \u2013 Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "This episode of The Amazing Seller is the special FRIDAY edition\u2026 and what\u2019s so special about Fridays? It\u2019s when Scott Voelker does his \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode, where you can ask your specific, situational questions and get direct answers from Scott. These episodes are some of the most listened to for very good reason. You get practical, powerful advice from somebody who\u2019s a bit further down the road than you are, and the lessons-learned can help you to avoid pitfalls and mistakes Scott has made thus far in his private label business journey. You can ask your own questions by submitting them through the Amazing Seller website: www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask - go ahead, ask your question now!\nTrademarks on my brand name: Is it a good idea?\nMany sellers who first start out with an Amazon private label business are concerned about their brand name and everything that goes with it being solely theirs. It\u2019s an understandable concern but Scott doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s that important at the beginning. Why? Because getting started is a very time consuming and difficult process. Your learning curve is very high. Taking the time to figure out the brand name/trademark issues is a waste of energy at that point. You need to focus on making the business successful first to see if it\u2019s even worth trademarking any brand names. Scott\u2019s got lots to say on this issue so be sure you listen to get all the details.\nShould Amazon Private Label sellers have insurance to cover themselves for liability issues (like customers possibly being injured using the product)?\nBusiness insurance is something many beginning sellers don\u2019t consider as a cost of doing business, but it\u2019s very important. On this episode of The Amazing Seller a listener asks about the possibility of a customers being injured using his product and what steps he should take to protect himself and his business from lawsuits. Scott\u2019s first piece of advice is to not sell things that have a high risk of injury (nunchucks, throwing stars, etc.). But secondly he highlights the fact that once you begin selling \u00a0a certain amount of products Amazon will require you to have liability insurance and will ask you to provide proof of it. That\u2019s something you need to be ready with when that time comes. Hear Scott\u2019s explanation of the policy and how you can go about finding the right kind of insurance for your needs, on this episode.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to avoid high customs charges when ordering large quantities?\nIt was back in episode 32 when Scott shared about a shipping mistake he made that cost him $1,082.00. Today a listener asks about a similar issue, wondering how to best go about arranging the shipping of large orders to the U.S. so that customs fees and costs are minimized. There are varying guidelines that shipping companies use regarding their calculation of the fees incurred at customs, but there are also things your product supplier can do in terms of how they package and invoice the shipment to help you minimize customs costs. Listen to Scott\u2019s explanation of this confusing issue to make sure you are not incurring more charges than you should, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nHave you made the most of Scott\u2019s free resources? The Private Label Workshop is a great one you should attend!\nIf you\u2019ve listened to The Amazing Seller for any length of time you know that Scott\u2019s not one to hold back information. He\u2019s eager to share what he\u2019s learned so that you can have every tool you need to make your private label business a success and a blessing to you and your family. One of the best and most comprehensive things Scott\u2019s created is his \u201cPrivate Label Workshop,\u201d a weekly, live, FREE webinar that teaches you the 5 steps to finding, launching, and selling an Amazon product successfully.

Scott\u2019s excited (as usual) to bring you some actionable tips about how you can maximize your sales on the private label products you\u2019re selling on Amazon. Today\u2019s episode covers a problem that\u2019s becoming more and more frequent for Amazon sellers. What is it? As the market become more and more crowded and others jump on the same bandwagon of products that you have, you\u2019ll see pricing become one of the main differentiators motivating product sales. A price war has begun. Scott\u2019s been experiencing that with his very first product and has been working to overcome the difficulties presented by it. But it\u2019s not all bad news? Why? You\u2019ll have to listen to hear Scott\u2019s explanation so you can get the full gist of how he sees this difficulty as an opportunity.\nDifferentiation is an important thing when it comes to a price war.\nOne of the things Scott has discovered through a recent price war that has ensued in one of his product categories is this: The more unique and attractive your product is, in ways that are different from the competition, the more likely you\u2019ll be to demand the price you need and want because buyers will be more willing to purchase it because of its uniqueness. That could have to do with either product design or packaging and Scott\u2019s the first to say that since the product in question was his first product, he didn\u2019t pay attention to those issues as much as he should have. But he\u2019s glad he didn\u2019t. That sounds like a strange thing to say\u2026 but Scott\u2019s got a great reason for saying it that you can hear on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nA great tactic for a product with slipping profit margins.\nWhen was the last time you went to the grocery store? Have you paid attention to the coupons that print out when you are at the register? They\u2019re discounts based on what you purchased that are designed to lure you back into the store to buy that product again at a discount. Why would they offer you an opportunity to buy the same product for less? Because they\u2019re betting that when you do come back into their store you\u2019ll buy more than just that one product. They\u2019re willing to give up some income on one product for the probability that they can get you to buy more when you make that purchase. Today Scott\u2019s going to suggest that products that begin to lose their profit margin can be used in the same way. How do you go about it? Scott\u2019s got some great ideas that he\u2019s eager to share with you on this episode, so make sure you listen.\nBundling could come to the rescue of a lower profit margin.\nScott always believes there\u2019s a way to continue benefitting from the hard work he\u2019s put in, in the past - and he wants you to think the same way. If your product used to bring in lots of cash but is slipping because of competition, you can\u2019t give up! You\u2019d be bailing out on all that hard work. One of the things you can do is to look over the \u201calso bought\u201d listings that show when you view the product in question and consider creating new products to bundle with it based on those results. THAT is a great idea that Scott unpacks for you on this episode and it could be the very thing to save your product\u2019s usefulness and keep your business rolling along just as it always has. Find out more about how to make those bundles happen on this episode.\nIf your product is being undercut by a price war see if you can create a variation.\nProducts that have variations - such as color, size, features, etc. - provide the buyer an additional opportunity from your company that they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. You want to make sure that you\u2019ve got every hook in the water you can have, and a variation on your current product could be a masterful way for you to gain attention you\u2019re losing to competitors who are undercutting your price. It\u2019s one example of finding a way to offer something that your competition doesn\u2019t and to do it in a way they can\u2019t. It\u2019s about differentiation and you can do it to keep your prod...", "duration": "33:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS12620.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1447664409, "title": "TAS 125 : (Success Leaves Clues) Scott\u2019s Complete Story and Path of Becoming an Entrepreneur", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Every entrepreneur has a story. It\u2019s the path they followed to success that was either planned for accidental. But for those who know how to learn, how to work hard, and how to hustle, the path will work itself out in the way it should. Today Scott shares his entrepreneurial story with you because he wants you to see what\u2019s possible if you are willing to keep moving and work to see yourself succeed. It\u2019s a story of fits and starts, experiments and hard lessons learned, and the discovery that working for himself was the best thing he could do. You\u2019ll be inspired by this blue-collar, hard-working story that has led to amazing success.\nWhat do you do if you graduate high school with no plan for the future?\nScott grew up on a blue collar home. When he graduated college there was no college fund that had been saved up and no expectation that he\u2019d pursue college. So when he graduated he had no idea what he was going to do with the rest of his life. Through a series of trial and error and many lessons learned from a series of jobs, he discovered that working for himself and for his own family\u2019s needs was much smarter than working for someone else. That lead to a whole new world that you\u2019ll hear about on this episode.\nDigital product sales opened his eyes to a whole new world.\nBy building out and working their own photography business Scott and his wife were able to create templates and systems they could use over and over to make their workflow and process work smoothly. When Scott became aware of the fact that many people were selling their own creations online, he and his wife started talking about the possibilities. They concluded that they should give it a try and they created a photography course to put online. Scott created the course, set up the website, began promoting the launch, and they waited. Within hours thousands of dollars was coming in. It was the beginning of an online business career that continues today. Hear the details of Scott\u2019s story and how he learned that if you want to see success, you\u2019ve got to take action.\nThere will always be self-doubt and fear.\nBut Scott Voelker learned through his journey, from high school to present day, that those voices threaten but can\u2019t really hurt you. You\u2019ve got to set aside those doubts and fears and push forward to find the open doors of opportunity that you can take to a better life. It\u2019s pushing through the obstacles and doing something, taking action, to move yourself forward to a better tomorrow. Scott\u2019s story is inspiring simply because he\u2019s an example of what can happen when you fight to make it happen. Listen to Scott tell his story on this episode. You\u2019ll love it.\nSuccess leaves clues.\nAll along the way Scott read, learned, taught himself the ropes in a new field of endeavor, all because he believed that if someone else could achieve success, so could he - and he believed that their success left behind clues of how they got there. It was finding those clues and understanding how to apply them to his situation that enabled Scott to flex, pivot, and keep trying when others might have quit. Today, he\u2019s doing things he never imagined, teaching people, leading weekly webinars, and running a business that allows him to live the life of freedom he desires for himself and his family. Be sure to listen.

It\u2019s the number that shows how well a certain vendor\u2019s products are selling on Amazon and it tells you whether or not a product niche is one that is worth your time and effort to get into.

How can I get a custom product made?\nA listener called in to ask Scott about a product niche that he\u2019s very excited about, but he can\u2019t find anything even similar on Alibaba from wholesale companies. What should he do? Scott\u2019s idea is that he can use Alibaba to provide a drawing or description of what he\u2019s looking for and find out how much a supplier might charge him to create the product from scratch. It\u2019s a great way to differentiate yourself in a busy market and also a sure fire way to keep your product listings from being hijacked.

Is it true? If you simply throw a generic product on the Amazon sales engine and there is lots of competition for identical or similar products, maybe so. But you don\u2019t have to stop there. In this episode Scott Voelker is going to walk you through some very simple things you can do to make your private label products stand out in a crowded market. This episode is loaded with practical ideas and tips to make your products different and attractive even if this market is crowded.\nYou need to think about your market, not just one product.\nWhen offering products on Amazon you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that you\u2019re not just selling a product, you\u2019re entering a market and you want to DOMINATE that market by offering products that meet the needs of the market in unique and truly helpful ways. What does that mean practically? It means you don\u2019t just want to load up your seller account with products, you want to make your products themselves unique so that they get more eyes on them, more attention, and eventually more sales. You want your product to be the top selling product, the most popular product, and you do that by making sure that your items are customized in ways that matter to the end user, the customer. In this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott walks through 5 ways you can make your products stand out so they can be positioned to take over your market.\nThe text you put on your product page matters - a lot.\nProduct descriptions are one of your main opportunities to make your product stand out, to outline and specifically highlight the difference between yours and those of your competition. You\u2019ve got to become adept at telling about your product in ways that catch attention and draw people to give your product a second look. You can do that through the use of words like \u201cprofessional\u201d or \"heavy duty.\u201d Those words communicate quality and value that is not true of every product in the niche. That way you can appeal to certain groups of buyers, like those who use your type of product in a professional capacity. There\u2019s a ton more that can be said about this issue, and Scott covers a lot of it on this episode, so give it a listen.\nOversized items can expand your sales in ways you\u2019ve never considered.\nMost Amazon sellers don\u2019t stock oversized items for many reasons. They may have a higher cost so it\u2019s a more difficult place to enter a market. They typically cost more to ship to Amazon so there\u2019s another barrier. But if you can get your mind around one simple fact you\u2019ll see that oversized items might be your ticket to success. What\u2019s that fact? It\u2019s that most other Amazon sellers are staying away from oversized products for the same reasons you are. That leaves a huge hole in the market that you can fill. So as your business becomes more profitable, consider investing in oversized items as an addition to your product line. You could be stepping into a vacuum that\u2019s been left in the market that will set your company apart in your niche, and begin capturing sales that nobody is currently meeting. Scott\u2019s got more to say about oversized items, so be sure to listen.\nCustomizing your products means more than just putting your logo on it.\nLot\u2019s of Amazon sellers understand the need to have products that are difficult to copy or imitate. But there\u2019s more to it than simply putting your logo on it. You\u2019ve got to research your market niche to find out what customers are looking for and figure out a way to provide it for them. How do you do that? One powerful way is to check out the reviews on products within your niche. Oftentimes customers will tell you exactly what they wish was different about the product they just bought. As you read more reviews you\u2019ll begin to see patterns. Those wishes are actually requests for YOU to make a better product especially fo...", "duration": "32:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS123.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1447059603, "title": "TAS 122 : Update For Launching First Amazon Product + Unique Review Strategy with Matt Ward", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Welcome to this episode of The Amazing Seller. Today Scott\u2019s got a couple of very important things to cover and he doesn\u2019t waste any time getting to them. Both come from today\u2019s guest, Matt Ward. The first has to do with introducing your very first Amazon product to the market. The other issue has to do with a unique strategy that Matt is using to get reviews for his products. It\u2019s an interesting idea and Scott\u2019s not sure what he thinks about it \u00a0yet, but he wanted to you to hear about it so you can make up your own mind. We\u2019re also going to hear what Matt\u2019s doing to prepare for a smooth exit from his private label business when he\u2019s ready to sell it. All of that and lots more details are on this episode.\nThere is more than one way to launch your Amazon product.\nToday\u2019s guest, Matt Ward is living proof of that. One of Matt\u2019s strongest beliefs is that Facebook is one of the greatest email list building services in the world. How does that work? Matt has become a member of many FB groups and builds his relationships inside those groups with an eye toward making connections that could eventually get people onto his email list for product discounts, purchases, and announcements about new products he\u2019s developing. Within a matter of days he found himself building a pretty substantial email list simply by making a 50% discount offer to anyone who sent him their email address. It\u2019s how he builds a list to help him not only with one product but with a series of products that are in the same niche. Hear more about his approach to using Facebook in this episode.\n\u201cI would never sell a product that didn\u2019t connect with other products.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Matt Ward said when Scott asked him if his products were related within a specific niche on Amazon. He\u2019s convinced that it makes the most sense to build a business, not just a few scattered or unrelated products that bring in money. The business approach enables him to tie the products together in a way where cross promotion is natural and the same people who buy one of his products would naturally be interested in the others. It\u2019s smart business and it works. You can hear more of what Matt\u2019s got to say about his approach to Amazon Private Label sales on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nDo you have a follow up sequence for your email list?\nFor that matter, do you even have an email list at all? Scott\u2019s long said that building an email list of people who are interested in what you have to offer is essential to making future product sales and launches happen much faster and with greater overall success. Matt Ward, today\u2019s guest, agrees. He\u2019s been able to use some of his blog content as trickle-out content that he sends through is email list to keep his customers or interested prospects engaged with his brand. That way he\u2019s able to stay top of mind\u2026 and when a new product comes out, they are used to hearing from him already. That\u2019s just one of the gold nuggets Matt shares on this episode so make sure you take some time to listen to how he\u2019s running his FBA business, on this episode.\nHow important are Amazon reviews for your product ranking?\nMatt Ward (today\u2019s guest) is convinced that product reviews are essential, but not because they help your product rank higher in Amazon. He\u2019s got a few products that are going up against competition that has thousands of reviews, but his product, which only has 50 reviews, outranks theirs at times. What\u2019s the catch? He\u2019s outselling them most of the time. He\u2019s convinced that ranking on the search page in Amazon has to do with your sales volume more than anything else. Reviews are good for social proof, showing prospective buyers that your product is legitimate and that you are a trustworthy company. Matt\u2019s got lots of insights to share and you can hear all of them on this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:03] Scott\u2019s welcome to this episode.\n\t[1:40] A TAS posting Scott wanted to share - from Brady Cook!", "duration": "37:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS122.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1446800438, "title": "TAS 121 : Ask Scott Session #32 \u2013 Amazon FBA Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Welcome, welcome, welcome! You\u2019ve found the place where Amazing Amazon sellers come together to get their Amazon private label sales questions answered by someone who\u2019s becoming increasingly successful doing exactly that. This is the Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d session of The Amazing Seller podcast, where Scott Voelker answers your questions about selling on Amazon. The questions today are all over the board - what to do in a crowded market - how to go about setting up a brand to sell in a few years - what to do about sea freight issues - and how to use the new Amazon PPC. As you can see, there\u2019s a lot to learn on this episode so stick around and hear Scott\u2019s advice!\nDoes a crowded market automatically mean I shouldn\u2019t try to introduce a new product?\nScott gets this question all the time and he says that whether or not the market is crowded is not the thing that matters. Why? Because many people will make the attempt at selling on Amazon on a whim, or will introduce a product into a hot market on a hunch without doing the research and work needed to ensure that their product is going to rise to the top in that market. What winds up happening is that those sellers have sent in lots of products to their Amazon warehouse and they\u2019re just sitting there. So when you look at a category that has 100 competitors, it\u2019s likely that many of those are not selling at all. So how do you discern the right thing to do? Scott\u2019s got a clear answer to that question on this episode!\nI want to set up an entire product line on Amazon for the purpose of selling the entire business 3 to 5 years from now. Do you have any tips for me? \u00a0\nIt\u2019s becoming more and more common that savvy sellers are recognizing the opportunities that could come of building a very competitive and popular brand for the very purpose of selling the entire business they\u2019ve built sometime in the future. Why does that strategy work? Because there are many, many people out there who have the money to get into a good, steady-income business but don\u2019t have the skill (or don\u2019t want to learn the skill) to build that business themselves. It\u2019s THOSE kinds of people who are ideal candidates for buying an Amazon private label business like this listener is asking about. So what tips and tricks would position this seller to best sell his business when the time comes? Scott\u2019s got plenty to say about this and you can hear the entire thing on this episode.\nMy supplier is insisting that they will ship to my local port\u2026 but my city doesn\u2019t have a port. What should I do?\nSometimes sourcing products from China or other foreign places brings with it a certain set of difficulties that you don\u2019t always expect. One of those is the misunderstandings that come from the challenges associated with language barriers. It can become very difficult to communicate exactly what you want or need and you\u2019ve got to know how to be clear, patient, and kind as you work out those details. This seller is running into that issue regarding shipping and isn\u2019t sure what to do. Scott\u2019s advice is pretty simple: You take the lead and tell the supplier how you want the product shipped to you. If they are unwilling you may need to find a new supplier. OR, if you want to go the sea route, Scott\u2019s got a resource for you to consider. Check it out on this episode.\nAmazon PPC has changed\u2026 do you know how to use the match types?\nAmazon Pay Per Click used to be set up so that the only way you could position your ads was on a \u201cbroad\u201d match type. That approach costs you more money for ads that aren\u2019t going to convert and gets you less sales. But Amazon\u2019s recent changes do away with that problem. Now you can do PPC campaigns on three match types, \u201cbroad,\u201d \u201cphrase,\u201d and \u201cexact.\u201d A listener on today\u2019s show wants to hear Scott\u2019s approach to using those three match types and Scott\u2019s not one to disappoint.

Wouldn\u2019t it be great to get a behind-the-scenes look at how these big companies that create multiple brands go about doing business on Amazon? Well in today\u2019s episode of The Amazing Seller that\u2019s exactly what we have. Scott\u2019s guest is Jason Brunson. Jason is not only an Amazon Private Label seller himself, he\u2019s also worked for one of those large companies for a number of years and walks us through the step by step process of how these companies go about doing everything, from product research, to optimization of their listings and product fulfillment. It\u2019s a great episode with lots of tips and encouragement. Be sure you give it a listen!\nGetting started on Amazon with Arbitrage through used book sales.\nJason and his wife heard about the possibility of selling products on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Their first venture was using the arbitrage model. They chose to find good used books to sell on Amazon and actually made a decent amount of income each month. That\u2019s when Jason saw an advertisement on Craigslist that was offering positions to people to work for a company that sold a variety of products on Amazon. He applied and was hired. At first he worked in the customer service area but very quickly was moved to marketing, where he worked on Amazon listing and product sales. He eventually took what he learned at his place of employment and started applying it to his own Amazon business and now is doing his own private label sales. As usual, Scott\u2019s got lots of questions so be sure you listen so you can glean from Jason\u2019s experience.\nHow does a company with 8 brands and 1500 SKUs operate on Amazon?\nBelieve it or not, the larger companies appear to do their product selection and research as well as their marketing and product sales very similar to what the \u201clittle guy\u201d Amazon sellers do. The main variables have to do with the company\u2019s willingness to try products and order larger batches to find those winner products. But in the end, the result is the same. They eventually find products that will sell consistently and use them as a basis to build a new brand. From there, you guessed - they add products to the product line and build out the brand. What do they do with all the products they\u2019ve tried but haven\u2019t turned out to be good sellers? You\u2019ll have to listen to the episode to find out, PLUS hear lots more tips and insights Jason gives us, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nFilling in the income gaps during slow times of the year.\nOne of the things Jason Brunson shares with Scott on this episode of The Amazing Seller is that the larger companies are pretty strategic at making attempts to balance out their product sales throughout the year. That means, for example, that since fall time is a slow part of the sales cycle, they\u2019ll intentionally search for products that sell better in the fall time to add to their product line. This enables them to start generating income during a time when sales are usually down. Naturally, that balances out their income stream. Can you do this in your business? Scott thinks it\u2019s not only possible, but necessary. You can hear his comments and Jason\u2019s insights from what his company does by listening.\nHow can you find gaps in a market that you can fill?\nToday\u2019s guest, Jason Brunson, has worked for a company that has over 1500 SKUs in their Amazon account. They\u2019ve worked hard to choose products that fill gaps in their existing markets. This enables them to get sales that others are missing by offering something unique but potentially in demand. Jason said that in order to figure out what those products are they look at a number of things going on in a particular product niche. What are those things? Well, they\u2019re too many to list right here so set aside some time to listen tot his episode and you can find out.

It can be a confusing and difficult thing to learn. But you aren\u2019t alone in the process, Scott\u2019s here to help. Amazon recently made some changes to their PPC platform and Scott\u2019s put together this episode to help you understand the platform as a whole, learn about the changes, and know how to use Amazon\u2019s PPC platform to get more sales for your Amazon Products. Sound like something you\u2019re interested in? Then grab a pen and paper and get ready to take notes because you\u2019re about to get the whole scoop, step by step on this episode.\nIsn\u2019t Amazon PPC a confusing thing to learn?\nToday\u2019s guest, Chris Schaeffer doesn\u2019t think so. He\u2019s been an ecommerce and internet marketing specialist for years and he says that it\u2019s very easy. The new tweaks Amazon has made to their pay per click functionality makes it even easier than ever to maximize your marketing budget and increase your sales at the same time. In this episode Scott and Chris walk through the changes to the PPC interface and tell you exactly what the options mean, how to use them, and how to step by step increase your sales using Amazon Pay Per Click. It\u2019s an amazing free resource for you today on this episode.\nThe 3 different types of keyword matches in Amazon PPC and how to use them.\nThe main changes to Amazon Pay Per Click that have come down the pike are the addition of some options for choosing the type of PPC campaign you want to run. Using these tools makes it much more likely you\u2019ll get your target buyers to see and click on your ads. The types are \u201cbroad\u201d, \u201cphrase\u201d and \u201cexact\u201d, with the option of adding negative keywords (things you don\u2019t want to rank for) as well. Using these and a little bit of patience you can figure out exactly which of your keywords are working and increase your PPC on those, which ones are not working (and remove them from your PPC altogether), and increase the likelihood of your Amazon private label sales. This episode walks you through how to do that, step by step.\nOnce my product is up and running and making decent sales, can I turn of PPC?\nToday\u2019s guest, Chris Schaeffer is a PPC and marketing expert and he says that you should never turn off your Amazon PPC campaigns, and here\u2019s his reason why: What\u2019s the worst that could happen? You have two top listing on the first page of the Amazon search - they click on your ad instead of your organic listing - and you still get a sale (more than likely). That\u2019s it. You always want to make sure that your products are being seen OVER your competition, that way you will have the ability to dominate the market when they don\u2019t. Find out how Chris suggests you set up your entire PPC campaign by listening to this episode.\nWhy learning Amazon PPC is so vitally important to your Amazon Private Label business.\nIf you learn how to use amazon PPC you\u2019ll have a huge advantage over your competition. It\u2019s the only sure-fire way to get your products in front of those who are looking for exactly what you have to offer. Your competition is likely not going to take the time or make the effort to learn this fairly simple way of getting your products up in the Amazon rankings, so that means you\u2019ve got a secret weapon you can use to advance your business ahead of theirs. Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that PPC on Amazon is too difficult to learn. It\u2019s not.

What are you doing to increase the sales on that product?\nThe past few episodes Scott has mentioned and even focused on the importance of researching the market depth of a potential product you want to sell on Amazon. It\u2019s a big deal and Scott knows how big because he neglected to do market depth research on his 2nd product. He\u2019s been very open about that fact and this listener asked Scott what he\u2019s doing with that product since it was launched without the necessary research. Is he doing things to ramp up the sales? Is he making modifications to the product or thinking of taking it off Amazon altogether? You\u2019ll get to hear Scott\u2019s detailed answer to this question on this episode of the Amazing Seller.\nWhat do you mean when you say that you want to diversify your product line?\nOne of the biggest things Scott has stressed over the past episodes is that you want to do more with your Amazon Private Label efforts than just sell a product. You want to build a business. That means that you want to have a product line rather than just one product. Why is it important to do that? Because a product line gives you more opportunity for sales within a niche, which enables each product to feed the same customers toward the other products within your product line. You\u2019re building a user base that will begin to know, like, and trust your entire business rather than just one product. That equals more cash for you and more satisfaction and happy customers to spread the news about your products. A listener is asking Scott what he\u2019s doing to diversify his product line and in this episode, Scott gives a detailed answer.\nI\u2019m starting out on Amazon PPC and wondering which match type I should use?\nAmazon PPC (Pay per click) can be a very confusing monster to a newbie. Scott remembers the task it was to figure it out for himself. This listener is just getting started using Amazon Pay Per Click and is curious which \u201cmatch type\u201d he should use. There are three different options and each of them has a very specific function, so it\u2019s a very good question. When Scott responds to this listener on this episode he gives a clear description of what each match type means and how he goes about determining which will work best for his specific products. A quick hint: It involves testing.\nI have someone who\u2019s approached me about setting up their products on Amazon. What do you think? Should I do it?\nThis listener has stumbled upon a potential source of great additional income. A company in his area has a very unique and distinct line of health supplements and has asked him to help them get their products onto the Amazon sales platform. In fact, they\u2019ve offered him a position doing it for their company. He\u2019s listened to all of Scott\u2019s teaching on the 5 step launch formula and feels that he\u2019s ready to give it a try, but he\u2019s never actually done it himself for his own products. He\u2019s curious what Scott thinks. Should he give it a try? Hear Scott\u2019s response plus some additional thoughts about taking this kind of approach to building your own business through helping others build theirs.

What are things you should do when picking a product to private label? More importantly, what are the things you should NOT do? On this episode of the Amazing Seller Scott\u2019s going to walk you through 3 of the most commonly made mistakes when it comes to product selection. With each of those points he\u2019s going to give you the details of what the mistake is, why it\u2019s a mistake, and how to avoid it. Can you see how valuable this episode is going to be? Make sure you set aside some time to listen.\nDepth of a product market is huge. What is it and how do you figure it?\nIf you are considering a product in a certain area you need to assess what Scott calls the \u201cdepth of market.\u201d What is that? It\u2019s a way of gauging the demand for a product to see if there is enough room for you to insert another variation of that product into the mix and have a chance of making enough profit. Figuring the depth of market has to do with analyzing the top 10 selling versions of that product and getting the average sales volume of each, from 1 to 10. Then you want to assess if the volume being sold is enough to leave room for your product. Sound confusing? It\u2019s not that hard, but Scott explains it a lot better on this episode, so be sure to listen.\nYou also need to look at the volume and placement of reviews for the product you\u2019re considering.\nWhy are reviews important? Because the amount of reviews a product gets, throughout all the variations and sellers, is going to tell you which of those products is a better seller and which are not doing so well. If you have 10 sellers of the same product and the top two have a ton of reviews, but none of the others have many at all, you might want to reconsider selling a similar product. Why? Because you\u2019ll be fighting an uphill battle to make any headway in that niche - the top sellers already have the market on that product kind of buttoned down. Hear Scott\u2019s explanation and tips on this issue by listening.\nConsidering price when you select a new product.\nIf you aren\u2019t careful to look at the issue of pricing when you select a new product to private label, you could get yourself into a world of hurt. Let\u2019s take an example. If you see 6 different products for sale in the niche you\u2019re considering and one of them is priced at $14.99 but all the others are much lower, you\u2019re going to have a hard time introducing a new product into that market. Why? Because it\u2019s pretty clear that the main competition for that product is based on price, so it\u2019s always going to come down to which seller is willing to make the smallest margin, which means you have to sell tons more products in order to really make a profit that\u2019s worth all the effort. So be careful when it comes to price. Make sure you\u2019re getting into a product niche that has plenty of room for you to fit in and take some of the sales.

That\u2019s because Scott\u2019s gone out of his way to track down and schedule this conversation with Kizzy Rucker, an Amazon Top 500 reviewer. Why would Scott do that? Because understanding the weight and significance \u00a0Amazon gives to reviewers, and especially those it deems prominent reviewers, could greatly impact the way you solicit reviews, get people to leave them, and even approach top reviewers to ask them to check out and review your product. This is an amazing conversation you\u2019re going to love!\nWhy would a person try to become an Amazon Top reviewer?\nKizzy Rucker, who is a Top 500 Reviewer on Amazon, says that there are a wide variety of reasons people might work to become a top reviewer on Amazon. For some it\u2019s as simple as getting free or reduced price products. For others it\u2019s the prestige of getting the little badge on the side of their profile that shows them as a top reviewer. For others, there are black hat, unethical practices they engage in to use their top reviewer status for personal gain. But for Amazon sellers, the Top Reviewer badge is a sign that a review by that person could mean a lot for your product in terms of sales and in terms of credibility. Find out more form Kizzy as she shares the inside world of an Amazon Top reviewer on this episode.\nDo Top Reviewers actually lend clout to your product if they decide to review it?\nThink about it from a buyer\u2019s perspective. If you are considering a product and notice a Top Reviewer has reviewed the product, you would likely pay close attention to what they had to say simply because Amazon sees them as an important source of feedback. Now imagine if that reviewer left a glowing review or a video review that sang the praises of the product. You\u2019d be much more likely to consider that product above others because a somewhat reputable source said it was worth buying. On top of all that, Amazon likely bumps products higher in search results simply because they have reviews by those recognized top reviewers. Find out how to take advantage of the top reviewers for your products, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nDid you know there is software that can help you contact the top reviewers in your niche?\nIt\u2019s true. A product Scott has mentioned numerous times on The Amazing Seller podcast, Amisuite, has functionality that enables you to find those top reviewers, research the actual products and reviews they\u2019ve left on other products within your niche, and give you the proper way to contact them. But you want to make sure that if you do contact those top reviewers to ask them to review your product that you do it in a personal, considerate way? What\u2019s that look like? You\u2019ll have to hear this episode of the podcast to hear what a top reviewer herself said about that issue. You\u2019ll be surprised at the kind of things that happen behind the scenes of a top Amazon reviewer.\nWhat is the best way to go about asking an Amazon Top Reviewer to review your product?\nKizzy Rucker is a top 500 reviewer for Amazon and has her own particular ways of dealing with and responding to review requests. She says that the top reviewers all get many, many emails a day asking for a review on products. Her recommendations are simple: Keep it short and get to the point. Be real (an obvious form letter will get you deleted right away). Show that you\u2019ve done your homework and know something about the reviewers\u2019 likes and past reviews. Make a connection on a personal level. Don\u2019t pester the reviewer after the product has been sent. Trust them to do their job.

Today\u2019s show is full of information that will apply to newbies and seasoned Amazon vets alike. It features a question about product reviews and feedback, barcodes and SKUs, and how to scale your product sales from 10 a day to an even higher number. There\u2019s so much practical stuff in this episode you need to make sure to carve out the time to listen.\nProduct Reviews are being left in my Seller Feedback section. What\u2019s the best thing to do?\nThis seems to be a common problem that many Amazon Private Label sellers find happening now and again: A customer leaves a great product reviews, but they do it in the seller feedback section. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to flip a switch and just move it over to the product where it belongs? But sad to say, that\u2019s not possible. You really only have 3 choices: #1 - Leave it where it is. At least that way you\u2019ve got some positive vibes about yourself and your products for all the world to see. #2 - Ask Amazon Seller Support to remove it. They will if you ask them, but ask yourself, \u201cWhy would I want to remove it?\u201d #3 - Contact the person who left the feedback and ask them to leave a similar posting under the product reviews section. Hear how Scott advises you go about doing all 3 of those steps, in this episode.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a barcode and a product SKU?\nAs today\u2019s questioner said, this is a basic question but it\u2019s one that needs answered because there are many, many new Amazon sellers who are listening to the show each week. The barcode is something you need for each individual product and each variation of a product. It\u2019s the identifier to which the price is attached, and you have to have a barcode to set up a listing on the Amazon sales platform. A SKU is a different matter. It\u2019s a product identifier unique to your product that Amazon assigns to each of your products. Scott\u2019s going to tell you how to find your SKU for each product and if you need to have it printed on your packaging or not. It\u2019s all in this episode. \nMy first product averages 10 sales per day already. What are the steps I can take to scale up my sales even more?\nThat\u2019s a great problem to have, wouldn\u2019t you say? 10 sales a day is great but as this listener implies, it\u2019s going to be even better if that number can increase. So what can be done? Scott\u2019s answer to this question is a bit more complicated than a 1-2-3 formula. There are a handful of variables like sales depth of your particular product that you need to consider. So take the time to hit the play button on this episode so you can hear Scott\u2019s advice and know how to apply it to your specific market niche. You\u2019ll be glad you did when you see your product sales starting to increase.\nYou need a supportive community around you. Scott\u2019s created one you can join for free.\nIn his time as an Amazon seller Scott has learned that the encouragement, advice, and support he receives from a community of Amazon sellers is one of the most important things in his business success and positive \u201ctake action\u201d mindset. He created the TAS Facebook Community to serve as a place that you can build those relationships and it works in that way wonderfully.

How is it possible? It takes dedication, attention to detail, and lots of hard work. Scott is happy to highlight Jaime\u2019s success story here today because it\u2019s proof not only that an Amazon Private Label business can work, but that anyone can do it\u2026 even people who are busy or working full time already. So grab a pencil and paper (you\u2019re going to need it) and take some good notes because Jaime drops a couple of mind bombs on us in this episode.\nThe value of \u201cJust in Time\u201d learning\u2026 and how Jaime did it in his business.\nIn the process of building any business there are so many details, so many ins and outs to pay attention to that it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed. Very easy. Building an Amazon Private Label business is exactly the same. That\u2019s why Scott advocates and practices what he calls \u201cjust in time\u201d learning, which is the process Jaime followed in establishing his business and products on Amazon. What is JITL? It\u2019s doing enough research and study of the process to do the next step only. That way you are able to focus, do one thing at a time, and move ahead only when you\u2019re ready. You\u2019re not looking at 20 steps in the whole process, you\u2019re just focusing on one. Hear how Jaime applied the JITL approach to his product research, samples, launch, and sales in this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nPay attention when you start interacting with potential product suppliers. You can learn a lot.\nThis is one of the biggest info bombs Jaime drops in this episode of the podcast. He contacted many suppliers to potentially source his products and then he started watching their interactions with him. Did they respond promptly? Did they respond professionally? Were they easy to communicate with? Did they send things to him in the appropriate time frame and in packaging that was right for the product? All of these things added up to show him whether the company he was talking with was trustworthy, concerned about quality, and reliable to do what they said they would do. Jaime explains it so much better from his real life experience, so you\u2019ll want to listen to this interview.\nLogos and branding issues for Amazon Private Label Products can be a pain.\nMany people find a designer on Fiverr or someplace similar to create their logos, take their product photos, etc. And that\u2019s a fine way to go about it, but both Jaime and Scott have found that finding someone local to where they lived was a wonderful thing. Why? The communication and time frames were much better, the quality was great, and the ability to be a part of the process was so much easier. Jaime even went to his product photo shoot and got to give input on how he wanted the products displayed and photographed. It\u2019s another tip Jaime shares from his success that you can take from this amazing episode.\n30 minutes a day to keep his Amazon product updates and rolling.\nNo kidding. Now keep in mind, we\u2019re not talking about the product research and launch phase. This is after all that work has been done and the product is live on Amazon for the first time. Watching the stats and sales, keeping products supplied, tweaking PPC campaigns, responding to customer issues - all of it takes 30 minutes a day or less. How it that possible? Because Amazon does the heavy lifting by handling all your marketing, shipping, and sales. It\u2019s an amazing business to get into. Now don\u2019t hear that to mean that it\u2019s easy. The product identification and launch process is anything but\u2026 but it\u2019s a rewarding way to build a business, not just an income stream.

In this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott\u2019s going to go over what he considers to the 5 myths about giveaways and reviews. He\u2019ll take the time to explain the panic, correct the myth, and tell you want he believes is appropriate to do in the scenario mentioned. You\u2019ll get some practical advice about this vital part of your product launch strategy if you\u2019ll take the time to listen, so why not click over and hit the play button right now?\nMYTH 1: Amazon doesn\u2019t allow you to do product giveaways anymore.\nScott\u2019s not quite sure where this one came from but it\u2019s clear from reading Amazon\u2019s own terms of service for seller accounts that even Amazon believes that the giveaways and reviews are an integral part of how their platform works. Scott believes giveaways and reviews are something you not only should be doing, but that you HAVE to be doing. In this episode you can find out why he says that and also hear the important WAYS you go about soliciting reviews and making the most of giveaways. This episode could be instrumental in helping you get your product launch off the ground in a big way.\nMYTH 3: You can\u2019t ask family or friends to leave a review anymore.\nScott\u2019s take on this is kind of unique. He believes that especially at the front end of your product launch you SHOULD ask family and friends to do reviews of your products, even if they are \u201cunverified\u201d reviews. Why? Because Amazon doesn\u2019t know who all your family or friends are\u2026 neither do they know whether they bought your product someplace besides Amazon or not. Even if the powers that be at Amazon are able to determine that someone who left a review is a family member, the worst that will happen is that they will remove that review. But between the time it is left and the time Amazon removes it, it may have helped you get 2 or 3 or more sales because it was there. Scott\u2019s got some actionable advice on this subject, so be sure you listen.\nMYTH 5: I shouldn\u2019t use a review service to get reviews.\nThere\u2019s been a TON of panic around this topic, some people saying that the reviews left by review service participants will flag your account and get you banned, others saying it\u2019s no big deal to use a review service at all. Which is true? As usual, Scott has his own take on this and it\u2019s somewhere in the middle of those two extremes. Are you eager to hear what he has to say? Go ahead and listen to this episode (it\u2019s only 26 minutes long)!\nAre you just getting started with Amazon Private Label Sales?\nIf so, Scott\u2019s got a great gift for you - and it\u2019s ENTIRELY FREE!

So grab a pen and paper to take some great notes because you\u2019re going to hear some real-world scenarios with Scott\u2019s real-world advice to go along with it. Enjoy!\nCustoms fees and tariffs: What should I plan on for my product?\nScott often gets questions about customs, which makes total sense, since most people have never ordered a product from overseas before. Most of the time customs are not concerned with one or two products at a time, like the samples you should order to check out potential products. It\u2019s when you start buying in larger quantities that customs will become an issue. So what are the customs fees and what should you expect? Honestly, it depends. It depends on the exact product you are shipping, what niche it is in, it\u2019s weight and quantity, and many other variables. Most of the time Scott lets his shipper (DHL) handle his customs issues but not always. There\u2019s really too much detail to type out right here, so be sure to listen to this episode to hear Scott\u2019s detailed answer.\nAmazon just lost my products! How often does that happen and what can I do about it?\nIt\u2019s not really common, but it does happen that Amazon itself will lose or damage one of your product shipments. But thankfully, the Amazon representatives are usually very helpful in resolving these issues and Amazon policies themselves are in your favor. If Amazon loses a product or damages a product that you\u2019ve sent in, they will pay you for the listed sales price of your product, minus all the Amazon fees, naturally. But they won\u2019t do so unless you ask them to do it. So pick up the phone and call a seller support representative to get the ball rolling. They will be able to verify that the product is lost and issue the money for the products to your accounts. Find out how Scott goes about doing this himself, on this episode.\nI\u2019ve only got $700 to get started on Amazon. What should I do first?\nThis is a common question that Scott fields from newbie sellers and it\u2019s very understandable. It\u2019s wise to mitigate your risks as much as possible, so asking is part of how you learn to do that. What would Scott do if he had $700 and was starting all over? The first thing he\u2019d do would be to prepare for his monthly Seller Account fee. It\u2019s part of what you\u2019ll need to pay in order to have the privilege of selling on Amazon. Next, he\u2019d either do retail arbitrage to turn that $700 into $2000 over the holiday season, or he\u2019d follow the steps a TAS community member did in his \u201cTAS $500 challenge.\u201d You can hear all of Scott\u2019s advice about starting from scratch by listening to this episode. \nI have 3 great products according to the numbers, but would like to get some advice from an expert without having my ideas ripped off.\nThis listener has done his product research and feels he has 2 or 3 products within a niche from which he can build a brand. Way to go! But before he moves ahead he\u2019d like to run the numbers by someone who\u2019s experienced in the Amazon world to make sure he\u2019s looking at everything correctly. His main concern is that the person who looks at his numbers might steal the idea and begin offering those products themselves. How can he find a trusted advisor? As you might imagine, Scott\u2019s got some thoughts about that conundrum and you\u2019ll hear his answer if you listen to this episode.\nOUTLINE OF THIS Q&amp;A EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:03] Welcome and introduction to this Q&amp;A episode and how to submit your questions!\n\t[1:00] A shout out to a TAS Facebook Community member: Yassar Mack", "duration": "29:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS112.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1444809607, "title": "TAS 111 : How To Buy and Sell Profitable Amazon Businesses (Step by Step)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "You\u2019ve heard of house flipping. And possibly you\u2019ve heard of website flipping. Well in this episode we\u2019re talking about at potentially new way to flip Amazon businesses, or just sell one you already own. Today Scott is chatting with a previous guest, Ty Rooney about an idea Ty has come up with to create a website interface to allow buyers and sellers of Amazon businesses to come together, exchange information, and consummate a sale of an already existing, profitable private label business on \u00a0Amazon. It\u2019s an amazing idea\u2026 very appropriately featured on this episode of The Amazing Seller!\nTy Rooney\u2019s built his own private label business and is helping others build theirs.\nTy was featured back on episode 33 of The Amazing Seller as an up and coming private label business owner and his business has taken off since then, just as he expected. But as he was building out his business he had another idea: help companies with existing products get their products on Amazon. He\u2019s discovered a great niche and his expertise with the Amazon Seller Central interface has enabled him to work up to 20 clients whose accounts he manages. It\u2019s that expertise that\u2019s led him to consider this another new idea: helping Amazon sellers sell their businesses to interested buyers. It\u2019s a great idea\u2026 one you\u2019ll hear about in detail on this episode.\nWhy would you want to sell a profitable Amazon business?\nThe steady cash flow of most profitable Amazon businesses makes them a very desirable type of business to have. So why would you want to sell one? There are many reasons. Though you can streamline an Amazon business like no other, there\u2019s still some work involved in reordering products, etc. It may be that an Amazon seller simply gets burned out and wants to try something different. Selling their business could be a great option\u2026 and there are plenty of business people out there who are eager to invest in businesses with a proven track record of profits. Ty Rooney and Scott Voelker have assembled a team of people who are working toward an Amazon Business brokerage that would help buyers and sellers make those deals happen. You can hear all the details by listening to this episode.\nWhat is my Amazon business worth if I wanted to sell it?\nNaturally, there are many variables to determining how much any business is worth. And the Amazon model is still new enough that there\u2019s no established track record of business sales to go by. But Ty Rooney has been doing his homework to work toward an Amazon business broker site and believes that the average Amazon business that is profitable could likely sell for at least 20 times its monthly net. So an Amazon private label sales business that is bringing in $2,000 a month could potentially sell for $40,000 or more. Do you see the possibilities? Ty has lots to share on this episode so be sure to listen.\nBuy an already profitable Amazon business that is fully vetted by experts.\nThat\u2019s one aspect of the idea Ty Rooney has for his Amazon business brokerage. Since he and his team are experts on how the Amazon Seller Central platform works, they would investigate the numbers on every business that is submitted for sale through their site. That way every claim made by a business owner about the profitability and track record of their Amazon business would be verified by an independent 3rd party. Buyers would be assured that the numbers they are hearing about their potential business purchase are accurate. Can you imagine the potential for this idea?

Today\u2019s episode of The Amazing Seller features someone who was in your shoes not long ago. Tyson Starling got into private label sales through retail arbitrage and became convinced early on that Amazon\u2019s platform could be a powerful way for him to build his income. He did the product research, built his listing, then ordered his first sample of products. He took action, which is exactly what YOU have got to do if you\u2019re going to make a go of it on Amazon. Hear Tyson\u2019s story on this episode.\nRetail arbitrage is a great stepping stone into private label sales.\nTyson Starling was doing retail arbitrage on Amazon way before he got into selling private label products. He feels that the experience he had working with the Amazon system and learning about the way things work was instrumental in him being able to move into sales of his own products without too much of a learning curve. He admits that retail arbitrage sales is tougher and time intensive, but he suggests it for anyone who\u2019s a bit unsure about whether Amazon is right for them. Find out how Tyson made the transition from retail arbitrage to private label products on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nYour first time dealing with a foreign supplier is very nerve wracking.\nIt\u2019s hard enough doing all the product research and settling on a product without knowing 100% that it\u2019s going to be a winner for you. To take that additional step to find the product you want and to send a big chunk of money\u2026 THAT is stress! Tyson Starling felt that and more when he ordered his first set of products and to make matters worse the email server at his supplier\u2019s office got hacked and he wound up having to jump through some extra hoops to make sure things were done properly. Hear Tyson\u2019s tips about dealing with suppliers by tuning in to this episode.\nWhy Scott always recommends your first order of private label products be shipped directly to you.\nYes, you can save money by having your supplier send your products directly to Amazon, and many sellers do that without any problems. But Scott is convinced that in order to make sure your business and brand are represented by quality products, you\u2019ve got to take the additional (and sometimes more expensive) step of receiving your first batch of products so you can check out everything about them yourself. Tyson Starling, today\u2019s guest, was so glad he received the first set of products he ordered because the packaging on all 500 products was all wrong. Because he knew about it he was able to get some new packaging ordered, communicate with his seller to correct the problem for future orders, and make sure his products were received in a a quality state by his customers.\nShould you try to sell a product when there\u2019s a big name competitor in the niche?\nMany Amazon Sellers turn away immediately when they see a big name brand company selling the same product they are considering. But Tyson Starling suggests you take a second look. In his thinking, the big brands are mostly selling through retail outlets throughout the world and Amazon is not their main area of focus. He believes (and is proving) that his products can compete with the big name simply because there\u2019s enough room within the Amazon marketplace for both to sell decently well. He\u2019s content to make the cash he\u2019s making, assuming that his small amount of sales is not going to threaten the big company enough to cause them to ramp up their efforts on Amazon.

Every Friday Scott Voelker answers questions that have been left on the voicemail app on the website. They could be about product selection, dealing with negative reviews, pricing, sourcing products from China, or anything else that has to do with selling your private label products on Amazon. You can ask your question by going to www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask - and Scott just might provide an answer on a future episode of Ask Scott!\nI\u2019ve got a handful of negative seller feedbacks and want to get my seller ranking to improve. How can I do it?\nIf you\u2019ve had issues where the people who have bought your products were not happy for some reason, there are some things you can do to deal with the negative feedback they may have left on your seller profile. First, contact them and offer to rectify the situation. You may need to simply refund their money and allow them to keep the product regardless. But either way, you\u2019re building good will about you and your brand, which could result in those people adjusting their seller feedback. You want your customers to be happy so do whatever it takes. But what can you do about the impact those reviews have had on your seller feedback? Find out by listening to Scott\u2019s response on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nI have a competitor who is slamming my products on their own product listings, saying that I don\u2019t have the right to sell the products myself. What can I do about this?\nIt is frustrating when your competitors seem bent on sullying your brand or products in order to try and get a leg up on you in the Amazon marketplace. Is there anything you can do about it? Yes, you can contact that seller and ask them to show you proof of the claims they\u2019re making or even send them a cease and desist letter to add a bit of pressure. You can also contact Amazon seller support to ask them to force the competitor to stop. But Scott recommends something else that you may not expect. Listen to this episode to hear his answer.\nAll of my products use the same basic keywords. How can I use Amazon PPC to target each product when the keywords are all the same?\nAmazon PPC is pretty confusing to use as it is. But when your products are similar, perhaps different variants of the same basic product, how can you differentiate within the PPC interface to drive traffic to a specific product? Scott\u2019s got some suggestions for this sort of situation on this episode that you\u2019ll want to hear. It\u2019s not only helpful for driving the actual traffic to the place you want it to go, but his response will also enable you to use PPC to do some research on what people are actually searching for in your niche. Interested? Listen in to hear more!\nAt what point should I consider using freight forwarders or shipping agents?\nObviously, you want to keep your Amazon business as streamlined and simple as possible. That way you maintain control of timelines and other things that impact the availability and sales of your products. But as your business grows you may need to find other solutions to help you expedite the sheer volume of products you\u2019re dealing with. Those solutions may include freight forwarding services or private shipping agents. At what point are these needed and how do you know if you\u2019re at that point? Scott gives some tips about those decisions and offers some other helpful suggestions about shipping in general in answer to this question.\nOUTLINE OF THIS Q&amp;A EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:03] Welcome to Session #28 of Ask Scott!\n\t[0:18] How you can ask your own question: www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask\n\t[0:56] What to expect on this episode.\n\t[1:14] A shout out to the TAS community on Facebook: www.TheAmazingSeller.com/FB\n\t[2:08] Scott\u2019s shout out to community member Thomas!\n\n\t[4:10] QUESTION ONE: How can I improve my seller ranking and how should I handle negative rev...", "duration": "30:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS109.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1444204835, "title": "TAS #108 : 5 Tips for Finding Profitable Products and Building a Strong Brand", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "It\u2019s not always easy for potential Amazon sellers to choose the right products to sell. That\u2019s because there are so many products possible and so many people already selling those products. How do you know which might be profitable? How do you know if there\u2019s enough room in the market for your product ideas? How do you know if you should take the chance? In this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott\u2019s going to walk you through the 5 steps he uses every time he\u2019s trying to figure out if a product idea is worth pursuing. And as a bonus, he\u2019s going to tell you why you should be thinking of building a brand, not just selling a product or two. It\u2019s an amazing episode you\u2019ll want to hear!\nThere is a lot of value of doing a brain dump.\nBefore you even start the 5 steps Scott covers in this episode he suggests you first do what he calls a \u201cbrain dump.\u201d You want to get out a sheet of paper and a pencil and write down every single idea you have about what products you might be able to sell or be interested in selling. As you do this you need to think about your passions, your pains and problems, your hobbies, and even the things that fall into those categories that were true of you in the past. These are great ways to tease ideas out of your head and onto paper so that you can look at all the options that appeal to you. From there, you\u2019ll have a direction to go. Hear the details of Scott\u2019s 5 steps by listening in to this episode.\nYou\u2019ve got to find the market that your products can serve.\nThe market your products will be sold to is simply the people who are interested in or desirous of your particular type of product. Are they baseball fans? Are they watchers of a particular television show? Are they moms who have a particular hobby on the side? You have to be able to answer what your target market is because knowing those people\u2019s interests is what\u2019s going to show you the wide variety of products they might be interested in, products which you could add to your product line.\nSo you have a product on Amazon\u2026 your next step is to begin thinking about a product line.\nWhat\u2019s the difference? A product is a one-time shot. You only have one opportunity to make a sale to people in your target market. But a product line is like having lots of hooks in the water. You have many more chances of getting a bite! A product line that is focused on one particular market is called a brand, and what you need to be doing is building a brand, which translates into having a legitimate business. Scott\u2019s going to cover the specifics of what it takes to build a reputable and viable brand on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nThere are at least 8 reasons you need to be thinking about building a brand rather than just a product line.\nA product line is just that\u2026 a line of generic, random products that fit within the same niche market. But a brand takes on a life of its own. A brand becomes something that consumers look for, by name, and can become loyal to over time. Imagine that, people who want exactly what you\u2019re offering who are looking for you and only you. There\u2019s amazing power and profit in being able to position your business in that sort of a relationship with your clients. It enables your business to soar to levels you never thought possible.

His site www.NichePursuits.com chronicles his experiments creating multiple niche based sites to generate varied streams of income to replace his J-O-B. He did it and has expanded to learn about SEO, website development, keyword research, and eventually to create his own software to do keyword research, www.LongTailPro.com. But when he heard about the possibilities of Amazon Private Label sales, Spencer just had to try it for himself. In this episode of The Amazing Seller you\u2019re going to hear Spencer\u2019s entire journey as an Amazon seller.\nWhy would a successful software developer give Amazon Private Label sales a try?\nSpencer Haws is not your average software developer. In fact, he\u2019s much more. Spencer\u2019s interest in Amazon Sales comes from the fact that he\u2019s naturally curious about the many ways that it\u2019s possible to make money online. He\u2019s always looking for recurring income, with as little administrative busywork and cost as possible. When he first heard about Amazon Private Label selling, it sounded too good to be true. He expected that there would be a huge time commitment, and there was at the beginning. But he soon realized that the potential of Amazon product sales far outweighs the drawbacks. Spencer shares his story and what he\u2019s learned so far on this episode.\nGenerating product ideas from the needs you have in our own life.\nDiscovering a real felt need in the marketplace can be a difficult thing to do. But Spencer Haws doesn\u2019t believe it really has to be all that difficult. His successful software, www.LongTailPro.com was developed for his own use simply because he had a need that none of the available software solutions could meet. It went on from there to become one of the most effective and widely-used SaaS products in the online business and blogging world. Spencer took that same belief into his Amazon Private Label sales efforts, believing that if he was experiencing a clear need that the marketplace was not providing a solution for, he couldn\u2019t be the only one. Hear how Spencer went about the product selection process in this great conversation.\nSpencer Haws knows something about keyword research and he\u2019s applying it to his Amazon product listings.\nKeyword research is often spoken of only in the blogging, SEO, and online marketing communities. But Spencer\u2019s expertise and experience as the head of a keyword research software company has shown him that every search algorithm, from Google to Amazon, uses keywords in one way or another. That belief has led him to do extensive keyword research relating to each of his Amazon Private Label products and the results have been amazing. The research has enabled him to rank for keywords his actual customers are using, but most of his competitors are not. The creative way he\u2019s been able to apply that skill is making all the difference. Find out more about Spencer\u2019s approach and beliefs regarding keyword research and your Amazon product listings, on this episode.\nDon\u2019t expect a lot of personal profit in your first six months as a Private Label seller.\nBut isn\u2019t that why we\u2019re doing this? To make money? Yes, it is, but you\u2019ve got to understand that you\u2019re building a business, not just a one-time source of income. That requires money to be invested back into the business so it can expand and solidify, building a base from which all your future income will flow. Most successful Amazon Sellers who make a living through their Amazon products spend the first 6 months (at least) putting their profits back into the business, and today\u2019s guest - \u00a0Spencer Haws - is one of them.

It sounds pretty scary, and in some ways it could be if you don\u2019t know how to stop it, but as always Scott\u2019s got some great, simple, actionable advice for you as to how you can protect yourself from your products being hijacked. Don\u2019t let it rattle you. You CAN take practical steps to safeguard your product listings from hijackers\u2026 now there\u2019s no guarantee all of this will prevent your product from being hijacked, but it will definitely make it much, much harder for it to occur. Listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller to hear all the details.\n\nNote and Update: Since this episode was recorded there's been a NEW tool created to monitor and help protect your listing from Hi-jackers. The tool is like a watch dog that notifies you by text and email if there's been any intruders.\nTry ListingEagle.com Here\n\n\u00a0 What is a \u201chijacked\u201d product on Amazon?\nYou\u2019ve done the research to find and purchase your first product. You\u2019ve listed it on Amazon. You\u2019ve got it labeled as your unique brand. Then suddenly you no longer have ownership or control of the \u201cbuy box\u201d on your own listing! Somebody has taken over your listing by sending products to Amazon that they \u201csay\u201d are identical to yours\u2026 but they CAN\u2019T be. You\u2019re the only one selling your products. You had them created just for you! Do you see the problem? Your sales will be impacted if you don\u2019t do something to remove the hijacker\u2019s products from your listing. How do you do it? That\u2019s what this episode is all about so be sure to listen.\nThe first steps to un-hijacking your product listing.\nWhat Scott recommends you do as the very first step if you see that your product has been hijacked is to send a \u201cCease and Desist\u201d letter to the hijacker. It\u2019s basically a legal-sounding, somewhat threatening letter warning the person of what could happen if they don\u2019t stop positioning their product as yours. They are breaking the Amazon terms of service and could be kicked off the platform, so you\u2019re using that possibility to motivate them to remove their product on their own. What exactly should you letter say? Scott reads an effective C&amp;D letter verbatim on this episode, so make sure you put it on slow play and get every word!\nThe importance of registering your brand.\nOne of the things Amazon has put in place to help you safeguard your listings from hijackers is the \u201cBrand Registry.\u201d It\u2019s a page on Amazon\u2019s site where you can go to register yourself as the owner of your brand, give Amazon a lot of details, and set yourself in a very good defensive position should your products ever be hijacked. Scott recommends that every Amazon Private Label seller register their brand immediately, the minute they begin putting their products on the Amazon sales platform. Find out how on this episode of The Amazing Seller or by using the link to the Amazon Brand Registry included in the show notes.\nIf your Amazon product is hijacked, buy one of the products they are selling.\nWhat? Why would you want to buy the product that\u2019s posing as yours? Because when you contact Seller Support at Amazon they are going to ask you to document exactly why the product listed is not your product. That means you\u2019ll need pictures of the product, detailed examples of how it is different from yours, and the overall ability to prove that it is not your product at all. So the minute you notice your product listing has been taken over, order one of the products. You\u2019ll be that much ahead when it comes to rectifying the situation because you\u2019ll be able to prove your product\u2019s uniqueness sooner.\nMake sure your product is uniquely different, as soon as possible.\nIt\u2019s OK to put labels or stickers on your products to \u201cbrand\u201d them when you first start selling on Amazon. But you can\u2019t be satisfied with that. Stickers are too easy to fake. You want to do something unique that will make it much harder for a hijacker to create a fake of your product.", "duration": "37:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS105.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1443427200, "title": "TAS 104 : The Exact Steps To Generating $30k in 3 Weeks (interview with Scott Thomas)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Every person who takes on the challenge of building their own business through Amazon\u2019s Private Label options dreams of hitting it big with real product success from the start. Today\u2019s episode highlights a guy who did just that. Scott Thomas and his partner stepped out of the ecommerce realm to try their hand at Amazon simply because the Amazon Sales platform is such a powerful machine for drawing in customers and closing sales. Even with their experience in Ecommerce they were shocked at how quickly their products took off. Hear the whole story on this episode.\nThe importance of quality checking your first order, yourself.\nScott and his partner put in their first order from a supplier in China and received it within a few months rather than having it sent directly to Amazon. They are very glad they did because there were a number of things wrong with the order. If it had reached Amazon as it was shipped things would have gone very wrong. Scott recommends that every Amazon Seller check their first couple of orders themselves to make sure everything is dialed in and the supplier knows exactly what to do every time. Hear more of Scott\u2019s advice on the Amazing Seller.\nA novel way of getting the first 20 sales of his product and the impact it had.\nScott Thomas and his partner have gone through Scott Voelker\u2019s material and knew they could get sales and reviews by offering discounts on their product. But they had a hunch that if they had full price sales within the first few days of their product being listed, they\u2019d bounce higher in the rankings almost immediately. So they explained what they were doing to 20 close friends and asked them to purchase their product at full price to help them get things rolling. Those 20 sales came in within a few days and things happened exactly as they suspected. Find out more about how Scott combined that tactic with Amazon PPC in this episode.\nHow should you go about determining modifications to make to your Private Label products to make them unique and more appealing to buyers?\nScott Thomas discovered that one of the best ways to find out what consumers want is to spend time reading posts in the forums where your ideal customers hang out. They often talk about specific products and their gripes and gratitude surrounding those products. From there a ton of ideas come up that enable Scott to make the modifications that people buying their products actually want. That\u2019s just one of Scott\u2019s tactics and you can hear the rest by listening to this episode.\nGet on board Scott Voelker\u2019s free live workshop to learn how to do Amazon Sales.\nIf you\u2019ve never attended one of Scott\u2019s free live workshops to learn the basics of how he sells products on Amazon, you\u2019re missing out.

This is YOUR opportunity to get your questions answered about Amazon FBA, Private Labeling, Product Launching, and a whole boatload of other stuff having to do with Amazon sales. And you\u2019ll get answers from Scott Voelker, a guy who\u2019s been there, done it, and is still doing it successfully every single day. Scott is not one of those guys who teases you in with a little bit of knowledge and then tries to sell you a course to fill in the blanks. He doesn\u2019t hold anything back.

So ask your question by going to www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask and Scott will see what he can do to include your question in an upcoming edition of \u201cAsk Scott.\u201d\nA question from this episode about LeadPages and email follow up\u2026\nScott often refers to setting up a landing page and one of the services he uses to do that is called LeadPages. It\u2019s a ready-made sales/landing page that you can direct people to in order to get them signed up on your customer mailing list. A listener asks Scott how he can go about setting up a LeadPage for his business when he doesn\u2019t have a website. Scott\u2019s got good news for him - you don\u2019t have to have a website in order to use LeadPages.

He\u2019s doing merchant fulfillment instead of Amazon FBA (fulfilled by Amazon) and is NOT seeing his product in the \u201cbuy box.\u201d Why is that? Could it have to do with the fact that he\u2019s not using FBA? Could it be that a competitor is hijacking his product listing? Listen to Scott\u2019s answer to get the full story.\nA product review was left as seller feedback. How should I handle that? \n A new Amazon seller asks Scott a question relating to seller feedback. Seller feedback is the place where purchasers of your products are able to leave comments and ratings about the service you gave them. This person\u2019s customer left a pretty good product review (4 stars) but did it in the seller feedback area. Should the seller remove the comments? Should they contact the buyer and ask them to leave it in the Amazon Product Review section? Scott\u2019s advice is spot on, as always. Find out what it is by listening to this episode.\nAmazon\u2019s terms of service regarding product giveaways have changed. Is it worth me doing a giveaway at all?\nIt\u2019s true. Amazon has recently changed its terms of service regarding product giveaways. It\u2019s a topic that\u2019s getting lots of buzz and has many people worried that their giveaways to generate product reviews are going to earn them a slap by Amazon. Is this true? Scott\u2019s not all that worried about it and is continuing to do his product giveaways as he always has. Can you guess why?

It\u2019s one of the best ways to see what\u2019s working, the hurdles that Amazon sellers face every step of the way, and the kind of success that everyday people can achieve if they are willing to take action. This conversation is with a long-time friend of Scott\u2019s who has been around since the beginning of this podcast. Bill has moved from retail arbitrage to private label sales and his first product is now selling 30 units a day or more. How did Bill do it? Scott\u2019s got all the details for you in this episode.\nWhy Bill prefers Private Label Sales to Retail Arbitrage.\nMany people have great success doing the legwork required to pull of a successful retail arbitrage business, but Bill feels he\u2019s not the kind of person who\u2019s cut out for it. He was able to make some money but found some of the limitations and difficulties involved in arbitrage to be hurdles he didn\u2019t want to have to get over. When he got into private label sales he enjoyed the kind of research, product sourcing, and brand building required and found it much more aligned with the kind of work he wanted to do. Find out all the details of retail arbitrage VS private label sales in this episode.\nBill didn\u2019t want to source his products from Alibaba or another common supplier. Why?\nLarge Chinese product sourcing companies like Alibaba make it easy for Amazon sellers to find products that match their criteria. But sourcing products from them also has its disadvantages. Bill saw that if he sourced his products from a common source like that, they could be easily imitated or even hijacked, so he went another route. How did he go about it? By going directly to a manufacturer. You\u2019ll have to listen to the entire episode to find out all the details!\nListen in to hear Scott\u2019s recommended launch sequence, in action!\nScott\u2019s guest today is a student in his Private Label Classroom and followed Scott\u2019s recommended launch sequence. As a result he\u2019s getting those 30 sales a day in record time! It\u2019s a proven system that works when you take it step at a time, and Bill\u2019s story proves it. Find out how Bill went about launching his product, got reviews, used PPC, and much, much more on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nNo matter what business you decide to start, you\u2019ve to surround yourself with a supportive community.\nThe guy you grab a drink with after work is probably not going to understand your entrepreneurial spirit. Your parents or siblings may not get it. But you\u2019ve got to have the support and encouragement all the same. Where do you find it? In a mastermind or discussion group that is focused on accomplishing the same type goals you are.

In today\u2019s episode he\u2019s going back to that launch plan to tweak and update it based on changes that have happened on Amazon and additional pieces of software or technology that make the process a bit easier or more streamlined. If you\u2019ve been considering the launch of an Amazon Private Label product, you really have no excuse now because Scott is going to show you how to do it successfully in this episode.\nDo sales and reviews from family members do any good on Amazon?\nYou\u2019ll hear a strange mix of answers on this one. Some people have had family member reviews vanish, or the family member never even receives the opportunity to leave a review on Amazon. Others have had no problem. What makes the difference? The honest answer is that we don\u2019t know. Amazon\u2019s criteria for determining what are \u201cfamily\u201d reviews and what are not is hard to pin down but we do know this. All reviews matter when you can get them, so you want to ask your family and friends to help you out with a review, or at least try. Scott\u2019s got lots of great advice about getting reviews on this amazing episode of The Amazing Seller, so give it a listen.\nWhat is the difference between \u201cverified\u201d reviews on \u00a0Amazon and \u201cunverified\u201d reviews\u2026 and does it really matter?\nThe difference between the two is pretty simple. A \u201cverified\u201d review is a review from a person that Amazon is able to track as an actual purchaser of the product being reviewed. Even if they purchased the product using a discount code, it was still an actual sale, so it counts as a \u201cverified\u201d review. An \u201cunverified\u201d review is exactly what it sounds like\u2026 Amazon knows the person did not purchase the product. Does it matter? Not always. When you launch your product you\u2019re just wanting to get as many stars and numbers on your rating scale as possible. The average buyer doesn\u2019t typically notice whether a review is verified or not, but they do notice whether you have 2 reviews or 200. Find out more about it on this episode.\nYou can use a Facebook fan page to promote your products AND build your email list.\nOne of the important steps Scott has in his launch process is the task of building a Facebook fan page that focuses on a topic related to your product. You\u2019re doing this for a couple of great reasons. #1 - you\u2019re building a community around the niche area your product is aimed at. You\u2019ll be able to present offers to them, conduct surveys about your product, and offer free resources to help them. But you\u2019ll also be able to use the page to solicit sign-ups for your email list and target special offers through Facebook ads. Don\u2019t know how to do that? Great! Give this episode a listen and you\u2019ll find out!\nIf you don\u2019t have a follow-up email sequence to reel in your customers, you\u2019re missing out!\nOnce a person purchases your product you\u2019ve discovered something important about them. They actually WANT what you have to sell! You\u2019ve got to be sure to follow up with them to make sure they are happy with your product, to solicit a review and seller feedback from them, AND (maybe most importantly) get their email address added to your \u201ccustomer list.\u201d You can do most of that through Amazon\u2019s built in communication channels. You can also use inserts in your products. But how it all works requires some explanation, like what you\u2019re going to hear on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS INTERVIEW EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Welcome to this episode of the podcast!\n\t[1:20] You\u2019re welcome to join Scott for a free, live workshop at www.TheAmazingSeller.com/workshop\n\t[2:43] The first steps - the \u201cPre-launch\u201d phase.\n\t[3:00] Using discount codes properly to get reviews.\n\t[4:10] The ways that Amazon sales to and reviews from family members will \u201cstick\u201d and won\u2019t.\n\t[5:50] The difference between \u201cverified\u201d and \u201cunverified\u201d reviews and why they matter (or don\u2019t).", "duration": "27:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS101.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1442563221, "title": "TAS 100 :  How To Choose and Launch Private Label Products on Amazon in 2016 (Round Table Discussion)", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "You\u2019d better buckle up for this episode of The Amazing Seller! It\u2019s over one hour and 15 minutes long\u2026 and for great reason! Scott\u2019s hosting a \u201cround table\u201d episode with 3 three other Amazing Sellers - Chris Schaeffer, Rich Kibble, and Danny Brewer. They\u2019re talking about how to launch products, changes to Amazon\u2019s algorithms, marketing strategies, setting up your own ecommerce site, and tons of other great stuff. You\u2019ll want to take notes and listen to this one more than once because there\u2019s just TOO MUCH information to digest at one time.\nDo you have the right mindset to be a successful Amazon seller?\nWhat kind of mindset is that? It\u2019s one that believes in the Amazon model and that anyone can be successful if they follow the steps Scott outlines. It\u2019s a mindset that won\u2019t give up even when disappointments or setbacks come. It\u2019s a mindset that doesn\u2019t try shortcuts, but patiently does what needs to be done each step of the way. It\u2019s a mindset that surrounds itself with other people who are doing the same things, to receive encouragement and be an encouragement. It\u2019s a mindset that takes action, over and over again. Find out more about how to be an Amazing Amazon Seller on this episode.\nThe fundamentals of building an Amazon Private Label business stay the same\u2026\nbut you have to learn to be flexible as some of the particulars change. Over the last few years Scott\u2019s formula for product research and product launch has proven to still work. His strategies for using reviews and PPC still get results. But since the Amazon market is getting more crowded, you\u2019ll need work harder at those things and also add more effort to differentiating your product from others. You\u2019ve got to stay flexible and be creative to make it work, but it still works.\nWhat about the stuff going around that Amazon is cracking down on review groups?\nIt is concerning to think that potentially hundreds of reviews for your products could vanish because Amazon deems them to have been \u201cpaid for\u201d through a review group. But is it really something to be THAT concerned about? In this episode of The Amazing Seller Danny Brewer says that so far it\u2019s all seemed like smoke without a lot of fire. He still uses review groups to do what he calls his \u201caggressive product launches.\u201d But other people say that they\u2019ve had reviews vanish without notice. What do you think? What does today\u2019s guest panel think? Find out more by listening to this episode.\nYou need to differentiate your Amazon products, but how do you go about doing that?\nThere are many ways to make your products stand out, but one of the guests on today\u2019s episodes has a great trick: He finds sellers that are offering products that are the same or similar to what he\u2019s offering, and goes into their seller profile. There he can see everything they\u2019re offering. He might decide to carry a product that is like something that competitor is doing, or he might get a great idea from browsing around the items they offer. Either way it expands his possibilities and helps him build a business not just a successful product.

Amazon is one of the most popular marketplaces out there and as an Amazon Seller you\u2019d be wise to maximize your products and product listings for the 4th quarter so you can make the most of this natural time of consumer activity. This episode is focused on helping you do exactly that. Listen in as Scott covers 5 basic tips to get yourself ready for the 4th quarter. And as a bonus, he throws in an additional 6th tip.\nIf you don\u2019t have enough cash on hand to get your private label products ready for the 4th quarter, you can do something else to build up your business.\nIt\u2019s called Retail Arbitrage. Simply put, you\u2019re purchasing existing products at discounted prices - either through stores or online - and reselling them for higher prices on Amazon, using your FBA account. Many sellers use this strategy to get started on Amazon, making extra cash that they can then roll back into an Amazon Private Label business. Where do you find these discounted products? On clearance racks, in thrift stores, at garage sales, anywhere that deals are to be found. Hear Scott\u2019s advice about using Retail Arbitrage to boost your income to eventually get into a private label business, no this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nIf you don\u2019t plan your inventory for the 4th quarter now, you\u2019re going to have trouble.\nOne of the biggest problems private label sellers have in the 4th quarter is getting behind on their inventory. It never fails that sales or demand are higher than expected and they run out of product. That\u2019s never a good thing since you\u2019re sourcing from a manufacturer or wholesaler and will have to wait at least a few weeks to be restocked. Plan now to have enough product to last you through the 4th quarter sales season. Scott\u2019s got stacks of his best selling product in his garage already and is gearing up for a big 4th quarter as a result. Find out what more you can do on this episode.\nTo make the most of the 4th quarter you need to get your seller account and products up in the Amazon rankings.\nHow do you do that? By generating traffic to your products, converting that traffic to sales, then appealing to those customers for reviews and feedback on the product they bought. It\u2019s really as simple as that. One of the best ways to start that cycle is through Amazon PPC. That\u2019s \u201cpay per click\u201d advertising, which puts your products in the view of those who come to Amazon searching for itit.. and that starts the ball rolling. You\u2019ve got to invest in PPC now and throughout the 4th quarter to get your products ranking higher throughout the selling season. Hear Scott\u2019s recommendations on how to go about it, on this episode.\nNow is the time to optimize your listing by testing the elements you include in it.\nBy the time the 4th quarter gets into full swing you want your listing to be optimized to its fullest. That\u2019s why you should be testing the elements included in your listing now, so you have time to dial it in and get the most out of the high traffic season ahead. Experiment with images, verbiage, titles, bullet points - do anything you can to test your listing for peak efficiency and conversions.

But Scott wants to offer help to everyone, no matter where they live. That\u2019s part of what motivated this episode of the Amazing Seller. Scott chats with an Amazon seller from Israel, Yinon Shiryan and discovered that while many of the tips and tricks are the same, there are some very unique things that International Sellers have to deal with that make it a more difficult journey. But Yinon\u2019s story is very encouraging because he\u2019s persevered and overcome all of those hurdles. Hear his story on this episode!\nWhy Yinon got started trying Amazon sales.\nLike most people, Yinon was already working a job that paid his bills, but he found himself never having time to get to the projects and other things her really wanted to do. His mind was dead after a full day of work. He heard about Amazon sales from a friend and was very interested. After only a little bit of research he decided to take the plunge and get started. He found a very popular product from a local supplier and looked to see what it sold for on Amazon. The margins weren\u2019t very big, but he decided to go for it anyway. After stumbling through the process he has made his way to a very successful business. Find out how he got from there to here, in this edition of The Amazing Seller.\nThe obstacles International Sellers face are huge!\nThere are shipping issues, account issues, and support issues from Amazon. One of the most surprising things Yinon discovered was that Amazon support would not return calls to numbers that were outside the U.S. So he had to get creative, using a combination of Google Hangouts and another app to connect with Amazon support and get the help he needed. Yinon\u2019s story shows how a commitment to reach a goal combined with massive action can propel anyone into a successful Amazon Sales business. Hear the entire story on this episode.\nMaking sales, even with a terrible listing.\nWhen Yinon first started his Amazon Sales business, he admits he didn\u2019t know what he was doing. His first listings, in his words, were \u201chorrible.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand English as well as he needed to, so he had a very hard time optimizing his listings for keywords. But within a few weeks he was making sales anyway. What he discovered was that his product quality was very high compared to others in his niche and even though he was asking a higher price than others, he was beginning to make sales. At one point he dropped his prices to see if it would generate more sales and his number of sales actually went down. It\u2019s a testament to value perception and the importance of having a quality product. Get all the details on this episode.\nVariations of products have enabled Yinon\u2019s products to rise in the Amazon algorithm.\nMultiple listings for the same type of product, but with variations, has enabled Yinon\u2019s products to gain a broader reach than many products do. His sales rank has benefitted from this and he\u2019s glad that he chose a product with so many varieties. Yinon and Scott both feel that when you set up your product, you should list it as having variations so that should the time come when you want to add variations, you\u2019re already set up to do so. Find out more about Yinon\u2019s story and how variations are helping his products rank, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS INTERVIEW EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Welcome and introduction - along with Scott\u2019s thanks!\n\t[0:42] The successes and failures of today\u2019s guest - an International Amazon Seller.\n\t[1:41] Scott\u2019s thanks for your emails, comments, and iTunes reviews.\n\t[2:03] Your invite to Scott\u2019s free, live workshop - www.TheAmazingSeller.com/Workshops\n\t[3:04] Yinon\u2019s story as an International Seller (he\u2019s from Israel) and the reason Scott\u2019s having him on the show.\n\t[4:22] How Yinon got started with Amazon sales.\n\t[7:24] Why it was so hard for Yinon to get started with his Am...", "duration": "47:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS09820.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1442044859, "title": "TAS BONUS EPISODE : INCOME REPORT \u2013 AUGUST 2015", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Today\u2019s episode is one of Scott\u2019s \u201cBonus Episodes\u201d covering his income through his Amazon Business for August of 2015. \n\nThese episodes are designed to be an encouragement to you, to show you that a real income can be provided through an Amazon sales business done the right way.

That\u2019s what Scott hopes these Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episodes can be for you. He\u2019s got 3 (actually 6) questions lined up today dealing with everything from customs fees to hijacked product listings. It\u2019s a great show with some very practical, relevant content that should help you avoid some pitfalls and ramp up your business.\nWhat is this I hear about a $2,500 limit on product costs to avoid customs fees?\nThere is a little bit of truth to the question, but it\u2019s not that you avoid customs fees altogether. What happens is this: When you order products from China or other territories outside the United States, and the total product cost is over $2,500, your products are bumped into a different category where your order is processed by customs manually. That incurs additional customs fees that you will have to pay. Scott\u2019s not sure if $2,500 is the exact limit, but received that information from a DHL representative. Listen to this episode to learn how Scott avoids that fee now.\nScott, help! My product listing has been hijacked!\nIt\u2019s a very maddening thing when you go through the work to get your private label products purchased and sent in to Amazon and then someone else takes advantage of all your work by listing their product on your listing and works hard to get the \u201cbuy box.\u201d What should you do? That\u2019s the exact situation one caller is in and he asked Scott how to handle the situation. Scott\u2019s response includes a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter that one of the TAS community members uses to address those issues in her business. You can listen to hear how she uses the letter and what kind of response she gets.\nWhen sourcing products through Alibaba, do you focus only on factories or manufacturers, or do you use any company?\nThe Alibaba listings can be confusing, especially when many companies have similar names. In today\u2019s episode a listener asks Scott what to do when there\u2019s an \u201cXYZ wholesale company\u201d and an \u201cXYZ manufacturing company,\u201d and an \u201cXYZ Medical company\u201d and they all offer the same or similar products. \u00a0Should he go with the one that seems like the actual manufacturer or does it make a difference? Scott\u2019s answer is focused more on the terms of the deal than the type of company it is, and he goes into his thinking in detail, so listen in!\nIf you\u2019d like to get your Amazon FBA or Private Label question answered\u2026\nAll you have to do is ask!

There are tons of ways you can organize your time, but on today\u2019s episode Scott has a guest who\u2019s going to help us get a better handle on our time. Welcome Kate Erickson, best known for her role in creating the Entrepreneur On Fire Audio Blog, \u201cKate\u2019s Take.\u201d Kate uses a process called \u201cSCRUM\u201d to help her focus on her goals and get more stuff done. Listen to this episode to discover how you can apply the same process to get more things done in your Amazon sales business.\nHow do you decide where to focus your energies each day?\nThat\u2019s the first question Scott asked his guest, Kate Erickson on this episode. Her answer was very enlightening. She uses a process called \u201cSCRUM\u201d to help her dissect each goal to the basic, elementary steps of what is required to get them to the point of completion. It\u2019s fully focusing on your goal one step at a time, no distractions, no pauses, no excuses. It enables her to knock out one aspect of a larger goal in a relatively short burst of time and then get on to the next step toward the goal. Hear more of how Kate goes about this process in this episode.\nMany of you are Amazon Sellers on the side\u2026 so how can you best use these concepts to your advantage?\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for people who are trying to build their business outside of regular work hours to find the time crunch almost impossible. There\u2019s only so much time each day and you\u2019ve got to be able to use it effectively. But there\u2019s so much other stuff that demands that time - family, friends, hobbies, fun - it\u2019s limitless. How do you go about using the \u201cSCRUM\u201d process Kate Erickson covers in this episode to manage all those obligations and needs? You\u2019ll have to listen to this great conversation to find out!\nThe power of just getting started.\nAt first it may be hard for you to determine what steps are needed in a larger project in order to get it done. The first step in the \u201cSCRUM\u201d process is making a plan for achieving that goal, and you do that by breaking it down into smaller steps. But you won\u2019t always know what those steps are when you begin. What do you do? You just get started. You\u2019re going to launch into the project and your mind is going to naturally gravitate to the first things you need to do. Get started and write down your steps as they come to your mind. Set time frames to guide you, and get busy. Find out more about how Kate Erickson recommends you take on these projects, on this episode.\nThe impact of not taking action - on you and others.\nThere are many things that keep us from moving on the things we know we need to do. We feel that we don\u2019t have enough information, that our idea isn\u2019t good enough, that there are other things we\u2019d rather do. But we need to realize that when we allow those things to keep us from action we are not only hurting ourselves, but also the people who are depending on the outcome of our work. Those may be family members, customers, or people like Scott\u2019s listeners who would never have been helped by his knowledge if he hadn\u2019t started this podcast (and he almost didn\u2019t.)

Should you?\nThat took a lot of guts. Not everybody would feel comfortable doing that. Scott is one of those people. His Amazon sales business took a full 90 days before he started seeing any kind of significant growth. If he\u2019d quit his job to get into it, he would have been in a world of hurt before significant income came in.

That way you don\u2019t put yourself or your family in a difficult spot. Find out more about why Scott advises caution when it comes to quitting your job to start Amazon FBA sales, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nThe 10X10x1 Formula worked like a charm for John.\nJohn gives the credit for the quick launch and success of his Amazon business to Scott\u2019s 10X10X1 formula. What is the formula? Simply put, it\u2019s this: 10 units - $10 profit - 1 day. So 10 units sold at $10 profit, every day. That formula is what you\u2019re shooting for to keep your product sales (and business growth) rolling in a positive direction. John set the 10X10X1 formula as his goal when he launched his product and discovered that the focus enabled him focus only on products that were already selling at least $10 per day, and to work smarter and more diligently as he tried to get his business going. Find out what those steps were by listening to this episode.\nHow did John learn everything that he did to make his private label business successful?\nJohn learned everything that he did from Scott\u2019s podcast. But he didn\u2019t just listen to each episode once or twice. He listened to every episode multiple times because he learned that the first couple of times through he heard what he wanted to hear, not what he needed to hear. The repeated listening enabled him to pick up things he\u2019d missed in the first listens that were critical to his success. Hear how John suggests you go about learning the things you need to know in order to make your products take off like his did, on this episode.\nHow John maximized his promotions - it\u2019s not a common way of doing it, but it worked.\nJohn offered some discount promotion codes for his product when he first launched. He put out the codes on fliers that he hung up at a local convenience store. He also made the offer that if the people using the code recommended the product to their friends, he\u2019d give their friends a discount as well (10% to 20%). The fliers disappeared from the convenience store and every single one of the discount codes was used! That\u2019s an amazing response to an unorthodox way of getting the offer out. Hear the details of how that promotion impacted John\u2019s product launch, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS INTERVIEW EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Welcome and introduction to this episode!\n\t[0:55] The story behind this episode\u2019s content.\n\t[1:45] Do you know about Scott\u2019s Periscope adventures?

He\u2019s getting a few sales a day, but is not even coming close to catching the top seller in his niche when it comes to product reviews. What should he do? It\u2019s a hard question for Scott to answer without all the details, but he gives it his best shot, providing a handful of things to look at that could result in higher sales.\nWouldn\u2019t it be great to find a U.S. Manufacturer to source your products?\nThere\u2019s been a lot of chat on the Amazing Seller Facebook Group about this one: finding U.S. based product sources to keep the cash flowing within our own borders. Scott\u2019s all for finding U.S. suppliers, but knows that in order to make a profit you have to spend as little as possible on the product side of things. That\u2019s why this question is such a difficult one to answer definitively. In this episode Scott highlights some of the ways Amazon sellers might be able to find U.S. based suppliers, and invites anyone who HAS found a U.S. based source for their products to contact him to share their tips!\nHow important is it to key in on the search terms and suggested customer profiles available in the product page setup?\nIn every Seller Central product page there\u2019s an option to give suggested categories of people that might be interested in the particular product you\u2019re adding to the Amazon catalogue. A listener asks Scott how important those fields are and what might be done to optimize their use. Scott\u2019s answer points to a previous episode where an expert on Amazon listings shared a wealth of fabulous tips about making your product listing the best it can be.

He did so way back before the days of Amazon FBA. In this great interaction Scott gets schooled by Steve on why every Amazon seller should consider, at least down the road, setting up shop on their own private ecommerce store. Steve tells the story of how he and his wife did that very thing, how they\u2019ve grown it over the years, and how they\u2019ve even used Amazon\u2019s own system to drive traffic to their private store. You won\u2019t want to miss this.\nWhy would an Amazon seller want to set up his own ecommerce store?\nSteve Chou thinks it\u2019s a must for every Amazon seller to eventually move beyond Amazon to set up their own store. There are many reasons, but two of the greatest are #1 - the ability to create your own promotional content, and #2 - the ability to capture your customer information and follow up on them during and after the sale. He\u2019s found that ability alone to be a significant source of conversions for his products. If you\u2019ve been thinking about setting up your own platform for sales outside of Amazon, don\u2019t miss this episode.\nYou mean I can use Amazon to drive traffic to my own private ecommerce store?\nYep, that\u2019s exactly right. Steve Chou has been doing it for a while now through what Amazon calls \u201csponsored ads.\u201d It\u2019s a way you can take advantage of the search traffic Amazon draws in\u2026 and it\u2019s not just any search traffic - it\u2019s people who are ready to buy exactly what you\u2019re offering. Listen to Scott\u2019s interview with Steve to find out how Steve sets up these sponsored ads and the kind of traffic and conversions he\u2019s getting from doing so, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nHave you ever considered creating content to drive people to your products?\nBloggers have been doing this for a long time. It\u2019s that great article, or video, or \u201chow to\u201d lesson that gives great value to the audience and then drives them to purchase the blogger\u2019s product or course. You can do the same thing for your products. Steve Chou and his wife have been doing that for a long time and have found it to be a powerful way to feature their products and get people to check them out. Find out all the details of how Steve does it on this episode.\nHow to use Pinterest to drive traffic to your products.\nIt\u2019s becoming more apparent all the time that out of all the social media platforms available today, Pinterest is one of the best at driving traffic to product pages. Why? Because oftentimes people are searching Pinterest for ideas or products to solve a particular problem. What better place to post your product images and posts? In this episode of The Amazing Seller Steve Chou talks about how he uses Pinterest to drive traffic to his products, and he covers some important tips on how TO and how NOT TO use Pinterest.

You\u2019ve got to figure out ways to get many, many people not only seeing your products, but opting in to your email list and eventually, purchasing your products. When your items first show up on Amazon, they\u2019ll be way down the list, so organic sales will be very few. That\u2019s where \u201coutside\u201d traffic comes in. In this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott\u2019s going to highlight some of the \u201cdos\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d of outside traffic to help you get the right kind of traffic, the right way.\nThe right social media platform for the right audience.\nWhat does that mean? It means that when you\u2019re considering promotions or list-building ads on a social media platform, you need to think through why people are on that social media platform in the first place. For example: People tend to go onto Facebook to see what\u2019s going on with their friends or family, or to be entertained by funny memes or videos. Very seldom are they there to buy a product. So ads directing people to a sales page are not as effective. But if you were to apply that same evaluation to Pinterest, you may find an entirely different story. In this episode Scott covers the difference in various social media platforms and gives his advice on how to use each of them to drive traffic to the right offer or page.\nDo you know the biggest \u201coutside traffic\u201d mistake Amazon sellers make?\nIt\u2019s driving people directly to a sales page instead of trying to use social media platforms for a more long term goal - building an email list. Because many people are on social media for \u201csocial\u201d reasons (go figure), they aren\u2019t open to buying something while they\u2019re on that channel. So trying to make them do it is not only frustrating, it\u2019s dumb. Instead, appeal to the reason they are there in the first place by offering them something that is entertaining or socially oriented that is connected to your product. And how do they get it? By signing up for your email list. It\u2019s a great way to build a list that can help you launch products, get reviews, and lots more. Find out how Scott would go about doing it, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nAre there smart ways to drive traffic using Pinterest?\nYou bet there are. Many people use Pinterest to spark their creativity or to find ideas about home decor, crafts, haircuts, and a million other things. They are there in a \u201cconsumer\u201d mood already. If they see your product-related pin and it sparks their interest or scratches an itch they already have, you may wind up having a very warm lead or potential customer. And one of the good things\u2026 if they wind up pinning your image to their board, it\u2019s there forever, for all their friends and followers to see. Find out more about how Scott\u2019s learning to use Pinterest on this episode.\nTo build your list you need to offer something that is truly of value to people.\nToo many internet marketers throw together something shoddy or unfulfilling to lure people into subscribing for their email list. But if you do that you destroy the trust level because once they download your offer and discover it\u2019s junk, they will unsubscribe or worse yet, form a negative opinion of you and your products. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that the \u201coffer\u201d you make in exchange for an email address is something of great value to your ideal customers. By doing that you\u2019ll ensure that they are the type of person who will not only buy your product, but also be more likely to help you promote it and spread the word.

That\u2019s what this episode of The Amazing Seller is for - it\u2019s an \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode where you get to Ask Scott Voelker your own question about selling on Amazon, either through Retail Arbitrage, Wholesaling, or Private Label sales. In this episode you\u2019ll hear questions about tax issues, private websites, and sending email to customers. Pull up a chair and get ready to learn as you hear from an experienced Amazon seller about the practical parts of building and running a successful FBA business.\nWhat percentage of sales profits should an Amazon seller set aside each month?\nThat\u2019s a very important question, and it\u2019s one asked by a listener on today\u2019s episode of \u201cAsk Scott.\u201d Naturally, there are variables to consider for each situation including your state of residence and personal tax bracket. But most importantly, you want to base your decision off professional advice from a qualified accountant or tax attorney. Having said that, Scott tells what he does, including how he reinvests profits into his Amazon business so he can get additional tax write offs. It\u2019s practical stuff you won\u2019t want to miss\u2026 and you\u2019ll only hear it on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nShould you set up a website for your Amazon products?\nMany Amazon sellers do set up a website for the products they sell on Amazon to give a greater sense of legitimacy to their business. But Scott\u2019s not sure that the investment in a website is really all that important, especially as you first get your business rolling. He\u2019d rather invest that time and money in things that will get his product more reviews and greater exposure in the Amazon system. Find out why he recommends that and how he goes about doing it on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nGetting reviews on your products is vital. How can you do it most effectively?\nThere are many 3rd party software programs that enable you to track your Amazon sales and solicit feedback from your customers. But is there a way to use those programs to solicit feedback on particular products rather than on your seller account in general? Yes, there is, and in this episode of \u201cAsk Scott,\u201d Scott Voelker walks you through how to do so in a couple of different software programs so that you can make the most out of those Amazon sales reviews and get your product ranking higher in the Amazon search algorithm.\nEvery State in the U.S. has its own sales tax rate? How can Amazon sellers make sure they\u2019re paying the tax that is due?\nEven experienced Amazon sellers will tell you that sales tax is one of the most confusing, frustrating parts of running a successful Amazon Business. A listener asks Scott a question about collecting and paying State sales tax in this episode, and as always, Scott gives practical, common sense advice about how to play by the rules when it comes to sales tax, and how to make sure you\u2019re not taking those payments from your profits.

But the highlight of Scott\u2019s time at PM was not the main sessions or the inspiring talks\u2026 it was the time he was able to spend informally with people from The Amazing Seller community. This episode is a one-of-a-kind conversation with a handful of TASers who were at the Podcast Movement TAS meetup. They discuss getting started, overcoming fear, busting through roadblocks, and a whole lot more.\nRoadblocks come to every business.\nIt may be when you discover that the product you planned to sell on Amazon isn\u2019t going to be as profitable as you thought. It could be when you come to the place of ordering your product and fear of writing that big check comes to the surface. It could be when you need to start a PPC campaign and realize you know nothing about how to get started. No matter what the roadblock is, you\u2019ve got to learn how to overcome it. In this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott leads a discussion between Amazon Sellers who have faced every one of those roadblocks. You\u2019ll hear how real sellers got past the things that often stop business owners in their tracks. It\u2019s an inspiring conversation to encourage you to keep taking action.\nFear is a sign that you\u2019re making progress.\nThink about it\u2026 you don\u2019t feel fear when you\u2019re sitting on the couch watching TV. Why? Because you\u2019re comfortable. You\u2019re within your comfort zone. There\u2019s nothing to fear. So when you feel fear as you take the next step in your Amazon business, it\u2019s a good sign\u2026 it means you\u2019re moving. It means you\u2019re growing. It means you\u2019re doing the things needed to make your business grow. Listen in as Scott and some of the TAS community discuss their individual fears and roadblocks and how they overcome them.\nAnswering the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d in your own head.\nFear often takes the form of \u201cwhat if\u201d statements that surface in your own thinking. \u201cWhat if I make a mistake on my product research and start with a bad product?\u201d \u201cWhat if nobody gives me product reviews?\u201d \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a bust and I make no money?\u201d Those what if questions are a sign that you\u2019re coming up against a roadblock and that it\u2019s time to grit your teeth and push through it. In this episode you\u2019ll hear how real people have pushed through their own \u201cwhat if\u201d questions to create an Amazon business that is successfully providing the lifestyle they imagined.\nYou can\u2019t make it alone. You need a community behind you.\nThe discussion you\u2019ll hear on today\u2019s show is proof of that fact.

But in this episode it\u2019s going to move to whole new Facebook level. Scott\u2019s got Rick Mulready on the show. Rick is known as \u201cTHE Facebook Ad guy\u201d and after listening to this conversation, you\u2019ll understand why. Rick\u2019s taken the time to truly understand the tools Facebook has created in its advertising platform and he\u2019s unloading a ton of information in this episode about how you can make the most of Facebook ads to build an email list, drive up your product reviews, and ultimately sell more products.\n\n\nDid you know you can use Facebook ads to drive traffic to discounted products - and get more true purchase reviews on Amazon?\nWith Facebook Ads you can drill WAY down into the demographics to choose exactly the right people to present your promotions to, and since people are usually on Facebook to share with family and friends, you want to make sure your \u201cads\u201d are not sales-y. One of the best ways to do that is to present people with a fun opportunity or deal - a 99 cent product, etc. in exchange for an honest review on Amazon. Can you image targeting your product to the exact people who have already expressed interest in it or similar products, then asking if they want an almost-free copy of your product? Your email list opt-in will likely go through the rough. Hear how \u201cThe Facebook Ad Guy,\u201d Rick Mulready suggests you go about doing exactly that, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhat is granular targeting, and how does Facebook make it easy?\nGranular targeting is a term used lately to refer to the ability to dig deeply into the statistics about your target market so that you can get your ads in front of people who are more likely to like what you\u2019re promoting, with pin-point accuracy. Facebook has almost written the book on granular targeting by utilizing the voluntary stats of its users to let you create ads that dig into the interests, buying patterns, discussion patterns, and self-disclosed interests available in their profiles and usage habits. Facebook ads allows you to use all that data to specify who you want to see your ads and who you don\u2019t. Rick Mulready unpacks how to do it on this episode of the podcast, so make sure you listen to get those great tips.\nWhy you should keep track of your numbers to make Facebook ads work best.\nHere\u2019s the scenario: You create a Facebook ad to highlight a free giveaway of your product. Within a few days you have 15 more people than normal who have taken you up on your offer. That\u2019s an increase, and you\u2019re really happy! The Facebook Ad must be working. But what might happen if you tweak your audience or change your settings just a bit? Would it turn that 15 conversions into 20, or 30, or 50? You won\u2019t know unless you watch the stats (numbers) on how your Facebook ads are doing. In this episode Rick Mulready covers that topic and what seems like hundreds more, unpacking his head full of knowledge about Facebook and Facebook ads.\nRetargeting, Facebook pixels, and how to catch the ones that got away.\nIt\u2019s amazing, but true. You can use some of the tools Facebook has created to virtually stalk those who have come to your website through a Facebook ad, but never took the action step you wanted them to take. You\u2019re able to follow them to another website and re-present your offer to them in a gentle reminder that they were interested and might be missing out if they don\u2019t take action. People who use retargeting see their sales conversions go up by leaps and bounds. Rick Mulready covers Facebook pixels and how you can use them to retarget your ideal customers on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS INTERVIEW EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\t[0:05] Introduction of the topic of Facebook Ads and the introduction of Rick Mulready, the Facebook Ads guy.\n\t[1:46] Rick\u2019s background and how he got into Facebook advertising.", "duration": "52:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS089.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1440144059, "title": "TAS 088 : Ask Scott Session #22 \u2013 FBA Amazon Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "This is another of Scott Voelker\u2019s Friday \u201cAsk Scott\u201d sessions where he answers your questions about Amazon FBA Sales.

Head on over to www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask to submit your question via voicemail and listen to hear your own voice on an upcoming episode of The Amazing Seller.\nIs there any benefit to placing 2 UPC codes on the same product?\nThis may sound like an odd question but there\u2019s really some sophisticated thinking behind it. The idea is simple: If you have a potato peeler as one of your products, should you also create a second listing for the identical product and list it as a \u201cCARROT peeler\u201d instead? You\u2019d have two products with two listings and two unique UPC codes. Scott\u2019s not convinced it\u2019s the best way to start but does think it could be advantageous after looking into the numbers a bit more. Find out the details of why Scott thinks this could be a good strategy as he answers the question on this episode.\nBusiness accounting can be a nightmare, but it doesn\u2019t have to be.\nA listener asks Scott how he handles the accounting in his Amazon Private Label business. There are product costs, customs expenses, shipping, Amazon fees - it\u2019s enough to make your head spin. But Scott\u2019s convinced that keeping good records doesn\u2019t have to be that hard. In fact, he started with everything in one spreadsheet and thinks that system could still work if he was inclined to use it. But he goes a bit deeper into the question to reveal what accounting software he\u2019s using now as well as providing a few other options, both software packages you can buy and online free versions. Learn how to get your accounting headaches under control on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhat do you do \"day to day\" once your product is launched?\nProduct research, product sourcing, product listings, PPC, Facebook Ads - there\u2019s a TON that goes into the process of getting a private label product to market on Amazon. But once all that hard work is done and your product is live on Amazon, what do you do day to day from there? A listener asks Scott what his daily, weekly, and monthly routines are now that he\u2019s an established Amazon seller and Scott gives a transparent and simple answer, breaking it down into even the small tasks that he does every day. You won\u2019t want to miss this practical answer as Scott responds to the listener\u2019s question.\nIs it possible for my multiple PPC campaigns to compete with each other?\nPPC (pay per click advertising) is a very confusing and mysterious thing at times. It\u2019s hard to know all the ins and outs of setting up campaigns correctly. In today\u2019s episode of The Amazing Seller a listener asks a question that stems from some changes he made in his Amazon PPC account, and a change in results he observed. He wants to know: \u201cIf I use the same keywords in different Amazon PPC campaigns, will I wind up competing with myself for those keywords, thus decreasing the effectiveness of my investment in PPC?\u201d It\u2019s a great question and Scott has a great answer.

If you aren\u2019t building an email list right now, you\u2019ve got to start. You can use the tips Scott shares in this episode to get a jump on the process, using mostly free tools. And in the end, even if you do need to invest a small amount of money in building your list, you\u2019ll recoup that cash quickly once those you target through your email campaigns begin responding to your products. Find out how to do it on this episode.\nAmazon won\u2019t give you the email address of people who buy your products. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t build an email list of your own.\nHow can you do it? It\u2019s really not that difficult to figure out, and once you do it, you\u2019ve got a \u201claunch list\u201d to market to for every new product in your niche that you develop and place on Amazon. Imagine the impact of being able to target your new products directly to people who have already expressed interest in your products. You\u2019ll have a jumpstart on Amazon reviews, sales, and ultimately, success. In this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott is going to give you his top 6 tips for building your own email list.\nHow you can use a Facebook fan page to capture emails and build a community.\nAnyone can create a Facebook fan page\u2026 it\u2019s really pretty simple. But how do you get people into the group? Even more importantly, how do you get people into the group who are truly interested in what you have to sell? That\u2019s where Facebook ads come in. For a very small amount you can specifically target people who have already indicated that they are interested in the types of things you sell. You can set daily limits on what you spend, tweak your ad campaign at any time, and cancel when you feel it\u2019s done all you need it to do. This is one of Scott\u2019s favorite ways to build a fan page, which you can then use to build your email list. Find out the details on this episode.\nTomoson is another way you can build an email list of people who want what you have to sell.\nTomoson is a website dedicated to connecting review bloggers and the people who have products needing reviews. That sounds like you, doesn\u2019t it? Using their platform you can locate bloggers who are interested in reviewing the kinds of products you sell, make contact with them offering to send them your product in exchange for a review, and increase your exposure through their review and through the things they say about your product on their blog. It\u2019s a great way to increase interest in your products with the potential of building your email list with the addresses of those who respond. Find out how Scott uses Tomoson on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nYou can also use Amasuite to find and filter reviewers who are interested in the type of products you sell.\nAmasuite is Chris Guthrie\u2019s amazing tool that helps you research and filter through the Amazon listings to find the exact products that might be big sellers. But there\u2019s tons more to Amasuite than just product research. You can use the filter functionality in the program to find people likely to review a product like yours so you can reach out to them for a review. It\u2019s another amazing way you can get your products into the hands of interested reviewers, which in turn can increase your product\u2019s profile in Amazon.

What\u2019s sales copy? It\u2019s the text you type into your product listing to tell potential buyers about your product. It may seem pretty straightforward to you, but know this: people like Karon Thackston have built a professional career on learning how to write powerful copy that sells products, and Karon has niched in on Amazon product descriptions as one of the main areas she makes her living. It\u2019s easy to niche because Amazon is so unique in the way its algorithms work. Find out how Karon got started as a copywriter and how she coaches Amazon Sellers to optimize their listings, on this episode of the Amazing Seller.\nDo you know the biggest mistakes Amazon Sellers make on their product listings?\nIt\u2019s wasting their keyword opportunities. Amazon is very, very different than Google or any of the other search engines. Search engines are optimized to find key phrases, but Amazon isn\u2019t, it uses key WORDS. That difference alone could help you increase sales when you tweak your product listings appropriately. So for example, you don\u2019t want to repeat keywords: \u201cGarlic Press, Stainless Steel Garlic Press, Garlic Press Kit\u201d, etc. Once you\u2019ve written a word in your title or keyword areas, that\u2019s all the benefit you\u2019ll get from it, so use different words, vary it up; that way you\u2019ll get the most out of your product listings. That\u2019s just one of the often missed things Karon shares on this episode of The Amazing Seller, so listen to the entire show.\nDid you know that your product title serves as keywords too?\nThat makes a huge difference when it comes to completing your keyword fields. If you\u2019ve already used a targeted keyword in your product title, never, never use it again in your keyword field. You\u2019re wasting valuable real estate that Amazon will search when people are trying to find products. Vary your keywords, get creative, and make sure you\u2019re not duplicating efforts to no avail. Karon is an expert at this stuff and shares a ton of valuable tips in this episode.\nWhat makes one Amazon product title better than another?\nOriginality. If your competitors all have the words \u201cTeflon, plastic, 6 oz.\u201d in their product title, you should work hard to differentiate yourself from them. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t have those same qualities for your product, but you want to stand out. When people are scanning the Amazon product listings they begin to scan faster when all the titles appear the same. Your original wording and title could be the thing that makes them stop, look a little deeper, and eventually buy your product instead of your competitor\u2019s. Find out more about making your Amazon Product Title \u201cpop\u201d in this episode.\nThe best way to use bullets in your product description.\nShould your bullets be a listing of features, or benefits? If it\u2019s both, which should come first? How long should an average bullet point be in your product listing? How do the recent changes to Amazon\u2019s product listing format impact your choices regarding bullet points? Does Amazon search your bullet points for keywords? You didn\u2019t know there was so much to consider about something simple like a bullet point within your product description, did you? In this episode of the Amazing Seller you get to learn from a woman who has studied the Amazon algorithms and know the best practices for using bullets effectively.

Scott\u2019s answer is very enlightening, focusing on the value of PPC in the beginning to crank up your product\u2019s ranking for its target keywords, which helps drive organic sales. It\u2019s not about profit at the beginning, it\u2019s about exposure. Once the organic sales start happening, there\u2019s more than enough profit to be made. Scott goes into the details of how he goes about it in his response to this question, on this episode of the Amazing Seller podcast.\nHow does BSR related to possible sales?\nA listener has heard Scott mention the BSR of a product (Best Seller Rank) and wonders how Scott knows that certain numbers in the BSR category will translate into a certain amount of sales. Scott\u2019s answer focuses on the reality of each niche having a different set of BSR values and how those variables will impact the numbers on your particular target product. But at the heart of Scott\u2019s recommendations is a piece of software that he\u2019s found invaluable in doing the kind of product research needed to get numbers that give you confidence in introducing new products. That software? Jungle Scout. You can get a discount on JS by using Scott\u2019s affiliate link - www.TheAmazingSeller.com/JS\nWhat if your product is part of a \u201ckit\u201d or grouping that doesn\u2019t seem to have one particular keyword to target?\nIt may be a bit frustrating at first to hone in on the right keywords to target when your product is part of a larger body of products or a \u201cset\u201d or \u201ckit\u201d that people may use. But in the end, it\u2019s a good thing, and here\u2019s why: Your product has the unique ability to target multiple keywords that may seem unrelated to the casual observer, and do so in a very relevant way. And the advantage to having your product as part of a kit (bundling products) is that people are often more prone to buy products that are part of a kit because it seems like a better value. And a bonus to you is that you are likely able to charge more for the kit than you would for the individual product. Hear Scott\u2019s full explanation on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nAmazon may be encouraging you to sign up to be an international seller, but should you?\nIt\u2019s a flattering feeling to have Amazon approach you via email about becoming an international seller. And it feels good to think of having a world-wide presence in your niche market. But doing so could be the worst thing you could do. Unless you\u2019re already killing it in the U.S. marketplace, which is the largest Amazon Marketplace that exists, you\u2019ll probably wind up distracting yourself from maximizing your sales in the U.S. Marketplace by becoming an international seller.

In this conversation, Scott asks Tim in-depth questions about what he did, how he did it, and what the results were from every step he took. You won\u2019t find a more transparent, encouraging account of how a normal person (not a guru) took his private label Amazon business from $0 to over $6000 in just 30 days. Listen to this episode to hear all the details of Tim\u2019s amazing story.\nOnce your product is on Amazon, what then?\nTim knew his products needed to get reviews for his private label product pretty quickly. He asked people with Amazon Prime accounts to make a purchase of his product (that he would reimburse - essentially giving away free products), and he also began using AMZ Tracker, which has a review system. He began building up reviews, which in turn moved his product up in Amazon\u2019s natural search results to get him some natural sales on Amazon also. So his product was slowly creeping up in the search results, getting a few sales organically, and enabling him to get things headed toward a bigger volume of sales. Find out what Tim did next on this episode.\nWhen Tim turned on Amazon PPC things began to catch fire...\n\u2026 but not immediately. That\u2019s because the Amazon analytics take about a week to refresh once you\u2019ve set on PPC. So the first week or so Tim\u2019s results looked terrible and he was a bit discouraged. But he knew he should hang on before making any changes because he\u2019d been listening to The Amazing Seller and knew that it would take a while for his stats to be correct. Once they started showing, his PPC became clear and he could see what campaigns to keep, which to turn off, and which to refine. This enabled Tim to continue cranking up his sales and getting his pricing and product inventory dialed-in. Listen to hear how Tim\u2019s strategies could apply to your FBA products.\nThe impact of inventory: What happens when you run out?\nTim\u2019s initial purchase of his product was not thousands of units, but only hundreds. That means that once his sales began jumping, he quickly ran out of his products. Once he realized he was going to run out, he scrambled to get more products produced, shipped, and into his Amazon account, which took a couple of weeks. When he ran out of products in his Amazon inventory and didn\u2019t have more to replenish it yet, he did see his sales drop (naturally). But he also noticed that once he had products resupplied, it took him a while to get the product ranking and sales back to what it was before the inventory was depleted. It was a great lesson, and one Tim knows is difficult for all sellers to handle because not everyone has the capital to keep a full supply of products when they first start. Find out what Tim recommends in this episode.\nThe issue is not whether FBA sales works. It\u2019s about finding the right products.\nTim\u2019s story shows that the FBA systems you learn on The Amazing Seller podcast and other places really does work. You can build an Amazon sales business that can supplement or replace your current income. But you may not do it on your very first product. The right product is the key to building a business that will last, and reinvesting the profits into the business will enable you to grow the business more quickly. If your first efforts don\u2019t turn out like you anticipated, don\u2019t conclude that Amazon sales doesn\u2019t work. Just start the process of finding another product and try again. You can\u2019t give up. Once you hit on the right product or niche, the sales will begin to take off and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to truly build a long term business.

He worked for years in a good job, working to take care of his responsibilities and life. He came to a point where he wanted to change his life so that he could spend more time with his family. He heard of the possibility of making a change through beginning an Amazon sales business from Chris Guthrie (a previous guest on The Amazing Seller podcast). So he decided to take the leap and get started building his own business. He asked lots of questions to know that what others were doing was possible for him. Once he was convinced, Tim began building his business - and he did all of it without ever signing up for a paid course of any kind. He invested a portion of his salary each month to building his business. Listen to this episode - part 1 of a lengthy conversation where Tim tells his story and how he got over $6,000 in sales within the first 30 days of beginning his FBA Business.\nTim\u2019s product research process for his Amazon business began with the purchase of one piece of software.\nAmasuite was the software Tim began with, simply because he trusted it\u2019s creator, Chris Guthrie. He started researching the top 100 sellers in lots of categories. He drilled down into those products by setting up filters to weed out products he didn\u2019t think were good options. Some of those products were not an option because the niche was too saturated. Others he simply didn\u2019t think were good. Through that process Tim found a product he felt good about. He wasn\u2019t concerned at that point with building a brand, though he does feel that is the best way to begin. He just found products that might sell well and made a decision. The next step was sourcing the product. Find out how he went about his product sourcing in this episode.\nTim\u2019s smart way of getting a sample of the product he was interested in.\nWhen Tim researched his product on Alibaba (An online Chinese directory of product providers), he found one of the exact products that were listed on Amazon. He felt there was room in the market for him to offer the exact same product, so he simply ordered one of his competitor\u2019s products from Amazon. \u00a0He accomplished two things at once by doing this. He got to see the actual product - it\u2019s quality, packaging, etc. AND he got to see how his competitor was presenting the product, including a misspelling on their packaging that hasn\u2019t been corrected to this day! Find out more about the quality control process and getting samples of your potential product in this edition of The Amazing Seller.\nShipping a private label product to Amazon - directly from the product supplier!\nThe supplier Tim was able to find had experience shipping products directly to Amazon so he thought it was worth trying. He bought his own UPC to put on the products, printed out his own labels to brand the product as his, and the supplier put the labels on the products, printed out shipping labels, and sent the products directly to Amazon for Tim\u2019s account. It was a tremendous time saving step that enabled Tim to keep one more piece of the process off his table so that he could fulfill the goal of spending more time with his family. Hear exactly how Tim went about working out this deal on this episode.\n Getting reviews for a new product - Tim\u2019s unique strategy.\nGetting reviews for your Amazon product is essential to begin moving your product up in Amazon\u2019s search results, and giving your product a sense of legitimacy. Tim knew that and wanted to boost his product through getting some quick reviews. The first step he took is common sense, but one not many people do. He enlisted people he knew who had Amazon Prime accounts (so they could get free shipping) and asked them to purchase and review the product, and he would pay them back the purchase price. Essentially, he\u2019s giving away the products for free but through Amazon it registers as a full-blow purchas...", "duration": "47:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS083.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1438934422, "title": "TAS 082 : Ask Scott Session #20 \u2013 FBA Amazon Questions", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Questions about setting up or running an FBA Amazon sales business?\nYou\u2019ve come to the right place! The Amazing Seller podcast, and these Friday episodes in particular, are one of the best ways for you to get your situation-specific questions answered. Each Friday Scott Voelker, a successful Amazon seller himself, answers your questions, submitted by you and played on the podcast in your own voice. He hopes to equip and educate you to make your Amazon FBA business your ticket out of the 9 to 5 rat race. You can ask your question anytime at http://TheAmazingSeller.com/ask\nShould you sell electronic items or things \u201cwith a switch\u201d in your Amazon business?\nA listener asks Scott how hard-and-fast his \u201crule\u201d is that Amazon sellers should not sell any items that have a switch. When Scott says, \u201chas a switch\u201d he means something with electronics or too many moving parts. Scott does see this as a rule but as a wise suggestion, mainly because offering products that have electronics involved puts you in a position that your products are more likely to be returned because of manufacturing defects, damage that happens during shipping, etc. That will cost you time and money, which you really don\u2019t want to spend. Listen in to hear what Scott suggests to sellers who are considering electronic products.\nDo you think it\u2019s a good idea for me to sell apparel on Amazon before setting up my own website or Shopify store?\nA listener asks that question and even though Scott doesn\u2019t sell apparel on Amazon, he\u2019s got plenty to say! Apparel sales on Amazon requires special approval due to the wear and tear that can happen to clothing. Amazon tries to safeguard the apparel category by making it more difficult to sell. But if you want to sell clothing and feel it\u2019s a very good niche for you to be in, Scott\u2019s got some suggestions for how you might go about it. Find out more in this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast.\nOne of the most time intensive parts of selling private label products on Amazon is the product research phase.\nThankfully there are many great software packages available that can help you get through that phase more quickly and with better results. On this episode a listener asks Scott for some tips in using one of those software solutions: Jungle Scout. Scott\u2019s got some great suggestions for how the listener can find the best products and get started selling on Amazon sooner rather than later. Listen in to find out more about how you could do the same thing!\nFeedback Genius, MailChimp, Awebber, and other email solutions. Which is best?\nA listener says he\u2019s a bit \u201cfuzzy\u201d on why Scott recommends using different software solutions for different parts of an Amazon FBA sales business. Scott does a great job clearing up the fuzz in this episode. Feedback Genius is used only to connect with Amazon\u2019s systems and automate follow up with customers who have purchased your products. It does so without you ever seeing the customer\u2019s email information, because Amazon does not allow sellers to have that information. But it still provides a powerful way for you to increase your feedback and reviews, thus lifting your product\u2019s visibility and legitimacy. Software solutions like MailChimp and Abweber are for building your own private email list of previous customers? How can you do that if Amazon doesn\u2019t allow you to see their email information?

Particularly the product reviews?\nYou should be. Monitoring your account is the only way you can keep tabs on what is going on with your products sales. You want to do that you can make adjustments and tweaks to your products, prices, and listings to maximize your Amazon FBA sales. If you\u2019ve been monitoring your account, you may have noticed that some of your product reviews have been removed by Amazon. What\u2019s up with that? Amazon has been cracking down on people who are getting reviews in illegitimate ways, and even removing some that seem questionable. In this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott is going to walk you through what\u2019s going on, why it\u2019s happening, and what you can do to safeguard yourself and your reviews as best as you can.\nHere\u2019s how you should think about those \u201cbase reviews\u201d you get during your product launch phase.\nThe reviews you push to get by giving away free or discounted products have one purpose only - to give your product some social proof or legitimacy so when sellers see your product, they feel good that it\u2019s legitimate and good quality. That way they\u2019re more prone to buy it. Once they do, you should be following up with them to encourage reviews from them, the purchasers of your product who paid full price. At that point you\u2019ll be building on top of your base reviews with organic reviews. When you do this right, it won\u2019t matter if Amazon comes in and removes some of those initial base reviews you got. Why? Because you\u2019re replacing them with organic ones - which is exactly what Amazon wants you to have most of all. Listen to this episode to find out what Scott recommends when it comes to your base Amazon product reviews.\nHere\u2019s the biggest reason Amazon is removing product reviews\nIt\u2019s not because you gave the products away for free in exchange for a review. It\u2019s not because you discounted a product in exchange for a review. It\u2019s because the person who reviewed your product did not disclose that they received the product for free in exchange for an honest review. That\u2019s it. So when you give those products away or discount them, make sure you\u2019re stressing to the recipients that they MUST include a disclaimer similar to that when they leave a review for the product on Amazon. If they don\u2019t, it may not only wind up not helping you, it could actually hurt you by the loss of that review. It would also turn out to be a waste of their time, so generously given. Listen to this episode to learn exactly how Scott recommends you stress this issue with your potential reviewers.\nThere\u2019s also a theory about an additional reason product reviews are being removed by Amazon.\nIt has to do with what have come to be known as \u201creview groups.\u201d You know what they are, groups on Facebook, or some forum where people agree to exchange reviews on products. It\u2019s a simple idea and it\u2019s worked for a while, but many people who have a lot of experience on Amazon believe that Amazon is starting to target those groups somehow and are removing reviews that they believe may have come from those kinds of groups. It makes sense, and it\u2019s a review tactic that could become more and more risky as months pass. Scott\u2019s going to cover this issue in depth and give you his recommendation about review groups, so give this episode a listen.\nWhat are the top 5 things you should do to ensure your product reviews on Amazon stick?\nThat question is at the heart of what Scott covers on this episode. He wants you to know how to make the most of your efforts to get reviews, so he\u2019s holding nothing back. Here they are: (1) Understand the purpose of initial launch reviews. (2) Have reviewers include proper disclaimers. (3) Don\u2019t rely on review groups. (4) Focus on organic sales (Pay Per Click / Pricing Strategies) (5) Use a good follow-up sequence to encourage organic reviews.

This episode is #19 of Scott\u2019s Friday Q&amp;A sessions where he answers your questions so that you can learn how to sell on Amazon profitably. If you\u2019d like to have your own questions answered, you can ask them at http://www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask\nShould you set up your Amazon Seller account without LLC or incorporation paperwork?\nThat was one of the questions asked on this episode of The Amazing Seller. While Scott is not an attorney or tax accountant (and suggests you contact one with your questions before you get rolling), he does have an opinion about the question. His view is that you should approach your Amazon sales as a business, and set it up that way from the start. You want the protection and security of the legal entity that LLC or incorporation can provide you. You also want to make sure you\u2019re keeping your taxes separate from your personal income. Again, check with a tax accountant or lawyer for the full picture, and listen in to this episode to hear the other questions and Scott\u2019s answers.\nHow can you estimate your product costs and profits accurately?\nIt\u2019s a very important question because you need to stay on top of your costs so that you know that what you\u2019re doing is truly profitable and not just wishful thinking. Costs include everything from the actual price you pay for your products, to shipping, to customs fees, to Amazon seller fees. How do you keep it all straight? That\u2019s the question one listener asked in this episode and Scott gives his best answer, including some resources you can use to help you estimate things so that you\u2019re not caught off guard. That\u2019s on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nIs Bundling products together worth it?\nIt all comes down to cost. Every step you take with your products, from shipping to packaging to branding, is going to add to the cost of your products. There are companies that can receive your products and package them together as you like, but again, it\u2019s an increased cost to you. You can also package those products together yourself, but it will take time and you\u2019ll need specialized packaging with your branding and logos on it. Either way, the cost is more by bundling products. But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do it. Bundling can be a powerful way to expand your brand image on Amazon and provide more value to your customers. Listen to this episode to find out how Scott would approach bundling.\nAre you eager to learn how to be a Private Label Amazon seller and want it in an all-in-one package?\nIf so, you need to get into Scott\u2019s Private Label Classroom.

But most Amazon sellers don\u2019t take the time to learn the platform well enough, so their PPC ads don\u2019t have as much impact as they could. A ton of your sales can come through PPC if you will take the time to develop a strategy to use the tools for the powerful purpose they were created for. In this episode of The Amazing Seller, Scott\u2019s going to walk you through the top 7 mistakes Amazon Sellers make when using PPC and how you can avoid every one of them.\nPPC on Amazon is about more than just the obvious keywords\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s impossible to get into the mind of the people who are searching for what you have to sell. You don\u2019t know how they think about the product, or how they formulate their search query. You\u2019ll tend to pick the most obvious keywords, which is good, but the people searching for your product may search for it in ways that are not so obvious. There are very simple ways you can find a clearer picture of the other keywords and phrases buyers are using to search for your product and you\u2019re going to hear about those methods in this episode.\nIf you\u2019re going to make PPC work for you, you have to check your data regularly\nWhen you first set up an Amazon PPC campaign, you won\u2019t have everything dialed in to its maximum potential. You just won\u2019t, it\u2019s not possible to hit it just right the first time. You should view your first attempts at PPC as an experiment that will show you what you need to do to dial it in to its maximum potential. That means you check out how it\u2019s working and make tweaks as you go along, refining your PPC effectiveness as you go. So don\u2019t set your PPC campaign and leave it alone. Watch it, beginning 7 days after you set up your campaign. Once you reach that 7 day threshold, begin making minor adjustments. Find out the details about how to do that on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nThe way PPC benefits your Amazon products\nPPC is one of the things that pushes your product higher in the search rankings because it puts your product directly in front of the people who are searching for it. When they click through your PPC ad and eventually purchase your product, your product just got a boost in Amazon\u2019s search algorithm because it is seen as a more legitimate product. That\u2019s when you need to follow up with your email sequences to generate more reviews - which in turn moves your product up in the sales process. It all begins with a sale, which begins with driving traffic to your product through Pay Per Click (PPC).\nYOU CAN GENERATE NEW PRODUCT IDEAS FROM PPC\nRunning an effective PPC campaign for your product on Amazon is great, but there\u2019s a side benefit that most people don\u2019t consider. As you monitor your PPC campaign you\u2019ll come across other product ideas related to yours from the data that is shown through your PPC campaign. That data could be telling you how to add to your product line in a way that will set you apart from other vendors and give you an appearance of legitimacy that will establish your business rather than just sell individual products. Scott covers that concept in today\u2019s episode, so make sure you listen in.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\tScott\u2019s introduction to this PPC focused episode!\n\tiTunes reviews from The Amazing Seller listeners.\n\tScott\u2019s recommendations for how to do PPC the right way (past episode).\n\tMISTAKE #1: Using the wrong PPC strategy.\n\tMISTAKE #2: Only focusing on the obvious keywords.\n\tMISTAKE #3: Not doing enough testing regarding the keywords they\u2019ve chosen.\n\tMISTAKE #4: Not regularly checking the data and making adjustments.\n\tMISTAKE #5: Hesitance to spend more money once you find keywords that work.\n\tMISTAKE #6: They stop using PPC once sales begin.\n\tMISTAKE #7: They don\u2019t look at their data for possible product ideas.", "duration": "36:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS078.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1437984055, "title": "TAS 077 : The Secrets to using Feedback and Reviews that Drive More Sales \u2013 with Chris Guthrie", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "Chris Guthrie is a superstar when it comes to Amazon sales. He\u2019s made tons of cash through the Amazon Affiliate program but has also moved into the realm of his own Private Label products being sold on Amazon and is making a killing. He\u2019s especially adept at building product niches on the back of product feedback and reviews, taking advantage of Amazon\u2019s built in algorithms to move products up in the Amazon search rankings. Listen in to the extra-powerful conversation on The Amazing Seller podcast.\n\n\nWhy are reviews of your product so important?\nReviews are proof to a potential buyer that your product has not only been purchased, but has been enjoyed. Internet sales nowadays is highly dependent on customer reviews - they are the social proof that your product is what it says it is, and that you are a reputable seller to purchase from. If you don\u2019t have a significant number of product reviews on Amazon, your products are going to languish at the bottom of the search results, not even being on the table as an option for the people who are searching for what you sell. How do you get more reviews for your products? In this episode Scott talks with his guest Chris Guthrie about several strategies you can use to solicit feedback from your customers to boost your product listings in Amazon search.\nWhat about feedback? Should you ask for it? What if it\u2019s negative?\nThere are plenty of Amazon FBA sellers who are afraid to ask for feedback because they believe that if they receive negative feedback about their products, they will take a hit in Amazon\u2019s search algorithms. While that\u2019s possible, a better strategy, which Scott addresses in this episode with Chris Guthrie, is to bury the negatives with tons of positives. Asking for feedback is yet another way you can boost your products in Amazon search. Scott and Chris also reveal some simple ways you can get rid of the results of some of your negative feedback, all in this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nPlant your flag in a product niche and build your business from there.\nThat\u2019s some of Chris Guthrie\u2019s advice for new Amazon sellers. He believes that once you do your initial product research and find a product that you can take action with, you should do your best to get a quick \u201cwin\u201d with that product and then branch out into other related products from there. You have to be interested in more than just making money, you have to build your business around a certain niche of products so that purchasers of your first product will be open to buying your next product as well because they\u2019re comfortable buying from you because of their good experience with your first product. Find out more about how Chris suggests you go about doing just that, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nDid you know you can automate a request for feedback from your Amazon customers?\nThat\u2019s what Scott does, as does his guest, Chris Guthrie. In fact, Chris has created a software solution to do exactly that. Scott\u2019s been using it and loves the simplicity and ease of use - and has seen his reviews rise to over 600, with 4 to 6 new reviews coming in on his products every day. Even if you can\u2019t afford a product like Chris\u2019 you can still solicit feedbacks and reviews from your customers through Amazon\u2019s contact options. Don\u2019t neglect this important step in boosting your products in Amazon\u2019s search algorithms.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\tWelcome to this Q&amp;A episode!\n\tScott\u2019s introduction to Chris Guthrie - an Amazon pro\n\tHow Chris got started - and a quick word of advice for those doing Amazon sales on the side.\n\tWhy Amazon feedback and Amazon reviews are so important for private label products.\n\tHow Chris started going after low competition products and found his preferred niche.\n\tWhy Chris believes Amazon to be a great opportunity for people.\n\tAn overview of Chris\u2019 software Amasuite - and how he first created it in February 2012.\n\tUsing reviews to beat the competition and positi...", "duration": "1:18:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/61/9c/f6/619cf602-ef11-f028-75fe-dc6c8c93f351/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/yougetripped/TAS077.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 963294070, "seriesTitle": "The Amazing Seller Podcast", "pubDate": 1437813023, "title": "TAS BONUS EPISODE : Prime Day Results to Blow Your Mind!", "author": "Scott Voelker: Amazon FBA Seller and Marketing Strategist", "summary": "In this episode of The Amazing Seller Scott Voelker quickly reviews what he observed about Amazon\u2019s recent \u201cPrime Day\u201d and outlines why those results prove that anyone who can get products onto the Amazon platform should do so immediately.\n\nAmazon is becoming a powerhouse for online sellers.

The reason Scott does these Q&amp;A episodes is simple: There are lots of questions that come up AS you are doing the work of establishing your business. You need the ability to ask somebody who has been down the road to answer those specific questions, and Scott wants to be that person. In answering your questions it\u2019s not only going to benefit you, it will help other listeners as well. So listen in and apply the answers you hear to your own business, and get started building your own Amazon FBA business.\nCan I use existing traffic going to a website where I feature Amazon Affiliate products to feature my own products?\nScott was so excited to hear this question because it shows how smart the listeners to the Amazing Seller podcast are, and that this listener in particular was thinking outside the box to take advantage of an already existing traffic flow. This guy has established himself as an Amazon Affiliate, which pays 7% to him from each sale of an Amazon product he refers through his website. He\u2019s got a substantial amount of traffic already and thought it would be a great idea to somehow feature his own product on that site to get even more profit for himself. Scott thought it was a great idea! You should listen in to hear how Scott advises him to go about it.\nPatented products can be a tricky issue. How should you handle the possibility of selling a similar product?\nThis listener has found a wonderful opportunity in a certain product, but recognized that the product most like it in the Amazon marketplace is patented. Should that raise red flags? Should she take special steps to make sure her product does not infringe on the patent of the existing product that\u2019s for sale? You might be surprised to hear Scott\u2019s answer, so be sure you listen in to hear his answer to this perplexing question.\nUPC codes to differentiate your product from others that aren\u2019t selling so well\nA listener has found a product that he believes will sell pretty well, but the other product that\u2019s already listed on Amazon has very few reviews, a poorly formatted listing, and isn\u2019t selling very well as a result. He\u2019s wondering if he could get his own UPC for the product, create his own listing, begin soliciting reviews, and soon beat the existing product. Scott\u2019s main concern on this one is not about the UPC code, but about the sales. Can you figure out why that\u2019s his concern? Listen in to find out what this listener should be thinking about first.\nMultiple products build a business, not just an income.\nThis listener knows that and asked Scott what to do when he wants to use a small amount of capital to launch many products within the same niche at the same time. He wants to get the sales flowing while the opportunity is hot and establish his brand with a number of items. Scott gives some solid advice on that approach to help the listener navigate the process of launching multiple products so he doesn\u2019t make mistakes and waste his time and money. Listen in to find out how Scott advises him, on this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\tWelcome to this Q&amp;A episode!\n\tOne situation where Scott had the opportunity to meet with a TAS listener to discuss Amazon sales and the T-shirt design for the upcoming TAS T-shirt!\n\tIf you have a question for one of these Q&amp;A episodes, submit yours!\n\tToday\u2019s questions:\n\n\tHow can I use my Amazon Affiliate traffic to offer my own product?\n\tHow do I deal with products that seem like great options but have a patent on them?\n\tHow can I create my own UPC code so I can differentiate my product from others?\n\tWhat is the best way to launch multiple products at the same time?

Scott Voelker knows. He\u2019s been at this long enough to know that there are opportunities every day to become discouraged and give up. But have you ever stopped to consider WHY people actually do give up? Scott believes there are 3 main reasons people give up, and he\u2019s going to outline them and their solutions on this episode of The Amazing Seller podcast.\nBefore you even start an Amazon business, you need to get this one nailed down.\nIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be quitting before you even hit your first real obstacle. What is it that\u2019s so important? You have to know your \u201cwhy.\u201d That means you have to be crystal clear on why you are doing what you are doing. What is your motivation, the reason it\u2019s so crucial that you succeed at your FBA business? If you don\u2019t know, you\u2019ll cave in the first time things get even the slightest bit hard. You\u2019ve got to have that light at the end of the tunnel to keep you driving forward no matter what happens. If you take the time to clarify your \u201cwhy\u201d, you\u2019ll be able to persevere through the hard times.\nIt\u2019s important to plan, but don\u2019t think too far ahead.\nWhy?

What is it? You\u2019ll have to listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller to find out!\nHow committed are you to your FBA business?\nIt\u2019s a question that is about more than your \u201cwhy\u201d - it\u2019s asking yourself \u201cWhat am I willing to do in order to achieve my why?\u201d You\u2019ve got to be clear on the price you\u2019re willing to pay in order to make your Amazon FBA goals a reality and stick to the tasks that will accomplish those goals, every single day. Think it through. Get your mind right so you can be ready when the hard times come. Commit yourself practically by creating a schedule for yourself that forces you into regular, systematic work that heads toward your goals. In the end, your commitment is only valid if you are putting the action behind it to make it reality. Find out how Scott does this in his own life in this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nWhat will you do if you launch your product and it doesn\u2019t sell very well?\nYou need to be ready for that possibility, because it could very well happen. Are you going to allow the less-than-hoped-for sales to discourage you into quitting? Though it feels like a very natural response, it\u2019s the exact opposite of what you should do. A slow product launch is an opportunity for you to learn from your small successes, but even more so, learn from the lack of results. You\u2019ll discover ways you can tweak your PPC, adjust our product title or description, or any number of things that can increase your sales over time.

He had a need in his own life and felt compelled to not only find a solution but to make that solution available for others. Through his research and hard work, Rich took action to make his business dreams come true by providing just such a product. It\u2019s proof that if you pay attention to the real needs of people and put action behind your ideas surrounding those needs, there\u2019s no telling how successful you might be.

But he makes no excuses about his life or his business. He knows that it takes action to make things happen and that\u2019s exactly what he did. One night as he sat up watching TV, he saw a late night infomercial that got him thinking about product possibilities for Amazon, and the rest is history. His hard work and research paid off and now his success story as an amazing Amazon seller is part of history.

He was working for a company and saw an incredible opportunity for them to place their products on Amazon that would up the bottom line. But his employer decided not to take advantage of the opportunity. So what did Ty do? He took matters into his own hands by wholesaling those very products on Amazon and making a load of cash. It\u2019s a story of ingenuity and hard work that is inspiring to those who truly want to make a business on Amazon. Ty\u2019s story shows that potential profit-makers are all around, if you know how to look. Listen in to this episode to hear more about Ty\u2019s amazing story.\nFrom wholesale, to private label, to software development\nTaking massive action to see things come about is one of the themes of The Amazing Seller Podcast, and guest Greg Mercer is a prime example of where that philosophy can take you. Greg started out like many people, wholesaling products for sale on Amazon. In time, he learned to research products to create his own private label business, but wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. He wanted to be able to find more products, faster, so he created a software app (Jungle Scout) that cut the time investment from that process tremendously.

This episode is the 17th edition of the \u201cAsk Scott\u201d format where listeners get to ask their questions about FBA Sales and Scott answers them from his experience. In today\u2019s episode Scott answers 5 questions ranging from whether or not the Fulfilled By Amazon option is always the best option, to how to pay suppliers in the safest, most efficient way. Listen in to get all the details!\nWhy should I use Fulfilled By Amazon?\nA listener who has been selling products on Ebay for a long time asked Scott about the differences between Seller Fulfillment and Fulfilled by Amazon. Scott\u2019s answer is clearly in favor of the FBA model for a number of reasons. When using FBA, Amazon takes care of all shipping, no matter how many items are ordered. You may be able to handle shipping 5 products a day, but what happens when you get 20, or 50, or 100 items ordered each day? Then you\u2019re doing a lot of work you don\u2019t have to be doing. In addition, Amazon likely gives preference to FBA sellers in the search rankings and you won\u2019t want to miss out on that. Plus, if a customer decides to return the item they purchased from you, you\u2019ll have to deal with all that stuff yourself if you\u2019re not using FBA, whereas Amazon will take care of it if you are doing FBA. Find out more reasons to use Amazon FBA on this edition of The Amazing Seller.\nHow do I decide if it\u2019s wise to sell a product with many variations, like color and size?\nThis is a great question and one that Scott knows is an issue for many would be and veteran Amazon sellers. Variations do put a lot more issues on the table for an Amazon seller and Scott recommends that people new to selling on Amazon try to find products that have as few variations as possible, just to make the learning curve a bit easier. But if you\u2019re dead set on selling a product with variations, focus first on the one that you believe sells the most. That way you can work out all the kinks on one product instead of multiple products. Find out more ways to work out the issues with variations on products as you listen to this episode.\nHow should you pay product suppliers?\nIs Paypal the best option? What about bank transfers? Is there a way that protects you and the seller? A listener had this great question and Scott answers by sharing what he does and what he knows other sellers have done that seem to work. The best option is working through a channel that provides an escrow type account, where the payment is put \u201con hold\u201d until the order is completed. Then when you, the purchaser are satisfied with the products, you can release the money from escrow. This is what Scott\u2019s done through the Alibaba interface since he first started and has never had a problem with a supplier. He\u2019s also worked with various suppliers to include escrow arrangements when they didn\u2019t have one already in place. There are all kinds of options to pay your suppliers, and some are better than others. Hear all of Scott\u2019s recommendations by listening to this episode!\nIn order to expand your sales, should you add more products or move into other Amazon markets?\nA listener had this great question and Scott had to honestly answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d That\u2019s because the answer depends a lot on what you\u2019re wanting to accomplish. For now, Scott is focusing only on the U.S. market, simply because it has a broader customer base, thus there\u2019s more demand for his products. But he readily admits that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t be making money in some of the other markets. He feels like for now, he\u2019s better off maximizing everything he can in his current U.S. based market before moving on to other things. What do you think? What markets are you currently seeing success in?

Do you know how to use it to maximize your product sales?\nWe\u2019ve all heard of Google. It\u2019s the monster search engine of all search engines. But did you know that among the suite of free products Google offers, there\u2019s also a thing called Google Trends? It\u2019s a FREE (Did you hear that? Free!) tool that is based on the Google Search results and algorithms that shows how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages. What that means is that you can see how and when particular search terms are being used, when they are used more, and when they are used less. If bells are not going off in your head about how useful this can be to your Amazon FBA business, just give this episode a listen to find out how this free data can impact the way you research products and get ready for peak buying seasons.\nScott\u2019s experience with Google trends - and why he decided to share this with you\nAs you know from listening to The Amazing Seller, Scott is FOR your Amazon business succeeding. He knows you can do it and wants to see you make your dreams come true. Recently in a conversation with another Amazon seller Scott was asked what he was learning through his Google Trends data - and Scott had to admit he\u2019d not been using Google Trends very often. That was enough to prompt him to go back and check out Google Trends again and he came away convinced that it is an amazing tool for analyzing product trends. As he became more convinced, he decided that he had to share his top 5 uses of Google Trends with you! Listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller to find out the best ways to use this amazing tool!\nAre you ready for your peak sales season? Do you even know when it is?\nGoogle trends can tell you. Honest. All you have to do is go into the GT interface and put in your search terms and Google Trends will show you how often that search phrase has been used, and even the times of year it is used most. That is a huge insight into the possible sales cycle of your product that enables you to prepare by stocking up on inventory, getting your products ordered and ready for that peak season. Of course there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re going to sell more products just because there is a past trend of search activity surrounding your keywords, but it\u2019s more information about past sales than you had before. Learn more about using Google Trends as you listen to this episode of The Amazing Seller.\nAre you considering a new product? Do you know how to tell if it\u2019s sold big in the past?\nYou need to do some product research. You need to validate that the product you think is going to be a good seller is actually a good seller. That\u2019s where the free results you can get from Google Trends comes in. You can research the past demand and search activity surrounding potential products or product lines that you are considering for your Amazon business. It could be just the product validation you\u2019ve been looking for to make you feel comfortable investing in a new product. Don\u2019t miss out on Scott\u2019s tips for how to use Google Trends to do effective product validation, in this episode!\nAre you dreading the \u201cslow time\u201d in your product sales cycle? What if you could find products to fill in those down times with more sales?\nGoogle Trends can help you do exactly that! How do you do it? Start by researching your existing products in Google Trends. You\u2019ll likely find that the search frequency of your related keywords is low at the same times of the year you currently experience lower sales. Now you know exactly when you should expect the downtime in your current product line sales. Next you go back to Google Trends to find new potential products that sell well during your current slow time. By doing this you could find a way to balance your sales cycle to keep your sales consistent throughout the year.

There\u2019s no easy way to do this, but there are many software apps that help make it easier than it would be without them. Scott\u2019s got 4 that he recommends. Listen to this episode of the podcast to hear about all 4 and to find out how you can get purchase discounts on some of them.\n\nAll 4 are listed on the resource page at http://www.TheAmazingSeller.com/resources\nKEYWORD RESEARCH\nKeyword research is a valuable skill to learn. Without it you won\u2019t know how to optimize your listings to be found by potential customers who search Amazon for products like yours. Keyword research enables you to write your listing and product descriptions in a way that maximize the use of words that potential buyers are already looking for. In this episode of the Amazing Seller podcast Scott outlines 4 of his preferred keyword research tools and gives his recommendations for the strengths and weaknesses of each one.\nPRODUCT SOURCING\nWhere are you going to find suppliers for your private label products? Do you know the first thing about how to find trusted sources that won\u2019t rip you off and will actually deliver on their promises? There are a lot of potential sources of products out there but you\u2019ve got to know where to find the ones that are trustworthy. In this episode of the Amazing Seller podcast Scott is going to recommend 3 primary places to find good suppliers for the products you may want to sell, two are foreign and one is in the United States.\nPRODUCT PICTURES AND ARTWORK\nProduct images are a vital part of your Amazon listing, especially when you\u2019re sourcing your own products. Your image has to present your product in a professional, eye-catching manner and serve as the true \u201cimage\u201d of your brand and business. Where are you going to get those images made? Do you know where to begin? In this episode Scott is going to suggest 4 sources for those images that will serve you well. Check out the audio to get the full scoop on why he recommends these 4 and not others.\nEMAIL FOLLOWUP AND COLLECTION\nOnce you\u2019re able to start capturing customer information, you have to be able to follow up on those inquiries and sales by building a rapport with your customer base. This requires you to have some automated email follow up so that you can keep in touch with your customers regularly, promote your products, and truly scale up your business. In this episode of the Amazing Seller podcast Scott will tell you the 4 resources he uses to collect email, respond via automated systems, and set up pages where his customers can register their products or ask for updates.\n\nAll of these resources \u00a0are listed on the resource page at http://www.TheAmazingSeller.com/resources\nPRODUCT REVIEWS\nMuch of what drives the Amazon search algorithms is product reviews. Reviews signal to Amazon and to potential buyers that your products are legitimate and your business is authentic and trustworthy. How do you get those reviews? How do you establish yourself to the point that customers will be willing to sacrifice the time it takes to leave you a review? In this episode of the Amazing Seller podcast Scott is going to share some resources that he uses to encourage and ask for reviews to quickly get his products established in the Amazon marketplace.\nBUSINESS AND LEGAL STUFF\nAny business owner can tell you, you have got to make sure you are doing things legally in order to avoid tax trouble, licensing and registration penalties, and all kinds of other things relating to the legality of your business and your business activities.

You can ask your question by going to www.TheAmazingSeller.com/ask .\nQ1: Facebook groups and product promotion\nThe first question covered in this episode of The Amazing Seller has to do with using a Facebook group to promote or highlight an Amazon FBA product. The listener has a group with several thousand members and is curious how she can go about leveraging that group the most to increase her product sales. Scott\u2019s advice has to do with the level of interaction and connection she\u2019s having within the group to establish herself as the owner and expert in the group, as well as some practical tips about when and how to promote her products through that group.\nQ 2: Price points and how to set the right price for your product\nQuestion number 2 in today\u2019s episode of the Amazing Seller is from a listener who is curious how to go about setting the right price point for his product when the Amazon results show a wide variety of prices already being asked for similar products. This is a great question and Scott dives into the details of what to consider in terms of similarity of products, the sales of those products and how to set a price that is advantageous to you and attractive to your buyers.\nQ3: Amazon PPC campaigns\nAmazon PPC campaigns are some of the best ways to drive traffic to your products and thereby increase conversions and build a customer base. But you can spend a whole lot of money and get very few results if you don\u2019t set up those campaigns the right way. This question focuses on that very issue and Scott provides some great insights regarding what to consider when you set up your Amazon PPC campaigns to save you money and get the best bang for your buck overall.\nQ4: Setting up discount codes for your Amazon products, and how to use review sites like Tomoson.\nA listener asks Scott how to go about setting up discount codes for products so that he can do some promotions, and the answer Scott gives is pretty simple. Listen to find out how to set up your own discount codes. A second question from the same listener has to do with how to best utilize review sites like www.Tomoson.com to increase product reviews, and thereby rank higher in Amazon\u2019s search algorithms. This is very helpful stuff, so listen in to hear the answer.\nQ5: The value of using \u201csuggested keywords\u201d to promote your Amazon products\nThe final question on today\u2019s \u201cAsk Scott\u201d episode of the Amazing Seller has to do with the value of the suggested keywords Amazon gives when setting up keyword campaigns. In Scott\u2019s view, those suggested keywords can be very helpful in dialing-in your ppc campaign to get actual buyers to your products and increase your customer base through sales. Find out how to go about that using the suggested keywords as you listen to Scott\u2019s answer to this listener question.\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\tHello from Scott!\n\tHow to submit your questions for Scott.\n\tScott\u2019s invitation to you to attend one of his free workshops.\n\tHow to get started launching your Amazon business.\n\tiTunes reviews from listeners like you!\n\tLISTENER QUESTION 1: When and how should I use my Facebook group to promote my products?\n\tLISTENER QUESTION 2: How should I evaluate the price point on a product?\n\tLISTENER QUESTION 3: How can I set up Amazon PPC campaigns the right way.\n\tLISTENER QUESTION 4: How can I set coupon codes for products?

Scott\u2019s got 5 great questions today, ranging from an inquiry about optimizing sponsored ads for a product, all the way to avoid losing the seller box for a trademarked listing. It\u2019s all over the board today, but well worth your time. You might even get the exact answer to a question that\u2019s been rattling around in your head for some time!\nHow can I get my sponsored ads onto page #1?\nThat\u2019s the great question Leo asked this week and Scott\u2019s response goes into a lot of detail about keyword research, the difference between long-tail and short-tail keywords, and how you can use the interface to position your ads in a way that they have a greater likelihood of landing on page 1.\nRunning out of inventory? How do you regain your position?\nJordan has hit a few situations where he\u2019s run out of inventory and by the time he\u2019s replenished his product supply his seller ranking and position has plummeted. What do you do then? Scott\u2019s got some great advice for him on this episode that has to do with how to keep your inventory from running out, as well as what you can do to regain your momentum if you do happen to run out of inventory.\nNaming private-label products: Is there a good system to optimize the name?\nJulie\u2019s creating her own private label products and wants to maximize the name she chooses to take advantage of keywords, search algorithms, and stuff like that. Is there a formula or system Scott uses to make sure he\u2019s choosing the best name for his products? His answer might surprise you, so be sure you listen to this helpful section of the show.\nCan you use HTML in product descriptions? If so, how much impact does it have on the listing?\nPaul wants to know if Amazon allows html coding in product descriptions - you know, stuff like bold, italics, headings, and other things to make the text and descriptions \u201cpop\u201d for the reader. Scott\u2019s answer outlines the basic html he uses in his product descriptions and why he only uses a few minor things. You\u2019ll learn a lot from his answer.\nMy trademarked product listing is being outranked by other sellers!\nTommy\u2019s got a question about a product listing he created that\u2019s got Scott a bit stumped! Tommy branded his own product, listed it on Amazon as a trademarked product, yet he keeps getting bumped from the buy box by other sellers of the same product! Scott answers his question with a lot of questions of his own. You won\u2019t want to miss this one!\n\nYou\u2019ll learn all of that and much more on this episode of The Amazing Seller with Scott Voelker.

The question was simple,\nCan you create passive income from selling on Amazon?\nAs you\u2019ll see in this episode, it\u2019s a great question with a definite, \u201cYes!\u201d answer, but there are lots of things you need to understand in order to make that passive income a reality.\nFigure out your \"why\" first!\nBut before you get to the place you can generate a passive income with Amazon selling you\u2019ve got to very clearly know the \u201cwhy\u201d behind your business. The \u201cwhy\u201d is the reason you are doing the business you\u2019ve chosen. It\u2019s the motivation that keeps you going when things get challenging or hard or discouraging. If you don\u2019t have a \u201cwhy\u201d that keeps you going, your motivation will fade long before you get to the point that passive income is possible. Scott talks about the importance of finding your \u201cwhy\u201d in this episode.\nPassive income is not entirely passive!\nWhen you think about the idea of passive income remember this: there will always be SOME work involved in any stream of income. So to think that you can set something up for sale on \u00a0Amazon and have an ongoing stream of income that you\u2019ll never have to tweak or touch again is simply unreasonable. At the first least you\u2019ll have a lot of work at the front end as you get your systems established and refined, and you\u2019ll continue to have work managing any team members you\u2019ve hired, overseeing the processes and systems, and tweaking them as Amazon changes its algorithms and policies over the years. In this episode of the Amazing Seller Scott will walk you through the things you need to think about to make your passive income through Amazon as passive as possible.\nYou've got to be realistic!\nScott believes that passive income through Amazon selling is possible, if you\u2019re willing to keep investing your time, energy, and thought into your business to keep it running smoothly once all the initial work is done. That means you have to be realistic about what you can expect when you sell products through Amazon\u2019s FBA, and you\u2019ll have to understand that Amazon is a channel for your sales, not a guarantee. Listen to this episode and find out how getting that straight in you head can set you up for the best benefits of selling through Amazon and potentially set you up for as much of a \u201cpassive\u201d income as is possible through FBA.\nLearning to take advantage of seasons and trends in the market!\nIf you\u2019re a smart Amazon seller there is an additional aspect of selling on Amazon that keeps it from being entirely passive: You need to be able to take advantage of the seasons and trends that are happening in the market. That means you have to pay attention, learn, try out new products, and adjust your sales tactics and products for sale so that you can maximize your profits as your business continues to sell your staple products. That takes ongoing work. So while your staple products and the systems behind them may keep chugging along fairly passively (to you), you need to be on top of changes in the market to keep moving forward - which requires lots of work on your part.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn all of that and much more on this episode of The Amazing Seller with Scott Voelker. Be sure to check out the outline and links mentioned in this episode below!\nOUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE AMAZING SELLER\n\n\tHello from Scott!\n\tWhat is the WHY behind your business?
