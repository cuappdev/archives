It's not enough to find your value, you have to deeply understand it, refine it, wield it with mastery. This is what it means to be a pro.\n\nDavid bowie\nHow do we take your creative peanuts, and turn them into creative peanut butter. Take these AKWARD to eat, messy chore into this power packed dense nearly liquid gold!\n\n1. Grind -\nCarver said to break it down and build it back up. Forget what you know.\n- Particle - forget your market, forget your niche, forget your industry, forget art. Know you. Didn't know I was an illustrator until I knew my value\n- Atom - study the greats. Read, meet the greats. Connect the dots. Know the lingo. Humble yourself.\n- Compound - your fields fundamentals. Master the basics. Read the books, work out those muscles.\n\n2. Add - we ain't serving that whole foods junk, this is commercial art!\n- salt - keeps them craving, coming back more. Work on the weakness of your strength. Take that peanut of talent and turn it into a jar of power packed peanut butter.\n- Sugar - wow factor. Gallery art is a mild mannered good old fashioned debate at the country club. We all speak in turn. Commercial art is a mosh pit. Gallery art is the colonial warfare, commercial art is guerilla warfare. If you want to get paid to do art for a living you have throw away subjectivity and subtlety. So many indie arts sit around complaining that know one cares, be so good they can't ignore you!\n- Stablizer - ready to go on a moments notice. No stir. Warmed up. Coach knows you give every practice your all even if you're not getting any play time. Make make make piles and piles and piles of work. Glad well says 10k hours of the RIGHT kind of practice. Not just drawing or playing notes, the critical thinking. Not enough to run sprints and lift. You need o be working on the finer points of your jumper, you need to be working on your short game.\n\n3. Package - \nUnderstand it, master it, then you need to be able to SELL.\nZig / selling teacher.\nNot phony bull. Really articulate the ROI!\nBranding.\nMusic.\nIllustration.\nCut the crap.\nBuy your own product.\n\nPresentation is everything. Violinist in subway.\nPresent yourself. Don't use authenticity as a crutch. Yeah those cockroaches are just my restaurants way of being authentic.\n\n\nConclusion.\nLunch with my dad.\nThere's a science. There's a craft.

Or harvest when their vegetables have only began to grow?\n\nToday on the show we talk about the differing seasons in your creative career and the power that comes from understanding them, identifying where you\u2019re at and making the most of the season you\u2019re in.\n\nCycle to the call to something more creatively fulfilling vs making money at it or success\nNothing kills motivation like confusion\n\n1. Plant\nSigns you\u2019re in the planting season:\nDread / apathy about current work (not just boredom)\nNew Opportunities or paths emerge\nIdea that doesn\u2019t go away (Seth Rogen from Tim Ferris Podcast http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/29/seth-rogen-and-evan-goldberg/ )\n\nWhat to give your focus:\nSeed Selection\nClear goals\nUnderstand the magnitude of the journey\nGet super clear on the \u2018why\u2019\n\n2. Grow\nSigns you\u2019re in the growing season:\nBoredom / no reward\nFueled only by passion / dedication / curiosity / fun\n\nWhat to give your focus:\nStay in touch with why\nEnjoying the Journey\nGiving it your all - like Rocky training\n\n3. Harvest\nSigns you\u2019re in the harvest season:\n$ enters the equation\nOpportunities knocking on your door\n\nWhat to give your focus:\nFinish Strong\n\nJim Coudal creative mornings talk\nhttps://creativemornings.com/talks/jim-coudal/1\n\n4. Rest\nSigns you\u2019re in the rest or the \u2018dead soil\u2019 season:\nYou never want to touch this work again\n\nWhat to give your focus:\nRome wasn\u2019t built in a day\nThere was a time you\u2019d have killed for where you are now\n\nConclusion\nUnderstanding the seasons mean that the farmer doesn\u2019t have to wake up everyday questioning everything or scrambling. There is peace and productivity to understanding the seasons of your career.\n\nThese seasons are cyclical. You don\u2019t just do each season once.
