Problems are money. Every problem ever solved on this planet is an opportunity. The bigger the problem solved, the richer you become. You need to pick your problems rather than get stuck with them. Be the creator of your problems, not the receiver. I always tell people to look at their problems as opportunities because one of the most basic truths in life is that problem-solving is success. If I have problem customers (people who give me a hard time during the buying process), or dissatisfied customers (people I have sold but are unhappy about what they received), then I know this is where I can create the most ardent admirers. If I show that I am willing to go above and beyond where my competitors decide to stop at, my customers will be the people who are more likely to be sold and more likely to buy from me because I have exceeded any and all of their expectations. Obviously, I don\u2019t want every one of my customers to be problematic, but what it comes down to is this: if there\u2019s a problem, my success is reliant on my ability to provide solutions for them.

This is because people are ignorized by the media. Planet earth manufactures so much ignorance it\u2019s incredible. Today I wanted to highlight the 5 largest blunders that millennials must fix if they want to get their money right. Make this the year you get your financial house in order!</p>\n\n<p>1) Not making enough money\u2014The holy grail of money that almost no one talks about is to make money. You can get rich or solve money problems without making money. Making more money is more important than saving or paying off debt. Spend more time making money and less time talking about your age, social media, and politics. There will be many presidents in your lifetime most of which you will disagree with.</p>\n\n<p>2) Paying off student debt prematurely\u2014Student debt would be the last thing I would pay back and I wouldn\u2019t suggest you do so until after you have some real money put away. And by the way, before you pay off your loan you should renegotiate a payout. Get your financial life in order and then start paying off your part of the student debt bubble of 1.3 trillion dollars.</p>\n\n<p>3) Using Credit for stuff that can\u2019t create income\u2014I have a rule, ONLY USE DEBT IF IT MAKES ME MONEY OR MAKES ME BETTER. Never use debt that can\u2019t produce income. Buying a home with a mortgage that can never make you money just doesn\u2019t make sense. Buying a motorcycle on debt can\u2019t make me money but I would lease a car so I could make sales calls. Just look at your parents.</p>\n\n<p>4) Investing prematurely\u2014Wall Street loves to see you invest money at the age of 12 and spin all these stories about if you do so you will be rich when you retire. It\u2019s insane. If you don\u2019t know what you are investing in then its not investing, its gambling. There is no way you will possibly know what you are doing at that young of an age. Information is everywhere and knowledge is almost nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>5) Spending too much time at college. If you believe you have to go to college then get in and get out. You could cut your college bill in 1/2 by getting it done in half the time. This would save the average college student $46,000 and have you earning money twice as fast as most of the chumps you go to class with.</p>\n\n<p>All millennials should be coming to 10X GrowthCon this March. It\u2019s the biggest entrepreneurial business conference of all-time. Learn strategies and get ideas that are priceless from men and women responsible for over $10 billion in sales.</p>", "duration": "33:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/podcasts.grantcardone.com/younghustlers/YH_161_5_Biggest_Mistakes_Millennials_Make_2017.02.02.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 860180416, "seriesTitle": "Young Hustlers", "pubDate": 1484845200, "title": "159: What To Do When You Are Not Feeling It", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What do you do when you're not feeling it?

The stock market could lose a trillion dollars and there would still be an abundance of wealth on this planet.</p>\n\n<p>2.Assume Responsibility for all Results\u2014Taking responsibility for everything in your life is the only way to take control of your life.</p>\n\n<p>3.Take Only Massive Action\u2014When you take massive actions your mind-set will shift and so will your results. You will end up instigating opportunities that you will have to address earlier, later, and in a different way than you would on a \u201cnormal\u201d day, so a routine day will become a thing of the past.</p>\n\n<p>4.Fear is an Indicator to Take Action\u2014 Getting a handle on fear is not easy, but it is critical to success. Maybe fear held you back you from calling on a client, investing money in your company, or maybe moving to a new city for a great opportunity or taking a great relationship to a more serious level.</p>\n\n<p>5.Criticism is a Sign of Success\u2014 Although getting criticized is certainly not the best feeling in the world, I have great news: Receiving criticism is a surefire sign that you are well on your way. Criticism is not something that you want to avoid; rather, it\u2019s what you must expect to come your way once you start hitting it big.</p>", "duration": "31:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/podcasts.grantcardone.com/younghustlers/YH_158_Top_10X_Principles_2016.01.12.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 860180416, "seriesTitle": "Young Hustlers", "pubDate": 1483635600, "title": "157: How to Find a Coach", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Young Hustlers How to Find a Coach: The Karate Kid was waxing on and off, but he didn\u2019t know why Mr. Miyagi was having him do it.

Attitude determines altitude.</p>\n\n<p>2. VAFU\u2014Value added follow up. This will differentiate from everyone else. It takes time sometimes to close a sale. 80% are closed between the 5th and the 12th contact. What are you doing to be valuable to your prospect? Get creative and get people\u2019s attention. </p>\n\n<p>3. Texting\u2014This is a great way to get responses from people. Texts have a 98% open rate compared to 20% for email. Texting is quick and easy with low commitment.</p>\n\n<p>4. Ask for Referrals\u2014Every single interaction is an opportunity for you to get a referral. 84% of decision makers who enter into a sales process are from referrals, and referrals close 70% faster. Salespeople that actively seek referrals make 4-5 times more than those that don\u2019t. </p>\n\n<p>5. Role Playing and Training\u2014All the greats take the time to practice.

You have to really research them.  If you\u2019re not willing to do the research, you\u2019re not serious.  A mentor is defined as an experienced and trusted advisor. Based on the definition, you need to trust them. People have wrong expectations of what mentorship really is. It\u2019s not an age thing.  A 60 year-old can learn something from a 14 year-old.  Maybe it\u2019s the new Pokemon app.  The point is you shouldn\u2019t trust someone who hasn\u2019t done what you want to do. A mentor doesn\u2019t have to be a face-to-face meeting. You don\u2019t have to personally know a person for them to be your mentor. Just consume their information.  A few tips in finding a mentor:</p>\n\n<p>1. Choose carefully\u2014Get someone who is qualified. Before you go all in with someone really learn what they are about.</p>\n\n<p>2. Do not get too many sources of data\u2014 You don\u2019t need too many chefs in the kitchen.  Pick just a couple, or better yet, just one.</p>\n\n<p>3.

How do you get your head right? Four tips:</p>\n\n1. Prepare to bust your ass \u2013 Wealth creation will be tougher than you think. In a 100-yard dash, people go all out but let up at the end. The thing is we aren\u2019t in a short dash, life is a marathon.  You have to go all in and you can\u2019t let up. Be prepared for war for the long haul. Understand how hard it will be.\n<br /> \n<p>2. Be Willing to fail\u2014Things won\u2019t always work out. Be prepared to fail if you want to find the right thing. Make the phone call, visit the office and take a shot. Don\u2019t play for the same piece of pie as everyone else is. Get over the rejection thing. Failure can be a good education as long as you learn from it. No decision you make locks you in forever. Take a swing. </p>\n\n<p>3. Find the right vehicle\u2014If you are looking to do something big you\u2019ve got to be in the right vehicle.  Know why you are going where you are going. What is your plan? There are two questions you should ask before you work at someplace: 1) How much money will I make?  2) what am I going to learn?  Get clear on what are you are doing.  You better be learning if you aren\u2019t making money, and if you aren\u2019t learning you better be making money.  Really you should have both. </p>\n\n<p>4. Skill up at all costs\u2014 Educate yourself. Go find YouTube videos, read blogs, books, and learn every day. If you already graduated, now it\u2019s time to really learn something. What\u2019s relevant today won\u2019t be in 20 years. If you stopped learning in the year 2006 you\u2019d be obsolete today. Take two extra hours every day to keep learning new things.  </p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ve been served the message go to college and you\u2019ll get a job paying 60 or 70k. It\u2019s a lie. 50% of 25 year-olds are still living with mom and dads.

Follow the Money: get around players who are in businesses experiencing rapid growth. If you are in an organization figure out where the money is. What departments are bringing in money? How can you get involved? Make yourself a valuable resource.\n<br />2. Don\u2019t Show Off, Show Up: Focus on effort and productivity not cars and bottles in the VIP, watches and clothes. The biggest money makers know showing off is expensive and cuts into the bigger bottom line, wealth and true freedom.\n<br />3. The Only Reason to Save is to Invest.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a millennial ages 18-33 or a parent of one, watch this video to learn from two people who were broke and are building wealth for themselves so you too can get the life you deserve.</p>", "duration": "42:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": null, "type": "episode", "tags": ["Grant Cardone", "millennials", "success", "money", "millionaire by 30", "follow the money", "earn more money", "Jarrod Glandt", "Warren Buffett", "millionaire secrets", "earning millions", "how to make millions", "how to build wealth", "wealth"]}, {"seriesId": 860180416, "seriesTitle": "Young Hustlers", "pubDate": 1456419659, "title": "113: Omnipresence", "author": "Grant Cardone", "summary": "<p>In this episode of Young Hustlers Grant Cardone and Jarrod Glandt talk about omnipresence.

If you don't believe me, ask someone you know to pitch you. Give them 20 seconds and see what they have to say. Oh, by the way, twenty seconds is how much time you actually have in a real pitch before you lose your chance.</p>\n\n<p>Here are five questions to ask yourself to help you create your perfect pitch:</p>\n\n<p>What is the one thing you want the prospect to remember about you? Do not try to be all things to all people. You are trying to get the pitch to stick not make a sale.</p>\n\n<p>What is your big claim of your product or service? Do not talk about your products, create a big claim for your product or service. \u201cMy product is sales training, we help companies increase sales 40% in thirty days.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>What is your competitive advantage \u2014 what do you do better than anyone else that if you said it everyone would want it? Find that stand out thing that you do better than the rest of the world. This is called the sticky.</p>\n\n<p>Who are the decision makers and influencers of your offer?  Who is it you would need to get in front of to demonstrate and validate your offer. You need to know the types of people that influence or decide on your offer. Depending on how complex a sale you are involved with or how large a company, there could be many influencers involved. \u201cIf I could do for you 1/2 of what I have claimed are you the decision maker at your company. And who else would need to be involved?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>How many different pitches do you need? I own five companies and there is no way I can pitch them all in 20 seconds. So I have to create a pitch for each and know who the market is. Before I move into a pitch I would need to know which pitch to drop.</p>\n\n<p>The pitch is not selling, the pitch is about getting attention and keeping your pipeline full. The prospect has a lot going on and is short on time. Don\u2019t sell, pitch, clarify your goal before you start and know something about the target to pick your pitch, ask for the prospects full attention, make it sticky and determine the decision makers and influencers\u2014then get it right.</p>", "duration": "44:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/podcasts.grantcardone.com/younghustlers/YH_108_Perfect_Your_Pitch_2016.01.14.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 860180416, "seriesTitle": "Young Hustlers", "pubDate": 1452186039, "title": "107: How to Dominate 2016", "author": "Grant Cardone", "summary": "On this episode of Young Hustlers on Grant Cardone TV, Jarrod Glandt wants to make sure people haven\u2019t already lost track of their targets and goals for 2016.

Most people think, \u201cI\u2019m okay at my job,\u201d but the reality is you suck at your job and likely fall into one of these categories.</p>\n\n<p>Groups of Workers That Suck at Their Job:\n<br />1. You Suck: You\u2019re underperforming, missing your targets; constantly making excuses, constantly changing jobs\n<br />2. Average Zone: People who are in the middle, average levels of activity\n<br />3. Top Producer: Constantly operating at less than your potential, but higher than those around you, so you get comfortable</p>\n\n<p>The One Group That Doesn\u2019t Suck:\n<br />4. The Unicorns: You have an insatiable appetite for success.

You have to break everything down into little chunks. And then focus attention and intention into a little chunk.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When someone asks you what your goals are, you must not hesitate with your answer.</p>\n\n<p>Tips to Not Suck:\n<br />1. Understand that everyone sucks, except the unicorns\n<br />2. Write down your dream income and act like you earn it today\n<br />3. Work like you have your dream job\n<br />4.

Not because you have been there for a long time, not because you do a good job, not because others in your position make more. While these are good reasons when you go saying you deserve something if everyone at your office got a raise because of this the company would be broke. The executive making the decision then thinks about this never ending lineup of people that will want a raise every six to twelve months.</p>\n\n<p>The 4 Steps to Asking for a Raise:\n<br />1. Get your bosses attention.\n<br />2. Clarify at the beginning what the meeting is about.\n<br />3. Make it very clear you\u2019re not looking for a handout.\n<br />4. How could it be possible to reach a specific goal?</p>\n\n<p>The script on How to Get a Raise:\n<br />\u201cI don\u2019t want a handout, nor do I want you to feel like you need to pay me more because I have been here for 2 years, or because I do a good job, or because I never call in sick\u2013those are things you deserve as an employer.</p>\n\n<p>I want to know what can I do to earn another $12,000 a year. This would represent a 24% increase in my pay, from 50k to 62k and make a major difference in how I take care of my family and prepare for my future.</p>\n\n<p>Again I don\u2019t expect you to give it to me, I want to know how I can earn it.</p>\n\n<p>While it represents another $1k a month to your payroll, it\u2019s another $6.25 per hour to me and I assure you I will use it for the good of my family. In fact, I am planning on using this money to start a college fund for my son.</p>\n\n<p>What can I do so you can make sense of this?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>If you do this right you might just get your raise. Be presentable, hold a smile, be confident but not entitled, and learn how to ask and make sense of what you want.</p>\n\n<p>This is why everyone must learn to sell, negotiate and make sense of your proposal and you can improve your condition in life.

In terms of social mobility, job mobility, overall geographic mobility, they are not doing as well as their parents and grandparents.\u201d Jarrod and Grant discuss the importance of needing to follow the money and the opportunity, to not be held back by old thinking, staying in one location and growing your business there is acceptable, but thats just average you have to push beyond and go where the opportunities are. There is no limitation to any individual. If you are unhappy with your situation you can move beyond it. Kenneth Johnson, senior demographer at the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, said that \u201cmigration is a key advantage of the American system historically\u2026\u201dthe ability of growing areas to attract migrants from a large national labor pool has historically helped the U.S. adapt to changing economic conditions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>If you are being held back by fear or distraction a millennial has to take the appropriate steps to move beyond this, it is vital to their success to break out and seize opportunities available to them. Bloomberg states that \u201ceconomists and demographers say a combination of relatively low-paying opportunities, the burden of student loans and an aversion to taking risks explains the reluctance to relocate\u201d. Even if this is a concern Jarrod and Grant emphasize that nothing should be a reason hold you back. If you have an opportunity to increase your revenue know your purpose, take responsibility and take action. Otherwise as William Frey a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who specializes in migration issues, quoted by Bloomberg \u201cthey remain stuck in place and the recent slowdown is really an interaction of demographics and a continued housing- and labor-market freeze. Millennials are mired down, very cautious about buying a home or moving to new areas.\u201d Grant often discusses the importance of no matter how you feel, where you are you must show up.

Millennials, young adults between 18 and 33, are low on social trust: Just 19 percent believe that \u201cmost people can be trusted,\u201d compared to 40 percent of Baby Boomers and 31 percent of Generation X.</p>\n\n<p>Why are young people less trusting than their elders? The Pew study offers several hypotheses:</p>\n\n<p>Racial diversity. Minorities have historically been less trusting than whites. The millennial generation is far more diverse than their elders \u2014 43 percent are minorities. Internet usage: Millennials are strongly connected to online communities and friends. The average millennial has 250 Facebook friends. Strong Internet connections may lead to closed social networks and a wariness to put too much trust in people who are not part of your network. Pessimism for the future. However, the Pew study finds that millennials are upbeat about the country\u2019s future and their own prospects for financial success. But we should reconsider these conclusions. My research strongly suggests that economic pessimism, not racial diversity or the Internet, is the key to explaining lower trust.</p>\n\n<p>The first two explanations seem plausible, but they gather little support from the data. The Pew data are not publicly available, but Pew\u2019s surveys use the same trust question as the General Social Survey (GSS): \u201cGenerally speaking, do you believe that most people can be trusted or can\u2019t you be too careful in dealing with people?\u201d In the 2012 GSS, 19 percent of millennials expressed trust in others, the same as the Pew survey.</p>\n\n<p>The main reason to discount racial diversity is that it cannot account for the generational decline in trust among whites. Minorities have always been less trusting than whites \u2014 not just in the United States, but virtually everywhere the question has been asked. But unlike among whites, the trend among minorities has been fairly stable over time: minority young people are slightly more mistrusting than their minority elders, but the difference is small (5 percent). Although the increasing share of young people who are racial minorities may lower trust overall, it does not explain the key trend: why each successive generation of whites has become less trusting \u2014 with white millennials almost as mistrusting as minorities of any age. Roughly 22 percent of white millennials trust others, compared to 16 percent of black/non-white millennials.</p>\n\n<p>There is also little reason to blame the Internet for lowering trust. I have shown (gated) that there is no relationship between Internet use and trust. And the logic behind this linkage is suspect. Most of our interactions on the Internet are with people we know. Generalized trust is all about having faith in strangers \u2014 and there is no clear way to go from one form of trust to the other.</p>\n\n<p>This leaves economic pessimism. Although Pew noted that young people are fairly optimistic about their future, the key question is not whether you believe that you will succeed in life. Through thick and thin, Americans have been optimistic about their own abilities to overcome obstacles to success. What matters most are relative expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Here, the pessimism of millennials stands out: relative to Baby Boomers, millennials are more likely to say that their generation is worse off than their parents. Millennials also worry that \u201ctoday\u2019s young adults face greater economic challenges than their parents\u2019 generation faced when they were starting out,\u201d as stated in the Pew report. And fewer millennials now consider themselves to be middle class (42 percent to 53 percent in 2008). More millennials now see themselves as lower or lower-middle class now than in 2008 (46 percent compared to 25 percent).</p>", "duration": "52:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/26/cf/2b/26cf2b28-bbd6-a3a9-b5ac-369a13e58430/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/podcasts.grantcardone.com/younghustlers/YH_015_2014.20.03-why_millennials_should_never_trust_anyone.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Middle Class", "Sales Tips", "Job Tips", "Free Sales Tips", "Sales Motivation", "Sales Coaching", "Closing Sales", "Sales", "Closing", "Success", "Business Coaching"]}, {"seriesId": 860180416, "seriesTitle": "Young Hustlers", "pubDate": 1394740800, "title": "014: Multiple Flows of Income", "author": "Grant Cardone", "summary": "<p>On this weeks episode Grant and Jarrod discuss creating multiple flows of income and why it is crucial to never turn your back on the primary flow until the other flows are so strong that nothing can possibly destroy or erode them.</p>\n\n<p>Warning: Even once the other (newer) flows are strong enough I would still suggest you never ignore the primary flow as it made the other flows possible.

Viewers and listeners share the mistakes they\u2019ve made with money. Grant Cardone and Jarrod Glandt begin the show explaining the there are many money mistakes millennials may make. Jarrod admits that he once bought 25 strangers at a bar shots of Patron tequila. Grant explains that it is important for people not to put their attention on the wrong things. He urges millennials to think about the life they want and then work to build wealth to achieve true financial freedom. Grant and Jarrod discuss these money mistakes: 1.      Settling, not striving. The wealthy never get enough wealth and never seek comfort. They seek freedom and abundance and always strive for more. 2.      Diversification. Andrew Carnegie said, \u201cthe way to get rich is put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.\u201d 3.  Depending on one income flow. 4.        Comparing yourself to others. 5.        Seduced by the hottest, newest, thing. Avoid investing in any companies that can be displaced by new technological developments. 6.     Na\u00efve and too trusting. 7.      Saving to save. To create wealth you must move surplus money into investments that will create more income producing activities. 8.     Being a premature baller. On the other end of the saver is the spender, the one who is trying to impress others with their cars, clothes and watches.", "duration": "42:36", "imageUrlLg":
