He tells why strategy is the key and tactic is just an element.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why an attendee at Funnel Hacking Live was unhappy with day one at the event, and why he\u2019s not seeing the gold Russell has given him.</li> <li>Why it\u2019s important to know the difference between tactics and strategy.</li> <li>And how if you follow an overall strategy, the tactics will still be there, but you can earn 15x more money.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear what someone else had to say about Funnel Hacking Live, and why Russell thinks he\u2019s wrong.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>What\u2019s up everybody? This is Russell, I am out taking the garbage out, Sunday night. And it\u2019s a beautiful night, a little chilly, but looking out there\u2019s a really cool ski hill called Bogus Basin here in Idaho. Anyway, where my house is at and I\u2019m taking garbage out, I go out and I can see the mountain and the mountain is all dark and where the ski hill is, is all lit up and looks insanely cool. So that\u2019s kind of fun right now.</p> <p>But I had a quick message for you guys because I just wanted to make sure everyone\u2019s paying attention. Because I feel like sometimes you can show people gold. Be like, \u201cHey, here\u2019s gold. You want some?\u201d and the smart people see that and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh sweet.\u201d And they take it. And there\u2019s other people who say, \u201cThat\u2019s not real gold. I didn\u2019t want gold. I wanted platinum. I came for diamonds, why are you trying to give me gold.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, there\u2019s gold. You can sell it and buy diamonds.\u201d</p> <p>So let me explain this metaphor. Funnel Hacking Live last week, insane. Those of you there, you know, you experienced it. It was just amazing. And we\u2019re starting planning next year\u2019s and I think I finally figured out a way, took me three days, but I think I figured out a way to make it better than last time. I\u2019m not sure yet, but I\u2019m excited to try. That\u2019s going to be in time, I got a year to plan it, so that\u2019s going to be sweet.</p> <p>But it was an awesome event and of the three days, day one was probably my favorite day because I think what I got to share got me most excited. I shared the first section of the book, which is how to build a mass movement. Went into all the strategy and the tactics behind how to do that. I wanted to break those out, because there\u2019s two different things, strategy and tactics. Then I had a chance to go into the story. We talked about epiphany bridge stories. I showed the strategy and tactics behind that. Then Brandon and Kaelin spoke the first day. Jim Edwards spoke the first day, it was awesome. All the days were good, but the first day was, I was most excited about what I taught the first day.</p> <p>Anyway, that was good, I thought. For those who were there, it was good right? Pretty amazing? It\u2019s basically a year, more than a year, deep year of my thought, what I\u2019ve been trying to really show and teach and coach everybody through. And what the new book\u2019s going to be really going deep into. So it was also a big preface for the Expert Secrets book which is coming out April 18<sup>th</sup>. So anyway, most people were there and they got that and went and ran away with it. But then one of my buddies, one of my friends showed me the other day some post that one of the guys at the event posted in his private members area.</p> <p>I know who this guy is, I\u2019ve been watching him for a while, he\u2019s been doing some cool things. But his business isn\u2019t that big yet,\u00a0 he\u2019s kind of\u2026\u2026I won\u2019t make fun of him publicly, I might later. We\u2019ll stop for now. In his members group he posted, he said, \u201cDay one of Funnel Hacking Live was stupid. Not a single tactic was taught. Blah, blah, blah.\u201d Dropped like 5 or 6 F-bombs in this thing. I was just like, I\u2019m glad it was after the event, because I would have called the dude out on stage and embarrassed him in front of everyone, which would have been amazing. I kind of wish I had that now.</p> <p>But instead I saw it like two days ago. I was like, \u201cWhat? Day one?\u201d It\u2019s funny, day two he came up to me afterwards and said, \u201cI\u2019m joining your Inner Circle, man. This has changed my life.\u201d Did the whole thing. By the afternoon day two he had a change of heart, but after day one he was frustrated apparently because I didn\u2019t teach enough tactics.</p> <p>So a couple of things. First off, what you must understand is that tactics are good. Tactics are like the tricks you use to do things. But tactics in and of themselves are not that powerful. In fact, I think, when I first met Jay Abraham and Rick Shephard and the guys, they used to talk about this. Talk about how strategy is more important than tactics, and I used to think that were not smart. Because I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, these tactics, these tricks, these tools, these things are the secret.\u201d And as I\u2019ve gotten older, in my old age, and I\u2019ve shifted from being stuck at 2 or 3 million dollars a year, to shifting to 30 million dollars a year and beyond. Hopefully this year we\u2019ll hit 80 or 90 million, and mass growth. Bigger than anyone I know of in our industry.</p> <p>The big differentiation that took me from 2 or 3 million dollars a year to ten time that, it wasn\u2019t the next tactic. It was the strategy, the strategy behind it. As I\u2019m on stage teaching how to build a mass movement, I\u2019m talking about the strategy of how you build a mass movement. This is how you get people to follow you, this is how I went from 3 million dollars, to two years later 30 million dollars in a year. The difference was not a magic tactic. And I showed tactics, I showed the different tactics, but it was the core strategy. When you understand the strategy there\u2019s a lot of tactics inside of it, but understand the strategy is the key.</p> <p>So we\u2019re showing the strategy to everybody and I\u2019m just hoping that you guys weren\u2019t like this dude looking at this gold and being like, \u201cbut I came here for diamonds.\u201d Dude, are you kidding me, take the gold I give you and go sell it and buy some diamonds if that\u2019s what you really want. Don\u2019t miss out on the lesson because you came thinking you were looking for something else. If there\u2019s someone that\u2019s showing you something, don\u2019t be like\u2026.I was the same way. So I\u2019m throwing myself as being guilty of this too. When I first talked to Shephard and Abraham, those guys who were way ahead of me strategically thinking, I used to make fun of them thinking they were dumb. Just like this guy was doing for me. I\u2019m like, no when I understood it; I respected and understood that I gotta figure out the strategy.</p> <p>The tactics are always there, the tactics will fit inside of any strategy, but the strategy is the key. That\u2019s what expands your growth. And then, come on now, epiphany bridge story, the hero\u2019s two journeys, that\u2019s all tactical. Come on now. I\u2019ll leave that there.</p> <p>What I wanted to talk about is, as I was thinking through this, is I want to kind of tie in the tactic and strategy and all that kind of stuff. When I got started, whenever it was, 14 years ago, my first mentor was Mark Joyner, he always told me, \u201cYou gotta build a list, you gotta build a list.\u201d Which is a strategy right. At the time there were a whole bunch of different strategies people were chasing. There was AdSense stuff, The was Google AdWords, there was Arbitros, there were all these different ways to make money. And Mark was my first mentor and luckily I listened to him by the shiny objects flying around me like crazy. So I started building a list, building a list, like he told me to.</p> <p>And I did that and it was funny, a couple years later Mike Filsaime came out with, he kind of coined this originally, a lot of people say it since, but the first time I heard it, it was from Mike. He said, \u201cYou should average one dollar per month, per name on your email list.\u201d I was like, okay, that\u2019s a cool metric. I started looking back at what I was doing and it was interesting how close my business at that point had followed that. I had a thousand people on my list, I was making about a thousand a month, when I had ten thousand on my list I made ten thousand a month, when I had a hundred thousand on my list I was making a hundred thousand a month. It was eerie. Is that a word? How close that number stayed.</p> <p>For me, I started focusing on the strategy is building a list. What are the tactics to build a list? I kept focusing on tactic, tactic, tactic to build a list. My list kept growing and my income would grow with it, but I didn\u2019t have the huge shift. When we started shifting, I was telling this, last week, I can\u2019t remember if I told you guys this or not. Dean Graziosi did this big book launch and he invited the top ten or fifteen affiliates to his office. So I flew down there Thursday and hung out, it was amazing. It was an amazing group. I could go on for days about all the people and what I learned. I got some amazing stuff that I will show you guys in the next few months. If you watch, you\u2019ll see some of the stuff I learned from that group.</p> <p>But what was interesting is, when I got there to talk, they wanted me to talk 30 minutes on whatever I thought was the biggest, most impactful thing in my business over the last few months. What did I share with them? I shared building a cult-ure. I talked about the three things. The thing I talked about first session of our group, we talked about charismatic leader, future based cause, and then new opportunity, which is the key. That\u2019s the core strategy. What\u2019s interesting is, I wasn\u2019t planning on talking but when I got up on stage, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve done this when you\u2019ve gotten on stage. Things pop into your head sometimes, so I got up in front of this group and the first thing that popped into my head was the Send out Cards event I went to 7, 8\u00a0 or 9 years ago.</p> <p>I remember going to this event all excited to learn network marketing and see how these guys do everything. And I was confused when I got there, to be honest. Nobody taught anything. I remember, the first day they gave awards to almost everyone in the group and they had people win cars, they had recognition, told stories, people crying about how sending cards changed their lives. And it was so confusing to me. I remember afterwards sitting there talking to David Frey, he probably doesn\u2019t even remember this, but it had a huge impact on me. I was like, \u201cDude, nobody taught anything.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou know what the craziest thing is Russell? They\u2019re a software company. That\u2019s it. They\u2019re a software, but what have they done different? What was the strategy?\u201d The tactic is how to build a software company, but what is the strategy? He didn\u2019t say that, but I was thinking what is the strategy?</p> <p>And we started talking and he said, \u201cThey\u2019re a software company, but look what they built around it, it\u2019s a movement. There\u2019s people, this is a way of life for people now.\u201d And I was thinking about it, send out cards, I love the guys who own that, it\u2019s a cool company, but their software is not that good. There are thousands of better card editors out there. But they built a movement of people and that\u2019s why that company did so well.</p> <p>So when I was launching Clickfunnels that kept ringing in my head from David Frey. They\u2019re just a software company. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m building a software company.\u201d I could have gone, what\u2019s the tactic to build a software company. No, step back. What\u2019s the strategy? How do these guys do it? They didn\u2019t say, let\u2019s build a software company. That wasn\u2019t what they were doing; they were looking at the strategy of it. So as we launched Clickfunnels, I knew we were going to compete against, Infusionsoft, Leadpages, and all these crappy software products, and I was like, I don\u2019t want this to become a battle of who\u2019s got what feature. I want to build a movement. I want people, I want to build the best software in the world, and luckily I\u2019ve got the partners that are able to do that, which is insanely cool.</p> <p>But I was like. Even if our software sucked, I still gotta out market everyone else.\u00a0 Because I want them to follow us because we\u2019re a movement, not because we\u2019re a software company. If you were at Funnel Hacking Live, you remember Ryan<br /> Montgomery, our CTO, he got up there and said, \u201chey guys, we\u2019re not a technology company, we\u2019re a marketing company. We\u2019re building technology, the technology behind it to make us be able to market, which gives you the ability to market.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the big differentiator, that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking on the SASS companies that are fighting us on features and we\u2019re thrashing them because we\u2019re building a movement. And that\u2019s the strategy. So I started looking at that, and I looked at our numbers over the last two years, and what\u2019s funny, is for 8 years in my business, our metrics were one dollar per name per month on our list. And I look at our numbers now and I gotta do the math real quick in my head. But we are closer to probably 14 or 15 dollars per name per month on our email list. So we 15x\u2019d it. Same people, same list building tactics to get people in, but the strategy shifted. What happened when we shifted the strategy? 15x, instead of one dollar per name per month on our email list, we make $15 per name per month on our email address, by shifting the strategy and the strategy was how do we build a movement? We\u2019re not a software company, we\u2019re building a movement.</p> <p>I wanted people coming to Clickfunnels like they came to Send out Cards on stage crying because they send a card and it changed someone\u2019s life. I don\u2019t want them coming and talking about how much money they made. That\u2019s the difference.</p> <p>I just wanted to share that because I know sometimes we get caught up in what\u2019s the new tactic. Some of my close friends are running an event this weekend coming up, and the difference, you go to that event and what do they do. There\u2019s all these people on stage sharing tactics, and some people love that, but that\u2019s not what wins wars. Tactics are the gun and the shot gun and rifle that you go out there, but if you got a bad strategy you\u2019re going to lose.</p> <p>So take a step back, look at the strategy and understand that, and hopefully this helps you understand the difference between strategy and tactics. How the tactics are good, but you switch to strategy and get that correct, 15x growth, going from 3 million to 30 million in\u00a0 24 months. What\u2019s the difference? It\u2019s not changing my tactics, the tactics were all the same, it was the strategy behind it.</p> <p>I hope that you guys get that. With that said, my fingers are freezing. I should have worn gloves out here. I\u2019m going back inside. Appreciate you all, tomorrow I\u2019m going to go finish\u2026..Friday I spent the whole day recording the audio version of the Expert Secrets book and tomorrow I\u2019m going to finish the last third. I drive out there, I have a message I want to share with you guys, but I\u2019ll save that for tomorrow. Thanks everybody, have a great night and we\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "14:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/316_-_The_Strategy_That_Made_Each_Of_Our_Leads_Worth_15X.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1488578354, "title": "Episode #315 \u2013 Behind The Scenes Of Funnel Hacking Live 2017 (Part 2)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The rest of the story\u2026</p> <p>On this special 2 part episode Russell recaps and summarizes what happened at Funnel Hacking Live. He also reflects on how he felt about different aspects and speakers at the event.</p> <p>Here are some of the cool things you will hear in this 2 part episode:</p> <ul> <li>An overview of the schedule during the 3 day event, who spoke, and what they spoke about.</li> <li>How Russell felt about certain speakers and what he thinks went right with his own presentations, and what mistakes he feels he made.</li> <li>What the best part of the event was for Russell (hint \u2013 It involves his lovely wife).</li> <li>And what Russell plans on doing differently at next year\u2019s Funnel Hacking Live.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below for the conclusion of Russell\u2019s thoughts and feelings about Funnel Hacking Live 2017.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Day number two now, Devon got on stage he intro to government estate. Then we came up and did a section on follow-up funnels. Which was Todd and Dylan and Ryan and me and we talked about how email funnels are from 1998 and the future is follow up funnels. And we did a presentation and during the presentation we ripped our shirts off and we had these shirts. I\u2019m actually wearing the shirt today. It says, \u201cWe are not confusion soft, we\u2019re Clickfunnels\u201d and then we challenged everybody to go all in and be all in, in Clickfunnels. And we gave them these t-shirts and temporary tattoos and a whole bunch of stuff for anyone who went all in.</p> <p>Basically they had to open up their phone and go to imallin.com and if you\u2019re not all in it had Macauley Culkin slapping his face saying, \u201cahh, you\u2019re not in.\u201d and there was a big button where you could upgrade. And if you were all in, it showed you were all in and basically you\u2019d run to the back of the room, show them the funnel and then we\u2019d give you a huge packet of swag, which was cool.</p> <p>So if any of you guys are listening to this. Don\u2019t do that right now. We\u2019re updating it to make it work online, I think by next week. Actually my birthday, March 8<sup>th</sup>. So on my birthday we\u2019re going to be doing that presentation live to Facebook Live and it\u2019ll be live so you can all go all in and get the same swag shipped out to you, which will be fun. But it was cool to show people what\u2019s possible in Actionetics. Most people don\u2019t know, they assume it\u2019s an email auto-responder, and that\u2019s like saying that Clickfunnels builds websites. Come on now, that\u2019s 1998.</p> <p>I had a slide, I wanted to use Urkel, Steve urkel in my slides, and I was able to use him twice. I was like, \u201cYou know what else was cool in 1998, Steve Urkel. Actually no, Steve Urkel\u2019s show was cancelled in 1998. So even in 98 Urkel wasn\u2019t cool anymore. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re using if you\u2019re doing email funnels. We\u2019re talking about follow-up funnels and all the stuff that\u2019s possible.\u201d So we showed people what\u2019s possible in Actionetics, and most people didn\u2019t even know. And everyone is shifting everything over to Clickfunnels, which is the goal. We want everybody all in, I want you all in.</p> <p>So that was what Follow-up Funnels is about. It was probably the coolest presentation. So much energy, it was awesome. Then we had a break after that. And then Justin and Tara Williams came on and did a whole section on podcast funnels, which was awesome. They told their story, which was cool. And basically showed how these three podcasts they had done, how these three podcasts had each launched three entire businesses for them and it was just cool to see.</p> <p>Anyway, that part was awesome. So podcast funnels, Justin and Tara were amazing. They killed it. After that we had Emily Shay come up and she is 11 years old and she stood up there on a huge stage where most people would be so scared and so intimidated and she crushed it. She was so awesome. She had about 15 or 20 minutes up there and she told her story and did it in a really fun way that tied it to the audience. She\u2019s just a superstar. Some people would say the youth speakers were the best one\u2019s of the whole thing, and I was like, \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>So Emily crushed it. Caleb Maddix came on, I talked about him yesterday on the podcast. He came on and just did an amazing job as well. And it was just so cool to see Emily and Caleb, two young entrepreneurs who were able to stand in front of a room and control the audience like that. For me, it took me honestly, it took me ten plus years to get a spot that they were in already and it was just so cool to see them. They\u2019re the future.</p> <p>So exciting, so they both crushed it and did such an amazing job. Then we had a lunch break. Again, the annoying thing where our stomachs were hungry and we had to go eat. So everyone went to lunch. We came back and Trey Lewellen stood up on stage and Trey is really, Trey spoke at the very first Funnel Hacking Event and he did a great job then. But it\u2019s fun seeing him transition, him owning the stage now, he just, he did awesome. He went into deep funnelytics, like here\u2019s the metrics you\u2019ve got to figure out to make your funnels works. And he showed this stuff where it\u2019s just like, well I didn\u2019t understand that. Most people who set up a funnel that doesn\u2019t make a million bucks day one they\u2019re like, \u201cThis didn\u2019t work.\u201d No, you gotta understand the math behind it. And Trey showed how he\u2019s built these huge companies. 20-30 million dollar companies off of a funnel that was not profitable upfront.</p> <p>But when you understand the funnelytics, the math behind the funnels, how it worked. It was so cool for him to document and show it all off, it was just amazing.</p> <p>Then from there, we\u2019re only halfway through, it just keeps getting, the whole thing was amazing. Then Jason Fladlien, who is someone I\u2019ve learned, in fact in the Expert Secrets book, I dedicated a lot to him as well. Because there\u2019s so much I learned from him about breaking belief patterns and rebuilding and reframing and he\u2019s just brilliant. He got on stage and talked about Amazon Funnels. And even though a lot of people know him as the guy who\u2019s the best in the world at selling from webinars, he happens to also be good at Amazon as well.</p> <p>So he showed 7 different Amazon funnels that he uses in his company and then he gave everybody at the event. \u201cHere\u2019s the Amazon funnels, there\u2019s 7 of them. You guys can knock them off and use them in your business.\u201d Which was so cool. So if you\u2019re using any Amazon or ecommerce stuff, Jason\u2019s stuff was amazing.</p> <p>From there Darrin Stevens got on stage. A lot of you guys probably don\u2019t know Darrin Stevens but he is a legend. He was one of the, he did the marketing behind Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus. Brilliant book launch and stuff like that. But he also runs events. He does these events that have 80 people in the room who make 2-3million dollars in a weekend, for a room of less than 100 people. And it\u2019s all about how he structures his events and event funnels. So he walked us through the whole process and he had 18 or 19 things that he does at events to build rapport and get people buying. If I was able to close what Darrin does, again he did what did I say, 2.5 million dollars from 80 people. I would have done like 60 million dollars from this event, but I didn\u2019t so Darrin is still the king. He\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>So he shared event funnel stuff, which was awesome. Then we had another break, then Setema got on stage, and Setema is the Super Bowl winner who had to sell his ring because after he won the Super Bowl his life kind of fell apart and talks about how you win again. How do you get that stuff back? How do you implement all the stuff you\u2019ve learned? It was amazing. He\u2019s nicknamed himself the reverend of the revolution. I feel like he was the reverend preaching to us about how to take this stuff and have success with imperfect action and just going through and doing it. It was so cool, Setema is the man. That was awesome.</p> <p>After that we came onstage and we awarded the Two Comma Club awards, which was amazing. We had, I think right now, we have over 100 people who have qualified for the Two Comma Club. Which means they have a funnel that made at least a million dollars. 100 people! So we gave away I think 80 something Two Comma Club trophy\u2019s. These huge trophy\u2019s with a gold record on it with two commas etched into it. It was cool for everyone else to see that and be like, \u201cWow, these are my peers. And they\u2019re all making a million dollars in a funnel.\u201d</p> <p>I was trying to make it so real. If they can do it, you can do it. So we did that, and afterwards I did a presentation called \u201cYou\u2019re one Funnel Away.\u201d Which basically I had no power point slides, I just told the story of all the ups and downs in my business and the funnels that have saved me. I talked about the two or three times I\u2019ve almost gone bankrupt. I talked about the fears, the pain, all that kind of stuff. What were the funnels we created that saved us from that.</p> <p>It was emotional, I started crying, which is really embarrassing, especially on stage. Other people were crying and it was cool. I hope people enjoyed that. It was a scary thing for me to get vulnerable like that, but I think it was important so that everyone understands, whatever you\u2019re struggling at, it happens to all of us. It happens to me, it happens to everyone. So understanding that and being okay with it and giving yourself permission through that to be able to succeed.</p> <p>That was really cool. After that we had a hack-a-thon at night. I was super tired. I went to the hack-a-thon, talked for a few minutes, then I went back up, ate some dinner and then passed out because I was so tired. But then I hadn\u2019t finished my next presentation for the next night. So I set my alarm for 4:30 in the morning, the next morning to get started.</p> <p>Hack-a-thon was awesome, people were up til midnight building funnels. We had a whole bunch of people who built, launched and made money on funnels that night, which was cool. We catered dinner again, which was cool. Then the next day, the last day, which was Thursday.</p> <p>So the last day we came in, Devon brought everyone in, brought the energy high. Then Garrett White and his wife, Danielle and their kids were going to come to the stage and when the event started we couldn\u2019t find them anywhere. I was like, \u201cWhere\u2019s Garrett? Where\u2019s Danielle?\u201d We started freaking out. I was totally stressing out and we\u2019re trying to Vox them and text them and call them and nothing. And finally Melanie found out what room number they were in, so Dave ran up and knocked on the door like, \u201cAhhh, we\u2019re on stage trying to announce you, where are you guys.\u201d It was a miscommunication, we had told them the wrong, we messed up on our side.</p> <p>But they came down and during that time it was fun because Devon was able to invent a new secret handshake for all funnel hackers, out of necessity. He bought ten minutes time by inventing a new secret handshake, which all of you who have been to Funnel Hacking Live know the secret handshake. Don\u2019t show to those who were not there. They\u2019ll have to learn it at next year\u2019s event. But we\u2019ve got a secret handshake now that is so cool. In fact, I should add a chapter to the Expert Secrets book about secret handshakes, that would be cool.</p> <p>Anyway, we got a secret handshake and then Garrett, Danielle and their two kids came on stage and gave a presentation that was, I don\u2019t even know what to say, it was so amazing. It was so cool. I\u2019m just going to leave it at that. It was something where if you were in the room you felt it and you heard it and it moved you. It was amazing. So there you go.</p> <p>Maybe someday we\u2019ll do a launch like warrior funnels .com and share all the presentations of Garrett throughout the Funnel Hacking Live events because they have just been amazing Anyway, who knows, but we\u2019ll look at that. So then we had after they got done. I came up and did a presentation called fill your funnel, which is how to make it rain. How to get people into your funnels. And this was the only presentation where I actually sold-sold. We were selling things throughout the event and I\u2019ll talk about this at the end, but this is the only one where I did the actual presentation.</p> <p>It went good, but a couple of weird things. When I got on stage after Garrett, there was so much energy from Garrett and Danielle and it was amazing. I came on immediately afterwards and the audio/video guys didn\u2019t turn the music on, so I got up there and it was just kind of a weird transition. And then we awarded Stu and Amy their checks for World Teacher Aide, which was the quarter of a million bucks, which was awesome. Then it was my chance to get up there and teach affiliate funnel and we sold a course called fill your funnels. And just something about that, I don\u2019t know what it was. Something about the presentation was kind of off. I\u2019m just going to be completely honest. I had numbers in my head of what I thought I was going to do and I didn\u2019t do that. It did well, if I told you guys how many we sold, everyone else would think I was a selfish kid and rude.</p> <p>It did well, but what I expected, and there was this, I was doing it, I couldn\u2019t get the flow right.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it was, part of it I think was because I worked on the presentation the week earlier, then that morning I woke up at 4:30 trying to get it done and I was tired and worn out. There was something about the energy that wasn\u2019t quite right. I think it was good, but it wasn\u2019t great, like I wanted it to be. But at the end of it we sold, and it was awkward. I\u2019m like, in the pitch, \u201cThis is hard selling you guys through my perfect webinar, even though I\u2019ve trained all you guys on it and most of you guys are doing it now. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m doing it onstage live. It\u2019s funny how that works.\u201d</p> <p>But it did well, that was when had breaks, we had snack breaks. And then basically we had to clear the whole audience out, secret service came through for Tony Robbins group, swept the whole thing and then Tony was onstage and I was in the back super nervous and awkward and worried. It\u2019s so different, because with Marcus when he came, he just showed up in his own Uber, it was laid back, he hung out with the crowd, it was really easy and laid back. And Tony was the opposite of that. He had his security detail of 10 or 15 people there who were like, swept all the chairs making sure there were no bombs or guns and we had check people as they came through.</p> <p>I was in the back and they had to pull us all out so he could come in. Very intense and caused anxiety and nerves and all this stuff, that was nervous. Plus, I found out Tony was throwing up before he came. So he wasn\u2019t feeling good. So much stress. He brought Tony into this little green room and they let us come in and he came out. It went from this nerve, all the nerves, it was like an hour of this, while we were waiting for him to get here. All the nerves and fear and anxiety. What if he\u2019s sick and he can\u2019t speak? What if people don\u2019t get what, they were so excited for him to be there. Secret service security was honestly kind of frustrating because it just. You know how I am, I\u2019m so laid back, it was beyond corporatey, it was secret service, military. Which is good, he needs that, I understand that. But it was just kind of, at first we were trying to make this cool experience and it was so hard.</p> <p>And then again, Tony came in and did his thing in the green room and came out and came to us and we had moment before he got on stage where he just kind of came in and gave me a hug, and gave my wife, Collette, a hug. And Dylan and Todd and their wives, he just connected personally with us at a level. I was so grateful for that, because it just made all the stress and everything go away. It was like, it\u2019s going to be okay. Tony\u2019s here, he\u2019s going to do what he does, and he\u2019s the best in the world and everyone\u2019s going to love it. I\u2019m not going to stress and I\u2019m going to let it happen and it was cool.</p> <p>Normally, I guess they don\u2019t let people introduce him, but I was like, \u201cI would love to introduce Tony, there is a reason why I wanted him here and I want everyone to know that reason.\u201d So they let me introduce Tony and I got all choked up during the introduction. But I was talking about how in his bio it talks about how he\u2019s helped 50 million people around the world. I was like, well that\u2019s cool. Tony helped me.\u00a0 He helped my wife. He helped our family. If it wasn\u2019t for Tony, my wife and I were at a rough spot before I met Tony, before I went to his event.</p> <p>It was honestly, it was what healed us. And I\u2019m just so grateful for him and after I went to Tony\u2019s stuff, I went to all of his events in a year period of time, and then right after that my company collapsed. Had I not been equipped by the tools he gave me, I don\u2019t know if I could have handled that. I was just talking about how grateful I am and how excited I was to share him with my world and my people, my funnel hackers. Then we played a video of him and we all went crazy and Tony came up on stage, gave me a hug and took over.</p> <p>And he was supposed to go for three hours. And again, he was puking five minutes before he got on the stage and I was nervous. And he stood there and he went not for three hours, not for four hours, but for five hours with everybody. It was just cool. Everyone\u2019s jumping and screaming and having fun. It was awesome. It just made the event, it was already amazing, just that much more amazing.</p> <p>And when it was done, all of the Inner Circle members had a chance to get pictures with Tony, which was cool. Then we went up and ate real quick, and then I had a chance to go up to his hotel room afterwards and interview him for his new book, which hopefully you guys saw him on Facebook live. We showed that. And it was just awesome. That night we passed out, woke up in the morning. We had late checkout, so we hung out for a while and it was just cool to sit there and reflect with my wife. And the coolest thing for me is that this is the first time that Collette has ever been to, I mean she\u2019s come to my events and poked her head in and then had to leave to watch the kids or all these different things, that time the kids didn\u2019t come. So she had a chance to be there and be present and sit in the audience for almost the entire thing. For me, that was special.</p> <p>It was cool and it was I think the first time she\u2019d ever seen me doing what we do. And you guys have a chance to see it through the podcast and through all the stuff I\u2019m doing, but she\u2019s not connected to that. She\u2019s not connected to the business very much, she\u2019s very much supporting from home, but not part of everything that\u2019s happening. So for her to be able to see that and experience it with people in the audience, it was special for me. So I just loved that. It was awesome.</p> <p>That was kind of Funnel Hacking Live. And then as we\u2019re, that day we\u2019re leaving, flying home and I look at the Facebook group, and everyday I\u2019m looking, kind of scrolling through, and if any of you guys are in our Facebook group you\u2019re probably bombarded by millions and millions, everyone talking about it. I was like, alright, ready fire aim. Everybody is excited right now. Why don\u2019t we sell tickets for next year\u2019s event right now? So from the airport I did a Facebook Live.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re selling tickets. There\u2019s a discount and Sunday at midnight we\u2019re pulling the page down. So you gotta buy them now if you want them. Otherwise you gotta wait six months and who knows what the price will be then?\u201d Did a Facebook Live, emailed the list and over the next three days we sold almost a thousand tickets to next year\u2019s event. We almost sold as many tickets as last year, just from that. Hopefully won\u2019t lessen the momentum. If the momentum is there, capitalize on it. Don\u2019t wait six months, \u201cHey you guys remember the event we talked about six months ago? Who wants to come again?\u201d When people\u2019s energy and emotion and excitement are high, that\u2019s the best time to sell.</p> <p>So we sold a lot of tickets, which was cool. It\u2019s funny, I had some of the Inner Circle members freaking out, \u201cDo we get discount tickets or not?\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t thought through this.\u201d This is the lesson for everyone. I\u2019m a big believer in \u201cReady Fire Aim\u201d We just fired and I have no idea. We\u2019ll figure it out way later, but we don\u2019t have time right now. We just fired. Sorry, but that\u2019s how it works over here. Everything\u2019s not scripted out and planned second by second. Some things are, but most things aren\u2019t.</p> <p>Hopefully that\u2019s inspiration for you guys to. To know, \u201cLook, figure things out and just do it.\u201d So that was kind of the event in a nutshell. For those who were there, hopefully that was a good breakdown. I wish I could spend the hour or two hours on each presentation that people did, so you can experience it. But hopefully those that weren\u2019t there, this will give you desire to come next year. I want you guys to be there. Yeah, I will probably sell recordings, and you will probably have some of these videos that are easy to see, but there\u2019s something different about being in the room and being surrounded by 1500 of your peers who are doing the same thing. Seeing 100 of your peers on stage with a big trophy saying I made a million dollars with a funnel this year. There\u2019s something different about that. So I recommend for all of you guys to make that break and come to the event.</p> <p>One last thing I want to share, because I kind of hinted to this earlier. And I think it\u2019ll be cool for you guys to know. This is actually not a victory, this is a failure. A failure in my eyes. But I want to share with you guys, just so you understand that I mess things up too.</p> <p>So one of the cool things that I wanted to do is, usually at each Funnel Hacking Live we sell one thing. We did certification at the first event and second event. This year, I didn\u2019t want to sell, I don\u2019t want this to be a selling event, but there\u2019s things we want to offer people. So we had this big trip to Kenya, which was awesome and people jumped on that. We had the Follow-up Funnels which was awesome and people jumped on that. Then I was trying to, we had this new event called the FHAT event that I was excited about and want people to come to that. Then we also had Fill Your Funnel and I think I tried to offer too many things. Not that we, it wasn\u2019t like I was selling each thing, but we had them available.</p> <p>At the Hack-a-thon, I was like \u201cHey if you want to come to the FHAT event, here\u2019s one more thing on it.\u201d And I think it almost caused confusion. People didn\u2019t know what to do. I think moving forward next year, we\u2019ll probably just pick one thing and focus on that again, just to not cause confusion. But one of my big things, again I only want one session when we sold, and that was Fill Your Funnel. That one went well, but it was just, the energy wasn\u2019t quite right when I did it. So that was one thing.</p> <p>But the other cool thing is that the entire Funnel Hacking Live event, if you look at it from the outside, it was a big perfect webinar. Session number one, if you\u2019ve gone through the perfect webinar in detail and as you read the Expert Secrets book, you\u2019ll understand it at a level I\u2019ve never really shared it before. But the first thing we do is talk about the vehicle putting people in. So my first presentation was about creating a mass movement, becoming an expert. So that was the first vehicle. Session number one, would have been secret number one if this was a webinar.</p> <p>Session number two is about the internal beliefs and that\u2019s how I walked into, I shared the story, showing \u201cLook, you can create a mass movement.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWell I don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cIf you can master stories you can.\u201d Belief number two was all about can they internally do it? So the second presentation for me was all about that. The internal.</p> <p>Then the third presentation, which was the One Funnel Away, was the external. I believe I can do it, I can tell stories, but I don\u2019t know how to do this whole funnel thing. So I shared at the One Funnel Away presentation to help people understand the external fears. So if you look at, again if you break down the perfect webinar, you\u2019ve got the belief pattern is tied to the vehicle, which is the new opportunity we\u2019re putting people into. That was session number one, number two is their internal beliefs, false beliefs about themselves, and number three is the external false beliefs about themselves.</p> <p>So that\u2019s how we structure those three presentations, and what we do at the hack-a-thon is offer people to come to the FHAT event, because that was kind of the natural continuation of that. The problem I have is that, if you look at the perfect webinar, what\u2019s the last step? It\u2019s stack and close and we didn\u2019t stack and close anymore. We just basically said, \u201chey you should come to the FHAT event because it\u2019s awesome.\u201d And we had a lot of people who did, but not what I expected or hoped.</p> <p>My two big lessons, number one when you\u2019re doing a webinar you can\u2019t forget the stack and the close. It\u2019s important even if you break their beliefs, if you don\u2019t offer them the opportunity to buy and do it in a way that\u2019s going to convince them to buy, a lot of people that you could have served, won\u2019t be served.</p> <p>I honestly think that everybody should be at the FHAT event. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I could do to serve anybody at a higher level than that. And because I kind of shied away and didn\u2019t sell it and skipped the last step, I\u2019m not able to affect as many people\u2019s lives\u2019 because of that. For me that looks like a failure. IT\u2019s not the money. Money\u2019s a cool way to keep score, but for me, I should have had 100 people from that room coming to Boise so I could help them create the perfect webinar. And I don\u2019t. I have a lot but not that many because I\u2026..I don\u2019t know the exact reason, but I didn\u2019t do it right. It came down to me having fears of trying to make it an official offer to people. It\u2019s funny, even after this long I still make the same fears that other people make as well.\u00a0 That was one big thing.</p> <p>And then the other thing, is again, shipping the focus of the event to being focusing on core thing we want people to do. Because I think people were confused, \u201cI\u2019m coming to Kenya, I upgraded and I\u2019m all in, there\u2019s this FHAT event Russell\u2019s talking about and I don\u2019t know what that is because he didn\u2019t tell me about it. Sounds cool, but I have no idea. Then there\u2019s Fill Your Funnel.\u201d So I think that that was my other mistake. There was confusion in where I wanted people to go from here.</p> <p>So those are the things I learned, and again, that\u2019s something you always learn as you do them. So it\u2019ll be fun, next year my goal is to make the event even better. It\u2019s shifting the focus, well I don\u2019t know what the focus is going to be yet. But it\u2019s making sure that everyone has an amazing experience, both from a marketing standpoint and also a personal development standpoint. I think that\u2019s one neat thing we bring that nobody else does, which is cool.</p> <p>And then the third thing is really figuring out for people who come through the experience, what\u2019s the next step for them. And focusing everything on that and not having two or three next steps, but one. And saying, \u201cThis is what you guys should be doing next. Those who are interested.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I learned at Funnel Hacking Live as well. Anyway, I appreciate everyone who was there, I had a great time. With that said, this is probably the longest marketing in your car of all time, but it\u2019s a recap for those who missed it. And hopefully you guys will come next year, because it\u2019s going to be amazing. Tickets are not for sale right now, but in four or five months we\u2019ll open it and we have probably 1500 more tickets or so I believe. When we do open it up, the price has gone up, I apologize for those that didn\u2019t get my emails and everything else. I tried to warn you. With that said, thank you guys and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "23:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/315_-_Behind_The_Scenes_Of_Funnel_Hacking_Live_2017_Part_2.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1488494838, "title": "Episode #314 \u2013 Behind The Scenes Of Funnel Hacking Live 2017 (Part 1)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What happened at this year\u2019s event.</p> <p>On this special 2 part episode Russell recaps and summarizes what happened at Funnel Hacking Live.

I want to welcome you to Marketing In Your Car. But today\u2019s actually a special episode because first off, I\u2019m not in my car, I\u2019m in the conference room and second off, I got this brand new little microphone that plugs into the bottom of my phone. People have been asking me ever since I started this podcast, \u201cWhat microphone do you use on your phone?\u201d I always just tell them that Iuse the microphone on my phone, which is true until today. There\u2019s this really cool thing, I don\u2019t know what brand or style, I have no idea but I\u2019m testing it out. So if it seems to be good, I\u2019ll let you guys know.</p> <p>It\u2019s so cool, it plugs into the bottom of your iPhone and it\u2019s got this big huge thing on it. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m trying it out. Hopefully this episode goes well enough and I\u2019ll let you guys know more about this thing, because it\u2019s pretty awesome.</p> <p>So what I wanted to do, I wanted to give a recap of Funnel Hacking Live. I know 1500 of you guys were already there and experienced it and went crazy with us, and for everyone else who wasn\u2019t, I wanted to catch you up on what\u2019s happening and why it was amazing and why you should be at next year\u2019s event. If you missed this one for some insane reason, because there\u2019s no logical reason to have missed it, only insane ones. So if you had an insane reason, I want to give you guys some cool behind the scenes of what was happening.</p> <p>So this year\u2019s event, this is the third year we\u2019ve done it. The first year was in Vegas, we had about 600 people come. The second year, last year was in San Diego and we had 1300 people come and it\u2019s funny because you have to sign a contract for next year\u2019s event before the event, because you have to, because if you\u2019re going to sell tickets for the event you have to know,\u00a0 here\u2019s the venue and dates, blah, blah, blah. So last year we\u2019re like, let\u2019s make it a little bit bigger, let\u2019s do 1500 people. And then we ended up selling out three months early.</p> <p>We probably should have done bigger. So next year\u2019s event we\u2019ve got a little bit bigger place. Hoping that we\u2019re able to fill it. Just so you guys are fully aware, nothing on Earth stresses me out more than events. Filling events is the hardest sell. You\u2019re not just selling, \u201cHey, you should come to an event.\u201d Because that\u2019s an easy sell. The hard sells are all the other sells someone has to make in their mind. \u201cI gotta ask for work off, I gotta talk to my spouse, I gotta fly, pay for flights, pay for hotels.\u201d All these other things, so it\u2019s not just a simple sell, I want to\u2026.usually when you sell something you create desire and people want it and you sell it.</p> <p>This is harder, even if I create desire for it, you still have to go and close yourself on all the other logistics that are a pain. Event\u2019s are scary. In fact, the last time I did an event before Funnel Hacking Live, which I swore I would never do another event after. I think we sold 3 or 400 tickets, and when we got there only\u2026and it was $100 tickets, so I assumed that $100 commitment was enough to get people to show up. I was wrong. We ended up only having 100 that showed up.</p> <p>It was so embarrassing for me. I remember having all these empty seats. I was like, \u201cI will never do another event again.\u201d Then fast forward a couple of years, about the time this podcast was starting, I probably talked about it. There was this new company we were working on called Rippln, and they did their initial kickoff and there was 1200 people, and we ended up getting 1.5 million people to sign up over the 60 days or so. And then there was an event on the backside of it.</p> <p>So I thought there was going to be 30,000 people at this event, I was all excited for it. But at the time, the company hadn\u2019t launched the actual thing that we\u2019d built the hype for. There was a huge loss of momentum, at the event we had 1000 tickets sold. I showed up and we were getting ready to open the doors and went in the hallway and there was only about 200 people out there. We were like, \u201coh crap.\u201d</p> <p>The guy, Brian, who ran the company was like, \u201cOh crap. Let\u2019s pull chairs out.\u201d So we sat there, right before the event and pulled 800 chairs out of the room and then we had this huge empty room and then 200 seats in the front and brought people in and did this event over three days. And it was, for me, I was emotionally scarred. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but this is not a good sign.\u201d And sure enough the company crashed afterwards. A lot of wasted energy, time and money on my side that never materialized, but learned a lot of good lessons.</p> <p>That\u2019s the point, right? So because of those experiences, I had this fear of events. I never wanted to do one. So when the first Funnel Hacking Live, after we launched Clickfunnels, people were saying, people started doing meet ups. I was like, \u201cWe should facilitate this.\u201d So we decided to do the first one. We were going to sell 600 seats, and I was so scared, panicking about what if we only sell 100 and we have this room for 600? S</p> <p>o finally we did it. We launched it, and we sold out, I think we sold out 2 weeks early, so it wasn\u2019t huge, but we did. We did the event and I remember even the day of the show I had so much fear and anxiety. What if people don\u2019t show up? And I remember even before the event started hiding in the back and peaking through and I was like, \u201cOh good, the seats are full. Thank heavens.\u201d And then I was able to, we did the event and it turned out amazing.</p> <p>And then last year, same thing. We had 1300 seats sold and I remember the night before we have pre-registration, we only had 200 people pre-register.\u00a0 I was like, \u201cOh my gosh, nobody\u2019s coming. This is it. This is my greatest fear recognized once again.\u201d And I\u2019m freaking out and went out there and the next morning tons of people registered and we ended up having the entire thing filled, all 1300 seats and then we did the event, it was awesome.</p> <p>So this time, I had the same thing. I wasn\u2019t quite as, I had two successful events now, I wasn\u2019t quite as scared, but I still get nervous. So the event happened and this time we, usually the event\u2019s on a weekend, but to get the hotel space we had to do it on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, so we all flew in Sunday night, which was nice. We all flew in there and had time to just relax. Then Monday, my wife and I got up and went shopping to go buy clothes, and my team was doing everything, my team is amazing. They\u2019re stuffing binders and getting things ready and all that kind of stuff. So it was kind of nice, they were taking care of that.</p> <p>I was able to go and spend time with Collette, and just get ready for the event and shop. Just kind of mentally get prepared for this thing. And then that night, we had a big VIP dinner for our Inner Circle Members, as well as our certified partners who have actually finished certification. We had a big dinner with them and it was really, really cool.</p> <p>Now a couple things, this will be one of my themes of this podcast. It\u2019s interesting, and I\u2019m going to be vulnerable and let you guys know all my fears and my things in hopes, not that you judge me, \u201cMan, Russell\u2019s a wuss.\u201d I want you to be like, \u201cWow, if Russell can do it, I can do it.\u201d That\u2019s more of the goal with this. I love being on stage. I feel comfortable in front of 1500 people talking, and I feel really good there. I get really, really scared one on one or even in groups.</p> <p>So even at our Inner Circle dinner, there\u2019s 150 or so people, maybe 200 people, I can\u2019t remember, it was kind of a smaller thing, but tons of anxiety being in that room talking to people. Throughout the event people come talk to you one on one, I really struggle. I feel bad. I had my coaching call with Tara Williams this morning and we were kind of talking about this. I was just like, \u201cMan, it\u2019s funny how comfortable I feel up in front of the stage and how scared and nervous and awkward I feel one on one.\u201d And I feel bad about it.</p> <p>I think a lot of times, for anyone who did have one on one interactions with me. I apologize if I\u2019m super awkward. I don\u2019t know why, I feel nervous. I get really nervous there and I struggle. Which is why I try to hide as much as I can. I try to be out there to take pictures with everyone as well, but it\u2019s really, I struggle with that part of it.</p> <p>Anyway, we did the dinner that night, it was really fun. Bart Miller, who is one of our Inner Circle members who\u2019s transitioning into becoming a fashion coordinator, he designed all my clothes for the week. And he did the same for Alex Harmosian and a bunch of the Inner Circle members.\u00a0 So he was there and had me dressing up all nice. So I was nervous because I wasn\u2019t comfortable in my clothes, completely. And then in this room with these people that I admire. I wanted to make sure they had such a good experience, it gets you nervous. At least for me.</p> <p>But what\u2019s cool, at the end I had a chance to give a quick speech, it was amazing looking out at that room. And I knew most of the people in that room. All the Inner Circle members I know really intimately. I know their businesses, and often times I know their fears, hopes, desires, dreams, passion, all those things. I\u2019m aware of those things, so it\u2019s kind of cool to look out there and realize and look at those guys like, \u201cMan, the ripple effect\u201d That\u2019s funny, because of Rippln, that was our pitch there, but the ripple effect of these people is amazing.</p> <p>And I kind of talked about that like, how cool it is for me and for us as a company that we get to be a little piece in that journey. For me, it\u2019s such an honor. I get a lot of credit for those things and it\u2019s like, no it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you guys. We provided a tool, some training, but it\u2019s you guys taking that leap of faith to go and do it. Because the tools and training is out there for everybody, but most people don\u2019t do it, and the reason why is there\u2019s so much fear and anxiety and things that happen. Just seeing this room of people who are taking those leaps, it was awesome.</p> <p>That was the first night. We went to bed that night and I could not sleep. I really needed to because I hadn\u2019t slept much earlier, and I ended up being up until 2 or 2:30 before I passed out. The next day started and it was insane. We got there and people were packed. Devon Brown, who is the best MC on earth was MC-ing it, getting people\u2019s energy, he had everyone dancing and it was so exciting. And then we brought the certified partners on stage so everyone could see, \u201cHere are the people who are certified. Here are the people you could hire if you need help with funnels. And if you want to become certified, you want this to be your career, go ask someone from our team because you could be certified. This could be your new career, just like these guys.\u201d</p> <p>We had most of our Clickfunnels team come on stage, so people could see who was actually behind the event. Then after that, I had a chance to get up and it was cool because these events are always fun for because I get to share what I\u2019m thinking about, I\u2019m geeking out about at the time. And it\u2019s usually stuff I\u2019ve shared in the Inner Circle, I\u2019ve shared some of on the podcast, but it\u2019s never been formally presented. So this is the first time I had a chance to formally present the first section of the new Expert Secrets book, which is creating a mass movement. And it was so much fun to share that and walk through the models and show people that.</p> <p>And I think a lot of, I don\u2019t know, I felt like it was for a lot of people, just such a new, exciting thing to see and realize that we\u2019re not just selling things. You are creating a movement. What\u2019s interesting, one thing that kind of made me sad about the event, I know it frustrated some people, in the initial sales letter we had a little section saying I was going to talk about supplement funnels, and I didn\u2019t because of just how things shift as you start growing the event and speakers and some things have to get cut and some things don\u2019t. And that was one that got cut.</p> <p>Someone came up to me afterwards and was like, \u201cI came all the way from Australia because I wanted to learn about supplement funnels.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell I\u2019m not specifically talking about supplement funnels, but this stuff is the same. It doesn\u2019t matter. We are building the supplement line right now and the difference between the first supplement funnel was all a media based thing where we had a really good funnel and drove traffic. But we didn\u2019t build a culture, we didn\u2019t build a following and that\u2019s why it grew and then it went away. It was kind of over.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cWith the new supplement stuff we\u2019re doing, this building a mass movement, is the same. All these principals we\u2019re talking about are the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re selling supplements.\u201d I was trying to explain to her and I don\u2019t think she believed me and she was frustrated and walked away.</p> <p>This is the key to all business. This is the key to everything you\u2019re doing. It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re selling, this is still the foundation of how you position an offer and how you treat your customers and how you get them to buy over and over and over again. So I was excited to finally share that and it was just so cool.</p> <p>Then we had a break and after that Todd Brown came up. And Todd is, I always say if you look who are the two guys out there in the market teaching funnels the most it\u2019s me and Todd. Todd\u2019s a lot smarter than me. A lot more analytical I think at stuff and he has a chance to hang out with some amazing marketers. So I love his perspective, he came in and we were talking about the big idea. How do you create the idea behind the marketing campaign\u2019s to get people to buy your thing? And it was fun just to see how he breaks things down and how he looks at things.</p> <p>He\u2019s definitely different than how I look at things, but I appreciate it so much. The way that he views things, I respect him a lot. And it was awesome having him up there sharing his perspective on that. Because I think a lot of people are getting good at building funnels, but they\u2019re missing my first presentation which is creating a mass movement, and the positioning of things, and that kind of stuff. And then Todd is figuring out the big idea. So that was the next cool thing and people loved that.</p> <p>From there we broke to lunch, which I feel like eating is such a waste at these event. We\u2019ve got two hours we gotta block out for lunch so people can go and eat. But nobody needs that. We need to be sitting in a room talking. We let people eat, because I think people need that. Humans have to eat every once in a while. But yeah, we went to lunch. For most of these meals, we bought lunches and dinners and stuff like that for most of the stuff. Because I didn\u2019t want people to have to leave, it\u2019s just kind of a nice touch I think, to help provide those for people.</p> <p>So we fed a lot of people. I can\u2019t remember if we fed people that lunch or not, but whatever. But then after I came back, this is where I had a chance to go into story, which is the next thing. The epiphany bridge, I shared a lot of pieces of that with you. But another cool thing for me, Daegan Smith, who is one of my favorite people in the world, one of my mentors, peers, friends, whatever you want to say. I actually had him come to the event because I wanted him to see a lot of this stuff that I was talking about, a lot of stuff I initially learned from him and then stuff that we talked about what inspired ideas that made me test things and try things.</p> <p>So I had him there, and it was cool because I had to give this cool presentation on story and I got to give him credit for being there. In fact, the Expert Secrets book, most of it is dedicated to him, because it was the foundation for so much of this cool thing that became. It was fun having him in the room to hear that. I was a little nervous, honestly, I was like, \u201cDaegan, I learned tons of this stuff from you and this is where I\u2019ve kind of taken it.\u201d And it was fun to share that.</p> <p>So I shared the story and epiphany bridges and how all those things work together. We talked about the hero\u2019s two journeys, all the stuff that\u2019s from the Expert Secrets book, which you guys are going to love. Then I got done and I was able to bring up Brandon and Kaylin Polland, who last year, they were at last year\u2019s Funnel Hacking event and I met them in person there. Then they joined the Inner Circle and I\u2019ve had a chance to be around them and experience them and their business over the last year. And I wanted them to be at the event, so they spoke. They talked about social webinars and telling their story, which is super cool. Their whole thing is #dowhateverrussellsays, and I think their end thing was give Russell all your money and he\u2019ll turn it into more money, or something, which I appreciate.</p> <p>But it was cool to hear their whole story. What I think what Brandon and Kaylin, outside of they\u2019re crazy talented as a whole anyway, but showing when they got in a year ago or two years ago when they first got started, they didn\u2019t have a ton of money, and they invested in the Funnel Hacks course, a thousand dollar course a lot of you guys already have. They said, \u201cWe went through and pushed play and watched thirty seconds and we paused it and implemented that. And pushed play again\u2026.and for three weeks we went through the entire course in thirty second chunks.\u201d They heard it, stopped an implemented it.</p> <p>And what\u2019s funny is he told me afterwards, that a bunch of people came up and were like, \u201cWhat was the course you went through with Russell. I want to go through the same thing the same way.\u201d And he told them and they were like, \u201cOh. I\u2019ve owned that for a year and a half.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.\u201d The difference is that they implemented. That\u2019s the key, they\u2019re the most amazing implementers in the world. They\u2019re presentation was amazing.</p> <p>Then we had a break and after that, Jim Edwards came up, my co-host with Funnelfridays.com. And he gave a presentation on Copy Blocks, which was amazing. I think that hopefully for most people it was liberating. Showing wow, this is, I don\u2019t have to be a creative writer. I just have to understand how blocks work and copy and how Funnel Scripts works and all that kind of stuff. And Jim made it really fun. He did a great job. He made the whole session really fun and exciting and people loved it.</p> <p>Then when Jim got done, then Stu McLarin came up. Stu is one of the greatest human beings, literally, to be birthed on this earth. I don\u2019t know if I can say it strongly enough. Just an amazing human being. He came and talked about membership funnels, which was awesome. And showing the pre-launch process and how he launched his programs, and it was cool seeing his pre-launch stuff. How he launches, 90% is pre-launch stuff that most people, like me, don\u2019t even think about. It was like, \u201cHere\u2019s a video we launched ahead of time on Facebook and Youtube that got viewed. From here we moved to here\u2026\u201d it showed the whole process which was cool. And From here we launched this funnel and it made 3.3 million dollars and it was cool to show that.</p> <p>Then afterwards I had a chance to come up with Todd and Dylan and we did a special presentation about World Teacher Aide and we talked about coming to Kenya and we showed a video of me in Kenya from last year. And then this time we said, \u201cLook, if you guys want, we\u2019re going, if you guys will pay for a classroom you can actually come to Kenya with us and do a special Mastermind.\u201d We had 11 spots that were open and that night we sold all 11 of those spots and I think we had 7 or 8 people on the waiting list, which is crazy. When all is said and done, by the last day we had raised between the money, it was almost, just shy of a quarter of a million dollars, that we had raised for World Teacher Aide from the event, which was insane.</p> <p>What a quarter of a million dollars will do in Kenya, is the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars here in America. There\u2019s so many people and kids and communities, lives will be effected because of that. I just, everyone was gracious and giving, which is awesome.</p> <p>After that, we ran down and did our round tables. Which had a bunch of people at round tables and anyone could come and ask questions and it went really, really well. We had a big buffet down there and everyone was eating and partying, asking questions. It was good. I think next year we\u2019re going to tweak that a little though. There were pros and cons. The pros were everyone who got at a round table it was really, really powerful. Those who didn\u2019t though, they were kind of like, it was hard. And I don\u2019t know if we need to get microphones or something. Have people rotate from table to table. Some people purchase a table and sit there for the entire two or three hours and other people can get it.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to figure out how to make the round tables a little better. But it was really cool for everyone come out and have a chance to talk directly to the speakers and the Inner Circle members and things like that. It was awesome. That was day number one. I slept really good that night, which was awesome.</p>", "duration": "18:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/314_-_Behind_The_Scenes_Of_Funnel_Hacking_Live_2017_Part_1.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1488234623, "title": "Episode #313 \u2013 #Character", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A quick little rant after I woke up this morning.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about standing up for Caleb Maddix in a marketing Facebook group after people twice his age begin making fun of him.

So today we\u2019re home with my little Norah here. She\u2019s holding me. She\u2019s a little sad because she wanted to go and say bye to the kids at the bus stop, but instead we\u2019re hanging out and we\u2019re going to do a podcast because, in fact, I\u2019m going to do a big update on Funnel Hacking Live because I know a lot of you guys want to know what happened behind the scenes, all the cool stuff. Conversions, numbers, metrics, all the nerdy stuff we all care about.</p> <p>But today, I\u2019ve wanted to do a podcast this morning on something, a little something I like to call character. I\u2019m sitting here because I\u2019m a little upset this morning. Upset as I can be because I\u2019m usually pretty happy, but definitely just kind of annoyed and wanted to share this with you.</p> <p>Yesterday was Sunday, I was home, I went to church, hung out with the kids, having a good time. Then I jumped on the inter-webs because, honestly because we were selling Funnel Hacking Live tickets for next year, and we were looking at numbers and stats and went to Facebook to see if people were talking about it and what was happening. And then in the middle of my news Facebook feed I see a big old video from my buddy Caleb Maddix, now Caleb, if you don\u2019t know him yet, he\u2019s 14 or 15 now, amazing kid. He spoke at Funnel Hacking Live on stage and crushed it. One of the best presenters we had by far and he\u2019s a 15 year old kid and just one of the most talented, amazing humans, individuals I\u2019ve ever met in my entire life so far on this earth. And Caleb is so cool, him and also Emily Shay, we had both of them speaking at Funnel Hacking Live.</p> <p>Both of them actually came out here to my home in Boise and helped share with my kids. Right now, my kids are part of the Maddix book club, maddixbookclub.com, where every morning they get a text message from Caleb with the video, he\u2019s got them reading books and all sorts of cool stuff. It\u2019s the coolest thing in the world. He\u2019s inspiring kids, changing the world, he\u2019s able, as a 15 year old kid, he\u2019s able to stand up in front of 1500 people and control the audience like no one I\u2019ve ever seen. Just one of the most amazing humans I\u2019ve....on earth.</p> <p>Anyway, he\u2019s got so many talents and so much drive and he\u2019s a hard worker and just awesome. And his dad who is an amazing human as well. Just can\u2019t \u2026..there\u2019s no way I could think more of them. They\u2019re just so amazing. Everyday I\u2019ve actually had with Caleb has been super professional, super polite, just love that kid.</p> <p>So I\u2019m on Facebook, I\u2019m scrolling and I see this big video of Caleb. I\u2019m like, oh it\u2019s Caleb\u2019s video. And above it I see some moron posting something about why\u2026something about this kid and blah blah blah, making fun of him. And it was in a marketing group that I\u2019m part of. And this marketing group\u2026\u2026It\u2019s one of those groups that they got in there because they\u2019re all marketers and then they all like to make fun of everybody. They make fun of Gary V. they make fun of, they probably make fun of me. If I wasn\u2019t in that group, I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019ll get kicked out eventually and then they can all make fun of me. Whatever.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t really, whatever. It doesn\u2019t really bother me that much. But I saw Caleb sitting there and they all started making fun of him and they all started going and at first I just read them and I was like, whatever these guys, that\u2019s what they do to whatever. So I just kind of ignored it and then for the next hour it just bugged me. I was so visually bugged. I\u2019m playing with my kids and I just had this annoyed feeling. I was like I gotta go, if I was at an event or sitting somewhere and a bunch of people were saying things like that about someone I love and respect and is a friend, I would stand up and be like, I\u2019m going to go and just\u2026</p> <p>So I go back to the group, find the post, I just posted some really simple, I don\u2019t remember exactly what it was but it was like, \u201cHey, Caleb\u2019s awesome. He came out to Boise and trained my kids, he\u2019s got my kids off video games. Right now they\u2019re reading and they\u2019re writing and they\u2019re learning. He\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s interesting to me how many haters\u2026.\u201d It drives me nuts because Caleb has tons of, you see his videos, tons of comments from jerks. People who just have to put in their two cents because they feel like they\u2019re tough because they\u2019re behind the computer.</p> <p>So I said, \u201cCaleb has tons of haters, but it\u2019s typically from people who are double his age and making half as much money as him. There\u2019s two ways to build the biggest building in town. One\u2019s to actually work hard and become better yourself, and the other is trying to knock down the other buildings around you.\u201d I just posted that and left it there.</p> <p>So they get some people coming in like, \u201coh yeah, Caleb\u2019s cool.\u201d So at the playground, someone\u2019s getting bullied until one cool kids stands up and says, \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s cool.\u201d So all the sudden all the people who were too afraid to say anything come out, \u201cOh yeah, Caleb\u2019s cool.\u201d That kind of made me happy.</p> <p>So this morning I woke up, and this one drove me nuts. This morning I woke up, in this thread where they\u2019re all picking on a 15 year old kid, who is a thousand times more talented than any of them, by far. Some guy comments to me and says, \u201cHey Russell, don\u2019t you think you were kind of harsh on so and so? Especially considering the room that you\u2019re in.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay. You guys are bullying a kid behind his back in a Facebook group and then one guy comes and sticks up for that person and teases there person who makes the post because he\u2019s half as successful as this 15 year old kid and now you\u2019re mad that I\u2019m bullying that guy that made the initial post?\u201d I was like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p> <p>So I wrote a comment back, I just said, \u201cYou know I try to treat all people the same no matter what room I\u2019m in #character\u201d and I left it there. Anyway, that was how my morning started this morning, and I thought it was interesting and funny and I just wanted to leave a message for you guys.</p> <p>First off, a couple of things. So number one, if someone is a thousand times more successful than you and doing their thing and having fun with it, it doesn\u2019t help you to cut them down. If you\u2019re feeling insecure because they\u2019re doing that. That means it\u2019s a problem about you. And posting trash about it is not going to help you. Looking at that and inspired will. That\u2019s number one.</p> <p>Number two, I don\u2019t know about you, but what my parents taught me and what I teach my kids and I hope that you will learn as well is that you should treat people the same no matter what room you\u2019re in. That\u2019s ridiculous that, oh we\u2019re in this room so we\u2019re okay picking on a 15 year kid behind his back. No. What kind of character do you have? If you think that\u2019s okay, that is ridiculous. That is insane.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in a room and everyone is making fun of people behind your back, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the internet or offline or whatever, just know when you\u2019re not in that room those same people are making fun of you. That\u2019s called lack of character. If you have character you treat people the same no matter where you are. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s just ridiculous. I feel like I\u2019m working with my 11 year old twins. This is not something that an adult should still be struggling with. If you have any character at all, that\u2019s how you treat people the same. Especially people\u2026\u2026just ridiculous. #character, my new slogan for today.</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of all I wanted to share with you guys. Seriously, what\u2019s that thing they say, if you\u2019re pointing outward at somebody, there\u2019s 4 fingers pointed back at you. That\u2019s the reality you\u2019re in. That\u2019s what you need to feel good about yourself. Then there\u2019s other issues.</p> <p>Alright, that\u2019s all I got. Me and Norah are going to go eat and later on today I\u2019ll do a podcast recapping the whole event. Let you guys in on the behind the scenes of it all. But I just wanted to drop that really quick because I think it\u2019s important and says a lot about who we are as human beings. I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019d rather be friends with Caleb Maddix than any of those people talking trash about a kid in a Facebook group. Grow up and have some character. With that said, I appreciate you guys. Thanks for being funnel hackers. Thanks for doing the right thing. Thanks for being people that I would like to hang out with. With that said, I will talk to you all again soon.

Welcome back to Marketing In Your\u2026actually it\u2019s Marketing In Your Closet. I would do it in my car but, I tell you what, things are going so crazy right now getting ready for the event. I don\u2019t even\u2026..I\u2019m heading into the office in a little bit here.</p> <p>But I\u2019m getting dressed in the closet. So you can hear me talk in here, which I hope is okay. I have something cool to share with you. If you\u2019ve been following along for a long time, or most of you guys haven\u2019t read the book yet, because it\u2019s not actually out. Yesterday from the publisher we got back the guts of the book. The finalized design guts. We had to go through it last night. So Dave was up, we were at the office until 3. I can\u2019t remember 3 or 3:30 or something like that. He went through the whole thing, there was like 10 or 11 little edits and I sent it back in, which means now we can get the books printed. Which means we\u2019re going to be able to sell these things on time, which is insane.</p> <p>So that\u2019s all happening which I am excited about. And in the book I was talking a lot about this earlier while I was writing, in the podcast, for those who are listening along as we go. I talked about the foundation and building a big mass movement, or culture. There\u2019s three things, there\u2019s charismatic leader or attractive character, number one. Number two is a future based cause and then number three is a new opportunity.</p> <p>We talked about how you can\u2019t create improvement, but if you created something that\u2019s an improvement, teaching people how to become better then you automatically dis-include 98% of the world\u2019s population, which makes it really hard to sell. So if you struggled selling, it may be you\u2019re selling improvement. People don\u2019t want improvement, the masses don\u2019t. They want a new opportunity, so you could always create a new opportunity.</p> <p>So last night, the presentation I was working on was to show Actionetics, and if I ask 99% of people who have ever heard of Actionetics, what it is they say, \u201cIt\u2019s an email auto-responder.\u201d So as I\u2019m working on my presentation yesterday I was like, \u201cIf I call this an email auto-responder, what leverage do I have?\u201d The only leverage is to say this is a better E-R, a better auto-responder. By saying better, it is now an improvement offer. Which means 98 % of the world\u2019s population will no longer care about it. Including people in my market. The only people who care are the 2% who are actually looking for improvement.</p> <p>So if I pitch that way, I\u2019m going against my own rules. So because I try to practice what I preach at all times, in all situations, I spent the last almost two days now trying to figure out how we position this presentation and the tool, Actionetics as a new opportunity? Because it is. We were here forever trying to figure out the title of the presentation and the hook and angle and all sorts of stuff. Anyway, it\u2019s kind of cool. Literally I spent, I think I told you yesterday, 8 hours figuring out the headline and title. Steve Larsen had a burst of inspiration after all of us were sitting there trying to figure it out.</p> <p>I had email funnel secrets and I had email funnels and I had all these things. He came up with this idea, this name which was follow-up funnels. And I heard the angels in heaven singing. That is it. That\u2019s it. Actionetics is not an email auto-responder. If I was the Actionetics guy, \u201cHey here\u2019s an email auto-responder.\u201d I would beat him up. No, I\u2019m so much more than that. But that\u2019s how you classified me because you are trying to make it an improvement, you\u2019re better version of an auto-responder, which is true, but it\u2019s different. It\u2019s a new opportunity. It\u2019s a follow-up auto-responder. All sorts of follow-ups.</p> <p>So after we got the hook we started looking in December and found out, we went through all of our front end funnels, for every one dollar we made in front end funnels, we made $16.73, something like that, in the follow-up funnel, which is insane. $16 to $1 more than that. I thought it was a typo. I thought we did the stats wrong. We did it ten times. We did 16 times more from the follow-up funnels, than we did from any of the front end funnels, which is crazy.</p> <p>The front end funnels, I think we spent $85,000 in front end funnels. We made $96, we made $11,000. That was it. Anyway, it\u2019s crazy. So I started going over the follow-up funnels when I started doing this presentation and showing how this is not an improvement, this is a new opportunity. How auto-responders, that\u2019s an old, dead idea, concept. It\u2019s from 1998. The future is follow-up funnels and Actionetics is the tool, the only tool that can do that. Because it\u2019s legitimately a new opportunity. It\u2019s a blue ocean, it\u2019s all these things. There\u2019s no other service that can do what Actionetics does.</p> <p>Some people compare head to head with the email auto-responders. These ones might have more features, from an email auto-responder standpoint they may be a little bit better. Any time I\u2019m talking about E-R, it\u2019s an improvement offer. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here. We\u2019re talking about a whole new opportunity. Emails or only 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the equation. It\u2019s actually the rest of the stuff. I\u2019m going to be showing in the presentation everything. When someone comes in how with Actionetics you can do Facebook follow-up auto-responders, changing the pixels, changing the traffic, the images based on where the funnels are hitting.</p> <p>We\u2019ll show you how you can change the message based on who they are, how the funnel they have changes. How somebody leaves, they can come back because of sticky cookies and buy 6 months, a year, 5 years, or ten years later and not even have to put their credit card in. There\u2019s so many insanely cool things that Actionetics does. Because it\u2019s not an email auto-responder, it is a new opportunity, it is a follow-up funnel. And that\u2019s the magic.</p> <p>I just wanted to share that with you because it was a big\u2026..when I got that I was going crazy. But you gotta look at everything you\u2019re selling you guys. If you looked at me, if I looked at myself two days ago, I was selling a better email auto-responder. I look at myself today, I\u2019ve created a new opportunity and it is\u2026.that\u2019s what Actionetics is.</p> <p>So those of you guys who are going to be at the Funnel Hacking Live event, Day two, which is what? Wednesday morning, I\u2019ll be giving that presentation. I spent almost 40 hours straight on this stupid thing and it\u2019s still not done. So I\u2019m going in right now to go finish it off. Then I got two more presentations after that, so we\u2019re getting down to the wire, but what\u2019s coming from it is legitimately amazing. I can\u2019t wait to share with you guys.</p> <p>With that said, I\u2019m done, I\u2019m getting out of the closet. Coming out of the closet. No, not like that. I\u2019m literally walking out of the closet and into the bathroom and I\u2019m going to go get my hair and head out because I got a call with Caleb Maddix and Emily Shai, I always say her name wrong, Emily Shay in 15 minutes. So if you\u2019re watching Facebook Live\u2019s come check it out, we\u2019re doing Facebook Live\u2019s with all the different speakers, telling out stories and it\u2019s been so much fun. I\u2019m having so much fun with this so far. Come hang out with us and I\u2019ll see most of you guys at Funnel Hacking Lives. Thanks everybody and talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "08:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/312_-_Changing_From_Improvement_Offer_To_New_Opportunity.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1487271617, "title": "Episode #311 \u2013 The Lost Art Of Choreographing Everything", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Some behind the scene thoughts, as I\u2019m choreographing Funnel Hacking Live.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about some of his preparations for the Funnel Hacking Live event next week.

Welcome to Marketing In Your Car. I hope you guys are doing fantastic, wherever you are listening in. So today a couple of things. First off, we are 5 days away from Funnel Hacking Live and so much crazy, insanely coo, amazing stuff is all happening that I wish I could share all or just a piece of. But I\u2019m on my way to get a haircut and I\u2019ve got 8 minutes so I thought this would be the perfect time to hang out with you guys. And I\u2019m actually in my car, which is strange, seeing how that\u2019s the name of the podcast.</p> <p>And also, a couple of people told me that two episodes ago where I talked about the sport we call business, talking about the playground with the athletes and the drama and the skaters, all those things. A couple of people said they were kind of offended by that. I didn\u2019t mean it to be offensive, I meant it to be, in fact I said at the beginning there the things I learned from those guys was awesome. The collaboration I\u2026.I wouldn\u2019t have collaborated well had I not learned that from those other groups. I\u2019m just saying you have to understand that when you\u2019re in a group with a melting pot of a whole bunch of different personalities that there are people who are like me, who are aggressively competing and just being aware of that, hopefully to bring some competition to you.</p> <p>So if you were offended that means that it\u2019s time to build some aggression, instead of on me do it on your competitors. Anyway, I\u2019ll leave that there. Let\u2019s see, I just wanted to kind of walk you guys behind the scenes of what\u2019s happening, because it\u2019s insane.</p> <p>So the event\u2019s happening, which means we are creating order forms to print and signs and bags and backpacks and things and then presentations and speakers slides. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s crazy how many things go into this. Then we had this great idea, thanks to Trey Lewellen to do Facebook Live\u2019s with all the speakers before the event to get excited. So we\u2019ve been doing that twice a day which has been so fun. You\u2019re going to be so excited to come and hang out with everybody, which is cool.</p> <p>And then a big part of events, I\u2019m going to bring you in on a little secret, don\u2019t tell everybody this. I don\u2019t know if you guys knew this, but we actually make money at the events. So there\u2019s the big secret, it\u2019s out, the pink elephant is out of the room. So now that that\u2019s out there, the event, there\u2019s a couple of focus, one is to get everyone together and build community and culture and myths and stuff like that. That\u2019s one thing, obviously. And another is for us to make money as a company. So that\u2019s one of the benefits, but there\u2019s a fine line between having an event that\u2026..When I first got started the way that events were is you had 15 speakers, every speaker is up for 90 minutes pitching something and that\u2019s how the event was. People didn\u2019t mind for a while. Then they started really minding and people stopped going to events.</p> <p>I\u2019m like, if I want people to come to my events, it\u2019s not pitch fest where everyone\u2019s selling. But at the same time we need to sell. So how do you do it in a cool way where it\u2019s not distracting but it adds a benefit and those kind of things. You know, a big, big, big piece of this whole pie is choreographing the event. It\u2019d be fun to talk about the event choreography for a long time with you guys because there\u2019s so many cool things. I think after the event, depending on what happens, I\u2019ll share with you guys some of this stuff that\u2019s actually happening. Because there\u2019s the surface level, what everyone will see, but there\u2019s stuff happening at a subconscious level that\u2019s so cool. I wish I could share with you guys right now. But I don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise for those that are going to be there.</p> <p>But there\u2019s stuff happening that there\u2019s patterns that I\u2019m using in really interesting ways that are very, very thought through. If you guys watch who\u2019s speaking, when. How they\u2019re speaking, what the topics are, the length of time. All those things are choreographed for a purpose. It\u2019s not just to put a speaker in here on this day, kind of stuff. There\u2019s a storyline that we\u2019re telling through the event, which is why I try to make it all so engaging, so people are not sitting in the halls, because if they do they miss the storyline. There\u2019s a very key storyline that\u2019s happening throughout the whole thing.</p> <p>Even the pace of the speakers and where they\u2019re at has a lot to do with it. The order of my presentations is very specific. There\u2019s hint that I\u2019ll drop right now and share with you guys post event, maybe. Hopefully, we will.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s so exciting. And it\u2019s really fun. I wish I could explain everything. But I mean everything from how do you build a rapport quickly with the audience? How do you get rapport with the speakers and with the MC ahead of time. That\u2019s what these Facebook Lives, it\u2019s a big part of it because rapport is huge. How do you teach in a way that doesn\u2019t just overwhelm people, but brings epiphany bridges, or breaks belief patterns and helps people to learn and grow and have not just like, \u201cOh I learned really cool tactics.\u201d But emotional shifts that change things.</p> <p>Because that\u2019s the experience we\u2019re trying to deliver and there\u2019s so much that goes into that. Again, it\u2019s being impactful and making an amazing networking content, belief transformation event that also setting us up to make money. So it\u2019s kind of cool how things will be weaved in. And we\u2019re making a couple of really special offers at the event that aren\u2019t going to be available to the general public for a long time. But will be available to those who were there. And it\u2019s going to be cool. So I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>Those who are coming and watching, pay attention. I would say, if you buy stuff from me, buy slowly because everything that we\u2019re doing is thought through. It\u2019s not just, oh let\u2019s blah. It\u2019s all very, very well thought through. But one kind of cool thing, doing a presentation of the morning of day two, which in our past events we always called the Clickfunnels state of the union. We talk about all the new features and stuff like that. It was really good, but also was\u2026the energy on that session always felt wrong. It wasn\u2019t \u2026..I wanted it to be like Steve Jobs thing, where he\u2019s up there and everyone goes crazy. And it\u2019s never quite been that.</p> <p>So I wanted, how do we choreograph this in the right way? And I\u2019m really proud of what\u2019s happening. I started on this presentation yesterday, about twenty four hours ago. I spent the entire first 24 hours on two things. One is choreographing the presentation, number two is figuring out the title and headline, which is crazy. I\u2019m not going to share with you guys here, because it\u2019s cool but I literally at ten o\u2019clock last night is when everybody else left the office and I was trying to figure out a name for the presentation.</p> <p>Because I had a name initially and I was just like, it\u2019s good but it\u2019s not great. Most people would have done it, and it would have been fine. If we used it, it would have been fine. But I was like, I need something that has enough emotional impact that it makes you be like, \u201cwhat? What is that?\u201d So I literally sat there going through books and books and books of swipe files, trying to find a word.</p> <p>From 10 at night until about 2-2:30 in the morning, so four and a half hours. And I didn\u2019t find it. Then in the morning I woke up and I was stressed out, so I voxed everyone on our marketing group like, \u201cHey everyone, this is my dilemma. Give me your thoughts.\u201d So everyone was giving their thoughts back. And then I came back and spent another two or three hours and then finally Stephen actually had the epiphany. He was like, \u201cWhat about this?\u201d I was like AHH! Angels from heaven singing. That is it, that\u2019s the one. Yes. And we were freaking out and we got it.</p> <p>Then I spent the next 7 hours trying to come up with the sub headline, which is crazy because all my slides have to be done tomorrow if they\u2019re going to be in the booklet. So I\u2019m on this huge time crunch but I still spent 7 hours on the sub headline. And then we got it. And it\u2019s perfect. And it\u2019s, it will cause the emotional response, number one. But it\u2019ll cause the belief pattern to shift in people\u2019s minds.</p> <p>Because I look at people that are succeeding with funnels and those who aren\u2019t. The difference between two comma members, who are making a million dollars in funnels and those who aren\u2019t. And it\u2019s a belief pattern in one thing, and if I can smash that belief pattern it\u2019ll shift everything for them. That\u2019s the key of this whole thing. I\u2019m so excited to give this presentation now. Except now it\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock and I\u2019m getting my haircut and then I\u2019ve got scouts tonight, so I\u2019m doing scouts.</p> <p>Then after scouts, I\u2019m coming back in the office after 9. So from 9 until 2 or 3 tonight I\u2019ll be getting slides done because I have to get this presentation done tonight. And there\u2019s a lot that goes into that. Because its, again, it\u2019s us showing all the new features within the context of this presentation and the choreographing of it.</p> <p>So the things I wanted to share with you guys because I know it\u2019s kind of vague today, but I want you to understand the concept of choreographing things. The perfect webinar is a choreographed presentation that does a very specific thing. Those who were at the FHAT event last week saw it in very intense detail, more than I\u2019ve ever done before. What I\u2019m choreographing, what stories are where and why? What belief patterns are supposed to break at each point? The Expert Secrets book will go deep into that as well, but it\u2019s the choreographing of the sales message.</p> <p>Same thing is on this event. The choreographing of it, when I give presentations it\u2019s the choreographing of that. How do we, what are the beliefs they may have and what order and how do we structure this stuff to fit within that? So I spend insane amounts of time. I spent probably 12, actual thinking time, probably 6 hours to get the title of the presentation. And then another, what did I say? Another 8 hours or so, 7 hours getting the subtitle. It was just insane. I gotta get 5 hours to get the rest of the slides done. But that\u2019s how much thought goes into it sometimes.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re working on a presentation or a sales pitch or something, you spend 30 minutes on a headline, and you\u2019re like, \u201cugh I can\u2019t get it\u201d and you\u2019re frustrated and walk away. Know that it happens to everybody. It happens to the best of us. But the one\u2019s when you get it right, that\u2019s the difference between, again, a 5 or 6 figure campaign and a 7 or 8 figure campaign is getting that right. So don\u2019t be afraid to put the time and energy and effort into that because it\u2019s worth it in the end and hopefully it\u2019ll be worth it for the attendees. You guys will have to let me know afterwards.</p> <p>Again, I will share with you. After the event is done I will walk you guys through the choreography, the what and why and how it all worked. What worked and what didn\u2019t work. So that\u2019s all I got today. I\u2019m at the haircut place, two minutes late. I\u2019m going to bounce. Thanks you guys for everything. I can\u2019t wait to see you guys at Funnel Hacking Live, those who are going to be there. Those who can\u2019t make it there, please come next year. I don\u2019t put out half a million dollars or more in cash from my pocket just for my health. It\u2019s to serve you guys.</p> <p>So take advantage of that, it\u2019s worth the $1000 bucks and the couple grand for tickets and hotels. Because I\u2019m spending 50 times that much on investing into you guys. So make sure you invest that back into yourself as well, because we do care and I do know that this stuff works and it can change your life. So if you\u2019re on the fence thinking about next year if you\u2019re going to come or whatever. Just remember you guys, you\u2019re just one funnel away. I cannot wait to help you implement and create that funnel. Alright guys, talk to you soon.

I\u2019m about a week or two away til I get rid of this thing. Getting rid of the Corvette, and my Lexus is now smashed because I backed into it with my other car. Yes, I\u2019m a genius.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to be finally getting my dream car. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve been, my whole life my dream car\u2019s been a Jeep. Ever since I was a little kid I always wanted a Jeep, but for some reason I never had one. I\u2019ve had a Ferrari, I\u2019ve had a Corvette, all those things. But I don\u2019t even like those cars, I\u2019ve always wanted a Jeep. So all the guys at the office are making fun of me, \u201cDude, you realize Jeeps aren\u2019t that expensive right?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cyeah.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get one?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBecause I have a Corvette now.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, get rid of it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI guess I could. Why don\u2019t I just do that?\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019m getting a Jeep. I\u2019m down grading in the eyes of some people, but I\u2019m upgrading in my eyes, which is all that really matters when all is said and done. So I\u2019m pretty excited for that.</p> <p>But I\u2019m heading to the office right now. Yesterday was planning out all the presentations, the offers, getting order forms, process flows, speaker lineup, all that kind of stuff was yesterday. Today is working on presentations. I got Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday to get all my presentations done. And then after that I\u2019m heading to the event. So it\u2019s like do or die.</p> <p>But I want to talk about, because I know some people have voiced concern that my presentations aren\u2019t done and the event is happening. So I want to talk to you guys. I did a podcast a year ago called the Fine Art of Procrastination, which is worth listening to. So this probably part two of that. It just kind of a understanding that most people, we spend so much time planning stuff. And there\u2019s some law, I think its, I can\u2019t remember, Fredo\u2019s law, one of those dudes. But there\u2019s a law that basically however much time you have to get something done, you will fill that time completely up. It always happens.</p> <p>So if I were to start planning these things six months ago and started working on presentations I would still be not getting it done until right now anyway. So in my philosophy, just why not just get them done right now and it\u2019s better? The other thing, I don\u2019t know about you guys when you do presentations, I\u2019ve had presentations, where I\u2019ve created presentations and I\u2019ve done the presentations a bunch of times and it worked, and then I don\u2019t do it for six months and I come back and do it and even though I\u2019ve done the presentation and I know it, for some reason my mind can\u2019t remember the process and some of the stories, all that kind of stuff gets messed up.</p> <p>Where if I\u2019m doing the presentations right before it actually happens, then I have better recall and clarity of what I was I doing and why I was doing it and how all the pieces fit together and all that kind of fun stuff. In fact, the FHAT event we did last week, I was up until 1:00 the night before doing my presentations. I was all nervous and all those things, but what\u2019s nice, I\u2019d gone through it so many times, I knew the process and what I was trying to cover, when and why and how they all fit together. So when I gave it, it was all top of mind. If I was to give the FHAT event today, I would struggle because it\u2019s been a week since I did it. I would be like, \u201cOh wait, why did I do that in that order?\u201d It would probably be hard.</p> <p>So that\u2019s another reason why I like to wait til the end. Because it gives me the ability to have it top of my mind. What I\u2019m doing, why I\u2019m doing it, and the order and structure and all those things. Anyway, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening today.</p> <p>So I\u2019m giving you guys all permission, those of you guys who procrastinate. But it comes back to is having a firm, hard deadline. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but if I don\u2019t have the deadline of this is when this has to happen or else it\u2019s never going to happen. If I don\u2019t have those deadlines then nothing ever happens. So that\u2019s why I always schedule things like, \u201cOkay FHAT event happens this day, Funnel Hacking Live starts this day. Product launch is this day. Roll out of MP3 players is this day.\u201d So I set these hard deadlines and that way my, I don\u2019t know, my mind does not have the ability to keep pushing deadline further and further away.</p> <p>Because it\u2019s like, if we don\u2019t make this one then we miss the next one and the next one. In fact, in our office I went and bought this huge calendar. It takes up an entire wall for the whole year. And what we\u2019d be doing is basically blocking out almost every single week and in most cases every day of every single week for the next twelve months. Everything is so tightly fitted in there it\u2019s like, okay here\u2019s all the stuff that\u2019s happening and there\u2019s no room for deviation.</p> <p>It\u2019s like, okay this is when things are happening and if I miss something then it throws the rest of the year off. So we have to get things done. That\u2019s kind of how I function. Is setting hard deadlines that are immovable and then reverse engineering to get that done. Like, when do I need to start the core tasks, and then starting those just in time.</p> <p>I remember I took a class in college, it was a project management class. But I did really bad on it, but the teacher was awesome. I remember it was my senior year, last semester. I was either failing or I was close to failing, but probably closer on the failing side, and I was not going to graduate if I didn\u2019t pass this annoying class. My teacher was super cool, he came up to me after class. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cSo what are you doing? What\u2019s your\u2026what are your plans after you graduate?\u201d I was like, \u201cOh well, I already launched this business, selling stuff online. I already have two employees, just going to keep growing that.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cSo you don\u2019t really need this engineering stuff right?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNot even a little bit.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cCool, how about this? I\u2019ll give you a C.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, I love you. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>And so he gave me a C, and it was the greatest gift that someone could have ever given me. I don\u2019t remember the teacher\u2019s name or anything, but if I ever see him again I\u2019ll be like, \u201cDude, thank you for that C.\u201d Anyway, I did learn something from that class, which is why I deserve that C, because I have retention to this day.</p> <p>In that class he talked about, probably a lot of stuff, the only thing I remember was the concept of just in time production. Where people get things done just in time. I guess that doesn\u2019t really warrant me getting a C, I don\u2019t really know what that means other than in my mind it means I\u2019m going to get things done just in time. I\u2019m not going to try to have things done a month or a week or six months early, because if I do I\u2019m going to stress about it, it\u2019s not going to be right, I\u2019m going to keep pushing it, and I\u2019ll waste so much time.</p> <p>For me if I can press those timelines I get ten times as much stuff done and sometimes things aren\u2019t perfect when I roll them out, but that\u2019s okay because I have time to perfect them over time. But I do not have time to over time to launch it, get it out the door. Because then it\u2019ll just never actually get done.</p> <p>For those of you guys who get stuck in that, what do they call it, analysis paralysis, in that mode of trying to make things perfect before you roll it out. What I highly recommend doing for you is finding a business partner who just likes to sell stuff. There\u2019s something magic about sales people.</p> <p>Like me, for example, not that I\u2019m that cool but I love to sell stuff. And I want to sell stuff fast, before it\u2019s even ready. In fact, Steven Larsen yesterday was like, \u201cDude, you sell all this stuff before you ever create it.\u201d I was like, \u201cYes.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cHow do you\u2026why do you do that?\u201d I was like, \u201cwell, first off, if I sell it and nobody buys it, I don\u2019t want to create it. And second off, by me selling it, I say things about what it\u2019s going to be and I then hold myself accountable to that when I create the products I have to fulfill on these different promises.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of people create the product first. I remember when I first learned copywriting, they told me that before I create the product, write the sales letter. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to be like, \u201cOh my product doesn\u2019t do that or that.\u201d And your sales letter gets worse and worse. Instead write the sales letter first and write all the promises you want and say how do I make my product fulfill these promises.</p> <p>And that\u2019s a better way to sell. The other way around is backwards and doesn\u2019t really work. The key is going up there and selling. So find a good sales person and go and take it. I\u2019ve got, by far, the most amazing partners on planet earth with Clickfunnels. And we\u2019ve joked about this before. If it wasn\u2019t for me, I want to sell this, they would probably still be programming it because there\u2019s so much they want to do. But I\u2019m like, no we gotta sell it.</p> <p>So I\u2019m selling and they\u2019re developing. So we sold it and the first version of Clickfunnels, guess what? It wasn\u2019t that good. But it got better. The next version wasn\u2019t quite as good, but it got better and better. IT\u2019s continual progression, but the progression is much easier to do when you got cash in the bank from you selling the thing. So that\u2019s kind of the moral of today\u2019s story I think.</p> <p>In this situation, if you\u2019re that person, find somebody who can just go and sell for you. I was talking to Dean Graziosi yesterday and he was doing an infomercial, so he filmed the infomercial, got a book that had the cover on it, with blank pages inside. Did the whole infomercial, showing the book. And he launched the infomercial and saw what the numbers were. The numbers came back really good, and he said, cool the numbers are good. Now I\u2019m going to go back and actually write the book. So he sent the next six months writing the book.</p> <p>And then the infomercial knew worked, so he went and tweaked it. This time he brought Larry King on the infomercial, launched it there, it did good but the book still wasn\u2019t finished. He tested it, refunded everyone who bought. He just wanted to see the numbers and now he\u2019s getting ready to finalize it. And what\u2019s cool, this is cool and a huge honor for me. He did the first version with Larry King, test it, worked good. Then a month or two months later I was out at the 100k meeting, and if you guys listen to episodes 300-302 I shared my presentation from the 100k meeting. We talked about epiphany bridges, belief and story and all that really cool stuff.</p> <p>And Dean, it\u2019s his event so he was there. He was like, this is awesome. So he messaged me yesterday, \u201cHey just so you know, after your thing I had some big aha\u2019s that I forgot about. Things I used to do in my old shows that I didn\u2019t do. I actually hired Larry King, flew him back out here and we re-filmed the intro.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u2018\u2019Really, can I see it?\u201d</p> <p>So he sent me the link yesterday to the infomercial. So I was watching it and at minute 2:20 he actually said the word, epiphany. And I stood up, clapped my hands. Not only is he using epiphany bridge, he actually used the word epiphany. I was freaking out and so excited, it was insane.</p> <p>And then I asked him, \u201cHey man, when in your schedule can we block out to do my infomercial for my book?\u201d and he was like, \u201cHey, we could do it blah.\u201d And gave me a date, which is insane and way sooner than I thought.</p> <p>So I may have an Expert Secrets infomercial in my near future. I\u2019m so excited. So we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll keep you guys in the loop as that goes forward. But how cool would that be. With that said, I\u2019m going to go inside and get some power point presentations done. Appreciate you all; see most of you all at Funnel Hacking Live. And remember you guys, you\u2019re just one funnel away. Thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "11:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/310_-_The_Backwards_Way_To_Launch_A_Bestseller_Everytime.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1487010957, "title": "Episode #309 \u2013 The Sport We Call Business", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Understand who you\u2019re competing against in this game, or else you\u2019re going to lose.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about looking at competing in business the same way he would compete during his wrestling days.

I\u2019m actually taking the trash out right now. That\u2019s what that wheeling sound, that\u2019s the trashcan being wheeled. But this is going to be a crazy week. I thought I\u2019d hang out with you guys before I get started on it.</p> <p>Tomorrow is Monday morning, and Monday is basically the week before Funnel Hacking Live starts. Technically it starts on Tuesday, but Pre-registration starts a week from tomorrow. So Tomorrow is when I get to start doing all my presentations. Yes, I wait til the last week to do my presentations. You want to know why? Because the stuff we were doing six months ago, even a month ago has changed. So I want to make sure I have the most up to date content of all time at any given moment. That\u2019s the reason why. That\u2019s one of the reasons. The other reason is I just haven\u2019t had time.</p> <p>But that\u2019s plenty of time to get everything done and make it amazing. I know what I\u2019m going to talk about, I just gotta get all the slides and examples and case studies and all that kind of stuff and put it together in a really cool way. Hopefully you guys can hear me. It\u2019s kind of loud, the trashcan. But I am\u2026.hold on a second I\u2019m going to\u2026</p> <p>Alright, this might be the only episode of Marketing while you\u2019re taking the trashcan out. I\u2019m out here and it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s super dark, we just got new neighbors that built a house across the street. We\u2019re on a really dark street where there\u2019s not lights at all. Their house is lit up really cool and the moon is\u2026.I wish you could see it. It\u2019s pitch black, it\u2019s way off in the distance, right above the mountains there\u2019s this glowing thing that looks misty and foggy over it. It\u2019s pretty amazing.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m excited because all the snow has been melting that we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve had so much snow this winter. Then it rained three days last week and it all melted. And we\u2019re back to where I can see the grass everywhere and it\u2019s so exciting.</p> <p>Anyway, tonight was really fun, we went to church and then had meetings after church and then went out with the kids, went and played in the wrestling room, jumped on the tramp which is freezing cold, then jumped in the hot tub which is super warm and now we put them to bed. My wife\u2019s actually in there putting them to bed. I snuck out to put out the trash because they wear me out those little buggars. I love them, but they wear me out.</p> <p>Anyway, Funnel Hacking Live is a week away, which is crazy. It\u2019s interesting, last week we had our FHAT event, here in Boise in our new office, which is super fun and I just have this bad habit of booking way too many things all at the same time. But it\u2019s been fun. There\u2019s something with finishing the book and creating everything for the FHAT event, and everything for the Funnel Hacking Live event, where all these concepts and things we\u2019re talking about right now are becoming so clear.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if you guys have done that where you\u2019ve had the chance to go through a really deep immersion. It\u2019s weird all these connections get made that don\u2019t when you\u2019re dabbling and goofing around. That\u2019s why I think people should go really deep when they\u2019re becoming a master at what they\u2019re trying to do. You know, become unbalanced for a while, spending insane amounts of time.</p> <p>But it\u2019s been interesting, one of the fun things I\u2019ve been thinking about. My dad came to town last weekend as well, which is awesome. I was thinking about business as a whole, it\u2019s such a weird I don\u2019t know, playground is the word that pops in my head, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right word. It\u2019s this weird playground where you go to school, and there\u2019s all these different types of kids. There\u2019s the athletes over here, then there\u2019s the people that are in band, and then there\u2019s the drama kids, and then there\u2019s the skaters, and then there\u2019s\u2026..there\u2019s all these different groups at the playground.</p> <p>When you typically go out there, you go and play with the people that fit in your mold. So I go play with the athletes. We play basketball, football. Competing against each other, trying to win. That\u2019s what drove us at recess, but I\u2019m guessing the other groups probably didn\u2019t do that. They were, I don\u2019t know what the other groups were doing. But I\u2019m assuming, because we would play games with all the kids, but as I got older, I focused on wrestling and that became my thing and it was a deep passion of how do I become the best.</p> <p>At first I wanted to be the best in the state. After I was State Champ I was like, I want to be best in the country. And my senior year of high school I took second place in the country. Then I was like, I want to be the best in college, in the country. And I never hit that goal. I guess technically I didn\u2019t hit the best in the country in high school either, I almost, I was two points away from that. College I was like, I want to be an all American, I want to be a national champ, and I didn\u2019t get those goals, but I always knew that\u2019s the person I have to beat. I was aware of them, I looked at them and I watched their matches and I studied them and looked what they were doing and I understood them. I understood their moves and what drove them so that I could beat them.</p> <p>And I was always aware of the people I had to beat. And that was just like, as an athlete, how I viewed the world and business, not business but things. I mean, for almost two decades of my life, that\u2019s what it was. Here\u2019s where I\u2019m at, who\u2019s above me, I gotta find those people, figure them out, and beat them. And that\u2019s what I understood. And I always assume that that\u2019s how everybody thought. But I guess, back at the playground, I\u2019m guessing the band kids didn\u2019t do that. They hung out and played music together, they had a good time.</p> <p>The drama kids, they made plays together and had a good time. And then the skaters, they skated. You know, I don\u2019t know all the different cliques and stuff, but everybody did their thing. I always assumed that everyone thought the way that I did. Because that was the only world I knew. And it\u2019s been interesting as I\u2019ve come into business, because for me business was the next sport. I got into business, I mean I was learning about it in college when I was wrestling. My senior year, I didn\u2019t hit my goals. I fell short, and in fact I didn\u2019t even qualify for the national tournament, which destroyed me. And it would have destroyed me if I didn\u2019t have the next thing. For me, business I was dabbling in and that became my next sport.</p> <p>It was like, here\u2019s the sport, I got to figure out. And it\u2019s interesting, the concepts of funnel hacking and the stuff that I share with people, you know how I always talk about I look at people successful and I model them, and I did, but it was different from that. For me it was a sport, I came in and this is the\u2026.I\u2019m on a new playground looking around. Who are the kids that are winning? And the people I saw at the time were Armand Morin, Alex Mandossian, Mark Joyner, David Frey, these are all the guys I saw who were successful. So for me it was like, okay what are those guys doing? It was just like wrestling. I would look at them, scout them, watch them, study and learn and figure out what makes them tick. And then when I understand that, then I go and compete against them.</p> <p>In wrestling I have a match, and someday I\u2019m going to come face to face, we\u2019re going to walk out on the mat under the lights. I\u2019m going to put my shoes on and it\u2019s going to be me and them and that\u2019s it. And if I haven\u2019t done my homework, I\u2019m going to look like an idiot. But in business it was weird because I would study these guys and try to figure out how to compete with them and be successful like they were and that was my whole thing, and I was racing towards that. But what\u2019s weird in business, we never got that moment where we step on the mat and shake hands and go and find out who prepared more.</p> <p>It was weird, I became friends with people and our businesses were together and I learned this cooperation stuff that I\u2019m guessing they probably taught at the playground with the kids in the band, and the kids, the other groups that all played together. For business it was fun because I collaborated and I had that, but in my mind, I don\u2019t know about you, but I always had from day one\u2026.I remember actually, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever publicly said this out loud, but for me, I\u2019ve always been very aware of where I visualize myself in the totem pole in my market, where are people at? Where up and down, that\u2019s just how my brain works.</p> <p>And when I pass somebody, I\u2019m aware of that. And when I know who\u2019s ahead of me, I\u2019m aware of that. When I know that, I study those people, I figure them out and I try to beat them. That\u2019s just how I\u2019m wired. It\u2019s been interesting, as I\u2019ve gotten into, as our business has been growing, I would say in our market, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any businesses that are really bigger than us right now. Outside of a couple of companies that have taken on venture capitalists. They\u2019ve got millions of dollars dumped into them, which is the equivalent of steroids. Honestly, in sports that cheating, but business it\u2019s like, \u201cAww yes, someone gave us 14 million dollars, now we can cheat.\u201d It\u2019s just ridiculous.</p> <p>For me, I\u2019m looking out and we\u2019ve got these dudes that got steroids, they\u2019re cheating, but I got to compete against the, but I\u2019m very aware. In my mind it\u2019s very clear, the companies I\u2019m going after. And it shouldn\u2019t be too hard for you guys that follow me to know, because we make fun of them a lot. But I\u2019m aware of it, I study and figure out what they\u2019re doing right and wrong, what the weaknesses are and then we\u2019re attacking them.</p> <p>It\u2019s been interesting because as I\u2019ve been doing that, the kids at the playground who grew up in band class, and that grew up in drama and as skaters and all these other things, they\u2019re not used to it. And those are the guys I\u2019m competing against. And it\u2019s interesting because they don\u2019t handle the heat well. We got in a\u2026\u2026</p> <p>For me this is a sport. Business is nothing but a sport for me. It\u2019s like, who do I need to beat? We\u2019re going and attacking and we\u2019re going to beat them. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of this whole thing? Yes, we\u2019re helping people and that part is amazing on this journey. But there\u2019s not, that\u2019s who I need to beat, what\u2019s the point of it? It\u2019s hard for me otherwise.</p> <p>Anyway, someone that I kind of ruffled their feathers, I actually thought through this podcast, interestingly enough. But they messaged me and kind of told me off, because they didn\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing. Because I\u2019m aggressive and I\u2019m not playing like they\u2019re used to playing. What they told me, they said my dad taught me never to burn bridges. And I didn\u2019t send this back, but I wanted to. I thought, that\u2019s interesting because my dad taught me how to win and that\u2019s all that matters to me, is winning.</p> <p>Anyway, I told that story at the FHAT event, and people thought I was pretty, everyone was laughing. But that\u2019s how I feel. I\u2019m very aware of who I am going after. And I don\u2019t publicly. In fact, Dan Usher is here making some videos for us and I was showing the offer we\u2019re creating, there\u2019s one other person who\u2019s had more success in this, I\u2019m not going to say their name. But there\u2019s one person who\u2019s had more success than me in this field where this book is. And I was showing Dan those videos and I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s who I\u2019m going against. That\u2019s who I\u2019m competing against. That\u2019s who we have to beat.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI thought you guys were friends.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWe are friends, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I was friends with people on the wrestling mat, but when it comes to sports I have to win. I\u2019m going after them. I\u2019m not sitting around and trying to be nice. My goal is to win. Flat out. And I want to make sure that everybody understands that.</p> <p>What\u2019s cool, is during this process I\u2019m making friends and all these kinds of things, but it\u2019s a sport for me. Very clear cut. This is a sport. And I have people I\u2019m competing against and I\u2019m going to win. And it\u2019s interesting, because these other people aren\u2019t used to that, and they are used to that, they\u2019ve never been under the lights, with your shoes tied up and it\u2019s you and them and no one else going head to head. And I am, I\u2019m used to it. I love it, I thrive off it. I need it, I desire it. I crave for that.</p> <p>So it makes this game interesting because the way that people are beating us right now is through the most part, venture capitalists, steroids. So it just drives me more. Yes, okay. You\u2019re going to cheat with steroids, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m still going to win, I\u2019m going to take you down and we\u2019re going to choke you out and we\u2019re going to turn you to your back and you\u2019re going to get pinned. And that\u2019s how I view business.</p> <p>I just want, I don\u2019t know, I want to instill that into you guys. A lot of you guys out there were athletes, you were the kids on the playground who went through that and experienced it, and that\u2019s your drive. For some of you guys it\u2019s not. You have to understand when you step in the business world, that\u2019s who you\u2019re playing against. You\u2019re playing against athletes. People who that\u2019s their goal.</p> <p>So when I come, when you come into your business and look at your market, you need to be fully aware. Where do you sit on the totem pole? Are you JV or Varsity? First team or second team? Where in the state or country? Because if you\u2019re not aware of that, how do you win if you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re playing against? Somebody told me the other day, after the FHAT event, \u201cOne thing I discovered after being around you for the last three days is how aware you are of all the competitors in your market.\u201d And I thought it was interesting, because I am very, very aware. I know what they\u2019re all doing. I\u2019m watching them.</p> <p>And the things that I like, we use. And the things we don\u2019t, we counter attack against them. You\u2019ll see more and more of that throughout this year as we are aggressively going after our competitors and we\u2019re going to surpass them through raw talent and skill instead of venture capitalists cash, which is amazing.</p> <p>You know, I wrestled kids that were on steroids before and it\u2019s interesting, they come out and have big muscles. They huff and puff and usually the first 30 seconds to a minute they are really strong, but what I\u2019ve found with the big dudes on steroids, when you choke them, you snap their head down and block the blood, there\u2019s a carotid artery in their neck, if you squeeze that and block the blood to their carotid artery, instantly in the second they go down. Their muscles become weak and they become soft like jelly. And the stronger they were, the weaker they become. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve found.</p> <p>Not that you guys care, but when I wrestled big people. I count out muscles first, and if I can\u2019t take them down, I have to get their head below me and do a front headlock; we\u2019re going for a choke, cut the blood off from the brain, not long term but just for a second or two. But as soon as you do that, all your muscles lose energy, they stop, you fall and then we attack and we win. It\u2019s similar.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s just\u2026.there\u2019s some\u2026what\u2019s the book, The Art of War? This is the Art of War by Russell Brunson. That\u2019s the strategy, how it works. We\u2019ve talked before in a podcast, how you know when your opponents break. When you\u2019re out there wrestling someone, you push them and you feel, physically feel them break. Their energy stops, their posture, their whole body stops. That\u2019s when you attack harder and faster and bigger, that\u2019s how you beat people that are bigger and stronger than you.</p> <p>That\u2019s what happening and I hope you guys are enjoying watching it. I\u2019m having so much fun competing. I don\u2019t know about you but I love seeing the underdogs win. I love seeing the dude who\u2019s got better technique beat out the guy on steroids, every single time. I\u2019m calling my shot, that\u2019s the plan, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. I hope you guys do the same thing. Become aware of who your competitors are. You don\u2019t have to be jerks about it, I\u2019m probably too jerky sometimes, I apologize for that in advance. But be aware of it and understand that, and run this like a sport. If you do that, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to win.</p> <p>Because this playground, nobody cares. Nobody cares, I grew up in band, I grew up in drama, I grew up in whatever. Okay, well you\u2019re still competing against the athletes. And if the athletes want to win, they\u2019re going to win. So be very aware of that, going into it. When you\u2019re inside of it, start shifting your mindset to understand that and it\u2019ll become fun. It becomes a game, becomes a sport.</p> <p>I always tell people, this is one of the greatest sports ever. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s all I got for tonight. With that said, I\u2019m done. It\u2019s freezing cold out here, I\u2019m going to go inside and get warm. And for those of you guys going to Funnel Hacking Live in a week, I will see you soon. I cannot wait. Appreciate you all, and I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "16:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/309_-_The_Sport_We_Call_Business.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1486756807, "title": "Episode #308 \u2013 My Epiphany Bridge Origin Story", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A glimpse behind the scenes at what happened at this week\u2019s FHAT event.</p> <p>On this episode Russell tells his epiphany bridge story during a Facebook Live video at the FHAT (Funnel Hack-A-Thon) event.</p> <p>During his epiphany bridge story you will hear:</p> <ul> <li>What inspired Russell to try to make money online in the first place.</li> <li>How Russell and his partners first came up with an idea for Clickfunnels and it was really a way to get Russell to be able to design his own sites.</li> <li>And how Clickfunnels had made it possible for Russell to support his family, while also being able to spend more time with them.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear Russell\u2019s epiphany bridge story and let it inspire you.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey Everyone, this is Russell Brunson, welcome to Marketing In Your Car. I\u2019m at the office right now and it\u2019s been a crazy week. We had our first ever FHAT event here in our office the last 3 days. We were here all night every night and it was amazing. But I also haven\u2019t talked to you guys in a while, and I want to do something really quick because one of the big things we talked about at the FHAT event, well it was kind of 3 things.</p> <p>Day number one was cult building, I mean culture building. Day number two was story. And then Day three was webinars and webinar hacks and product launch sequences and Actionetics sequences and a whole bunch of other ninja, amazing stuff.</p> <p>But day two was story day, so we did this cool thing where we talked about the hero\u2019s two journeys and a bunch of other things. And I can\u2019t give you everything right now, but I want to give you one cool. So it\u2019s in the book that\u2019s coming out soon, to a funnel near you. After I talked about the Hero\u2019s two journeys, I showed them how we transition that script into the epiphany bridge script, and if you look at it, I wish I could show you, I wish the podcast could show pictures. Looking at it right now, the way this script works is basically, there\u2019s 8 sections.</p> <p>There\u2019s the back story, your desires, the wall, the epiphany, the plan, the conflict, achievement and transformation. So the back story, what is your back story that give us a vested interest in your journey? Number two is your desires, what is it that you want to accomplish? And inside of that, what are the external struggles you are dealing with and what are the internal struggles you are dealing with.</p> <p>From there you hit a wall. The wall is the problem or the\u2026what is the wall or problem that you hit within your current opportunity that started you on this new journey. Then you have the epiphany. So what was the epiphany experience and the new opportunity you discovered. Then the plan, what was the plan you created to achieve your desire? Then there\u2019s conflict. What was the conflict you experienced along the way? Then there\u2019s achievement, what was the end result you achieved. Then there\u2019s transformation. What was the transformation you experienced?</p> <p>So those are the process of telling a good epiphany bridge story. So anyway, I know it\u2019s hard to visualize that, but when you get the Expert Secrets book you\u2019ll see the graphs and images and it\u2019ll be all explained and you\u2019ll love it, I promise.</p> <p>But when we were here yesterday, or two days ago, whenever it was, the event. I did an epiphany bridge story on Facebook Live, telling my Clickfunnels story. So I wanted you guys to hear that story because it\u2019ll\u2026..going through all these aspects, you\u2019ll see them all weaved in. Everything from the back story, the desire, the wall, the epiphany, the plan, the conflict, the achievement and the transformation.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to get the audio and I\u2019ll plug it in here so you can listen to the audio of my epiphany bridge story, which is my Clickfunnels story, the origin story. The origin story of how I got excited about funnels and how Clickfunnels came to be. So I\u2019m going to play that audio for you right now, and you guys will hear my epiphany bridge story. So let me connect to that right now.</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell, I hope you guys are all doing awesome. So I\u2019m here right now in the room of 48 or 49 amazing entrepreneurs, and we\u2019ve been talking about storytelling and how to tell your story, the origin story of wehre you got started and what got you into what you\u2019re doing. So I\u2019ve been challenging all of them to go and do that, and I thought it would be kind of cool if I just told you guys my story. Some of you guys have heard pieces or parts of this, but probably not the whole thing.</p> <p>So what I wanted to do is share with you guys the story about Clickfunnels and why this, for me, became my new opportunity, the thing that I\u2019m so excited about and why I have so much passion. Some of you will say, \u201cRussell you\u2019ve been talking about Clickfunnels everyday for the last two years.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI know, because I\u2019m so excited every day.\u201d</p> <p>So some of the back story, if you don\u2019t know, I got started in this business, I guess it\u2019s almost 13 or 14 years ago now, and when I did, I was a college kid, I was going to Boise State University, which is just down the road from where I\u2019m at right now. I was a wrestler which means I wrestled and I had to go to school. So I barely graduated. It was barely. I think my accumulative was a 2.1, which means I got a whole bunch of C\u2019s and one B over 5 years, so it\u2019s kind of painful. But I graduated which made my mom happy, which is pretty cool.</p> <p>But during school, while I was wrestling I started learning about that internet marketing stuff. And you guys remember this is 12 years ago, before Facebook, before Instagram and all these kind of things. We had Google, kind of. In fact, I don\u2019t even remember how we were driving traffic. We didn\u2019t have a website, or anything. I was using Front Page, some of the old timers remember Front Page. I would create these things in Front Page and it was pretty bad. So I was doing that, but I believed that it was possible. I saw people, some of my mentors, like Arman Morin, Alex Mandossian and some of these guys who were making money online.</p> <p>I was like, if these guys can do it, I\u2019m pretty sure I could do it. So that was my goal that I wanted to accomplish. The other side of that that I don\u2019t share a lot of times, it wasn\u2019t just that I wanted to make money, that was just a desire I had. The bigger desire, I had just gotten married to my beautiful wife, we\u2019re still married today. It\u2019s been almost 15 years this year, which is amazing. I married here, she was working full time to support me, her jobless wrestling husband and I don\u2019t know about you, but I always envisioned that when I got married, I would be the man, the supporter, but it was honestly pretty tough for me. That she was supporting me and I didn\u2019t have anything to contribute other than going to school and wrestling, and it was hard for me.</p> <p>I remember I was like I got to figure out a way to contribute. I don\u2019t want her doing everything. So that was the real driving factor. In fact, my goal was, if I can make $1000 a month, that would match what she was making, we weren\u2019t making very much money at the time. Then I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m contributing as well. So that was my goal, to figure out a way to do this. I tried all sorts of stuff.</p> <p>I was trying Ebay, I was trying Craigslist, I was doing this stuff. I had a $20 a month, which was a big deal for me, I was excited, but none of the things really hit big. About that time I started learning about information marketing. In fact, I was at a post office mailing something I had bought from Ebay in this huge awkward box, I thought it was going to sell huge, and it ended up selling for $1.50 and I lost a ton of money. Then postage, it was a nightmare. I\u2019m sitting in the line at the post office next to this dude, who had a big box full of CD\u2019s, thousands of them. I was like, \u201cDude, what are you selling?\u201d and he was like, \u201cI have one CD that I sell and I burn it.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cThese are your orders for the month.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cThese are my orders for this week.\u201d I was doing the math, \u201chow much do you sell them for?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201c$67\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d And I had this\u2026..I need to sell information, that is the future.</p> <p>So I started to try to figure out information. I started doing stuff and my very first product I ever created was a DVD on how to create potato guns, I\u2019m sure some of you guys have heard this story before. So I started making potato guns and it was working really good, but then what I was doing was going to Google and buying ads on Google and making some money back and forth, but eventually I probably had 4 or 5 months of success and then Google changed their algorithm and it got really hard.</p> <p>And the hardest thing for me during this time, it was me building things in Front Page, and I had to figure out how to FTP pages and images and how to go to Paypal to get the order, it was super techy and I\u2019m not a techy person at all. But after Google changed their algorithm we tried some stuff. I remember one of my friends called me, it was Mike Filsaime, some of you may know Mike, he said, \u201cRussell, I figured out how to make this whole internet marketing game work again.\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cIs your potato gun thing still making money?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t break even, I can\u2019t make a profit.\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019s like, \u201cwell I went back to all my sites and added these things.\u201d He called them OTO\u2019s and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat\u2019s an OTO\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s an upsell, a onetime offer.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI added these upsells and people started buying the upsells and suddenly I\u2019m making two or three times as much money from everything I sold. And I was like, \u201cI could actually do that.\u201d</p> <p>So I remember jumping online I was Googling potato guns, trying to figure out what my upsell would be, I don\u2019t know. All I had was a potato gun DVD, and I met this dude up in northern Idaho who actually made potato guns and drop shipped them. I was like, \u201cDude, if I sell those, would you drop ship them for me?\u201d and he was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019d love to not have to sell these things.\u201d So I partnered with him and I started selling the DVD\u2019s and people started buying this upsell. And it was the first thing I\u2019d made a funnel. I was like, this is a funnel.</p> <p>And that was this new thing and I was so excited. So I had this epiphany, this is the future. If I can make more funnels, this funnels been making me 20-30 bucks a day, but what if I had 2 funnels, or 3 or 5 or 10? So I started going a little bit crazy and I created funnels in the couponing market, which by the way, is a horrible market. People in that market do not like to spend money. Don\u2019t do that. We did couponing, we did dating, we did weight loss, we did network marketing, I\u2019ve done diabetic supplements. That\u2019s the ones on the top of my head, there\u2019s\u2026..I could show you guys, there\u2019s a trail of thousands of offers, some that worked, a lot more that didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>But we were doing these things over and over and my plan was if I had ten of them that are each making a hundred bucks a day, or 20 or 30. So I was doing this, and at first it was working but the problem I kept running into was, Front page isn\u2019t\u2026. for people like me it was hard. I would do these pages and mine looked ugly and other people\u2019s looked awesome. So then I had a designer and he would design these things. I would make a front page ugly, send it to him and he would design it and make it look cool. I\u2019m like, put it up.</p> <p>But then it was up and I couldn\u2019t do anything, I couldn\u2019t touch it again. I had one shot. Then I had to bug him. Then I hired a web guy to do edits for me. Then I was using Paypal and I couldn\u2019t do anything else. So then someone invented a one click upsell. I was like, \u201cDude, I need that.\u201d So I hired a programmer to connect that into the next\u2026.it kept getting more and more complicated to the point where soon I wasn\u2019t able to do anything.</p> <p>I would look at it and be like, \u201cChange that.\u201d And they\u2019d try to change it, but they didn\u2019t. I\u2019d be like, \u201cMove it over here.\u201d And they\u2019d put it in the wrong spot. It would take days, sometimes weeks of going back and forth with the guys in Romania and India and everywhere to try to get them to move an image or make it a little bit bigger. Things that were so common sense and I couldn\u2019t actually do it, and it drove me nuts.</p> <p>About that time, one of my friends and partners, in fact, he might be in the room right now. Is Todd in here still? He\u2019s already eating lunch, he\u2019s already gone. Todd was one of my partners doing these things with me. He saw my frustration and he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat if we build something that\u2026\u201d and the joke was, \u201cRussell could edit the website and actually move things and quit bugging us all the time.\u201d I was like, \u201cThat would be awesome.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to create.\u201d</p> <p>And that day we sat in front of a whiteboard and started mapping out what it would look like and how it would work. So we mapped out this vision of what became Clickfunnels, and he went home and actually built it. It was funny, him and another partner we brought in, Dylan Jones were working, he did the editor. They would build part of it and be like, \u201cWe need to make this so simple that Russell could do it.\u201d So they\u2019d do it and be like, \u201cRussell, test this.\u201d And I\u2018d login and be like, \u201cHow do I do it?\u201d And they\u2019d be like, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell you. You gotta figure it out on your own.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019d do some stuff, and if I could figure it out, then good. We got it. If I got stuck, I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know what to do. So they\u2019re like, we didn\u2019t do it intuitively enough. We went back and forth and back and forth for 6 or 7 months and finally I got it. I was like, if I can do this, anyone can. At first it was a tool for me, that was the initial goal of Clickfunnels. I think it was Todd and Dylan like, \u201cThis way Russell will quit bugging and I don\u2019t have to design his sites anymore or redo his headers.\u201d All this stuff that was happening. And then after I started using it and I was having success, I was like, \u201cWe have to make this a tool for everyone, it will free all entrepreneurs like it freed me.\u201d</p> <p>So because of that I was able to create funnels quickly. I went from having 5 or 6 guys, and it would take on average almost 2-3 months every time to create a funnel to where I was able to do it by myself in an hour, hour and a half. Sometimes less, which was cool. The cool thing was I was able to achieve that and have success. We started rolling out funnels like crazy. Some of you probably remember seeing a lot of them.</p> <p>I still do a lot of them because they\u2019re so much fun to do. But the cooler thing for me was the other side. I was able to make money to support my wife and support my kids because I didn\u2019t no longer have to spend three months doing something, my time to be with my kids completely freed up. I have a chance, I go home everyday and play with my kids. I\u2019m not stressing out trying to talk to programmers in India at 3 in the morning and stressing all this stuff. It just works.</p> <p>That was really the biggest thing for me. And it\u2019s been an amazing thing. In fact, now my kids are using Clickfunnels, they\u2019re building stuff with Clickfunnels. It\u2019s not just, for me it\u2019s not just a product. It\u2019s a mission. I\u2019m seeing people\u2019s lives change. I\u2019m seeing other people who had messages but they couldn\u2019t get them out because they couldn\u2019t move things around on the stupid page, but now the power is back in their hand. And that\u2019s the power of it. That\u2019s what fires me up, to be able to help entrepreneurs with that kind of thing.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my Clickfunnels Story. So if you guys haven\u2019t heard it before, I wanted to share that with you guys and share why I\u2019m so passionate about this.

I hope you guys are doing awesome. I\u2019m driving to go get my hair cut and this is kind of like the climax, well it\u2019s the end when you slide down. Almost the end, I guess it\u2019s not even though. Anyway, the end of a very crazy week. It\u2019s now Friday. In about an hour we have Boise State does a really cool thing once a year called the Beauty and the Beast tournament. Where they have the wrestlers and the gymnasts all competing on the same floor. And it\u2019s the one time of the year that people actually show up to wrestling matches, which is cool.</p> <p>I convinced my wife and kids to come and some of my friends and all that kind of stuff, so we\u2019re heading to that tonight. I competed in it for four years and it\u2019s just a super fun thing to do. So I\u2019m going to that tonight which is exciting. I\u2019m getting my hair cut because this is the little calm, that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s not the climax or apex, it\u2019s the calm before the storm. Because for the second storm. There was a big storm first. This last week has been insane.</p> <p>Let me explain to you, lest you think you had a busy week. Maybe it was busier than mine, but I\u2019m game for comparing and seeing because this week was crazy. Monday we moved into a new office and then Tuesday I had to submit my book to the publishers, which sounds like you just email your book to the publisher. But no, you have to freaking write a book first and then edit it and edit it, change things, tweak things, and then you submit it and its final, can never change it\u2019s the end. So you can never tweak it, ever. So that was stressful.</p> <p>And then Steven Larsen, who is working with this even starting Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday called the FHAT Event. Funnel Hack A Thon, FHAT Event. We needed a manual for that, which the manual is based on the book. So he was home sick, puking in bed while he\u2019s helping me create this whole manual. Bless him for doing that while he\u2019s puking his guts out. Making the manual and puking and making the manual because we had these printing deadlines to get it done. So we\u2019re racing on that, got that all figured out as good as we possibly could.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m going through getting my power point slides and then I walked into the conference room that we\u2019re doing the conference, and the echo is so loud, it\u2019s going to destroy all the films, it won\u2019t even be good. So I\u2019m freaking out there, so we have to go and I\u2019m searching all night until 2 or 3 in the morning trying to find sound things you can put up to make echoes disappear. The only place I can find, the fastest I can get them here is 2 to 4 weeks. I\u2019m not going to have them for Monday and I\u2019m stressing out. Then Brandon Fisher on our team,\u00a0 he\u2019s like, \u201cI got a buddy who does events and stuff and he\u2019s got these sound dampering curtains, we should use those.\u201d So I\u2019m like, \u201cAlright.\u201d So he comes and shows up and wraps our entire room in these huge curtains, throws these lights on them, brings a stage and a pulpit, and it becomes the coolest event center on planet earth.</p> <p>And then they\u2019re trying to rent us stuff, it will look so cool. I\u2019m begging them to let me buy it all. I never want this to change ever because it\u2019s so cool now. It turned into a good thing. I was stressing out about that. This whole week they\u2019ve been working on that and getting the lighting and the systems and things, and I\u2019m just trying to get my power points done. Then on top of that, there\u2019s other business things, it\u2019s been nuts.</p> <p>So today I got my power points probably half way done for the event that starts on Monday. I\u2019m just out today, going to get my haircut and then Beauty and the Beast and then tonight keep working on power points, I\u2019m guessing if I\u2019m going to get done in time, which is crazy. Steven had drill so he\u2019s out driving to go do Army drill stuff, and he\u2019s got to work on stuff for the presentation as well. So he\u2019s going to be working on those tonight form the hotel and sending those to me.</p> <p>And then, I didn\u2019t realize, stupid me, that the Funnel Hack A Thon was the day after the Superbowl, so everyone that\u2019s coming, we have 48 people that are coming. Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cDo you know it\u2019s the Superbowl? Why did you book it on Superbowl Sunday?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t watch the Superbowl.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWe need a party.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay fine, we\u2019ll throw a party.\u201d So now I\u2019m throwing a party at the office Sunday for the Superbowl, which means to get TV in the office, I say yes and then I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay we\u2019re going to watch the Superbowl on this screen and they\u2019re like, \u201cthat\u2019s not easy, you have to have cable.\u201d So now they\u2019re scrambling to get cable in our office to be able to show the game.</p> <p>And then, it\u2019s just thing after thing. We had this nice fridge and we\u2019ve stacked it full of waters and Redbulls and drinks and all sorts of stuff, and then the whole thing collapsed this fridge because the bolts weren\u2019t strong enough and we had to buy new bolts and string them in to get the water to stay. It\u2019s seriously been insane. I just wanted to thank, if anyone on my team is listening, everyone with everything that\u2019s gone into this, because it\u2019s been nuts. But somehow, not only are we surviving, it\u2019s been fun and everyone\u2019s happy. We\u2019re excited and energy levels are really high.</p> <p>It\u2019s one of those things where maybe it\u2019s me and I know people have ADD like me, the more things that are happening, the better we function. A lot of times if you have one thing going on, you stress out like crazy. So maybe it\u2019s that and that\u2019s why I\u2019m enjoying it and thriving in this. Because there\u2019s so much chaos I can\u2019t not do it. But maybe it\u2019s just a fact that just smiling, keep moving forward, maybe that\u2019s the message for today is, if you keep moving forward, you can\u2019t change anything. I can\u2019t change the fact that the event is happening in two days. I made that decision and it was probably a dumb decision. Especially since we have Funnel Hacking Live two weeks later and I haven\u2019t started on my presentations for that yet.</p> <p>But besides the point of stupidly planning like I often do, things can\u2019t change. You\u2019re going to do it anyway. I think I\u2019ve shared this story with you before. I had a wrestling coach named Mark James when I was growing up. I remember this one practice, it was tough. At the time I was cutting about 30 pounds a week, it was painful, horrible and hard. We\u2019re all cutting weight and I remember one day after practice, I was dead. Imagine wrestling in plastics and sweats and not eating for three or four days and not drinking for three or four and just being to the point where you felt like you wished you could die.</p> <p>And I remember we finished practice and he pulls us all into this, our wrestling room, we called it the rubber room. It was underneath the basketball court. It was dark and damp and stinky and it was kind of nasty. So he pulled us out of the rubber room into this hallway, that was again underneath the building. It was dark. And he sat on the stairs and we all sat around and talked. And I remember him saying, \u201cYou know what, we have a match and you have to lose weight.\u201d And he\u2019s telling everyone this, and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou can\u2019t change that, the only thing you can change is your attitude about it. You\u2019re going to miserable going through this experience or you can be happy going through this experience, but you can\u2019t change it. The experience is happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing we can effect is the attitude we have going through it. So you might as well have a good attitude, because you\u2019re going to do it anyway.\u201d\u00a0 And it really, I was like, \u201cDang.\u201d So I remember the next day I came down and I put on my plastics and sweats on and came out and started jumping ropes. And I started smiling.</p> <p>And one of the other guys on my team came down and was like, \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d And I was like, \u201cHave you ever seen someone lose with a smile on their face?\u201d and he was like, \u201cNo.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNeither have I.\u201d and I kept smiling. And then I smiled the whole practice while I was cutting weight, I smiled while I was doing it. And it was weird because this process that legitimately painful. If you\u2019ve ever tried to not drink for three days while sucking water weight out in plastic suits. Where you\u2019re losing, on average, 25 to 30 pounds a week in water weight. That\u2019s painful. That\u2019s probably some of the worst pain I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life. But I did it with a smile on my face and it became a thing, and it became fun and it became a part of the experience I actually enjoyed.</p> <p>In fact, tonight going to the wrestling match, I can feel myself right now, feeling guilty. I always feel guilty sitting there drinking something. I shouldn\u2019t be watching wrestling with liquid. This is a really awkward feeling, you know what I mean? But that\u2019s the reality. I\u2019m not wrestling, I\u2019m not competing so I can. Take that wrestlers that are cutting weight. But going through the experience, it became fun.</p> <p>So I think for you guys, there\u2019s a lot of stress out there, I get it. But as you approach it, do it with a smile on your face. Because you can\u2019t lose with a smile on your face. No one can, it\u2019s impossible. So you might as well smile as you go through it. Remember, you\u2019re going to go through it anyway, so the only thing you can change is your attitude, so have a good attitude and make it more fun and pleasant for you and for everyone.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I got today you guys. I\u2019m here, getting my haircut, my head will shrink by about half, which is a good sign. Because I got a huge fat head, if you\u2019ve ever noticed. I can\u2019t wear hats, because my head is so\u2026\u2026.if you guys remember the movie so I married an Axe Murderer. And that kid\u2019s sitting in front of the TV with his dad, Michael Meyers. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, get out of the way. Man, did you see that kid\u2019s head? It\u2019s like an orange on a toothpick.\u201d That\u2019s totally how I am right now. So if you\u2019re envisioning what I look like, I got an orange on a toothpick, so they\u2019re going to shave this thing down to be normal size, which I\u2019m really looking forward to.</p> <p>Alright guys, before I tell you anymore random weird things about me, I\u2019m going to leave. I appreciate you all, have an amazing day. Keep a smile on, and remember you can only change your attitude. Thanks everybody, talk to you soon.</p> <p>Ps\u2026Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re just one funnel away, thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "10:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/307_-_You_Cant_Lose_With_A_Smile_On_Your_Face.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1486077799, "title": "Episode #306 \u2013 The Strangest Secret", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My cliffnotes from Earl Nightengale\u2019s speech, The Strangest Secret.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the book, The Strangest Secret by Earl Nightengale.

Welcome to Marketing Behind Your Desk. My commute from my house to my office is like 10 seconds now so I don\u2019t know how to keep Marketing In Your Car, we may have to change the title or something. But I\u2019m here and I\u2019ve got something cool for you guys.</p> <p>So when we moved from the office, we moved our books all onto one really cool bookshelf. As I was putting up all the books I was like, \u201cI want to read this book and this book.\u201d So as I\u2019ve been coming in I\u2019ve been grabbing different books. So today I grabbed, The Strangest Secret by Earl Nightengale. And I don\u2019t know if you guys have ever heard of this book but it\u2019s the beginning, the foundation of the personal development industry. I\u2019m pretty sure he wrote this book, I think it was a record back in the day, and then that\u2019s what sprouted out all personal development. So it\u2019s kind of like the beginning.</p> <p>I just heard a beep in the office, do you think it\u2019s the fire alarm. Oh crap, good thing Steven is packing heat, my body guards here packing heat. He\u2019s literally on his elbows crawling out to go kill somebody and protect us from imminent danger and doom.</p> <p>Anyway, while he\u2019s trying to kill these people I\u2019m going to give you guys a message about the Strangest Secret. First off, if you haven\u2019t read this, the book is like 15 pages, so you can read it in a very short period of time or you can try to find the record. I wonder if I can find the record on Ebay, that\u2019d be cool.</p> <p>Anyway, in this book he\u2019s talking about the fact that\u2026.well he\u2019s talking about, and this is written way back in the day, this is a long time ago. But he\u2019s talking about how if you look at people that are over 65 that at the time, there were 14 million people. Of that 14 million, 13 million were broke and relying on other people. He said it\u2019s amazing that by the time that you\u2019re seven you learn how to read, you can make a living by the time you\u2019re 25, but the majority of people by the age of 65 had not learned to be financially independent.</p> <p>That\u2019s crazy, how is that not happening? And then he talked about what\u2019s the definition of success? And he said the definition of success is not that you achieve something, but the definition is the pursuit of that. So the pursuit of something is success. So it says the only man who succeeds is the man who is progressing, realizing a worthy ideal. So if you\u2019re pursuing something, that\u2019s the definition of success. It\u2019s not so much that you have it, it\u2019s that you\u2019re going forward.</p> <p>I should almost just read you guys the whole book, it\u2019d only take 15 minutes. Probably less than that actually. But I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise. I want you guys to go and find it on Ebay or Amazon or whatever and get it. It\u2019ll be worth it.</p> <p>Anyway, he\u2019s talking about, the next chapter is all about goals. He says, the key here is goals, setting goals and moving towards those goals. He talked about how if you take a boat with the crew and captain and they say, this is where we\u2019re going, 99.99% of the time, they get there. If you took a boat, took the crew off and the captain and just set it on the harbor and pushed it out, 0% of the time, would it ever get there. Yet, that\u2019s how most people function their life.</p> <p>They wake up and they\u2019re walking and stumbling and things like that. One thing, I don\u2019t know if I can find it real quick in here. He said, it was super cool\u2026.This is what he said, that society was not set up to keep people from winning. Society was set up to keep people from losing. It\u2019s like, if you look at the American society it doesn\u2019t really care if people are winning or whatever, it\u2019s trying to set it up so people don\u2019t lose. So it becomes super simple. It\u2019s easy to get a job. It\u2019s easy to make enough money to survive.</p> <p>And he says why do people not succeed? The reason why people don\u2019t succeed is because they conform. The conforming is the opposite of success, which is so interesting. So it\u2019s not, I wonder if I can find the quote right here where he said it? \u201cThe opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice, a lot of people think that the opposite of being encouraging and going forward is being a coward. No, it\u2019s not. The opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice, its conformity.\u201d</p> <p>So it\u2019s conforming to the world around us. Conforming to that and then, he said, the government, the world way it\u2019s structured is to protect people from failing, that\u2019s why everything is so easy. Because of that we have to conform to do that. So then 99% of the population conforms. People get jobs so they cannot fail, so they can get a steady paycheck or whatever that means. It\u2019s not just for money, but for anything in life.</p> <p>I think about wrestling, let\u2019s say you\u2019re doing sports. It\u2019s way easier to kind of go through the motions than it is to try and win. So there\u2019s conforming and doing the normal whatever anyone is doing is the lowest thing. Anyway, it\u2019s hard to tell a book that you just barely read.</p> <p>Anyway, it kind of goes on from there. Success and goals and he said this is the key to success. The key to success, we become what we think about. Let me say that again, we become what we think about. And then he goes through and starts talking about all these different quotes from different people. Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cA man is what he thinks about all day long.\u201d William James \u201cA great discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their life by altering the attitudes of their mind.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s got quote after quote after quote all these people. Shakespeare, \u201cOur doubts are traitors that make us lose the good we oft win by fearing to attempt.\u201d On and on. All these things come down to, we are what we think about all day long. And that is the Strangest Secret. That\u2019s kind of the key.</p> <p>So at the very end it says, \u201cWe become what we think about. That is the strangest secret in the world. Now why do I say it\u2019s strange and why do I say it\u2019s a secret? Actually it isn\u2019t a secret at all,\u00a0 it the first..\u201d there\u2019s a big word that not in our vocabulary now a days, \u201c the first \u2018something\u2019 by some of the earliest wise men and it appears again and again throughout the bible, but every few people who have learned it, understand it and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a secret and for some equally strange reason, it virtually remains a secret.\u201d</p> <p>So kind of the message of this book and hopefully this podcast for today, is a couple of things. First off, it\u2019s what are you thinking about? What\u2019s the goal? What\u2019s the thing you\u2019re driving towards every single day? And if you don\u2019t have that you\u2019re just like the boat that\u2019s wandering and going to crash.</p> <p>And the second part of this is understanding that just conforming to the standard is the reason why the majority of the population by the time they\u2019re 65 have not learned financial independence. 65 years is not how long, it shouldn\u2019t take that long to learn and master financial independence. You should learn that earlier in life, but because it\u2019s easier just to conform and just to slip back to doing the status quo. And just doing what it takes to not lose, which is what our whole society is built upon. Most people go that way.</p> <p>So for you guys here listening to this podcast, I know that\u2019s not what any of you guys want. So it comes back down to setting a goal. What do you want? Where are you going? Having a very clear path and thinking about it, visualizing and figuring out how to get there. If you, man, low and behold you get there.</p> <p>Like I said, it\u2019s weird that 99.99% of the boats that set a destination get there, same with airplanes. There\u2019s a tiny fraction that crash and burn, but mostly if they\u2019ve got a direction and a destination they\u2019re going, they get there. And I think it\u2019s the same thing for you guys, if you\u2019ve got that.</p> <p>What\u2019s your destination? Where are you going? If you\u2019ve got that and you\u2019re thinking about it and it becomes the thing you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll get there. And it\u2019s not that hard, you just gotta think about it and then work to make that thing become a reality. So that\u2019s what I got for today you guys.</p> <p>The Strangest Secret by Earl Nightengale, I think they said that this where the secret, the movie The Secret, came from. Which, that movie is a little cheesy, not going to lie. Conceptually it\u2019s pretty cool. But then it\u2019s like, I just remember the one scene when the guys like, \u201cYeah, I thought about, I wanted a coffee and someone brought me some coffee.\u201d That\u2019s not what this is talking about, that\u2019s stupid.</p> <p>This is talking about what do I want in my life? And I want to be able to see it visually and then I go and chase it. For me, I remember when I got started in this business, 13, 14 years ago now, I saw people ahead of me. For me, my first mentors were like, Armand Morin and John Reese, Marlon Sanders, Jonathon Mizel. These are the guys that I saw initially and I saw what they were doing and I was like, that\u2019s what I want. I need that. I gotta figure that out.</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t easy. Conformity is easy. And it\u2019s not what they say. I mean it\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s worth it. That\u2019s definitely the thing. Same thing, that was my goal. So I started looking what Armand was doing. I was modeling him. If you look at my first 3 or 4 sites, they were identical to Armand\u2019s. I funnel hacked him as close as humanly possible. My sites, Armand always had a picture of his head on the header, so I always had a picture of my head on the header. I just modeled him identical because it was Armand. That\u2019s who I wanted to be like.</p> <p>I had a vision and that\u2019s where I was going. And then at my very first big seminar, that\u2019s the first time I saw people speak and sell from stage and I was like, \u201choly crap.\u201d I remember seeing this dude get on stage and he does his pitch and people run to the back of the room and I was doing the math, he made 50 thousand dollars in 90 minutes. I saw the next guy and the next guy. They did 130 thousand dollars in sales. Thing after thing after thing. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to speak. I\u2019m scared to death of people and getting on stage. But that thing, that skill, I gotta learn that.\u201d So that became the destination. For the next three years of my life I learned how to speak and sell from stage.</p> <p>It was hard. It was not easy. It was embarrassing. The first ten or fifteen times I got on stage I did my pitch and nobody would move. That\u2019s humiliating. It sucked, it was so embarrassing. But I knew where I was going, so I\u2019m like, \u201cI gotta get there because that skill, if I can get that skill, holy crap that\u2019d be cool.\u201d So I stood up in front of 100 people, 500 people, 600 people and I did the thing. And then I crashed and burned. I was so embarrassed.</p> <p>I remember, I think I told you this before. The first time I was so embarrassed because usually when you speak all the other speakers that are selling from the stage will be like, \u201cHey, how did you do? What were your numbers? How many did you close?\u201d So I did my pitch and nobody bought. It was like the walk of shame to the back of the room. Everyone was waiting, just not running to the back and buying. I was so embarrassed and I didn\u2019t want to talk to the other speakers, the promoter, the other attendees, I was humiliated.</p> <p>So I went to my room and I still remember, I had never before rented a movie on TV in a hotel room before, so I went to the movie section and I started movies. And I watched movies for 3 days. Every movie that was there that I felt comfortable watching, I watched. I remember ordering coconut shrimp and Haagan Dazs ice cream every hour on the hour. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m not leaving this place. I want to eat.\u201d Because it was so humiliating. But I knew where I wanted to go. I knew the destiny. I gotta figure this thing out because people are doing it and they can\u2019t be that much smarter than me. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re more talented than me, but they can\u2019t be that much smarter than me. I just gotta figure it out. So I kept doing it and doing it and eventually I got to that destination.</p> <p>So for you guys, find the destination, set the goals, think about it all the time, go read the Strangest Secret. It\u2019s literally a 5 minute read. It\u2019ll take you less time to read than it was to listen to this podcast. That\u2019s all I got you guys. With that said, I appreciate you all, have a great day and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "12:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/306_-_The_Strangest_Secret.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485976112, "title": "Episode #305 \u2013 Are You Watching The Magician\u2019s Hands?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A quick glimpse behind the WHY of this funnel\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell goes on a mini tour of his new office and podcasts from two conference rooms and the kitchen. He talks about how you need to watch a magician\u2019s hands to figure out what he\u2019s doing, and how that relates to being a marketer.</p> <p>Here are some of the cool things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What it means to be a magician in marketing.</li> <li>Why Russell buys other people\u2019s products that he doesn\u2019t need, and why you should buy his Marketing In Your Car MP3 player, even if you don\u2019t need it.</li> <li>And why it\u2019s good to grow a business organically, but it\u2019s better to push it along faster by buying ads.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why you need to be looking at a magicians hands instead of getting distracted by what he wants you to see.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>What\u2019s up everybody, this is Russell, welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Now this is a special episode because I\u2019m not in my car. In fact, I\u2019m at the brand new office. We moved in this week and it\u2019s insanely cool and I\u2019m not only in the office, I\u2019m in an actual conference room, which is the first thing I\u2019ve done in this conference room is actually talk on this podcast. I\u2019m looking out and everybody is working. We all have standing and sitting desks. So everybody out here working standing and sitting. So exciting.</p> <p>Anyway, if you haven\u2019t seen yet, I\u2019ve been Snapchatting and I\u2019ll probably Facebook Live Friday. Friday we get the big Clickfunnels sign in the office, which looks so cool. So as soon as that\u2019s here I\u2019ll Facebook Live this whole place so you guys can see it. You can see the bookshelf and everything.</p> <p>What\u2019s cool, Monday and Tuesday we had a certification event here in Boise. We were supposed to do it here in the office initially, but we didn\u2019t think we were going to get the office done in time, so we moved it back to a hotel. Then Tuesday, at certification I make everyone do a hack-a-thon, which they stay up\u00a0 all night building funnels. Part of the cult-ture that we\u2019re trying to do is you need to get crap done, you just pull an all nighter and just get it done. So we taught them that and they did it.</p> <p>And then on Tuesday they went and presented all their funnels and everything and we gave away awards and it was cool. Tuesday morning I woke up like, man these guys have been killing themselves. How cool would be if they actually got to come to the office. So we chartered a bus, had the bus drive to downtown Boise, pick them up and bring them back. And now they\u2019re\u2026\u2026.</p> <p>Anyway, they came to the office last night and it was so much fun to have everyone here and showing off the new stuff. People were like, \u201cIs that really your bookshelf? Are those all your books?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m kind of a nerd. Sorry about that.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, it was so much fun. So now, today we\u2019re here. This is the first day we\u2019ll actually work the whole day. Everybody\u2019s here and it\u2019s exciting. One big fear I have is we have our FHAT event coming up Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday next week in the big conference room which is amazing. But it\u2019s got echo. I don\u2019t know if you hear echo in here. This is the conference room and it\u2019s kind of echo in here as well. We have a sound engineer coming to try to figure out how to put up paneling and stuff so we won\u2019t have those issues. But the problem is it\u2019s like 2 to 4 weeks to get those things fixed. So that kind of stresses me out a little bit on that side. Hopefully we get some of it figured out. We\u2019ve got people coming and they\u2019re going to be hanging up sound panels and things like that in the conference room.</p> <p>Anyway, someone just came in the conference room so I\u2019m going to walk out here. Now I\u2019m going into the kitchen. The kitchen also has got a lot of echo in here as well. But we designed this because we do a lot of videos in the kitchen, so we made it a really nice kitchen so we can do videos and stuff in here. So it should be pretty office.</p> <p>So now I\u2019m wandering. So fun to wander around the office, now I\u2019m in the conference room. So anyway, I wish you guys could see what I\u2019m doing, probably more interesting than hearing me talk about it. But it\u2019s so exciting.</p> <p>So what I want to talk about today, yesterday the Marketing In Your Car free MP3 player offer, we were paying affiliates $20 to give away a free MP3 player, and I think it ended last night at midnight. It\u2019s been fun watching a lot of our affiliates promote it and then seeing people\u2019s feedback. Tim Castleman, one of my buddies, he\u2019s been promoting it. He\u2019s like, \u201cJust go buy it, you guys. Why are you not buying it?\u201d and people are commenting why they\u2019re not buying it. It made me laugh so hard. These are all people trying to learn marketing. And they\u2019re trying to figure this whole thing out. They\u2019re studying, learning, following Tim, following me, following people and they\u2019re like, \u201cthat offer didn\u2019t make sense to me. I don\u2019t really want an MP3 player. I need to subscribe for free on iTunes.\u201d All these things, all these reasons why they wouldn\u2019t buy.</p> <p>It made me laugh because we\u2019ve sold a lot of them. I think we\u2019ve sold, we\u2019re almost at 4 thousand sold, which is cool. What we\u2019re finding is for every single person who\u2019s buying an MP3 player, probably 5 or 6 people are subscribing to the podcast, even if they\u2019re not buying. So if you watch, I don\u2019t know if you guys are watching, but if you go to iTunes right now, and you go to the business section, we\u2019ve been in the top ten ever since this thing has launched. The business section is hard to get in the top ten.</p> <p>Tony Robins is not in the top ten. Eric Ward is not in the top ten. All these legends are not in the top ten. Neil Patel is not in the top ten, we\u2019ve been in the top ten for the last 2 or 3 weeks now. And it\u2019s like, I want, since you guys are my best people. You\u2019re hanging out, you\u2019re here listening, I want to reveal, show the curtain, behind the scenes of what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>You know how they say, magicians are doing a trick, but he\u2019s distracting you with stuff so you don\u2019t see what\u2019s actually happening, so you don\u2019t see his hands move when he\u2019s doing whatever that thing is that makes the trick possible. So he\u2019s doing misdirection stuff and leading you places and stuff like that. With marketing, it\u2019s kind of fun, my job. Most businesses is, it\u2019s like you\u2019re doing marketing, selling your product. Whereas, I\u2019m doing marketing, selling my stuff. But for those who are watching, I\u2019m hoping you are watching. Watching my hands, watching what the magician is actually doing because that\u2019s the most valuable lesson.</p> <p>Me giving my MP3 player, pre-loaded episodes is kind of a cool little thing, but why did I do that. Why am I doing that? What\u2019s the magician actually doing and watching that. I always tell people, I buy everybody\u2019s products. Usually I do not go through most of the products, but I\u2019m buying because I want to see what the magicians are doing. What do they learn? If you saw the stuff I\u2019m buying. You\u2019d be like, \u201cRussell, why are you buying another weight loss course?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cBecause the weight loss dudes are really good at funnels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you buying a thing on stocks? You don\u2019t even know what the stock market is?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI know, I have no idea how to do stocks. I don\u2019t even want to know how to do stocks. But the stock guys are really good at funnels, so I want to watch what they\u2019re doing.\u201d I want to see what the magician is doing. So for those who are listening and those who are paying attention, and I hope you guys are paying attention, is watch these processes. Don\u2019t say, \u201cI didn\u2019t buy Russell\u2019s MP3 player because I don\u2019t want an MP3 player. I\u2019d never listen to it anyway.\u201d Dude there\u2019s a lesson here.</p> <p>I\u2019m not just doing these things for fun. I\u2019m creating things and testing things and if they\u2019re working, you\u2019ll see me keep pushing them and keep pushing them. I look at right now, our podcast has grown insanely over the last little bit. We\u2019re in the top ten, we\u2019re consistently in the top ten, which is amazing. We\u2019re getting tons of, I mean tens of thousands of downloads a day, which is amazing. And it\u2019s because these things we\u2019re doing, if you\u2019re not watching, if you\u2019re not looking you will miss it.</p> <p>It was kind of cool, I did a podcast interview last week with Paul Colligan, who\u2019s the podcasting guy and he\u2019ll be, I think it goes live to day. And Paul is someone who\u2019s watching the magician. He messaged me like, \u201cDude, I\u2019ve seen your podcast funnel, I gotta know what and why.\u201d It was really cool. A really cool podcast with him, kind of explaining. All of his followers are podcasters. Podcasters are out there and they\u2019re trying to create good content to organically grow.</p> <p>And I\u2019m like, \u201cOrganic growth is good, but it\u2019s hard.\u201d I did a podcast every day for 3 years. We had 300+ episodes while I was organically growing it, it was good, we got followers, we got traction, but it wasn\u2019t until I created something that I could stimulate with paid ads that it grew dramatically.</p> <p>So for you guys, looking at that, look I can go on a blog all day long, but if I can\u2019t stimulate with paid ads, man that\u2019s a long time. Same with podcasting or whatever it is for you. But for this funnel, for the one you guys went through, a lot of you guys to get here. That was the vehicle, was the podcasting funnel. And it was a way for me to be able to pay for ads. And he, Paul basically was like, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that can do this. You\u2019re the only person that can pay for subscribers profitably.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, because of the model.\u201d Anyway, I hoping you guys again, are watching the magician\u2019s hand. Because prior to that we\u2019d try to grow Marketing In Your Car and what we were doing is we were buying Facebook ads, trying to get people to subscribe. I\u2019d ask John, \u201cHow many subscribers did we get from the Facebook ads?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI have no idea. There\u2019s no way to track it through iTunes.\u201d He was like, \u201cI\u2019m basically just crossing my fingers and hoping that somebody subscribes.\u201d We have no way to track it and test it. We\u2019re just dumping money at it and crossing our fingers. That\u2019s a horrible way to do business, stupidest thing in the world. That\u2019s what branding guys do. That\u2019s what companies that are backed by VC cash do. They just burn cash and they\u2019re stupid.</p> <p>Funnel hackers like us, we\u2019re smarter. We\u2019re looking at the ROI and it\u2019s like, I had to create this thing to be able to create the ROI. So what\u2019s cool about it, right now we\u2019re driving traffic through these funnels. We\u2019re paying affiliates $20 to give away a free MP3 player. But we know our metrics and we\u2019re profitable on the front end. I think we\u2019re close to about $30, might be a little lower than that. Somewhere around $30 we\u2019re making. And we\u2019re spending $20 to affiliates, but our ads are making about $10 \u2013 15 to sell an MP3 player.</p> <p>If you look at that, we pay for the ads, we pay affiliates, get the MP3 player, we\u2019re profitable so we actually make a little money there. Not a lot, but enough to cover our costs. Then after we\u2019ve covered those costs, like I said, a big percentage of people come to the page, never buy the MP3 player, but then subscribe to the podcast.</p> <p>And everyone who\u2019s, again iTunes doesn\u2019t give us the best numbers possible. But based on my guestimations, for every single person that\u2019s subscribing to, or that\u2019s buying the MP3 player, we\u2019re getting 4 or 5 people that are subscribing to the podcast as well. So I\u2019m paying for that growth profitably. It doesn\u2019t cost me anything.</p> <p>So anyway, I just wanted to kind of lay that out for the guys who are paying attention and just thinking through that. Because organic is good, but if I could stimulate that with paid and be profitable with it, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s how I build a company fast. That\u2019s how I do it without VC cash and all the other crap we\u2019ve been told you need to do to build a company. You don\u2019t if you\u2019re smart, the market will back you. They\u2019ll cover for you.\u00a0 That\u2019s the magic of funnel hacking, what we all do.</p> <p>With that said, you guys. I appreciate you. I\u2019m going to bounce. Get back to work and probably do some more podcasts from the office, find different cool locations and go from there. Thanks everybody. Talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "11:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/305_-_Are_You_Watching_The_Magicians_Hands.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485822610, "title": "Episode #304 \u2013 My Backwards Strategy For Truly Understanding If A Funnel Is Going To Work", "author": "", "summary": "<p>When you master this piece, it actually becomes really simple.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about moving into his new office, and finishing up his book.

Guess what today is? Today is moving day. I am so excited. Today is the day we are finally moving into our new office, which there\u2019s probably a few of you guys like, \u201cWho cares, Russell. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d But this is a big deal for a lot of reasons.</p> <p>Number one, we\u2019re moving to a new office and every times there\u2019s change, a pattern interrupt from your day is a good opportunity, a good chance to radically shift everything about yourself. So I\u2019m excited because this is like a new beginning, a new birth, I don\u2019t even know, but it\u2019s pretty cool. Number one.</p> <p>Number two, I\u2019ve been in a lot of offices in my days since we started this whole internet marketing game, and all of them have been rented from people. This office I bought, so I own it. Well not yet, I guess I got like a thousand more payments, but someday I will own it. But what\u2019s about it is it\u2019s our own. And then we bought this building and it was horrible inside so we gutted the whole thing and rebuilt it to be exactly what we want and how we want it.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure you guys will see if you follow me on Facebook or anywhere else. We\u2019ll do some videos and kind of show the whole thing, but it\u2019s so cool. On the outside we got this big old sign that says Clickfunnels. The inside, you walk in, the sign\u2019s not there yet, the sign should be there by tomorrow, I think. But a big old sign that says Clickfunnels. And then there\u2019s the TV, when we\u2019re doing events and stuff we\u2019re going to play video or audio, looping what\u2019s happening. And then on the right hand side you walk in, there\u2019s this huge seminar room that will hold up to, I mean we could have about 100 people in there, but comfortably it\u2019s about 70 or so people that it\u2019s set up.</p> <p>It\u2019s big. And basically we\u2019re going to be able to do workshops there. What we\u2019re trying to do\u2026.actually, let me step back. I\u2019m driving right now to downtown Boise because we got a certified partner event. So I\u2019m going to be hanging out with 40 or 50 of our certified partners today while everybody else is moving stuff.</p> <p>So our goal was to get it done last weekend, so we could do the first certified partner event in there, but we didn\u2019t quite make it. I guess technically we could\u2019ve but it would have been weird today because everyone would\u2019ve been moving and they would have all been there and it would have been just, you know. You know when you first move into your house and you don\u2019t want guests coming right away, because you don\u2019t even know where you\u2019re going to sleep yet. So that\u2019s kind of how it is.</p> <p>So anyway, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday we have our first ever FHAT event. It stands for Funnel Hack A Thon. Funnel hack a thon, I think I mentioned this before, but it a new, I\u2019m really excited, it\u2019s a new type of event we\u2019re going to do in our office. If it works, we\u2019re going to start doing them throughout the year and start bringing people to them. But I\u2019m doing a test run with our inner circle members. So that\u2019s happening next week.</p> <p>So we\u2019re getting everything set up and ready and prepared for the first ever FHAT event, which is exciting. So that\u2019s going to be happening at the workshop room in there. Then we\u2019ve got a big old kitchen. I think the kitchen will hold like 38 chairs. 38 people can eat at the same time, which is crazy. I guess that\u2019s a lot for normal days, but I guess when we have events there, we\u2019ll probably need a little more. People can eat in the conference room as well. So we got places for people to eat, which is cool.</p> <p>Also, we always rent these kitchens and stuff, to film different products, when we did the weight shake video we\u2019d rent this person\u2019s kitchen. We\u2019ve done that once. So I wanted a kitchen that was nice, so we could actually film in it. We\u2019ve got a nice backdrop a nice countertop. So it\u2019s set up so we can actually film in it.</p> <p>That\u2019s one of the cool things about this office. Our old office, if you ever saw it on the videos, it\u2019s totally embarrassing. It was so trashy and I\u2019m not the cleanest person ever, especially when I\u2019m in the zone working and creating, I\u2019ve got stuff everywhere. But it always looked ugly, it\u2019s kind of embarrassing. There was no where to film videos, so we always had to go somewhere. But in the new offices, we\u2019ve got probably 15 or 20 spots that we created specifically to look cool, to be awesome on video, which is going to be really, really cool.</p> <p>You should see a lot more new cool video stuff coming from us. When we\u2019re streaming stuff it won\u2019t look lame, it\u2019ll actually look awesome. So I\u2019m excited for that on top of everything else. We have our own little recording studio, it\u2019s going to have all sound proofing, that foam stuff so there\u2019s no echoes or revirb so you can record webinars or audiobooks or whatever in there, podcasts. It\u2019s going to be really, really cool. I don\u2019t know, just ton\u2019s of cool stuff is happening.</p> <p>So I, as you can tell, am very excited for today. The move is happening, but first I got to get to downtown Boise, through all of this traffic and go give a presentation to our certified partners, then get back to have some fun.</p> <p>Also, the new office has got a lot of book shelf space, but not as much as the old office. So some of you guys knew this, if you watched me on Snapchat, it was kind of a sad day in my life. But we went through and threw away\u00a0 hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of marketing courses, things that were no longer relevant, or I knew I\u2019d never listen to, things like that. So because of that I threw away most of my courses. And I put the courses that are still relevant, we burned them all onto audiobook files, so now they\u2019re all in my phone and laptop and everywhere else. But they\u2019re no longer on the bookshelf.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s just going to be books there. So today we\u2019re bringing all the books over. I\u2019m going to organize all those, get them on the wall and hopefully there\u2019ll be some room for new books. Because I love books, books are the coolest.</p> <p>And speaking of books, Saturday I finished it. I finished the last edit, the last everything. I sent it to\u2026\u2026 I printed, actually printed out 6 physically copies of the book and handed them out to 5 of my friends and one for me. And they\u2019re all doing a really quick read through to see any last misspellings or typos or anything, but after that It\u2019s done. And it was the weirdest thing. Saturday I went in and spent about two hours just doing the last, last thing. Making sure everything was in there. Making sure all the images were correct, making sure all that stuff. And I remember, when I got done I was like, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d I think I snapchatted, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p> <p>But it was the weirdest, I literally felt like I had this 300 pound kid sitting on my shoulders, and then he fell off. And I was like, \u201cI feel so light.\u201d It was really interesting. I felt so light and fluffy and good and So it\u2019s nice to have that big old gorilla off my back, because that\u2019s been one of those things that needed to be done.</p> <p>In fact, my initial due date from the publisher was December 1<sup>st</sup>, and then I missed that date. Then it was December 31<sup>st</sup>, I missed that date. Then we had to move our launch date, so we moved our launch date for the book to April 18<sup>th</sup>. I was basically like, \u201cOkay, you have this done by the end of January, it\u2019s physically impossible to have it done by your launch date. I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. So the last two months, was like a nightmare. But now it\u2019s done and books, I don\u2019t know if you ever written a book, it\u2019s so much more permanent. I can, I\u2019m not, what\u2019s the right word, I was going to say cheat my way through.</p> <p>I can freestyle my way through power point slides, presentations and sales videos and all those other things. They don\u2019t have to be perfect or finite, there\u2019s, I\u2019ve done them enough that I don\u2019t need them to be perfect. But a book has to be perfect. Because they don\u2019t have you being able to cover up the mistakes through a good story or through whatever. It is what it is. It has to stand alone. You can\u2019t touch it when it\u2019s done. So there you go. I\u2019m excited, the book\u2019s going to be so, so cool.</p> <p>Alright, with that said, I\u2019m driving down to the certified partner\u2019s event so I thought a good thing to talk about would be the other side of the funnel business. So I know we talk a lot about our own funnels. How you\u2019re one funnel away and that part of it, but I thought it would be fun to talk about what our certified partners talk about. And if you\u2019re not a certified partner yet, but you\u2019d like to be, you should become one. I think everybody, whether you want to sell funnels or not, should go through a certified partner training. It\u2019ll help you become a better funnel builder for yourself or if you did have clients. Whatever that is. But I think it\u2019s good.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re interested in going, go to cfcertified.com, and there\u2019s a webinar there explaining how the whole thing works. I just think everybody should go through it. It\u2019s worth it. A few groups are coming in today. So the way it works, you sign up for it and it\u2019s like, I think it\u2019s 12 modules, but you have to complete the first 8 before you\u2019re able to come to the certification events. The certification events, we do every quarter here in Boise. So everyone who\u2019s got the first 8 modules done is allowed to come to it.</p> <p>At the certified events we actually bring in a bunch of business owners and you have a chance to go and build funnels for them. There\u2019s a contest at the end, whoever builds the best funnel wins the prize, it\u2019s really cool. But it kind of gives you the ability to do the whole thing for a client, which is like taking the intake and finding what they want, from there figuring out the strategy, figuring out how to build it and going through the whole process. I would typically make people stay up all night, this is an all nighter type of thing, to work hard and get these things done. It trains you and teaches you how to actually get the project done, which is cool.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting that even if you\u2019re not doing these for other clients, you\u2019re doing them for yourself, the process is still the same. A lot of people start with the funnel by jumping into Clickfunnels and start building, which is cool. But there\u2019s stuff you gotta be thinking through ahead of time. And if you were working for a client, you would. What\u2019s the goal, what\u2019s the strategy? Here\u2019s all the funnel types we have, what should I do? What should I not do? And it gives you a chance to really think through it at a different level.</p> <p>So it\u2019s kind of cool, but it\u2019s been fun watching our certified partners, some of these guys are making crazy, crazy amounts of money and it\u2019s interesting what it comes down to. What you\u2019re doing is taking your business owner off the street. And the business in the past probably had a website, they\u2019ve probably got all these things they\u2019ve been doing, but none of them are making them any money.</p> <p>You\u2019re saying, \u201cLook, the old things you have don\u2019t work. There\u2019s a new way, a better way to do it and it\u2019s through this process with what we call a funnel.\u201d And if you think about funnels, this was so interesting to me, most businesses have a funnel. Yesterday at church I was talking to a guy who\u2019s a chiropractor and he was asking me about what I do with funnels. And he\u2019s like, \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of like a website?\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, I guess.\u201d That\u2019s like if I\u2019m like a basketball player, saying \u201cOh, so you\u2019re kind of like Michael Jordan?\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, technically. He\u2019s a lot better than me, but I\u2019ll take that I guess.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of like a website, but it\u2019s a process we take someone through. A website is kind of dead thing that\u2019s like, bleh.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cHow much money did you\u2019re website make you last year?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201dWe don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cExactly. Nobody knows because it doesn\u2019t do anything, you guys think it\u2019s useful and it\u2019s not. But if you shift it a little bit, you shift your thinking, and you\u2019re like \u2018websites are dead, this is the new future, the new opportunity is these things called funnels.\u201d</p> <p>And you start looking; in fact, this is what I do with any client I\u2019m working with, especially offline clients. \u201cWhat\u2019s the funnel you\u2019re taking people through right now?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHow do you get clients right now?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cokay, well first thing I do is this, then I do this, then I do this, then I do this, then I do this.\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019ll draw out a picture of a funnel, like, \u201cThat\u2019s what you did.\u201d So we know that model, and I\u2019m not going to try to re-invent the wheel. How do we replicate that? If you\u2019re doing this, this and this. How do we replicate that online. Let\u2019s look at that because the funnel you have is working now. My chiropractic buddy, when we first started, when he started his practice, he struggled forever to get leads. And the first thing I think that really took off for him was, he put a, what do they call them, fish bowls in a restaurant. So people put their business cards in for a free lunch. Then he\u2019d call them up and be like \u201cCongratulations, you won a free lunch.\u201d To everybody who dropped a card in.</p> <p>The way it works is I\u2019m going to come to your office for free, I\u2019ll bring lunch but I get to give you a thirty minute presentation. So he\u2019d show up with lunch, feed everyone, do a thirty minute presentation, close a bunch of people and rinse and repeat. That was his funnel that he was bringing people in. And it\u2019s like, hey that works. So now we know that model works, how do we replicate that online. You need to get lunch appointments for people locally that you can give them free lunch or whatever. Let\u2019s make that same offer, let\u2019s make a fishbowl funnel. \u201cPut your name and email address in here and you can win a chance to get me to bring lunch.\u201d And then go buy Facebook ads that go to that fishbowl funnel, get their contact, call them up and be like, \u201ccongratulation, you won.\u201d And then go do the same thing.</p> <p>People seem to think it\u2019s this magic trick, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just looking at the customer process. I\u2019ve talked about this before with you guys. But I don\u2019t know if it was episode 1 or 250 so I apologize, they kind of blur together. But I remember reading the book the Emyth, for the first time and he talking about how every business has a system and if you don\u2019t have a system, it means you do but it\u2019s a really bad system probably. And he was talking about how what\u2019s a system for a retail business, when a customer comes through the door. What do they say first? What do they say second? And looking at that process.</p> <p>I remember reading that book ten years ago and thinking about the stores I go into. How am I being, what\u2019s the funnel people are taking when they walk into the store? It\u2019s funny, my favorite store to this day is GNC. But I rarely go, even when I see a GNC, I\u2019ll avoid it like the plague, because I know their system sucks when people walk in. I walk in, the first thing is, \u201cHey what can I help you with?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cGah, I just walked in. I want to look at the bottle and read the back.\u201d And they always ask me that, and so I always say what everybody says, \u201cOh no thanks. I\u2019m just looking.\u201d And then they, and then it ruins that first interaction.</p> <p>It\u2019s like having a sales funnel where the headline is, \u201cHey what can I help you with today?\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just landed on your landing page. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to leave. You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d And then they leave. That\u2019s the equivalent of it.</p> <p>So it\u2019s like, okay how do we make this process right? If I were the GNC dude, I\u2019d come in and be like, \u201cWelcome to GNC, looks like you\u2019re looking for some cool supplements. Have you tried the new whatever power bars? I can give you free sample if you want to try them because they are freaking amazing.\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cHeck yeah, I\u2019ll try a power bar.\u201d I eat and I\u2019d be like, \u201cDude that is amazing. What\u2019s the secret?\u201d and they\u2019d be like, \u201cOh there\u2019s this kind of protein instead of this. This is the big thing behind.\u201d Maybe he\u2019d be like, \u201cAre you looking for proteins or what kind of supplements are you typically looking for?\u201d</p> <p>Boom, he\u2019s opened his question. First off, he built rapport, second off, he opened up a question. I\u2019d be like, \u201cI like all sorts of supplements.\u201d And be like, \u201cSweet, let\u2019s get a cart and let\u2019s make a shopping list.\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cAlright.\u201d And I\u2019d spend like $800 instead of the opposite when I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m just looking.\u201d And awkwardly looking around and you can tell they\u2019re looking at you.</p> <p>Every time you\u2019re looking at something, \u201cHey so do you have any questions about supplements?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo I\u2019m just looking.\u201d And then walk to the next section, \u201cOh do you have a question about those?\u201d \u201cNo! GAH! I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d That\u2019s what normally happens when I go to GNC. So if I was the consultant for GNC, I\u2019d be looking at the funnel, that process, every single interaction. What\u2019s weird, what\u2019s not weird? What\u2019s awesome? And I\u2019d be looking at those kinds of things and figure out how to tweak it and make it smoother.</p> <p>And the same thing is true with websites and funnels. For five years I used to do all the Glazier Kennedy website reviews. Go to this website and every single time it was this brick wall, \u201cCan I help you with that?\u201d and there\u2019d be 8 thousand links on their page. I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019ve been reviewing these things for 5 years, how are all your pages still horrific?\u201d</p> <p>When someone comes to your page, that\u2019s why you have a headline. What am I going to say in my headline that gets them to want to give me their email. You have to think through the process, that\u2019s the key. It\u2019s not, \u201cokay I\u2019m going to use the book funnel for this one. I\u2019m going to use\u2026.\u201d No, think through the process. If you were coming here for the first time. What would be the path? What would they say to you that would not shut you down but would open you up? And that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. When I\u2019m building my own funnels, that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about.</p> <p>Someone\u2019s coming here, what\u2019s happening? Where am I feeling resistance? Where am I feeling good? What\u2019s creating curiosity so I can proceed through this process? What\u2019s giving me too much so I want to step back? Where am I being annoying? Where am I helping? That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking at when I\u2019m building a funnel. That\u2019s what you should be doing if you\u2019re working for other people. Is looking at that process. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking through and if it\u2019s for yourself, it\u2019s the same thing.</p> <p>I have a friend that said that every month you should secret shop yourself. I haven\u2019t really done that, but I think it\u2019s smart. Secret shop yourself and see what resistance you\u2019re hitting into. In fact, Dean Graziosi, I think it was, told me that when he had his big seminar business they were 200 million dollars a year and he hired a bunch of people whose full time job was to go and consume everything.</p> <p>They went to the live event, they signed up, they went to the next thing, just do the whole thing and spend all the money to go through everything in the process and then come back and be like, what things were awesome? What things were horrible? He said what he found from secret shopping himself, was that people signed up they\u2019re all excited and then they didn\u2019t hear from people on average, about 6 days after the event. He said that was what bothered him. It took six days to hear back. They\u2019re like, \u201cWow, we need to get back to people immediately.\u201d</p> <p>So they shifted the whole business to where as soon as someone would sign up for an event, the next day they got an email. When they did that their cancelation rate dropped by half, like crazy. So it\u2019s like, coming back to the process, the funnel is just the process. The system that your taking somebody through. The magic of online funnels is the fact that we can perfect that.</p> <p>You know, with offline funnels, you gotta train the sales dude, you gotta train the person in every single store, in every single GNC to not be an idiot and ask a good question instead of a bad question. And then when they want to slip back to their bad questions, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard, right?</p> <p>The cool thing about funnels is you can tweak that, perfect that and everybody comes through the same path. What\u2019s cool, just think about GNC, if they were to go to every one of their stores around the whole country and make that one shift, what would that do for their revenue? If they were able to instantly get every single person to follow the same script, I mean, I would not be shocked if it doubled their revenue. That may seem crazy, but let\u2019s just, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s that hard.</p> <p>But the hard part is getting ten thousand reps to actually do it and do it right and do it correctly. That\u2019s the opportunity that they\u2019ve got to figure out, which is not that easy. Whereas with a funnel, there\u2019s one point that everybody\u2019s coming through, therefore you tweak it in one spot and it works across everything.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to double companies business when you fix that piece. And that\u2019s the opportunity you guys. That\u2019s what certified partner program is all about. That\u2019s what these funnels are all about for yourself and for other people. That you\u2019re just perfecting the message and each step along the funnel. And when you do that, it\u2019s what do they say? Small hinges swing big doors. Or the butterfly effect. Wjatever you want to call it. Those teeny tiny tweaks have dramatic impact on everything else you do on your business.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s pretty exciting. I geek out on this stuff, as you can probably tell. But it\u2019s all about thinking through it. How would you feel if you\u2019re going through this process? Where would your resistance come from? What would you be excited by? And the more you think about, and then watch as other people go through it, and watch what they\u2019re doing and make tweaks and changes based on that, the more success you\u2019ll have in your funnels.</p> <p>So, I hope that helps everybody. I\u2019m almost to the certified partner event, so if you\u2019re there today I\u2019ll see you guys. If you\u2019re not there yet, it means it\u2019s time to get certified. You or someone on your team should be certified. Everyone should have one in their office. Go to cfcertified.com and go get certified. And I will see you guys here in a little bit. Thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "20:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/304_-_My_Backwards_Strategy_For_Truly_Understanding_If_A_Funnel_Is_Going_To_Work.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485552748, "title": "Episode #303 \u2013 Should You Write A Book?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>After finishing book #2, these are my thoughts on weather or not you should actually write a book.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about finally completing his Expert Secrets book as he\u2019s about to send it off to the publisher.

I hope you guys are doing awesome today. So I apologize that I have not been here for you guys the last three days. I\u2019ve been here in spirit. Hopefully you had a chance to listen to the last 3 episodes. I\u2019ve got some of you guys freaking out in the Facebook group about the last 3 episodes. They\u2019re like, \u201cI cannot believe you actually gave this.\u201d In fact, if you guys aren\u2019t on the Facebook group yet, if you go to projectclickfunnels.com it\u2019ll redirect you to the Facebook group. But we\u2019ve got 40,000 funnel hackers like you hanging out, talking about stuff all day long. So go to projectclickfunnels.com and come join us.</p> <p>But some of you guys are freaking out there like, \u201cDude, I can\u2019t believe Russell shared that.\u201d So for those of you guys who are paying attention, I\u2019m trying to drop gold bombs all the time. Hopefully the last 3 days have been inspiring for you. If that did anything for you, you\u2019re going to love the Expert Secrets book. Because it\u2019s taking that and going into a lot of depth and it\u2019s so exciting.</p> <p>Anyway, I wanted to let you guys know that I\u2019m pretty much done with the book. What? It\u2019s been every night, so Monday night I was up til 4:30 and then I had to get up at 7, and then Tuesday night I was up til I think about 3, and that night I remember Dylan Jones, we\u2019re racing, I\u2019m trying to get the book done and he\u2019s trying to get the survey element done, which I think it\u2019s done. I think he\u2019s going live today, which is amazing. But we\u2019ve been racing and I told him, \u201cI have this weird feeling, I\u2019ve been drinking a lot of caffeine so I can stay awake. I have this thing where I\u2019m wide awake, but I feel like I don\u2019t have a soul, because I think my body is a asleep, but my brain and my eyes are awake. It\u2019s this weird zombie feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, I told him that at 2:30 Tuesday night, and at 3 o\u2019clock I hit a wall. So I had to be done after that. And then Wednesday was the next day. Each night I\u2019m getting 3 to 4 hours of sleep, so Wednesday started, luckily I had the day pretty much open so I worked on the book all day, and came home at night and I think I done about, all the days are blending together, I think it was about 2:30 when I went to bed on Wednesday. I pretty much got it for the most part done.</p> <p>And then yesterday I had a bunch of stuff happening. And today\u2019s Friday and I\u2019ve got 2 of these Funnel Fridays which is starting in 15 minutes. If you\u2019re not watching Funnel Fridays go to funnelfriday.com we archive them there, but again, I\u2019m dropping these little gold bombs, gold nuggets for you guys in different places, and if you\u2019re not watching you\u2019re missing out on cool stuff.</p> <p>Each week we build a funnel. We\u2019re building one in 15 minutes from now, which is cool. And then I\u2019ve got decade in a day, so those who join my inner circle, when they first come in we do a thing called Decade in a Day. Basically I spend an hour with you on the phone and we look at your model, figure out what you need to do and point you in the right direction. So I\u2019ve got 5 or 6 of those today in a row, we let everyone who\u2019s in it, listen in. So they listen and hear what everyone else is saying, which is kind of fun.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. So today is a full day too. I\u2019ve got probably, I\u00a0 would say 2 hours left on the book just ot put all the final images in and I\u2019ve got two new chapters I added that are just mini chapters. They\u2019re two pages just to show how this stuff works in different funnels, so I have to write those as well. Then at that point, I have my editor do one last run and my goal is Monday to submit it to the publisher. So Monday I submit it to the publisher, then I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t touch it. I\u2019m not allowed to ever touch it again, which is stressing me out.</p> <p>Then I have to record the audiobook version, which will be happening in a couple of weeks. And then Monday we have our certification event. So we have Certified people coming out Monday. So I\u2019ll be speaking at that. And Monday we\u2019re actually moving to the new office. It\u2019s crazy. The next thirty days are insane. I have three events in the next thirty days.</p> <p>So Monday we move in the office, plus certification, that\u2019s Monday, Tuesday. Then I got Wednesday, Thursday, Friday to plan for the FHAT event, which then we have our FHAT event. Which FHAT is F H A T which stands for Funnel Hack A Thon. So this is a new event we\u2019re going to rolling out, and hopefully it goes well. But we\u2019re taking 30 of our inner circle members through that. So that\u2019s happening the next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Then Thursday and Friday I\u2019m supposed to have the 100k meeting, but I\u2019m going to have to miss it because I can\u2019t get it all done.</p> <p>So I\u2019m missing the 100k meeting, during those two days we\u2019ll be filming the book launch video\u2019s and also the FHAT event videos, to launch those two projects. Then I\u2019ve got a week where I\u2019m trying to do all my presentations for Funnel Hacking Live, and after that we go to Funnel Hacking Live. It\u2019s crazy. And then I have a break for a couple of weeks, then we launch the book. So It\u2019s insane. If I survive the next thirty days it\u2019s going to be pretty amazing.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because I have people that are like, \u201cOh, I wrote a book.\u201d I had a guy I was talking to the other day and he\u2019s like, \u201cI have a presentation in March I\u2019m preparing for.\u201d I\u2019m like, a presentation. I was like, \u201cIn the next 30 days, I have 17 or 18 presentations that I haven\u2019t started on yet.\u201d I have to get that done in the next 30 days, plus I\u2019m writing a book, plus moving offices, plus there\u2019s a lot of other stuff happening behind the scenes of well.</p> <p>Next week, we\u2019re launching, obviously we launched the podcast funnel last week, which was cool and brought a lot of you guys to our podcast. Next week we\u2019re launching Funnel Graffiti, the week after that we\u2019re launching Funnel Manifesto, and we have all these cool things we\u2019re rolling out. There\u2019s so many fun things happening, I love it. I love Clickfunnels, it makes it so fun and cool to do cool stuff.</p> <p>Anyway, all those things are happening. On top of that trying to be a scout master and a parent and husband and everything else. It\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s so fun. I\u2019m having the time of my life. This is, I love it.</p> <p>Alright, today I wanted to share one thing, because people keep asking me about the book. \u201cRussell, should I write a book? Should I not write a book?\u201d So what I wanted to share with you guys is my thoughts on that because this is now book number two. I\u2019ve written others, I mean this is my second published book. We\u2019ve got 108 Split tests, which is an awesome book. We\u2019ve got Funnel Stacking, which is an awesome book we\u2019ve done. But this is the second real book. And for me it\u2019s been stressful. The Dotcom Secrets book took me a year and a half to write. And Expert Secrets book turned into that as well, I thought it was gonna be faster. I was like, I will prepare better this time. But no, it still took almost 18 months from beginning to end.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, my accountant was, which I finally have a good accountant. It\u2019s awesome to have someone who\u2019s awesome. So he\u2019s going through all our stuff and numbers and the end of the year he sent us this report and it\u2019s funny because if you look at the book funnel, we\u2019ve sold almost 100 thousand copies of the Dotcom Secrets book last year. Or maybe since it started, I don\u2019t know, whatever it is.</p> <p>But you look at that and it\u2019s like how much money we make on those funnels. And it\u2019s not a lot. If you look at it, if that was my business was the book, you\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, wow you made\u2026.\u201d I think we netted maybe 100 grand from book sales last year, which depending on who you are could be good or bad. But we sold a lot of books. I averaged a dollar a book, which is horrible. But you look at that, and what was the, from looking at it, was that profitable? No it probably wasn\u2019t. But if you look at it like because of that book, what was created? It became the guidebook, the playbook for people to understand funnels, which got people into Clickfunnels, which got people building, which got people into the certification, which got people to go to live events. It became this tool for so many other things.</p> <p>And the Expert Secrets book is the same thing. My goal is to sell 100 thousand copies during the launch month. I want to sell a million copies. In fact, I\u2019m launching a blog documenting how we sold a million copies of this book because I want to show the process and share with everybody. So the question is, is writing a book worth it?</p> <p>A couple of things, first off I\u2019d say at first it\u2019s not. But there\u2019s a transition point. In fact, I still remember when I actually wrote the book, or decided to write the book, I\u2019d always wanted to. In fact, the reason I bought the domain name Dotcomsecrets originally was because I wanted to buy a book called that. So that was 10 years ago. But I didn\u2019t write a book for 10 years. I think you have to earn a book. Some people write a book really quick. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right timing.</p> <p>But for me, I was sitting at a Carl\u2019s Jr with Chad Woolner, my buddy. We were watching our kids play in a playground and he said to me, \u201cDo you know the difference between you and Brendan Burchard and Tony Robins? There\u2019s only one thing that I really noticed. I feel like your content is as good, if not better. I feel like all these things, the one thing that they have that you don\u2019t have is a book. That\u2019s it.\u201d And I was like, huh. That\u2019s weird because I don\u2019t feel like, there\u2019s some weird perception about a book, whatever that is.</p> <p>So that night I was like, I don\u2019t know how you are, but I financially commit if I\u2019m going to do something. So I went out there and I was like, I need to find someone to help me with this book.\u00a0 So I found a whole bunch of people and I interviewed a bunch, and spent a whole bunch of money the next day for somebody to be the person. It was Julie Easton, who\u2019s my\u2026..helps me write the book. So I gave her a whole bunch of the money and she became\u2026.Now I had, I paid someone, this has to happen. And she was writing every single day. It was like \u201cWhat\u2019s next? What\u2019s next?\u201d and a year and a half later we had a book.</p> <p>But it was just one of those things. So people always ask me, \u201cShould I write a book? Should I not write a book?\u201d And when all is said and done, I think that you should. I don\u2019t think it should, it shouldn\u2019t be the first thing you do. But it\u2019s something you should do because it is dramatically transformed our positioning, our business, our brand. So I do think it\u2019s worth doing, but not at first, but there\u2019s a time.</p> <p>So I would say to all you guys to do what I did. 10 years before I wrote my book, \u201cI\u2019m going to write a book.\u201d Just declare, \u201cI\u2019m going to write a book. And this is what the title\u2019s going to be and I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be yet.\u201d Because as soon as I had this, I knew the book, I knew\u2026.it\u2019s weird because my mind started doing stuff that became the book later.\u00a0 I had to become something to write the book. We had to have stories and stuff. I don\u2019t know if subconsciously I declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to write a book.\u201d In fact, I even paid Morgan James who did our publishing; I paid him for the book 10 years ago. You could ask him. Every time I saw him for the next year he was like, \u201cSo when\u2019s the book coming?\u201d I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s coming soon.\u201d</p> <p>But I paid it 10 years prior, I paid the bill for the book. So when the book came out he was li,,e \u201cI never thought you were actually going to write this.\u201d But I had put it out there. I paid money to start it, and then I was doing life but because of that it made me create the book. It made me create the stuff to have that I think that it should be the goal for all you guys to write a book.\u00a0 Because I think it\u2019s important. I think if I was you guys, I would make sure you write a good book. I\u2019ve had some friends write books that were like, they did this thing where they busted out a book in a weekend and it became a bad book and it didn\u2019t help them, it actually hurt them a lot of times.</p> <p>In fact, I had a guy who I respected a lot, and then I read his book and I lost all respect for him because I was like, \u201cThat book made me think you have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d So I think it\u2019s worth writing a good book. So I\u2019d say if I was you guys, depending on where you\u2019re at in your path say, \u201cI\u2019m going to write a book.\u201d Just make that a thing and even buy a domain name, get the e-cover designed. Be like, \u201cI have a book now, I\u2019m an author. I\u2019m writing a book.\u201d Tell people that, \u201cI\u2019m writing a book.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know yet, but I\u2019m writing it.\u201d Just to kind of put it out there. And then start becoming who you gotta become to write the book. You have to earn the book.</p> <p>Go out there and if you\u2019re writing a book on weight loss, go get a hundred clients and help them lose a lot of weight so you can understand intimately the process so you when you do write the book, you will a different perspective. When I had the idea for Dotcom Secrets, I had like 4 funnels in the internet marketing niche and the potato gun niche and a couple little things, but I didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t worthy of writing that book yet. But because I did that, I started coaching people and started learning and I started to launch my own.</p> <p>We did supplement funnels and weight loss funnels and from that learning and education I learned all the stuff and then I was able to write this book. But if I didn\u2019t have that, this thing out there, who knows if I would have ever written it. And now, the Expert Secrets book is out there and it\u2019s been written out and it\u2019s the next piece. What we\u2019re trying to do with our company and our mission and how we\u2019re trying to effect people, it is a book, it is the thing if I do it right, if I execute it correctly, which I hope I will, it\u2019s going to expand our market and bring us out to the masses and get this main stream. That\u2019s why I feel called to write this book and I\u2019m so proud of it.</p> <p>I said on Snapchat the other day, \u201cAfter writing this book I almost hate the Dotcom Secrets book.\u201d It was an amazing book, I\u2019m proud of it. But compared to what\u2019s been created here\u2026.I\u2019m so excited for people to have this. It\u2019s going to change people and it\u2019s going to cause movements and it\u2019s going to be awesome.</p> <p>With that said, I\u2019ve got Funnel Fridays in 7 minutes. I\u2019ve got to get in here and get started. That\u2019s my thoughts on writing a book. It\u2019s worth the journey and when you\u2019re ready for it, you\u2019ll know and then it will become a transforming piece in your positioning and in your brand and in you as person. That\u2019s what I got for you. Alright guys, I\u2019m out of here. Have a great day. I\u2019ll talk to you soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "13:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/303_-_Should_You_Write_A_Book.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485472103, "title": "Episode #302 \u2013 Secrets From The $100k Meeting - Part 3 of 3", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The real secret to converting with funnels\u2026</p> <p>Today\u2019s episode is part 3 of a 3 part series of Russell speaking at a $100k event where he taught about the psychology of funnels.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you will hear in part 3:</p> <ul> <li>Some tips and tricks when it comes to building funnels.</li> <li>What the cardinal rule of upsells is and some of the things that will help convert an upsell.</li> <li>He also gives some cool tips for using Facebook Live.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how to make your funnels awesome and successful.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Russell Brunson: All right, so now we're going to ... Cause now, like everyone ... I'm the funnel guy, so let's talk about funnels, right? Now that we've got the foundation stuff out of the way, so then it comes to how do we build the funnel? I lost ... There's the lid. For me, the funnel ... Everyone thinks there's some magic. I have people all the time like, \"Hey Russell. Do you have an MLM funnel you can give me, so I can grow my MLM?\" I have a funnel that's worked for someone I can give you. \"Hey, I'm doing this.\" I give them the book funnel. I was snickering yesterday. Everyone's like, \"I need your book funnel. [inaudible 00:46:27] book funnel to work.\" It's like, well kind of. Y'all have the funnel now. That's the framework. What makes it work is this stuff we talked about, right? The pieces don't change.</p> <p>My funnels are not complicated If you look at my funnels versus, I have friends who like to brag about the complexity of their funnels. They're insane. My funnels are so simple. They're usually four or five pages and that's it. It's, very simple. My thing, I think ... In fact, I was at a Infusion Soft thingy and I was watching these guys and they had all of their ... These guys were building all of these funnels that had like a billion different segments and all this stuff. You know those Infusion Soft charts, that show all the thing ... I was just sick to my stomach. I'm like, \"Guh.\"</p> <p>They're like, \"Yeah, well if they click here, then it takes them this sequence. If they don't, they take them to here and then if they've done this thing for three days and they haven't done this and then they go here and ...\" All this stuff and I was just like ... They have a billion different branches. I'm looking at that, I'm like, \"You know the problem with that, is I have no idea what the crap to fix if something's broken. There's so may things. I want five or six variables max I want my cost per ad, I want my landing page conversion, I want my sales thingy. I want four or five things and I'm going to go and spend a thousand bucks driving ads. I'm going to stop and look at it and be like, \"Okay, cool. It's one of these five things that's broken. Maybe two of them. Let's fix just those.\" You've got a thing that's got 8,000 sequences. I can not make it better.</p> <p>What's more important, is become better at selling. Me getting better at telling a story is better than 8.000 segmentations of lists. I'll make way more money by becoming better at telling my story, than I ever will from the third, the guy that didn't click on email 13, send him this one instead and then send this one at two in the morning and then. Holy crap. Just sell yourself better and that's worth a million times more than that, right? I make them simple. All my ... Everyone's cheering back here, \"Yay, simple funnels.\" My stuff's all very, very, very simple, but I've become a master at understanding this. The opportunity switch to the opportunity stack.</p> <p>I'm just going to talk about a book funnel, but this could be any funnel. Does not matter. The first thing I'm looking at is that is, what is the opportunity switch. There's going to be a video of me telling a story about the opportunity switch. With my book funnel, I'm telling a story about my book, my epiphany story about how I had an opportunity switch and how this book is going to give you that same thing as well. Right? That's the key. That's the magic. If I'm doing a webinar, what am I doing? Telling a story about my opportunity switch, tell the epiphany story. They have the same epiphany, they're sold. I don't have to sell them anymore. If I'm selling supplements, same thing. Tell them the story, how did my epiphany pitch. It doesn't matter what it is. That's the key, is I'm telling a really good story about how I had my epiphany, and if I do the job right, they'll have the same epiphany and then they'll buy the first product.</p> <p>From there, it's coming and the biggest thing most marketers do, when they start creating their upsale, downsale sequences is like, \"Okay, what else do we have on the shelf we can sell them? Okay, they bought my book. Let's sell them, I don't know, some other random thing.\" Or, they bought the book. Let me sell them more of that same kind of thing. Now, in supplement world, this is like the default. E-commerce/supplements, it's kind of like remember A-E-I-O-U and sometimes I and W, or E and W or whatever that is. There's two times this rule breaks.</p> <p>In supplements and e-commerce, whatever I sell on the first phase, if I sell supplements, I sell three bottles, my upsell's always six bottles of the exact same crap. If I sell e-commerce, we just did a campaign for Fiber Fix. Three Fiber Fix, I'm upselling a crap ton more Fiber Fix. It's e-commerce and supplements, you sell more of the same thing on the next page. Only time you do that. In information products, that will kill you. First time I really got this, it was when we launched our 108 Split Test book, which was kind of ironic, because the whole book's about split test. We launched this book and the landing page converted and non of the upsells did and I was so pissed. I'm like. \"Why is this not working?\" I retweaked this offer probably 12 times. I changed the video, changed the pitch, changed the offer, changed the thing, the thing, the thing. I'm like, \"Why is nobody buying this crap?\"</p> <p>The main thing I was selling was, they bought a book on split tests, and my upsell was this whole course on split testing. I'm like, \"This is all the cool stuff you need. You told me you wanted split testing. I'm selling you more split testing. Why are you not buying that?\" I had one of my friends, who went to my funnel and bought it and he texted me. He's like, he said, \"Hey man. Cool book. Thanks for the book.\" Then he's like, \"I bet your upsell is not converting.\" I was like ... I didn't tell anyone, cause the conversion, that's my thing. Like, \"Why would you say that?\" He's like, \"Ah, I can just tell.\" I'm like, \"Well, I'm just curious. Why would you assume that?\" Anyway, he shot ... it's Tim Erway, if any of you guys who know him.</p> <p>He shot me this message, he's like, \"Dude, cause you did the cardinal fail of upsales.\" I was like, \"All right. Yeah. What was the cardinal rule again?\" He told me, he said, \"When somebody buys your first product ...\" Think about it. Let's say it's My Gear, The Truth About Abs, right? I want abs so bad, right. I buy Truth About Abs. My mind, as a consumer, I'm like, \"I've got abs. That itch has been scratched.\" And I'm like, \"Ah sweet, I got abs. Whew.\" Then here it's like, \"Hey, I'm going to give you workout videos, so you can get abs.\" Like, \"Dude, I already got abs. I just bought them. They're ... It's done. My itch has been scratched.\" He's like, \"When people buy your split test book, in their mind, that itch has been scratched. It's done. Nothing you do will get people to buy more of that.\" I was like, \"But they raised their hand as people interested in split tests.\" Nope, that itch has been scratched.</p> <p>He's like, \"You've got to look at, you just did an opportunity switch. What is the next thing they need to be more successful with that? What's the stack? What's the next logical thing?\" I was like, for me I was like, \"Well, if they scratched their itch on conversion, conversion's awesome, but they're only coming to the website and then they're kind of screwed, right?' For me, it was traffic was the next thing. We shifted that to a what's the opportunity stack. Now you know how to make your pages convert, now let's get people to actually show up. Switched it and stacked the next opportunity. Boom. I was like, \"Crap, that was so easy.\" Now everyone in my funnel's [inaudible 00:52:17] the psychology of, okay. First lead is the switch.</p> <p>Now we've got them believing ... This is why I love free book offers. Why I like low end things, because the lower the barriers initially ... All I have to get them to do is to raise their hand and say, \"Yes, I'm going to buy your book.\" By saying that, they've subconsciously sold themselves on like, \"I have now switched off on the opportunity. This is now my future. I'm a guy who has six pack abs.\" They've made that switch. You know, as soon as you pull a credit card out of your wallet, you are voting. That's why, we don't do customer service and crap, cause I don't care. We get people to vote with their credit card, cause that's the only thing I actually believe.</p> <p>Every time we do focus groups and all that kind of crap, people give you whatever ... I only care about people voting with their credit card. As soon as they pull a credit card out of their wallet, they have voted that this is the opportunity that they are buying in to. They're done. The next thing is just like, \"Okay, you've already bought in to this now.\" That's why I like making this first opportunity as low barrier, as easy, because as soon as I get them to sell, subconsciously they're 100% in. Now the stacks become easy. Like, \"Hey, you got this. Now you need this.\"</p> <p>People always ask me, \"Well how many upsells should I have? What should be the price points on it? Duh, duh, duh, duh.\" It has nothing to do with price points, it has nothing to do ... None of that crap matters. People are like, \"Well, should I go from free to 97 to 290. What's the ...\" Everyone worries about that. It has nothing to do with that. It has 100% to do with, what's the next logical thing this customer needs to have success in the new opportunity I just gave them? This might be a $25,000 offer, if it makes sense. If that's the next logical thing that they need, or it might be $37. Price point does not matter. It's the logical sequencing of the offers that is the key. That's what makes any funnel work, is the logical sequencing of offers.</p> <p>Speaker 10: May I ask a question?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yes.</p> <p>Speaker 10: With the opportunity switch, is that more emotional and then the opportunity stack is more logical?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: I don't think anything logical sells. [inaudible 00:54:11] why I think logically, there's still emotion.</p> <p>Speaker 10: Well you know, you've got this ... You've got emotion and logic here. Is that [inaudible 00:54:18] the epiphany bridge?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yes. Yes, sorry. Yeah, so the emotional part's the [inaudible 00:54:28], the logical part ... Logical's like that how they explain to their wife [inaudible 00:54:33] buy something for 25,000, $100,000. How do I explain to my wife like, \"Yeah. I spent a hundred grand to go on this thing, because it's going to be really good for my ... No, I just want to hang out with me and Joe and everyone.\" Right? We emotionally get bought in, but I'm still always selling from emotion. I'll talk about logical, the logical justifications in the videos and stuff like that. It's still emotional.</p> <p>Speaker 10: [inaudible 00:54:54] emotional [inaudible 00:54:55] stack.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yeah, I think so.</p> <p>Speaker 10: How do you extend that story, that epiphany story [crosstalk 00:54:59].</p> <p>Russell Brunson: New story. New story.</p> <p>Speaker 10: It's a new story?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yeah, so it's like here's split testing. Like, cool. Let me tell you a story. After I got ... I'm sending this book out to you in the mail. You guys are going to go crazy for it, cause it's going to show you split testing. For me, when I started to get in to split testing, I was really excited, but the problem was, I didn't really have traffic coming to my website. I was doing a split test, like three people come. You can't actually ... It doesn't help.\" I start going in to the whole story.</p> <p>Speaker 10: A new epiphany.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yes.</p> <p>Speaker 10: You're sharing.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yeah.</p> <p>Speaker 10: Okay. Gotcha.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Sometimes multiple epiphanies. I'm telling as many stories as I need, to get that idea across.</p> <p>Speaker 10: Okay.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: How many stories do you think I've told in the last hour, so far?</p> <p>Speaker 10: A lot.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Anyway. The more, the merrier. It's not like, what's my one epiphany bridge story. Usually, it can be multiple. Any time I explain something that's confusing, I've got to step back again, \"Well, it's kind of like millions of motivational speakers running through your blood. That's what ketones are.\" Okay, and I keep moving forward. Okay, so like I said, some upsells, there's one thing, cause that's the only logical thing they have. Some upsells, there's two. Some upsells, I have one thing and I have a downsell. It matters less to me what it is and more tome just, what makes sense for this customer that's on this path?</p> <p>I remember reading the Emyth 12 years ago, and one of the initial things he talked about is the process of somebody walks in to a store. Last week, my wife wanted to go to the mall, cause we were going on a cruise in two days and she wanted to get some new clothes. I hate going to the mall, but I love GNC. That's my ... I love supplements. I take more supplements than I should, every day. I love it, right? I go to GNC and, the thing I hate about GNC though ... How many of you has been in to a GNC? What happens as soon as you walk in? They just pounce on you, it's like, \"Ahh [inaudible 00:56:30]\"</p> <p>I hate it, so I take a breath like, \"Okay.\" I walk through the door and within like one step, the girl comes out, \"oh, blah blah.\" I'm just like going through this pain like, \"What are you looking for? What do you want? What do you need?\" I'm like, \"I just want to look at supplements. Leave me alone.\" Then it's like finally, that horrible pain's gone and she leaves me. Okay. I can start looking, right? I'm remembering the E-myth and thinking about, I love GNC but I always have this pain going in, because the process is so weird.</p> <p>I start looking at ... I became obsessed with this. Everywhere I go, it drives my wife nuts. We're going through anything and the way a waiter pitches me, depends on what I'll buy and what I'll tip them. I want to get sold. I'm obsessed with the process of everything, from offline funnels to online funnels to everything that's happening. For me, I'm just looking at that like, \"Imagine that you're your customer, okay, and they come here. What's going to capture them, like a really good video. You're going to cut out the techno babble. You're going to tell a really good story, that's going to be exciting, it's going to be visually good, it's not going to be me against a white wall, trying to be boring. I'm going to find a good background and make it look visually stimulating, so it's cool. I'm going to tell a story that captivates them and make then=m an offer that's so irresistible. It's a new opportunity that's going to change their life, and that's what we do here.\"</p> <p>Then I'm like, \"Okay, they bought the book.\" How can I serve them the best? What's the next thing I can do to serve this person the most? It should be this. Do I have a product that does that? No, and that's what I need to make them. I need to make a product that does that, cause it's all about, how do we serve our people at the highest level. That's more important than \"I've got a whole bunch of products. What do I plug in and where do they go and should this be the upsell?\" No, think about the process.</p> <p>If you're walking in to GNC, if was walking in to GNC, I would change the whole process to like, \"Hey, welcome to GNC. Here's a free power bar. Let me know if you need anything.\" I'd have been like \"Huh.\" Eating a power bar, I'd buy four times as much stuff. I'd be going through things. I would just be focusing on that customer journey, what's happening through the process. For you guys, that's the way to think through this. Think like, someone buys this like, \"Oh man. It's kind of expensive and we ship them out DVDs and all this stuff.\" Maybe some people don't want DVDs. Maybe they don't have a DVD player. Maybe I'll downsell them. Maybe they just want a digital version. Maybe that would be my downsell, is a digital version, cause that's probably what they'd want.</p> <p>I'm looking logically, like what makes the most sense to them. If you can craft that, that's the magic. That's how you get a funnel that converts and how you make it work awesome.</p> <p>Speaker 10: On that first page, how long generally ... Do you have a time frame of the ideal video length? Three minutes, 45 minutes.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: This is what ...</p> <p>Speaker 10: Or does size really matter?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: One of my professors told me one time, he's like, \"It needs to be ... it's like a girl's skirt. It needs to be long enough to cover the subject, but short enough to still be interesting.\" That's my gauge I my mind, always. If it's getting boring and long, then I ... But I don't have a timeline. How long does it take me, take the story, where it's still engaging? It might be three minutes, it might be 20 minutes. If I tell a good story, people will sit there. That's more important. Yeah. There is a duration to the price of the thing I'm selling and how long it is. If it's a free book offer, I don't have to do a lot to get people to take that, but still need to get them to buy in to this, or else the upsells won't convert. A lot of times you see people book offers, \"Get my free book. It's amazing. You're going to love it. It's free. Ahh.\" That may work good for getting people to buy initially, but it kills you everything back here, cause they're not bought in to the opportunity switch. If you can get them to buy the opportunity switch, then everything else increases, from the rest of it on. Any other questions about that stuff at all?</p> <p>Cool. Then the last piece of this ... Oh yeah.</p> <p>Speaker 11: Where does the traffic primarily come from?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Cool. All right. The last piece of this. Traffic all over the place, but I want to show you guys what's working the best for us right now. On the last page right here. This is Anthony DeClemente. He is one of my buddies. He owns this company, biohacking stuff. We started, we're starting an online reality show called Funnel Hacker TV, just cause we want to ... Without people ... I wish we had like five hours, I could talk about more of this. For our customers, to build the whole culture, the biggest thing that we got to do is believe. Get these guys to believe in this right here. What I do, I do a lot of stuff to show belief. Friday we do a show called the Friday Funnel show, where I'm building an entire funnel in 30 minutes and I show them over and over and over again that I drink my own Kool-Aid. That I'm actually doing this. It's like the biggest thing for sales we've ever done.</p> <p>We do, we built this reality show, where basically each week, we pick an entrepreneur that's got a really cool product and we take them, figure out the product, the offers, build the thing and launch it. He's episode number one that's coming out. He had no list, no following, switching markets to a whole completely different thing, but he's just really good at what he did. We had him write a book. This whole campaign went from zero. I'm saying, you don't have to have a big following for this to work. This went from zero. In the last six weeks, we sold 8,000 copies of his book. He just finished his very first biohacking week in Chicago, had a whole bunch of people pay a crap ton of money to come out there and go through the experience and this whole business went from zero to it'll do a couple million bucks, yeah number one. All just from this. No other traffic source except for this.</p> <p>As you start going further down the cold, it's different, but for most people, you can build really good off of this. Facebook live, Facebook loves us right now. They are wanting all of us to do it, so what we do, and I'll kind of give you Anthony for example. He's got a book funnel. Some questions like what's the message? What's the best Facebook ad? I don't know. I have no idea what message is going to be right. Everyone responds to different things. What, Anthony I said, \"First thing he has to do is, every single day you have to do a Facebook live video on a different topic. Every single day, for the rest of your life.\" He's like, \"But I don't know if I have enough ideas.\" I don't care. Every single day for the rest of your life. That's your only job, is to make a Facebook live video. What he did was he made a first Facebook live video and I was like, \"It's biohacking. Do the weird crap. Get things with lasers up your nose and all sorts of weird stuff and that'll be your Facebook live.\"</p> <p>Then he did that and nobody cared. We did another one, and nobody cared. Then we did another one. We found out that about one out of 10 does what we call force virals. One out of 10, and what's weird is, it's usually the message that I think is the stupidest message ever. The first video we had that went force viral, the title of it was How to Biohack Your Vegetables. It was like, \"Hey.\" He's cooking, he's like, \"What you do is you put butter in your vegetables and it's biohacked now.\" It got like two or three million views and sold hundreds and hundreds of copies of the book. I was like, I thought the cools ones with the lasers in his eyes and ears would be the cool thing, but no. It's never what you think. We build a marketing campaign, we focus on one thing and it's the wrong one, it's like no. Do a Facebook live every single day for the rest of your life, on a different message and you'll find what the market actually cares about. What things they do. It's a consistency thing. Over and over and over again.</p> <p>Here's a couple things on Anthony's, just printed out a guide to help you guys, cause there was a lot of questions on it yesterday. The main thing is again, profile picture has a huge thing to do with people actually being part of it. The name should not be a company. People do not want to engage in companies and they do not want to share things from companies, they want to engage with you, the attractive character. The ult leader. All the headlines are super easy. They're things that are shareable, so it's not too complex. It's like, ,\"Hey cool, how to biohack your vegetable. How to ...\" What was this one? \"How to biohack, detox and get a flatter midsection.\" There's a simple call to action with the URL that's not clickfunnels.com/1234/ ... It's something that's also benefit driven, like biohackers guide. It's like, \"Oh cool. There's the guide.</p> <p>Speaker 12: Do you boost these or no?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yeah, I'll talk about that in a sec.</p> <p>Speaker 12: And you can boost with a URL? You can do that? Okay</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yep. I'll talk about kind of that strategy here in a second. Can the video structure, typically this is the structure. They're usually three to five minute videos. The first 15 seconds is like, \"Hey. I'm Anthony DeClemente.\" Then, if you have a cold like me, so I'm, \"Hey, I'm Russell Brunson. My fellow funnel hackers, I want to talk to you about whatever.\" Calling them out. Then the next thing is, this is ... We ask people to share like, \"Hey, if you like this video, at the end of it if you can please share it, that way I know if you like this content, and I'll make more like this. If you don't like it, don't share it and I just won't make any more like this.\" Some people are like, that's how they're voting if they like it, by sharing. Which is huge. The first 15 seconds, we tell them to share it if they like it, we ask them to do a favor like, \"Hey, if you thought this was awesome, share it. That way I know.\" Huge thing. Then, four minutes of teaching. I would say teaching/telling epiphany bridge stories is more important. Telling a good story. The end of it, a call to action to whatever it is your front end things is. \"Go get my free books.\" Anthony, every single day, he's showing one biohack, and then \"Hey, go get my book Biohackersguide. Com.\"</p> <p>Then down here, the very first post ... As soon as he starts a video ... When you first do a video , first it goes out to your fan page, right? Anthony has zero people on his fan page, the first probably hundred videos, right? Nobody was there. He just did it, and then as soon as it's done, then what our guys will do, they'll come in the very first post. We try to post the link to the actual offer, so that everyone sees that initially. It's pulls in a picture of the product, stuff like that. Somebody manually is adding that in. Now, because he's got more of a following, as soon as he starts a thing, someone goes in and posts it really quick as the first comment, so it sticks there, then it goes live.</p> <p>What we do is typically, for each of these videos it goes live, we put about five bucks behind it, just to see what's going to happen. If you've got more of an audience initially, you don't put money behind it. If you have zero audience initially, you put about five to 10 bucks behind it, just to see which ones get some traction. Then as soon as one thing gets traction, the way that we judge traction is right here, is the ration. It's the 1% share to view ratio. How many people viewed it and how many people shared it? As soon as you get 1% share/view, we call that internally it's a force to viral video, which means I can spend as much money as I want and it's going to go viral and it's going to make us a bunch of money.</p> <p>About one out of 10 hit that number, and then we dump as much money as we want or can or need to behind that and it'll just kind of blow up. For me, this is ... the biggest thing I can give you guys is this.</p> <p>Speaker 12: Is the 1% based off of views?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: It's the ratio of views to shares.</p> <p>Speaker 12: Views to shares.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: This video's got 1.4 million views. Its got 10,000 shares, so it's 1%.</p> <p>Speaker 12: [inaudible 01:06:19]</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Huh?</p> <p>Speaker 12: [inaudible 01:06:23]</p> <p>Russell Brunson: We're not mathematicians, we're marketers. You are definitely way smarter than me. It looks like one to me. It's a ball park. If it's close, we're going to blow it up. That's kind of about what we're looking at. Then we can promote it. What's cool about this, if you think about everything we talked about earlier, right? We talked about traffic temperature up here, right? What's cool about these videos is that, every video, you're learning what people respond to and what they don't respond to. We realize like, \"Wow, they actually care about biohacking vegetables. Let's do more things like that, cause they shared it.\" You're able to speak to different times. You can speak sometimes in techno babble and you're going to boost ... It may not do as good, but you're going to boost it to different audience. For me, I might do a Facebook live talking about funnels for network marketers and I do it and nobody on my page cares, but now that video, that ad's done and my guy will blow up all the network marketing companies, and then boom. We get all the network marketers to come underneath us.</p> <p>I might do one, funnels for real estate agents. Funnels for ... I'm just, it's like carving out little pieces of the market you can then target differently. It also helps you figure out what people actually care about, what they're listening to, what they click on, what they share. As of right now, this is such a big piece of our strategies, because we're learning so much so fast. I mean, I could write a thousand surveys and not get the same data we get from just doing a daily video, every single day, consistently, consistently, consistently doing it.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: From the funnel side, those are the keys you guys, and hopefully that helps a lot.</p> <p>Speaker 16: [inaudible 01:10:05]</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Am I allowed to celebrate something? Just kidding. We do an event once a year, that's ... Tony Robbins is our key note this year and it's basically me on stage, with a bunch of our ... [inaudible 01:10:18] difference. Me on stage and then we've got people that are click funnels members who are doing it in different markets. We got a really cool couple, Brandon and Kayla. They're in the fitness industry. They sell $149 product. All they do is Facebook lives. In fact, they do an entire webinar pitch on Facebook live and they'll do ... During a live Facebook live, they do 150,000, 200,000 dollars live on it, and they boost it afterwards and do five, six, seven hundred thousand dollars. I've done ... Jason talks about webinars later today.</p> <p>Speaker 17: That's incredible.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Doing, if you do a whole bunch of these viral videos like this on your Facebook live, and you're building an audience and stuff's coming that's really, really good, then you come in and you do your entire webinar. I've done three Facebook lives that were me doing my entire webinar live and in front of everyone, just talking. Al of it over a quarter million dollars in sales, cause it's just engagement and live and it's really fun. A lot of cool ways you can use that. Anyway. I hope that helps you guys and ...</p> <p>Speaker 18: That's awesome. That was good. Thank you.</p>", "duration": "24:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/302_-_Secrets_From_The_100k_Meeting_-_Part_3_of_3.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485378879, "title": "Episode #301 \u2013 Secrets From The $100k Meeting - Part 2 of 3", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The 3 steps to build a cult\u2026</p> <p>Today\u2019s episode is part 2 of a 3 part series of Russell speaking at a $100k event where he taught about the psychology of funnels.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you will hear in part 2:</p> <ul> <li>The three things you need to build a culture or a following.</li> <li>Why having a new opportunity is the most important part of building a culture.</li> <li>And what the difference is between an Opportunity Switch and an Opportunity Stack.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how to build a cult following.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Russell Brunson: My next book I'm working on now, it's called Expert Secrets and it's really about building a cult, to be completely honest. I don't ... Well, we call it cult-ure. If you get through my inner circle [inaudible 00:29:13], we have big things about, \"Hey, we've got to build a cult.\" Sure. As I was preparing for this book, I started studying, I got super deep in to cults. I wanted to understand how they work and why they work and so I was reading all the amazing books on cult dynamics and you know, just totally geeked out on it. After looking at a whole bunch of things, I'm like, \"What's the pattern?\" The pattern I found for every single cult is this. Three things. Number one, every single cult has an attractive character. A charismatic leader. Whatever you want to call it, right? Typically, for most of you guys, that's you in the business. There's somebody who's like leading the march, right?</p> <p>What's interesting is, I'll go through these ... This is true for negative cults and positive cults. It's the exact same for Hitler as it was for Christ. It's the exact same for Hillary as Trump. It's fascinating, you start looking at it. Every mass movement across time, follows this exact same pattern. One is the attractive character. Number two, in to bring their people in to a future cause mission. This is where we're going. This is the plan. This is what's happening. That's number two.</p> <p>The thing I want to spend the most time on, because this is the key to everything, is they always offer people a new opportunity. Okay? When Christ came, what was the new opportunity he offered? He said, \"Look, we've been doing a lot. Moses is doing all these kind of things. That's gone away. No longer do you have to do animal sacrifices. Now we're switching over to, you come to me with a broken heart and contrite spirit. It's different.\" Hitler came. World War One, Germany got all this oppression, all these kind of things and said, \"Look, we're not going to try that. I'm not going to help you guys to solve this issue and pay our debts off. We're going to freaking take this thing over and we're going to get this new opportunity, new Germany. It is a new opportunity.\"</p> <p>What most of us are doing, is we create products, we call these in our, in my world they call them urb products. Products that will make you better, smarter, happier, faster. That's the worst possible thing you could do. Okay? We also have these improvement offers. Improvement. Same thing. Improvement offers or ER offers. If you were selling an improvement offer to somebody, I'm going to help you to improve. What are the things that they have to admit before they give you money?</p> <p>[inaudible 00:31:31]</p> <p>Speaker 4: That they suck at what they're doing. For me to give you money, I have to admit that I failed. That's it, okay? Improvement offers are the worst possible things on earth and if your product's like, \"Yeah, my product makes you smarter, it makes you stronger, it makes you faster, it makes you better, it makes you happier, it makes you sadder, it makes you ...\" If you can tie an er to it, that's why your business sucks. To be completely honest. Okay? This is the biggest problem most people have, is that ... How many of you guys are looking and you're like, \"Crap, I have an improvement offer, to help you become better,\"? Right?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: That's the biggest problem. People do not want to get better. Perry [Beltzer 00:32:03] was telling me this. He said, \"2% of the world has ambition.\" 2% of the world wants to become better. 98% of the world do not want to become better. As soon as you position what you're selling as an improvement offer, 98% of the world just left. You've lost 98% of your market instantly. Now you're selling to 2% who actually want to become better. Way harder to do. Okay? If you want to get a mass movement and you want to build a cult share of people that give you money, it comes down to this. It's creating a new opportunity. That's what people want. Everyone wants a new opportunity.</p> <p>The question comes back, how do I create a new opportunity. I was looking at all the different opportunities that we looked at. New opportunity. They are basically all new opportunities can be broken down in to one of two things. Number one, we call it opportunity switch. Number two is an opportunity stack. Most of your offers ... The good news is, typically you don't have to change your whole product, you have to change the positioning of that product. If I come to people and say, \"Look, this is the current opportunity that you are living your world under. I'm not going to help you make that better, because it sucks and it's painful.\"</p> <p>The other thing about improvement offers is, most people have been doing that their whole life and they've tried to get better, they've tried to get better, tried to get better. In their mind, they associate pain with becoming better at that thing. As soon as I offer a new opportunity, they have no idea what that means. There's no preconceived notions, there's no idea of pain It's just like, \"Wow, this is a new thing.\" It's the reason why this did so well. I didn't say, \"Hey, this is a way to lose more weight.\" I said, \"Look, this is a whole new opportunity. No longer do you have to work out hard to get your body in the state to burn fat. You take this thing, it tastes like candy. You mix it in water, you stir it up, you drink it, and your body is in a fat burning state instantly. This is a whole new opportunity.\" Boom, a hundred million bucks, right?</p> <p>It's all about that opportunity switching, or opportunity stacking. Some people ... I always look at this as like, an opportunity switch is like, \"Hey, you're driving a Volvo. I'm going to put you in a Ferrari.\" I'm switching your opportunity. Here is like, \"Okay, you've got a Volvo. You love it, but on the weekends you need a nice car, so I'm going to stack ... It's an opportunity stack, I'm going to sell you a Ferrari, so now you've got both of those.\" Then the opposite of all these is obviously the improvement offer. This is ... Do you guys know Perry Beltzer? If you want to hear how Perry explains this ... Perry was explaining, the first time I heard him talk about this was, he was talking about from like a marriage standpoint, right?</p> <p>You're in your marriage, you're not happy, you've got three options. Number one, you can improve, you can go to counseling. Yay, that would be so much fun, right? So much pain, right? Number two, you get a new wife. Number three, you sleep with the secretary and you just have an opportunity, right? That's like, these are easy things for people to go to. This is pain, this is hard, this is why people do not want this. If you're structuring like this, you've got to say, \"Look, let me step back. How do I change what I'm selling to this?\" If I can figure out how am I taking ... What's the opportunity they're currently in, that I'm trying to move them to? If you look at the good offers, if you look at ... I was in weight loss, now I eat probiotics. This is a whole new opportunity. You didn't even understand this, but as your gut's all jacked up. This is the new opportunity. Holy crap, I don't have to run and lose weight. All these things I've tried in the past, I could try this new thing. That's the key.</p> <p>How do you structure what you sell as a new opportunity? That's the key. To really understand that, is to really get clear. What are they currently doing, cause people have this desire, that's why they came to you, right? They have something they're currently doing and that, to get that need met. You're looking at, here's the need they're trying to get met through some vehicle. What's the vehicle they're currently using. I need to get them out of that vehicle, in to my vehicle that's going to help them meet that same desire. I've got to become crystal clear like, this is how they're trying to meet their desire, this is the vehicle or the option they're currently in. I'm getting them to switch out of that to this one. That's what we have to rethink through your brain, of how to structure what you're doing. Does that make sense?</p> <p>You see that there's going to be an opportunity switch, like you're getting out of this vehicle, moving to this one, or \"Hey, you're currently doing something that's good, I'm not going to make it better, but I'm going to stack a different opportunity on top of it. This might be, you've got a gym right now. I've got a buddy that does, he comes in to gyms and adds on a whole new [inaudible 00:36:31] and he says, \"You already have a gym, you're already doing [inaudible 00:36:33], you're already doing your stuff. I'm going to come in and I'm going to stack a whole new opportunity on top of it, maybe it's a yoga studio inside your gym, or it's going be a different marketing business stack as opposed to an improvement.\" Okay?</p> <p>I'm curious if you guys, you're looking at this within what you offer right now, how many of you guys think that what you're offering is probably an, is\u00a0 How going to be an opportunity stack to your market? How many is it going to be an opportunity switch?</p> <p>[inaudible 00:37:02]</p> <p>Speaker 5: Many of you guys, it's going to be both, yes.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: You know what I think that opportunity stack by doing 100k.</p> <p>Speaker 6: Stack it. Stack it. Thank you for setting this up. If you think about this, typically when somebody is first coming in to my universe, the first time they meet me, my first job typically is an opportunity switch. How many of you guys, when you came in to 25k, it was an opportunity switch? Like, \"I've been trying to get these things met in NEO or YEO or through this or that.\" It's like, \"Crap, none of that stuff works. I'm going to try this.\" How many of you guys it was an opportunity switch, when you came in to that? Now you switched to get in there, and then typically, the back end stuff are more stacks. Now you're sold on this opportunity, now how do we stack things? Okay? Any questions about that?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: [inaudible 00:37:45] Improvement off of this. I mean, he's offering basically like [inaudible 00:37:54].</p> <p>Speaker 7: It's how you sell it. You do it that way. I got in to Bulletproof, and I don't drink coffee, but I was like, he was like, \"Hey man. I was hiking this Himalayan mountain and I met some dudes with yaks and they gave me some hot chocolate, some coffee, with yak butter in it. I drank it and I felt amazing, and it turns out I lost a whole bunch of weight, and I have way more energy after drinking yak butter. Have you guys read that story? That's his initial opportunity switch, should I wait? I'm going to put butter in my coffee, to lose weight? That's a switch. Then you're going to feel better and healthier, you're going to get those things they want, but ... It's like, even ...</p> <p>Russell Brunson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I remember when Biggest Loser, the last Biggest Loser episode was on and I watched. Dave posted something, it cracked me up. He was like, making fun of this, right? Like, \"Here's Biggest Loser. They're going to eat healthy, they're going to lose weight, they're going to do all of these kind of things.\" He's like, \"I want to make my own version of Biggest Loser, but it'd be really boring. It would be a bunch of guys, sitting around drinking coffee, working our computers, losing weight doing nothing.\" That's an opportunity. That sounds way better than this, right? I want to switch ... I need to switch opportunities. He could've positioned it as something different, the positioning is how you get the switch. [inaudible 00:39:01], most of these, you don't have to change your offer. You just change how you're positioning that offer. Did you have something D?</p> <p>Yeah, I was just going ... I was just telling him to turn my mic on for a second. It's funny. Dude, I hope everybody knows the value of how he's breaking this down, because this is stuff ... What you've done better than me is, you articulate what you do in a better way than I know how to. What I had internally for years, and I would teach my team too, in the same opportunity switch or stack, compared to improvement is, I'd watch people and the difference of, when it's somebody new, in my head, the way I was ... I like this better. This analogy's better, but I used to look at opportunities, like the switch was, when you're going to a new prospect, you have to prove there's gold in those hills. You have to tell them that there's gold in California, and you should get your ass on a ricking horse or car and get to California, cause there's gold in those hills.</p> <p>D: It's a switch. It's like, I'm working my ass off. I don't know what I'm doing, but there's gold, where you can just dig and you find it. Then once they get there and you prove that there's gold in those hills, then you got to sell them sharper picks, shovels and tools and better maps. That's the opportunity stack. I see so many people flop it. They'll be on a front end offer, offering improvements. \"Here's a better pick, here's a better shovel.\" You didn't prove that there's gold in the hills yet. They're not digging yet. When you think about, I first have to prove that probiotics are the fucking answer, not a better probiotic or an improved probiotic. Anyway. This is so brilliant, the way you explain this dude. I love it.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Really impressed. I mean, I always love what you do, but I love the science behind your art.[crosstalk 00:40:41] I like the science behind your art.</p> <p>D: I'm totally geeking out on this right now, cause it's like, my new book's all on this stuff. It's so fun. One thing cool, how many of you guys have read the book Red Ocean, Blue Ocean?</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Yes.</p> <p>Speaker 9: I never read it, but I saw the cover. I was like, \"Oh, that's cool.\" I got the gist, right. I think, I haven't read the book, but I think the gist was this. It's like there's this red ocean over here of improvement offers, where we're all fighting over trying to like, \"Oh, mine's better. I have a little better mouse trap. Mines a little. No mine.\" You're fighting over features and benefits and all this crap. Everyone's over here and there's all these sharks and there's blood in the water. If you have an improvement offer, you are in a red ocean and you are fighting against every single other person out there. It sucks. You become a blue ocean, make an opportunity switch, now you're the only ones there. Price goes out the door, resistance goes out the door. All those things magically disappear, because you're a new opportunity. What do you have to compare it to? It's different. It's a whole different thing.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Eventually after you, like Bulletproof, right. Dave's done that, now there's people coming in to that ocean, but he created this blue ocean. That's why that's such a huge influx initially, cause it's such a different conversation. It's a whole different opportunity, went crazy, now everyone's jumping in to that pool and it'll get more and more bloody. I think for Dave to keep reinventing himself, it's going to be that. Like, what's the new opportunity? What's the next opportunity switch. I need to give them to you. That's what I'm always thinking in my business. What's the next thing and where am I coming back at it?</p> <p>If you look at the [inaudible 00:42:01], any mass movements, that's the key. For me, it's like, I'm not trying to sell products. Selling products is like transactional. It's one offer. I'm trying o build a cult. If you come to my event, you will see it's a cult. People are insane. We all wear the same tshirts. If you go to any marketing even in the country right now, half the audience is wearing my tshirts. We are a tribe, we are a cult, we are people who have a vision. My people know where we're going. We know what we're doing. People are bought in to it. It's insane. Now, when I'm stacking opportunities, I don't have to even try and they just buy the next thing and the next thing and the next thing, because it's like, they're bought in to this mission.</p> <p>If you start looking at your businesses and your companies less like, \"What's my transactional thing and I'm going to get a lead and I'm going to sell them.\" All those kind of things. \"How do I build an experience, where they come in and they get these things. They're attached to a charismatic leader. Okay, we've got something bigger than, that we're going towards collectively as a whole, and we offer new opportunity to them, that they can't get anywhere else.\" That's how you build this thing, that's so much bigger than what you could do. Right now it's crazy. We get between five and six hundred people a day that sign up for click funnels and everyone's like, \"Where do those people come from?\" I have no idea. No idea. No idea. My colt's talking about it, everywhere.</p> <p>Where ... Where'd you go? Oh, he was telling me yesterday, he was in an airplane. Some kid from South Africa sitting next to him was like, \"You've got to read this book. It's the greatest thing in the world.\" That's what we're doing. We're trying to get people who are like, your person at the thing, right? Your hairdresser or ...</p> <p>Florist.</p> <p>Speaker 9: Florist, yeah. That's what we're trying to do, and I think that, f we're looking at things more like that, that's the key. I wanted to get in to that first, before we get in to kind of some funnel stuff, because that's the key to it, right? Understanding the strategy, understanding like, \"Look. If you're selling from here, nobody's buying your stuff.\" Your warm audience is buying it, they'll give you money, but you can not grow beyond that, because of your own language patterns. Language is the key, right? You've got to step back here, and this is the key, is mastering this.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Stay in control of the epiphany bridge is like, what is the story that brings people in to the new opportunity. For me, I'm thinking ... The one thing I'm thinking about is, what's the story that got me in to this opportunity? If I was Dave Ashbury, I'd be telling his yak butter story way more often than he does. I had to find it on his blog and I was like, \"Holy crap.\" If I was him, I'd be telling that story every single day, three or four times. Over and over and over again, cause that epiphany story is what got people in to the new opportunity. Have any of you here ever heard my potato gun story? I am so sick of that story, I've probably told it a thousand or more times, but it's my story about how I understood funnels. That was it, so I tell that story over and over and over and over again. That's what gets people in to the opportunity.</p> <p>Mastering the story, because I think, for most businesses, most of us aren't going to have someone amazing like Craig, who can write copy. It's going to be hard, it's expensive to outsource something, but you as the ... Like you said earlier. I can sell the crap out of my own stuff, right? You don't need a copywriter then. You need to get super good at telling your story from here, that's your VSL. That's your upsell. Everything is tied to that. It's not going to be as efficient as what Craig, or a really good copywriter can do, but it's faster, it's better.</p> <p>We put out so much stuff so quickly, because I don't have to sit down and a pad of paper every single time. I get myself in front of a video, I click record and I'm doing this. What's the story I've got tell people to give them the epiphany, so they understand that this is the new opportunity. What's the story I've got to tell people to get them the epiphany, so they want to stack on this opportunity to what they're currently doing. If I just get good at story telling, that process, it gives you the ability to do things very, very quickly, without having to guess and tweak and [inaudible 00:45:29], all those kind of things.</p>", "duration": "18:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/301_-_Secrets_From_The_100k_Meeting_-_Part_2_of_3.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485299460, "title": "Episode #300 \u2013 Secrets From The $100k Meeting - Part 1 of 3", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The Epiphany Bridge, State Control, Kinda Like Bridges</p> <p>Today\u2019s episode is part 1 of a 3 part series of Russell speaking at a $100k event where he taught about the psychology of funnels.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you will hear in part 1:</p> <ul> <li>How if you have something you are geeking out over or passionate about, it is the perfect thing to sell others on.</li> <li>How the epiphany bridge works including how to get your audience to have the same epiphany you had in order to get them to buy into you.</li> <li>And how to tell a story to make your audience feel how you felt.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear the first part of Russell\u2019s presentation about the epiphany bridge.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Speaker 1: How many of you have this thing called a website? Okay.</p> <p>Speaker 2: What's that?</p> <p>Speaker 1: Now, yeah it's this thing on this thing called the internet, that came out a couple decades ago. I look at anything online as real estate. Back in my direct mail days, when there was no internet, I always loved the line, \"The difference between a one dollar bill and a hundred dollar bill is the message on the paper.\" Same paper, same ink, different message. One change in the message could make that same piece of paper worth a hundred times more. The same thing goes with any of the virtual space. It's what you say, how you say it, how you compel people. Someone that actually knows how to print virtual money, would be Russell Brunson, and he has a whole process and a whole company and a whole software that can do this for you, and so he's going to take you through something that I'm sure could be potentially worth millions, if not tens of millions of dollars to all of you. Give it up for Mr. Russell Brunson.</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Well, I'm excited to be here. Excited to share some cool stuff. I didn't do my presentation until last night, cause I wanted to see what you guys, what I think would be the most help for everyone. That's kind of where I came up with some handouts. Do you guys all have these?</p> <p>Okay, so what I want to do is, I'm not going to show you guys anything about click funnels, cause that doesn't matter. I want to bridge some gaps, hopefully help you guys understand the psychology of funnels, cause if you understand that, then everything else becomes easier. I think that's the most essential part for us as the entrepreneurs in the business, to really understand. Hopefully this will kind of bridge some of the things from the copywriting and other things we've been talking about.</p> <p>Okay, a couple things. Craig yesterday was talking about Maslov's hierarchy of needs, which was like, I was totally geeking out and loving it. I look at things very similar. I just flip it on the side kind of. I want to kind of reshow this, cause it'll help my next thing I'm going to explain make more sense. I look at the world where there's like, there's cold traffic, there's warm traffic and then there's hot traffic, right? I got the picture there in my little handouts. If you've ever read my book, Dot Com Secrets, I sketch out everything I do, cause I'm a visual person, so this is the sketch.</p> <p>I learned this originally from Jean Schwartz. He talked about, if you look at any market, there's this awareness, this cycle of awareness, right? Where we hear people are unaware of what's happening. After they're unaware, eventually they become problem aware. From problem, they become solution aware. From solution, they become product aware. Then they're most aware. Just kind of noticing, the peoples companies here who are doing well, but not where they want to be, it's almost ... The biggest thing I see everyone doing, is that you've become masters at selling here. This is the warm market, right? You become really good at that, but to scale, you've got to step back. You've got to come back to here. This is like your existing audience, who loves you. This is like Facebook, they love the market, but they don't understand you. This is like the cold, hard masses and in my mind, the only way to drill past 10 million or so ... I think most businesses can be really successful here, you have to master this to get to about 10 and beyond 10, you've got to become a master of this.</p> <p>This is like, how do you create your offer in a way that it goes to the masses, which is very similar to what Craig was talking about. That's kind of how I look at things, and it kind of leads me to the first important thing I want to talk about here. It's called the Epiphany Bridge. Anybody here ever done network marketing?</p> <p>Speaker 1: We're very [inaudible 00:07:36]</p> <p>Russell Brunson: [inaudible 00:07:36], they've done network marketing. Okay, so I'm going to grab something real quick, cause it'll help illustrate this. I have a buddy who started a network marketing company and he wanted me to join in and to market. I said no a million times, but eventually he sent me some of the product. I loved it, it was really, really good. This is a company called Prove It. Anybody here ever heard of Prove It? No one here? Okay. If you've studied Dave Ashbury's stuff about high fat diet, skinnier body [inaudible 00:08:03], this is the product they made. You drink it, outs your body immediately in ketosis. Tastes like candy, and it's awesome.</p> <p>I helped them write a pitch and wrote this pitch for them. They took it out and in the first six months, the company had $20 million dollars this pitch. This year'll be over a hundred million dollars, and it's just growing like crazy, because of the pitch. Now, I want to explain. After the pitch, they wanted me to come out to the leadership team and explain to these network marketers how to use this [inaudible 00:08:30] that I created for them, right? I'm like, I love network marketers, but I'm also scared to death of them, cause they're like ... They just pounce on you. You know, that feeling where you're just like, I was getting pounced by everyone. I come in this room, and I walk in, it's this room, probably about three times as many people as this, and they want me to show them how to use this new message to sell more stuff.</p> <p>I'm looking out in the audience, and I'm trying to think, \"What am I going to talk about to these guys. They don't understand funnels or marketing. They're a bunch of people who are selling stuff. As I'm looking out at this audience, of these network marketers, and prior to me coming in the room, I was watching them as they were pouncing on hotel employees and other people, and I had this thing just popped in to my head. I want to share this, cause it's the key now to everything we do. This is a typical person, right? I'm going to make fun of network marketers, but this is you, right? In your business. We were born, we went to school, things were going well, and all of a sudden, something happened in your life that got you excited about what you're excited about, right? Dean probably, initially he sold a car and was like, \"Holy crap. I can sell cars and make money.\" Right? Then he sold a house.</p> <p>Every one of you guys, something happened. You were just normal humans. Something happened and all of a sudden, you had an epiphany, where you were like, \"Holy crap, real estate's the greatest thing in the world. Holy crap, financial stuff.\" Something happened, where you had this big epiphany, and it changed your whole life, right? Do you guys all remember that moment, when it happened for you? He got his epiphany and then he went over here and then all of a sudden, the worst thing possible happened. You started like, \"This is the coolest thing in the world.\" You start geeking out on it, right? I'll draw this dude with glasses. You start geeking out, and you're like, \"Oh this is so cool.\" You start studying, and you just start doing the research, and you start going deep. I was looking at these network marketers, and I was like, \"This product ...\"</p> <p>I was watching these guys in the hallway and people walking by, and they're pouncing on people, and they're like, \"Dude, you've got to quit burning glucose. That's why you're so fat. You got to switch your fuel from glucose to ketones. If you do that, you won't be fat anymore.\" It's like, \"Man, if you had beta hydroxy blueberry salt in your drinks and in your coffee ...\" All this stuff. I'm watching this, right? What happens is we come in to this world, we get excited, and we start geeking out, and the worst thing possible happens to us. We learn this thing we call techno babble. In every one of your businesses, you've got a crap ton of techno babble, right? IT's these words that you use to describe things.</p> <p>What happens is, you meet this prospect, and they're so cool, and you grab them, and you're like, \"Okay, this is my prospect. I've got my shot at him.\" You're about to, like, \"I'm going to tell him everything I know, and they're going to buy my crap, and it's going to be amazing.\" Then it's \"blugh,\" and you spew out all this techno babble on the person, right? I'm watching these network marketers just spew out this stuff out at people and they're freaking out and they run away. For most of your businesses, how many of you guys know that you use techno babble? There's words for your industry that you use, that you shouldn't probably be using, okay? The reason why ... What happens, this warm market understands your techno babble. They're excited and they'll buy your crap over and over and over and over again. Okay? Everybody else? They haven't geeked out yet.</p> <p>They key, this is what I found, the key for me to sell anything, is I have to stop this right here. I've got to cross out techno babble and I've got to stop this, cause this is what kills sales. I've got to figure out what was it that gave me the experience that caused me to go on this journey? If I can figure out what gave me this epiphany, and if I can give somebody else that epiphany, I do not have to sell them anything, ever. They'll have that epiphany in their mind and they're going to geek out and then they will cause a revolution. They will go so crazy on it. I've got to step back here.</p> <p>When I was talking to this network marketing group, and the pitch I wrote ... I was telling Craig this yesterday. I got equity for the company for writing a pitch. It took me less than an hour to write the entire thing. The reason why, the [inaudible 00:12:11] wrote this pitch he sent to me, it was like the worst thing ever. I was dry heaving in my mouth, like \"Ugh, that was such a bad ...\" It was all this. Thousands of pounds of techno babble, just spewing forth and I couldn't even read the whole thing. I was like, \"This is so bad.\" He's a friend, it was like two o'clock in the morning, I was sitting in bed. I was like, \"I know he's going to call me, wanting me to critique it and give him feedback, but it just sucks, the whole thing.\" I just deleted the whole thing and I was like, \"I'm just going to rewrite this for him.\"</p> <p>The first thing I did, is I was like ... Cause I believe in this product. I believe in the concept. I was like, \"This is really, really cool.\" I was like, \"What was it that gave me the epiphany, that got me excited? Why do I drink this crap every day now? What was it that gave me that epiphany?\" I was thinking back and it took me a while to realize. I was thinking like, \"When was it? Some time in my life, something happened where I was sold on that.\" Then I was going back here, and all of a sudden, I remembered. I remembered the moment that I had the epiphany. I was at a seminar. I went out to eat with my buddy, his name's Aaron Lily. Do you guys ever remember in Skymall Magazine, the cream that they would sell that you put on your mole and your mole would fall off? Have you ever seen that? He's the inventor of that.</p> <p>I'm out to dinner with the guy. Super cool, doing insane amounts of money with that business. We sit down to eat and he's super ripped and healthy and everything and he ... I order this amazing dinner, and he's ordering chicken with a side of butter. I thought it was weird. Then he's eating it, and he's dipping his chicken in butter and eating it and I'm like, \"Dude, you are a freak. What's wrong?\" He was like, \"Oh, it's this whole thing.\" All of a sudden, he started giving me techno babble and so I started making fun of him more, cause it just that gave me fuel for my teasing, right? I'm making fun of him and he's like, \"No, no,\" He said, \"Okay, let me explain it like this.\" He's like, \"Your body ... \" Wow.</p> <p>\"Your body's kind of like a campfire, right?\" He said, \"If you think about it, you have a campfire, you feed it kindling, right? You throw a bunch of kindling on it, what happens?\" I was like, \"It burns really fast, then it goes away.\" He's like, \"Okay, cool. That's like carbs. That's why you wake up in the morning, you eat Cheerios and you get like Ahh and then like 10 minutes later, you're starving. Your kids have ADD and they're bouncing off the walls, cause it's carbs. You just keep putting more carbs in, your body gets more hungry. That's how that world works.\"</p> <p>I was like, \"Okay, cool.\" He's like, \"Proteins are kind of like getting a log and you throw a log on the fire and it'll burn a little bit longer, but same thing. It burns up and then it eventually goes away.\" He's like, \"Fats are like coal. It's like throwing coal on. It's harder to get the fats to catch on fire, but once they're on fire, they burn warm and hard and dark. That's the best energy source, cause as soon as they're lit up, they'll burn all through the night.\" He said, \"That's like eating fat. If you can transition your body from needing carbs and proteins, to processing fat, then you've got this amazing thing where you lose weight, you feel more energy and everything.\"</p> <p>I was like, \"Oh, so that's why you're dipping your chicken in butter. I get it.\" It made sense to me, right? [inaudible 00:14:48] this pitch, I just wrote a little, it's a three minute explainer video, about a dude and a campfire. I tell my epiphany and why it's important to be in ketosis and how this product puts you in ketosis instantly and that was the pitch. Three minute video, took the company from zero to a hundred million dollars in 18 months. It's because I figured that out, cause that speaks to everyone. I'm not dropping techno babble and all this other stuff. Does that make sense?</p> <p>The biggest thing that I think I can share with all you guys, is this. Is figuring out how to get out of this state, cause this is where all you guys are stuck at. I've heard you guys talking about your business and you're always throwing techno babble, assuming that any of us have any idea what you're talking about and most of the times, I have no idea what any of you guys are talking about. It's because this is so second nature, so you're super power, this is what you're good at and you understand. This is where you lead from. If you get rid of that and figure out this piece, this is the key.</p> <p>I'm going to share some other things, because I have so much respect for what Craig does. I don't think anyone's ever studied him. It's probably creepy for him to know how much I watch\u00a0 what he does, cause I have so much respect. What he does is like a sniper rifle, right? He spends so much time to craft his message, he's just flawless. When he gets it right, it's like a sniper rifle and blows up a company. I'm not nearly as skilled as him. What I've become a master at is this process, at telling these stories. I watch good copy like his, so I can get good at incorporating it in to my speech patterns. I think I'm kind of like a blend between these two. I'm kind of in the middle there, and I'm doing a lot of stuff to be able to figure out messaging. I'll kind of show you guys that here in a minute.</p> <p>This is the best copywriting, I think, is mastering this piece. Mastering the telling of stories, because the process that I'm going to show you guys here, you can do a lot of them, every single day you're doing them, and you're finding the ones that work and you're pushing away the ones that don't. You can move through things really, really quick. Okay? Any questions about epiphany bridge? One other thing, I had a big realization the other day, as I was kind of going through this. How many of you guys have ever had something amazing happen to you, and you go to tell your friend, like, \"This cool thing happened.\" You're telling this whole story and they're like, \"Oh.\" You're like, \"No, no, no, no.\" You tell it to them again and they're like, \"No, that sounds really cool man.\" You're like, \"No, dude. God, you had to be there. If you were there, you would have felt what I felt.\" How many of you guys have ever done that before? Right?</p> <p>That's the biggest problem we have, is a lot of times when we tell these stories, this is why it's so important to become good at this, is we just, we suck at telling the story and then they don't have the epiphany. My job is not to tell them what epiphany they're supposed to have. My job is to set up an environment and a story that causes them to have this epiphany. When Marcus Lemonis spoke at our last funnel hacking live event, I had a 30 minute window before the event started, where we could sit down and just kind of talk, right? First time I'd ever met him and he gets there and he walks in and he's got this really confused look on his face.</p> <p>He's like, \"I thought you guys were a website builder.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, we are.\" He's like, \"Why is everyone so crazy outside?\" You come to our events, it's more like a Tony Robbins event than anything. People are going nuts and going crazy and I was like, \"Well, it's more than that. We're building a culture of people that love what we do [inaudible 00:17:57]\" He's like, \"What's a funnel?\" First thing I do, stupid me, I start trying to explain from here, and he's like, \"All right, so why's everyone so excited? I don't get why everyone's excited. You build websites.\" I was like, \"Ugh.\" All of a sudden I was like, \"Okay, I've got to tell my story.\"</p> <p>I came back and I told him a story, the story that got me excited about funnels, and I explained that story to him and he was like, \"Wait. You're telling me that these can work for anyone, right?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Well, how would it work for Camping World?\" I was like, \"Well, this is what I would do.\" He's like, \"Okay, well how would this work for Sweet Peas?\" I'm like, \"I would do this.\" \"How would this work for ...\" He starts going through his businesses and after three or four of me telling these stories, he stops and he goes, \"Man, every business needs a funnel, right?\" It's like, \"Yeah.\" He goes, \"I got to get you on the show, okay?\" I didn't tell him, \"Hey man, Marcus, every business needs a funnel. You should have me on the show.\" I took him on a journey, told him a story, then I put it up in the air and let him have the epiphany, right?</p> <p>That's the key. I want them to have the epiphany. I don't want to tell it to them. You get them to that state by telling them about the epiphany you had. A couple things about the story telling process, that I've learned that work so good. How many of you guys have ever seen the movie, the X-men movie, where they were little kids, before they became the big X-men? You guys remember that? I can't remember which one it was. There's this scene when Magneto before he ... He was a little kid and they're taking him to a Nazi concentration camp and they start taking him in, he's freaking out and they see the fences start kind of bending and they're like, \"There's something with this kid. He's got some magic powers.\"</p> <p>They pull him in this room and it's this really tiny room, it's got Magneto sitting here, it's got the head of the Nazi party there and it's got Magneto's mom. She's sitting there crying, standing there. The Nazi guy is telling him to move this coin, there's a coin on the desk and little Magneto's trying to move it and trying to move it and he can't get the power to do it. He's trying and he's trying and he's trying, nothing's moving. Then the Nazi guy gets kind of frustrated and looks over, pulls out a gun, shoots his mom in the head, boom and the mom falls dead on the ground. Then you see this scene that's like so powerful. You see this little kid's face and you see the pain and the agony. You see his whole body convulse down, like \"My mom just died.\" Then it transforms from this pain, to this anger and then he comes back up with this just pure anger in his eyes and everything. You see him and he shoves the coin across, he starts crushing all the metal , crushing and everything starts falling around him and he just destroys this whole room. That's how he found his power, right?</p> <p>Now, when watching film, you see that, right? Now words were said, but you see all these things that were happening. You see the pain, you see the frustration, you see the anger, you see ... Us, as an audience, as we're watching that, we feel it. [inaudible 00:20:31] I was just explaining it, you kind of felt some of that. You felt that stuff, right? That's the magic of film. We don't ... Most of us aren't producing films to sell our stuff, and so we have to do that through our words. Imagine if Magneto came and he's like, \"Yeah, so when I was a kid, I was in a Nazi concentration camp. They wanted me to move a coin and I couldn't do it, so they killed my mom. I was pissed, so I blew the whole thing up.\" You're like, \"All right.\" You wouldn't have had the experience, right? Magneto came and he started talking about how he felt.</p> <p>When I'm telling my stories, I go in to how I feel. I talk about, \"Man, I was sitting there, I was so freaked out because my bills were due and I had this stuff and I had this pain in my stomach and it was almost like a heart attack, but it was lower, and I felt this pressure coming down and I literally felt like someone was sitting on my back. Everything was coming down on my. I looked down at hands and they were sweating, yet I was freezing cold. My whole body was shaking and shivering, because I was in so much pain and frustration, so much fear.\" You notice as I'm telling that story, I'm walking you guys through what I'm feeling and you start feeling it your audience starts feeling those things as well, right? My goal, for me telling the story, is I have to get you in the exact same state that I was in when I had the epiphany, or else you will not have that epiphany.</p> <p>If you look at a good author, I mean you'll read books where an author will come in to the room and they'll spend 30 pages explaining the room and the lights and the look and the feel and everything, to set up a scene. Deliver some line, cause they need you to feel that line, but you won't feel it if they haven't set it up correctly. If I want you to have this epiphany, I have to get you in the exact same state that I was in when I had it. Okay? Tony Robbins 101, stay in control. I have to control their state and I do that by telling the story in a way to get you to feel what I felt, so that when I explain how I had my epiphany, you have the exact same epiphany. Does that make sense? Is that the coolest thing? I realized that, I was just like, \"This is like a whole nother level.\" It's so easy when you start understanding, this is how the pieces work and how they all kind of flow together. Any questions about that at all?</p> <p>All right, so if you flip over to the next page. In my inner circle group, people always ask me, \"Okay, I got that [inaudible 00:22:44]. What's the process now?\" I'm a big ... What I do a lot of times, I go through and I look at patterns. I go through and dissect like a hundred sales videos like, \"What's the pattern?\" Then I like sketching out patterns, based on that, so I can replicate it over and over again. I started going through all the stories I tell and I was looking at commonalities. Also, we had an event where we hired ... Any of you guys know Michael Hauge? Michael Hauge, I write his name down, Michael Hauge, H-A-U-G-E? There's an audio with him and, I think, Chris Volgler, on Itunes. It's like a six hour story telling workshop they gave. It's like the best thing in the world.</p> <p>Michael Hauge is, he works in Hollywood and he ... We had him come to one of our events and he was showing everybody, he was like, \"Look at any movie that's ever been successful from the beginning of time, like Batman, Spider man, Titanic, anything. They all follow the exact same script.\" He's like, \"If you look at the screenplay that you get,\" He's like, \"On page number three is when the hero does this. On page 13, they always do this. On page 26 ... Every movie, it's exactly the same.\" He came and talked, but if you listen to that class, it's a college class he's teaching on story telling. It's insane. In fact, have you guys ever seen the movie Hitch? When Will Smith wrote that movie, it was before him and Michael Hauge were like best friends. Will Smith said, \"I was studying Michael Hauge's stuff and I was writing Hitch, 100% trying to follow the keys that Michael Hauge taught.\" Then when it was done, he met Michael Hauge and they became best friends, like super good friends. Now Will Smith, all these guys, Michael's the dude they go to help map out the screenplay. Super fascinating stuff.</p> <p>This became, as I started looking at it, the outlines for most of my stories, but also the outlines, very similar to what they teach in Hollywood. It's kind of interesting, if you go in to it. If you're looking at how I typically teach things, or how I tell my stories, they all start with the backstory. The big reason why is because it's this, right? Coming back to here, people see you over here as this guru on the mountain, if you start your presentation from there. They have no faith r trust or hope in you, right? It's like, \"Ugh. That's Dean. He can get there, but I can't.\" You've got to come down the mountain, come back to where they're at and be like, \"Hey man, this is where you're at. I was here too. Come on, let's go on a journey. I'm going to take you where we're going.\" You start with the backstory.</p> <p>The backstory usually leads you to some kind of wall, which typically is the same wall that your audience is in right now, that's listening to you. Then the first thing you talk about is the external struggle, cause this is what your audience is willing to admit. \"Yeah, I needed more money,\" or \"Yeah, I needed to get in shape.\" You talk about, that's the first struggle. Then the second thing's, you've got to get to the internal struggle, cause this is the only thing that actually matters. This is what Dean was talking about yesterday. Seven why's. This is how I get to my internal struggle. External, I need more money. I ask five or six or seven why's. Why, why, why, why, why? That's the real reason why they care.</p> <p>In your story, you don't talk about ... You mention the external, cause that's where they're at. Then you go in to the internal. You talk about the internal thing that you were struggling with, cause that's where it gets them. You're controlling state, right? That's where you get in to the same state you were in, cause you're actually talking to them on a level that they don't ever share. When you're willing and able to share that, then it causes the empathy you need. From there something happens, you had this epiphany. \"Whoa, check out how cool this thing was.\" Then, after the epiphany, you're like, \"Here's the plan, what I'm going to do.\" After you have the plan, usually you still freak out like, \"Ugh, is it going to work? What if it fails?\" We talk about the painted picture of failure. Then we have the call to action, and then, at the end of it, we have the result.</p> <p>This is kind of an example. I have this on my desk, when I'm doing videos, doing stuff, I just look at this all the time. I make sure I don't miss pieces of it. I probably tell, I don't know, 40 or 50 stories a day. If you look at how much we're publishing stuff, I'm just telling stories all day long, and I want to make sure that I'm following a process. This is there, and this little thing will help, these questions will help walk you through what's your back story and what did you want? There's a problem you encounter, how'd you make it feel? What was the external struggle? What was the internal struggle? What was the epiphany you had? What plan did you come up with after the epiphany? What would happen if you failed? How'd you take action? What was the end experience?</p> <p>Some epiphany bridge stories I tell are a minute to two minutes. Some of them are 30 to 40 minutes. I tell a lot of them. Every one of my presentations ... One of the presentations I did, one of the guys on my team was counting things and in a 56 minute presentation, I told like 30 something stories. I'm telling them a lot, consistently, over. If you guys ever watch\u00a0 my stuff, I can tell story after story after story after story, because that's what gets people here. If you notice, any time I get to something where I come to some kind of technical thing, like when I did the pitch for this. I had to explain ketones, causes there's a word called ketones. Ketones is techno babble, right?</p> <p>As soon as I get to the word ketone, I say, \"Ketone.\" Then I stop and I say, \"Ketones kind of like,\" I step back, \"It's kind of like a million motivational speakers, running through your body.\" Like, \"Oh, cool.\" Now they've got what ketones are and I keep moving on. Any time I introduce any kind of techno babble, I stop instantly, take a step back, I tell a really quick story to make it so that that word means something to them, and then I can keep moving on. Anyway, I'm doing that over and over. Does that help for like a tool for you guys, how to ... People always say \"How do you do your sales videos now?\" It's Really this. These are how, mostly everything we create is from that.</p>", "duration": "28:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/300_-_Secrets_From_The_100k_Meeting_-_Part_1_of_3.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485212809, "title": "Episode #299 \u2013 Getting Excited, Offline Funnels That Work, Make Sure You Don't Sale B To R", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I don't know about you, but I'm pretty excited that I survived the drive to the office today.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about why he always gets excited about everything.

I hope you guys are doing awesome. I\u2019m stuck in the snow right now and most people would be complaining, but guess what. I\u2019m crazy effective right now. I can barely move, apparently in Boise when there\u2019s a half a centimeter of snow it shuts the whole city down. So I\u2019m stuck in the snow.</p> <p>But while I\u2019ve been stuck in the snow, listen to everything I\u2019ve accomplished already. We\u2019re sending out a letter to our Dream100, letting them know about the book launch on April 18<sup>th</sup>. By the way if you guys want to participate in that, mark it on your calendars today. April 18<sup>th</sup> is when the Expert Secrets book is going live. So I was going to write that today, but I was like I don\u2019t have time to write it.\u00a0 So I have a guy on my team, and I think everyone needs a guy on their team that does this. His name is Levi and what he does is, I vox him stuff and he writes it out and cleans it up.</p> <p>So when I want to send emails, I just vox him and then he puts the emails in Clickfunnels and Actionetics and types them all out. Then I look in there, tweak it and then send it out, which has been so great. And then today, for the sales letter I just voxed him, \u201cHey man, I\u2019m stuck in the snow. Here\u2019s the sales letter I want to send out.\u201d So I sent it to him, he\u2019s going to write it out, give it to me, I\u2019ll edit it and then we\u2019ll send out an actual physical sales letter from there.</p> <p>The cool thing about that, I don\u2019t know about most of you guys, but this is the hard thing about writing. This is why I think copywriting is typically so hard and everyone struggles with it. It\u2019s because most of us are really good selling face to face. I can sell you on why you should go see this movie or why you should whatever. Those things are easy to do. But it\u2019s like, if I have to write that to you, it\u2019s so much harder and then you start writing, you\u2019re creative brain that\u2019s really good at selling, starts getting out and your analytical editing brain is like, \u201cWait, you have a typo there. You need a period. You forgot the comma. What about capitalization.\u201d So you\u2019re going back and forth and it\u2019s painful.</p> <p>I know for me, when I start writing emails, I log into Actionetics and start typing it out, I start stressing out because it doesn\u2019t look good. I spend half the time editing and half the time to write. I\u2019m going back and forth, and I know the story is really good, but it takes so long to type it out that I just shorten the story. I don\u2019t even tell it. \u00a0I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just not as good as it could be. So what I do now is vox him the stuff, tell him the story and vox it and he writes it out. I\u2019m like, \u201cDang, that looks actually really good.\u201d He knows the format I like my emails in, so he puts it in 99% the way there and I go and clean it up and send it out.</p> <p>Anyway, I think that\u2019s cool. So I hope you guys think it\u2019s cool too. Because it\u2019ll be a shortcut. But it works for sales letters, works with emails, works with anything you\u2019ve got to write. Even my book, that\u2019s how I wrote my book initially. The first draft came from me dictating through my phone and then Julie on my team re-writing it and then me going back and doing deep edits from there. I think its magic because it pulls the editing side out of your body, or out of your brain and gets you to be creative when you\u2019re just writing. So don\u2019t actually write, just talk.</p> <p>So I got that done, and then I thought that was going to take my whole drive to the office, but I\u2019m halfway there. I\u2019m stuck behind a big old, what\u2019s it called? A tow truck. I guess it\u2019s probably more efficient to have a tow truck behind you, so if you wreck he can pull you out. If I wreck, he\u2019s going to be gone by the time anyone notices.</p> <p>But yeah, I\u2019m stuck. We\u2019re going 1 mile an hour. I got my meeting in 4 minutes. Not going to make it in time. But I got time to hang out with you guys, which is even better. So thank the snow because that\u2019s awesome.</p> <p>So today\u2019s message, what I wanted to talk about, is all about being excited. I think that the worst thing about most people nowadays, nobody is excited about anything. I\u2019ll have the coolest thing and I share it with somebody and they\u2019re like, \u201cWow.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? Wow? That\u2019s all I got from that. Dude, you should be going crazy.\u201d If you notice one thing about me, I get so excited about everything. Even the little dumb things that shouldn\u2019t matter. I just get excited by it.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting what happens when you do this. So a couple of things, when you start getting excited by every single thing that happens, even things that normally aren\u2019t that cool, but you\u2019re like, \u201cThat was awesome.\u201d First off, your brain starts going, \u201cWow that actually was awesome.\u201d Right now I\u2019m out in the snow and this is awesome. I have a chance to share with you guys and get a sales letter. I got two things done today in the snow. How awesome is that? Most people would be like, \u201cI\u2019m in the snow, I\u2019m miserable. Life is crappy.\u201d And that\u2019s the reality most people live in. Where because I\u2019m excited I\u2019m like, \u201cThat is pretty cool. I could do this. What else can I do?\u201d In fact, I was on slack. I downloaded the slack app, which we started using in our office. I\u2019m messaging people and getting crap done while I\u2019m sitting here doing nothing.</p> <p>I also snapchatted a story about the new office. I\u2019m getting a lot of crap done in the snow. And then when cool things do happen, again someone goes to see a movie, I\u2019m like, \u201cHow was the movie?\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cIt was alright.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? How was that alright? You just saw\u2026.\u201dIt could be anything, \u201cYou just saw Batman and Superman fight to the death. It was alright? Are you serious? That was awesome. I don\u2019t care who you are or what you think, that was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>This weekend I saw Rogue One again for the second time. And what was cool was Chad Woolner, one of my buddies/chiropractor, he put this thing on, so this is cool. He, and you may think this is impossible, but he\u2019s an offline business and guess what he did, he used a funnel to make a bunch of money this weekend. So this is what he did. He built a page in Clickfunnels, he recorded a video of him telling a story. He told his origin story about why he got into chiropractic, and at the end he invited people as a guest. He said, \u201cEven if you\u2019re a member of our clinic or not. I don\u2019t really care if your part of a community. But we rented out a whole theater, we\u2019re going to be showing Rogue One, if you want to come. If you want to bring your friends and family, bring them all. It\u2019s my treat because I\u2019m a chiropractor who cares.\u201d And then he sent it out to his list of clients and friends, posted it on Facebook, drew up some ads and everything.</p> <p>And from that he filled up a theater of 300 people, and so my kids and I all went and saw Rogue One with him. So he shows up to Rogue One and he had recorded a whole bunch of video testimonials of all his patients, so everyone is sitting in this movie before the movie starts, a captive audience of 300 people. And he\u2019s playing on the huge screen all these testimonials talking about why he\u2019s amazing, why his clinic is amazing, which is awesome.</p> <p>Then after the movie\u2019s done, as soon as the credits come in, boom he cuts the credits, the lights come up and he\u2019s like, \u201cHey everyone, before you leave, we\u2019ve got some prizes.\u201d So he does a drawing and gives out Star Wars things and everyone\u2019s excited and everyone\u2019s sitting there listening to him, again captivated. He\u2019s got 300 people sitting in the room and then he keeps talking about a special offer, \u201cHey if you guys want to come in and get adjusted by the chiropractor that everyone is talking about in the videos, and the one\u2019s that served you and let you come to this cool movie. If you want this law of reciprocity to work both ways, we\u2019re even going to do something better. We\u2019re going to make a special offer.\u201d What, are you kidding me? You can\u2019t make a special offer if you\u2019re a chiropractor. Everyone charges $40 for an adjustment. \u201cNo, this is what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to make a special offer. If you come in for an initial exam, we\u2019re going to give you a free massage and on top of your massage, we\u2019ll give you a $50 amazon gift card, just for coming in and letting us check you out.\u201d</p> <p>So people are like, \u201cDude, that\u2019s a good offer. I want a free massage and a $50 gift card.\u00a0 It\u2019s worth it to come in. And my neck has been kind of hurt, my back, have him look at it. My insurance is going to pay the bill. I\u2019m in for that.\u201d Boom, all the sudden he gets this table rush, there\u2019s a huge line of people outside, signing up for free chiropractic care. All because of a movie.</p> <p>So first off, I\u2019m sitting there as the marketer in the room freaking out, snapchatting the whole thing. \u201cThis is amazing. I\u2019ll find funnels. Funnels work for offline business, are you kidding me?\u201d How many chiropractors do you know that closed 50 people yesterday? He had a captive audience with 300 people and closed 50 of them on chiropractic care. Yeah, one. The only dude that\u2019s actually using funnels. So there\u2019s number one.</p> <p>Number two is I\u2019m watching this movie for the second time and I\u2019m with my kids. I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is so amazing.\u201d And I\u2019m looking at people, all my Facebook group are writing these reviews, \u201cThe movie is okay, wasn\u2019t\u2019 that funny.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you kidding me? Did you not see that scene with Darth Vader at the end? He\u2019s thrashing everybody. It was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m just saying, you guys need to be more excited. Everyone needs to be more excited.\u00a0 There are some amazing things, we live in this day and era and time when all this amazing stuff is happening around us and we\u2019re missing it because we\u2019re so bored. We\u2019re so unimpressed with the remarkable that\u2019s happening around us. There are literally miracles happening every single day all around us and we\u2019ll look at it like, \u201cMeh.\u201d What? Dude, did you see what just happened? How are you guys just \u2018meh-ing\u2019 that? That\u2019s a big freaking deal. That\u2019s something we should all stop and be like, \u2018wow.\u2019</p> <p>So anyway, I try to be excited all the time. I\u2019m sure it drives some of you guys crazy. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got a lot of people who can\u2019t stand me because of it, but the people I want to surround myself with are those who are seeing the miracles happening around us. Realizing that this stuff that kings would have paid everything they had, given up their entire fortune to watch the movies we get to watch for $10. And the fact that I\u2019m in a car right now, it\u2019s snowing outside, it\u2019s freezing cold, and I\u2019m able to say I want this to be 70 degrees and I want my seat to be warm. It is. I\u2019m sitting in comfort right now.</p> <p>This is better than having\u2026..the Pharaoh\u2019s back in the day would sit in one of those carts people would carry them around. I bet it was still hot. This is the miracle, I click a button, I push my foot down and it moves forward and it\u2019s heated. This is exciting. Are you guys missing this? I may be going to the extreme here, but I want you guys to stop today and I want you to look around and start acknowledging this amazingness that\u2019s happening and be like, \u201cDude, that was awesome. That, right there, that was amazing. That right there, that was amazing.\u201d The fact that I walked, I just drove by a Jack in the Box, I could drive in there right now and for $5 have somebody make me the most amazing meal on earth. That\u2019s amazing. Yeah, that\u2019s not healthy, but it\u2019s pretty amazing, you have to admit.</p> <p>Anyway, there you go you guys. With that said, life is good. Sure, there\u2019s some bad things happening around us, but look around at the miracles. We have it pretty dang, freaking amazing and I hope you\u2019re all grateful for that, because I am and I hope you are as well. So count your many blessings, because they are there. You just gotta look for them.</p> <p>With that said, I\u2019m at the office. I haven\u2019t died, which is like, I\u2019m freaking out excited about that too. I could have wrecked multiple times. I\u2019m a horrible driver right now. I\u2019ve been snapchatting, writing sales letters, and voxing, and podcasting all on this ride and I\u2019ve survived. That\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m pretty stoked about that. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I hope you are. Some of you are like, \u201cMan, I wish he would have died and it would have ended the torture.\u201d But for the rest of you guys, we survived it, that\u2019s exciting. We should all have a party today or something. I don\u2019t know. I think it calls for a party.</p> <p>So alright, there you go you guys. I\u2019m excited, hope you are as well. And for any of you guys wondering if offline funnels work. They do. You gotta think a little bit, you gotta be a little creative, but the key message is the same. Capture results, push people into a funnel, after you\u2019ve done that, try to get a captive audience, create an irresistible offer. The game is the same. Doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re at, you\u2019ve just gotta think through it.</p> <p>I had someone the other day, \u201cYeah, that works for B to C, but it doesn\u2019t work for B to B?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cIt depends, is the B to B, are they people? Because it only works on people.\u201d So yeah, if they\u2019re people that you\u2019re going to be communicating with, this stuff works. If they\u2019re not humans and you\u2019re dealing with robots, I guess\u2026..but b to b, B to C, as long as it\u2019s not B to R, B to robot, business to robot, you\u2019re screwed because robot\u2019s have no emotion. But for everybody else, this crap works.</p> <p>So there you go. We should get t-shirts, that say something about B to R. Okay, I\u2019m pulling into a snow filled thing, and I have my flip\u2026\u2026..oh I\u2019m sliding, I\u2019m sliding, but I\u2019m stopped. And I\u2019m officially at the office and we\u2019re alive. I\u2019m pretty stoked about that too. Alright you guys, talk to you soon. Have a great day and unless you sell B to R you should be smiling because funnels work. Talk to you soon, bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "13:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/299_-_Getting_Excited_Offline_Funnels_That_Work_Make_Sure_You_Dont_Sale_B_To_R.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485104400, "title": "Episode #298 \u2013 Follow The Big Piles Of Cash", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Stop being offended when people market to you and instead, do this\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about clearing out his office to move to the new one and finding old courses that he learned from.

Welcome to Marketing In Your Car. I feel bad, this is 3 podcasts, almost in a row, where I have actually been in my car. I feel like I\u2019m a fraud or a sham or something. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m at the office right now and it\u2019s kind of a bittersweet day. We are packing up the office. All of my books are no longer on the bookshelf. They\u2019re in boxes. Most of my courses I threw away, or my brother Scott took them and is turning them into audiobook files so I can listen to them in my phone. And we threw away literally an entire dumpster full of CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s and courses. It\u2019s a little emotional, I\u2019m not going to lie. But we\u2019re going to survive.</p> <p>A few minutes ago we drove over to the new office and we saw it and everything\u2019s getting put together and it\u2019s so exciting. We have a glass wall, which looks super cool. We have our own bathroom, which may seem lame to you guys, but it\u2019s so exciting for us. Because this is, I\u2019ve rented a lot of offices, this is the first we\u2019ve actually owned, which is so exciting. So those bathrooms are actually my bathrooms. I guess they\u2019re our bathrooms. No, I paid for it, they\u2019re freaking my bathrooms. Just kidding.</p> <p>Alright so as we\u2019re packing stuff up, I\u2019m putting things and I have to decide what goes in the garbage and what gets saved. So I\u2019m throwing away things with tears in my eyes. Hoarder Russell, because I\u2019m totally an info product hoarder, so I\u2019m throwing away my piles of everything that\u2019s built the foundation for our entire company. If it doesn\u2019t matter, even though it does, we\u2019re throwing these things away. Some of these I\u2019m like, \u201cNot throwing that away. That\u2019s gotta stay.\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019ve got this binder here, sitting on the floor. I just looked at it. I looked at it and it made me smile for a couple of reasons. First off, it\u2019s from Frank Kern. Frank\u2019s stuff is always fun, I always love his stuff. It\u2019s a binder and on the outside of the binder it says, 32,800,000 swipe file. So I grab it and opened it up and inside there is 1, 2, 3 4 booklets. There\u2019s one booklet that says the Annihilation Method, one that says Stomper Net, one that says Pipeline Profits, one that says Serializer.</p> <p>And when you open up these little booklets, guess what\u2019s inside? The only thing inside is half a paragraph explaining what this is and then it\u2019s the emails that he sent out during this product launch. So it\u2019s just copy and pasted all the emails.</p> <p>And I started laughing because this is part of a product that I don\u2019t know what we spent on it, but you know it\u2019s probably a $1000, or maybe a $2000 course. And this was a big piece, the swipe file books and swipe file from 4 campaigns that each of them made, well combined made 23.8 million dollars. But they\u2019re the swipe files. What\u2019s hilarious about this, if you think about it, is if you were on Frank\u2019s or anyone\u2019s list at the time during this thing happening. You got these emails for free. And they came in your inbox and they didn\u2019t cost you anything and you already got them.</p> <p>Yet, fast forward a year and all the sudden you say, these emails made 23.8 million dollars, and suddenly people pay you $1000 to read these emails. The same emails that were already in your inbox. In fact, they probably are in the inbox. That\u2019s what\u2019s so funny. So I started thinking about this because people join my list for what reason? They want to learn marketing, right. So they join my list because they want to learn marketing and they want to learn stuff, and they want to figure out how to sell their products and services better.</p> <p>And they\u2019re on there and getting the emails and then people unsubscribe and then I read the, I don\u2019t do it often because it stresses me out and makes me whatever. So I look at it and there\u2019s the comments that are like, \u201cWhy did you unsubscribe?\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cRussell sends too many emails. All he does is try to sell me stuff.\u201d \u201cRussell always trying to get me to go to another webinar.\u201d Or whatever. \u201cHe keeps talking about Clickfunnels.\u201d And it makes me laugh because if I fast forward a year from now and take all those emails and put them in a binder, I could sell them to the same people for $1000. \u201cHere\u2019s the sequence that I sent out that made us a million bucks.\u201d And they\u2019re all excited because they want to buy it.</p> <p>But the reality is like, you are joining my list or other marketers lists to learn how to market. Why are you getting offended about their marketing? That\u2019s why you signed up for the first place. Yes, you can go and buy their products and you will learn from that, but I learn more from watching the process. That\u2019s what we call, we talk about Funnel Hacking. Watch the process, what people are doing and that is worth its weight in gold.\u00a0 Usually that is worth more than the product.</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell you how many hundreds of thousands of dollars of products I bought and never went through the product. Yet, in my mind completely justified the entire cost because I got to see the sales videos on each page. I saw the upsells and the downsells and I saw those things. I saw the email sequences they sent to me later. And all those things came into my head and I started learning and understanding them. And my next email sequence I\u2019m like, \u201cremember when Frank did this on email 3? I\u2019m going to do that in my next email.\u201d \u201cRemember when So and So did this?\u201d we start looking at those things and tweaking them based on what we\u2019re learning.</p> <p>And so I just wanted to say for you guys who are trying to learn marketing. First off, step number one, do not be offended by marketing. Because that\u2019s the whole point. You can\u2019t be offended by what you\u2019re doing. Second thing, those emails or Facebook Live\u2019s or things that are bugging you where right now you\u2019re like, \u201cMan, they keep doing these things\u2026\u201d Those might be the same case studies that next year you\u2019re buying for $1000. So you should watch the process, watch what\u2019s working. And if somebody\u2019s doing something consistently, it\u2019s probably working really well. If they do it for a little bit and stop, it probably isn\u2019t working.</p> <p>So that was my message for today as I was looking through this, I was just kind of smiling and thinking about these emails. If I search my email inbox from whenever these campaigns were, 7 or 8 years ago, I guarantee they are all in my inbox still. Yet, I paid $1000 to get the booklet of them because of the result they got.</p> <p>So this is kind of two tiers. So number one is, again, don\u2019t get upset when people are marketing to you, take that and learn from it. Add it to your swipe files, funnel hacking files, whatever you want to call it. Then number two, think about the byproduct of what you guys are doing in your business. People will pay to see what\u2019s working for the marketing of your business.</p> <p>When we had our supplement company we had the info product, all the other stuff we were doing before we created the 108 Split tests book. That book was just, here\u2019s all of the things we were doing, here\u2019s the case studies, the ads we ran, what worked here, what didn\u2019t. That\u2019s what we showed people.</p> <p>I was watching the other day, one of our Facebook ads, some of you guys probably saw it. There\u2019s a video of me promoting the 108 Split tests book and I got two pictures. I got a picture of one webinar registration page and another one. And I was like, \u201cWhich webinar registration page do you think wins? One of them out converted the other one by whatever.\u201d And the ugly one won.</p> <p>And I was reading the comments from all these people who are posting, \u201cThat was not a true split test. You split tested wrong.\u201d And yelling at me because I didn\u2019t split test the right way, the way that they think split testing should happen is completely wrong. Because they are like, \u201cYou have to have the exact same copy, the exact same thing and only change one thing at a time.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s true on the second or third tier of a split test. But where are you at in business right now?\u201d Anyway, I just wanted\u2026.</p> <p>In fact, I was talking about this earlier with these guys here in the office, one of my friends Matt Bacak, I remember I used to hear him speak and he the rule, he called it the piles of cash rule. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhenever I am looking at someone and they give me advice, I look at the size of their pile of cash and if it\u2019s bigger than my pile of cash I take their advice. If it\u2019s smaller, I ignore them.\u201d I want to go back to these guys and just be like, \u201cOkay, so you\u2019re telling me my split test process is wrong. I just want you to look at your pile of cash real quick and if it\u2019s bigger than mine. Cool, I\u2019m wrong. But if it\u2019s not maybe you should learn and instead of complaining in the comments of my Facebook ad, maybe you should be like, \u2018why would Russell do that? Why would he test two completely different layouts first before he gets into headline tweaks or little tiny tweaks that we typically do on our split testing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Number one is because, and I talked about this before on the podcast. When we\u2019re doing split testing, level number on is not headline tweaks and tests, its radical shifts, so it\u2019s one page design versus a completely different page design.\u00a0 That\u2019s the first thing I\u2019m going. From there I figure out the right page design that\u2019s going to have the highest conversion. Then we go deeper into the copy, the elements the images. All the other pieces we go deeper and deeper and deeper in. but it starts with two radically different looks and feel. That\u2019s the key in my mind.</p> <p>Because if I would have done, and that split test specifically, if I would have done it the way that they were suggesting, I would have picked the one that was the loser, and I would have started split testing headlines of the loser. And I don\u2019t care how long I tried, what do they say? You can\u2019t polish a turd. I could have kept polishing that thing forever and 15 years from now, I never would have had a winner. But instead I had two radically different things and found out, \u201cWow, this direction is dramatically better than that one. Now I\u2019ve got this nice shiny diamond and now I start going in there and chiseling away and making it perfect.\u201c</p> <p>Not that the message of this podcast, was not to teach you guys split testing, but It\u2019s teaching you don\u2019t get offended by people marketing. Don\u2019t leave comments about how you\u2019re frustrated about something that you don\u2019t understand because it\u2019s not the way you would do it, because maybe you\u2019re wrong. Maybe somebody else isn\u2019t. I also wanted to drop the whole pile of cash rule because I think that it\u2019s a good rule for everyone to live by. With that said, thank you Matt Bacak for that idea. I\u2019m going to come back to that and start sharing that more often with people. Look at where and how you\u2019re getting your advice from. Follow the piles of cash.</p> <p>So that\u2019s it you guys. Appreciate you all. Remember the big piles of cash. Look and take advice from those whose are bigger than yours and those who are smaller, don\u2019t pay any attention right now, because it will save you a lot of time, frustration and headache. So there you go guys. Appreciate you all, have an amazing days and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "10:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/298_-_Follow_The_Big_Piles_Of_Cash.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1485018000, "title": "Episode #297 \u2013 The Only Way That You Can Continue To Grow...", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Semi-deep thoughts after writing the back cover of the Expert Secrets book.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how we grow in business and family life and all aspects and how the only way to continue to grow is to help others grow as well.</p> <p>Here are some of the enlightening things you will hear on today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why if you are reading Russell\u2019s book, Expert Secrets, it means you have already been through the trenches, and now you need to figure out a way to continue to grow.</li> <li>Why if you are only learning without ever moving on from that, eventually growth will stop and you will become stagnant.</li> <li>And how you can contribute to other people\u2019s growth, and that will actually help you continue to grow.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how to avoid becoming stagnant in life and business.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to Marketing In Your Car. I hope you guys are doing awesome. I am so tired. I was up til 3 last night editing the book. It\u2019s the final edit and guess what? It is finally getting really, really, really, really close. And it\u2019s, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019m pretty proud of it. So I\u2019m just excited right now. But yeah, I was up til 3:00 editing and I woke up super early today because we got Funnel Friday starting in 11 minutes. So I\u2019m racing to the office to go, I\u2019ll probably be late. But that\u2019s kind of like, you\u2019re on Russell Brunson time, you\u2019re going to be a little late sometimes.</p> <p>But anyway, it\u2019s funny how much, I don\u2019t think pain is the right word, but how hard it is for me to get into the book, writing, editing process. Because I think this is the final edit. So everything I leave there is going to be in print in a physical book for forever. And it\u2019s never going to go away. So it\u2019s like it\u2019s so final. Steven was like, in the Dotcom Secrets book, there\u2019s probably like 10 things I want to change. So it\u2019s just like, you can\u2019t, it\u2019s final and that\u2019s it.</p> <p>So it kind of stresses me out, but what can you do? It\u2019s been good though. I started finally going through. I got about 50 pages of the 250 pages or so finished. So I\u2019m hoping in the next day or so, I\u2019ll be done. And then this thing we can send off to the publisher and get the formatting done and turn it into a book. So that\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s funny, I was Snapchatting me procrastinating last night and showing people stuff. You know how I have my little doodle drawings, which is kind of a cool thing I think. I feel like most people think it\u2019s cool. But someone Snapchatted back, \u201cThose drawings are cute but there childish and unprofessional.\u201d Or something like that. I was like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\u00a0 People are amazing. Why would you tell someone that? I wish I could see who it was on snapchat so I could tell them off. But I\u2019m too nice of a guy, so I won\u2019t even though I want to.</p> <p>Alright, so what I want to share with you. I was writing the back cover of the book last night. And that\u2019s a hard thing to do too, because you\u2019re just like, some people that\u2019s all they\u2019re going to read. So what do you say and how do you say it? I probably re-wrote ten times. That probably took 2 hours just to write that and get it. What\u2019s interesting, when I did finally write it, I was kind of nervous because it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, it almost goes a little deeper than\u2026.I don\u2019t know. But I think it\u2019s how I feel about this book, but it\u2019s also how I feel about my mission in Clickfunnels.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to think of which part I should tell you now. Actually, I\u2019ll rewind. So it\u2019s interesting, Liz Tennison who is now helping me run the Funnel Hacker community and certification program and stuff like that. She\u2019s awesome. She came to our house and she was filming a testimonial last week and when we were filming it I was asking her story about how she became an entrepreneur. And she told a story about when she first joined Mary Kaye, and the founder of Mary Kaye before she passed away she had a chance to hear her speak. And once she heard her speak, she was talking about how Mary Kaye for her was more than just a job or a business, it was a spiritual thing. And she said, \u201cYou know, a lot of times we can\u2019t get into people\u2019s houses with the Bible or with God, and so this is another way we can do it. Get into their house and try to help and serve them through makeup.\u201d</p> <p>When Liz was telling me that she started to get emotional, and I started to get emotional. I was like, dang that\u2019s such a cool thing because in a perfect world all of us, the way we serve each other is by bringing God and bringing things into people\u2019s lives, you know it\u2019s hard in today\u2019s day and age. People don\u2019t want that. People fight against their, it\u2019s just like how else can we serve these people and get them to where they need to be? And it\u2019s through other avenues we have to serve. So for me, and I think my entire team, we always talk about how Clickfunnels is more than a business or product. It\u2019s a spiritual thing, we give people the ability to share their message and grow and help and serve as well. For me it\u2019s bigger than a business, which I think I\u2019m so passionate about it and why we\u2019ve had so much success with it.</p> <p>So anyway, the reason I told you that is because I was writing this book, I was realizing that some of you are going to read this book, Expert Secrets, they\u2019re typically not at the beginning of their journey. Most of them, and I\u2019m going to most of them, most of us, most of you, all of us, the time that you pick up this journey is not you\u2019re doing nothing else and then like, \u201cI want to wake up an expert.\u201d It\u2019s usually because some experience happened in your life that made you want more, so because of that you started reading and studying and learning.</p> <p>And then after you learn things, you got excited, so you\u2019re experimenting and tried it. Some things worked and some things didn\u2019t work, and then You\u2019re making up your own experiment. And it could be any avenue of life. Some of you guys, it was in fitness, some of you guys it was in relationships. Some of you guys it was in wealth, money, finances, or marketing. All of us have different things, but there\u2019s something that happened. Some experience that made you go deep on the topic. And what happens is that we\u2019ll typically go through a period of our life which is extreme growth. We\u2019re learning, we\u2019re learning and we become better and better at this thing and you\u2019re growing.</p> <p>When I started wrestling, I started getting excited by it and started geeking out and learning and growing. It was this phase of my life where I went through extreme growth, but then there comes this point where you can\u2019t grow by learning anymore. You just keep learning and learning and eventually, me learning more marketing tactics is not going to, I\u2019m not growing anymore. You start to plateau. And when you hit that plateau point, I don\u2019 think there\u2019s any way you can grow by continuing to grow, it\u2019s impossible.</p> <p>The only way to continue to grow is to transition from this growth into contribution. How do we share this growth with other people? And as you start helping them and sharing with them and you see them grow, That\u2019s how you start to grow again. Your growth becomes dependent upon the growth that other people have. Does that make sense?</p> <p>So it\u2019s this interesting transition point. You know the back of the book said basically, you pick up this book, you\u2019re probably half way through your journey. You\u2019ve probably gone through that and you\u2019re growing and you\u2019re stuck, and the only way to really progress is to help people become like you, to get to the spot you\u2019re in right now.\u201d I just think that it\u2019s fascinating. I look at other things around me that that\u2019s true in. An industry that I joke about a lot, but it\u2019s serious is network marketing. You can make money but you plateau quickly, and the only way you can really grow is by helping those around you grow. That\u2019s how you get this leverage and growth and make insane amounts of money that some people do in network marketing.</p> <p>If you think about your kids, half of your life is this growth phase where you\u2019re selfish and you\u2019re, most of us go through this phase of life and we\u2019re kind of selfish and it\u2019s all about us, then you find a spouse and then it\u2019s all about you guys together. And then you get married hopefully, then you have kids and suddenly when you have your first kid, it transitions to, okay you\u2019ve gone through this testing ground, the only way for you to progress now is to help these little people progress. And that\u2019s how you start to grow. That\u2019s how you become the next level of who you are supposed to become.</p> <p>Business for me is like that. It\u2019s like having kids, it\u2019s like it gives you the ability then to continue to grow. And from the spiritual standpoint, well I don\u2019t know how deep I should get into these kind of conversations through a marketing podcast, but in a spiritual sense I think that\u2019s how God grows. It\u2019s through the perfection in us as children becoming more and growing and serving each other and it\u2019s just such a cool cycle when you look at it from that standpoint.</p> <p>Anyway, without getting emotional or too much probably further than I\u2019m supposed to on something like this, I just thought I\u2019d share that with you guys because I think that what you and what I and what all of us are doing matters. And it matters a lot. Because it gives you the ability to affect other people\u2019s lives. So this mission you\u2019ve been on to grow and develop, the only way for you to continue that progress is by the transition where now you are becoming an expert. You\u2019re helping other people, you\u2019re serving them and bringing them up to your level. And when you do that, that\u2019s where true fulfillment and happiness is. So I think it\u2019s pretty cool.</p> <p>So there\u2019s my message for today. With that said, I\u2019m going to be late for Funnel Friday. It\u2019s starting in 2 minutes and I\u2019m probably 5 minutes out. But that\u2019s what happens when you pull all nighters trying to change the world.

We just had Snow day number 6. I\u2019m at the house in the snow and yes, I\u2019m praying that the snow melts so our kids can go to school. Plus we\u2019re supposed to have three trucks bringing all the stuff for the new Clickfunnels office today, and they all got stuck in the snow. So we\u2019ve been delayed another day in getting our office finished and moved in which makes me want to cry a lot.</p> <p>Some cool stuff, though, while we\u2019re hanging out. Steven came over. He\u2019s been reading the Expert Secrets book. He\u2019s the first person to actually read the final, the almost final draft. I\u2019m curious your thoughts so far.</p> <p>Steven: it\u2019s pretty much going to change everyone\u2019s life again. You know how the first book changed your life. Get ready to change it again. You were seeing in color, it\u2019s actually going to be more vibrant.</p> <p>Russell: We\u2019re going to color.</p> <p>Steve: it\u2019s really good though. This is fantastic. I sit next to Russell and I hear him say this stuff and now I\u2019m actually reading it like, oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! I\u2019m not going to sleep tonight.</p> <p>Russell: I\u2019m so excited. This book has got twice as many pictures or more. And yes, we\u2019re working right now. So we\u2019re launching a new event called the Funnel Hackathon event, or FHAT for short. Our FHAT event. We\u2019re going to be doing a test run, is it two weeks? Or three weeks? In two weeks for some of our inner circle members and it\u2019s going to be amazing. It\u2019s basically going to be a three day workshop style, where everything in the Expert Secrets and Dotcom Secrets books, we plug in and actually build it with you live.</p> <p>Kind of a good example, most people, this is how I kind of learned as well. I\u2019ll go through and read a book or course and I\u2019ll immerse and go through all this stuff, and I learn so much of it and I\u2019m like, \u201cI gotta go implement it. Oh wait, I gotta get back to the real world.\u201d And then you never do. It\u2019s interesting, I was talking to Brandon and Kaylin, who are inner circle members who are crushing it. And what he\u2019s said, the way he did it, which was different. I was like, it\u2019s different but I think it\u2019s right. He said that they sat down with the book and the audio and everything. We listened to part and paused it. And then we stopped and figured out that piece. Then we push play again. Listen to it, stop, paused it and figured out that piece. What we did, after we were done with the book and training, we had our attractive character built out, we had our soap opera sequence, all the pieces were done.</p> <p>Most people don\u2019t do it that way. Most people learn it and try to go back and implement. They forgot stuff, or don\u2019t have time now, all sorts of things. We wanted to make an experience where people leave their environment. Actually we wanted to make it even cooler, we wanted to make this a pilgrimage. The Muslims do a pilgrimage to Mecca once in their life. They go and do their thing.</p> <p>When I was wrestling in high school, we used to do a pilgrimage, called it the pilgrimage to Iowa, because Dan Gable, the greatest wrestler in our sport ran wrestling camps in Iowa. So our whole high school career, everyone saved up money through a pilgrimage to Iowa so that I could be coached by Dan Gable. My junior year in high school I finally made. I saved up my money and went. We went to practice with the Iowa guys. We met Dan Gable, shook his hand. I was like, \u201cI just shook Dan Gable\u2019s hand. There\u2019s no way I can\u2019t win.\u201d It\u2019s done, it\u2019s over.</p> <p>So I want to make this a pilgrimage, people come to Boise to get their funnel done. We keep talking about how you\u2019re one funnel away from whatever it is for you. We want that to be, \u201cyou\u2019re one funnel away, come to Boise and we\u2019ll build that out.\u201d In this event. So we\u2019re doing our first FHAT event for the inner circle members in two weeks. So Steven is working on the workbook right now for that. And then that\u2019s kind of the initial game plan. And then if it goes well, as we think it will, we\u2019ll start doing those more often here in Boise and have people come back. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on today, which is fun.</p> <p>So anyway, hopefully all of you guys will want to come do your pilgrimage to Boise, because it will be amazing. With that said, I wanted to share with you guys something amazing. It\u2019s been interesting, over the last month or so, we\u2019ve been reworking some of our offers. Our certification program, for one. We launched it at the first funnel hacking live event. We brought a group through and then we closed it for an entire year. At the second Funnel Hacking Live event we reopened it up, brought in another group of people and then a couple of months later we opened it up, we\u2019ve had people coming in more consistently. If you haven\u2019t gone through the certification program, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a business owner or if you are someone looking for a new business opportunity, you should come through it. If you go to cfcertified.com you can see info about the certification program.</p> <p>But as it\u2019s been another year and we\u2019re trying to rebuild the webinar and change things, we\u2019re looking and all these success stories of people who have come through in the last year. We\u2019re looking at all those things and we\u2019re like, \u201cMan, we could literally just have a webinar, here\u2019s 50 people that have made their money back, plus more. Or have doubled their money or 3x\u2019d their money. Or have built huge careers on the back of this now, because we have so much proof that this process works. It just works like magic.</p> <p>So we\u2019re like, \u201cWhat if we just, instead of trying to sell this and work really hard at it, what if we just did a proof webinar.\u201d Like, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re thinking about getting certified, here\u2019s 50 people who have done it. Here are their stories.\u201d And that was the webinar, how interesting. It reminded me of rewind back in the day. John Reese, he launched the first internet marketing product, which made a million dollars in a day. It was called Traffic Secrets. He did the big launch, in fact, if you go to archive.org, they have this thing called the wayback machine. You can type in <a href=\"http://www.trafficsecrets.com/\">www.trafficsecrets.com</a> into there. And then look at, I think it was in 2005, 2004, whenever the initial launch was. You\u2019ll see this sales letter. It\u2019s this big, huge long form sales letter with testimonials, it was amazing.</p> <p>Then after the initial launch they shut it down and a year later they rrelaunched it. And when the relaunch happened the sales letter was completely different.\u00a0 All it was, was a big headline that said, \u201cProof.\u201d And then it was 150 pages of testimonials of everybody who had success with the program. That\u2019s all it was, then order button at the bottom. Then they relaunch it and made as much, if not more money the second time. It was like, \u201cHere\u2019s proof of the thing you heard about, actually is legit.</p> <p>So anyway, I was thinking about that. What\u2019s kind of cool is we tested this and it wasn\u2019t on purpose. We didn\u2019t mean to do this on purpose but, dang it worked really, really good.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to share with you. So some of you guys know Dan Henrie, who is in the Clickfunnels group. He read the Dotom Secrets book. And then he did a perfect webinar. He just, how long ago was that? Do you remember?</p> <p>Steven: Um, I think it was 5 or 6 months.</p> <p>Russell: Yeah, 5 or 6 months ago. So he launched the perfect webinar and he just passed it, or is about to pass it?</p> <p>Steven: Just passed a million.</p> <p>Russell: So he just passed the million dollar mark. And this a guy who prior didn\u2019t have any of those things happening. So reads a book, does a perfect webinar, makes a million bucks and it\u2019s awesome. So we\u2019ve been teasing him relentlessly. \u201cHey you should join the inner circle.\u201d And the inner circle, a lot of you guys know, it\u2019s usually full. There\u2019s 100 spots, so for the most part we don\u2019t advertize it at all anymore because it\u2019s always full. People re-up year after year, which is really cool and kind of a testament of how good of a program it is. But every once in a while we get someone who doesn\u2019t re-up for whatever reason. Sometimes it\u2019s\u2026.whatever. Everyone\u2019s got a reason. Some people feel like, they\u2019re good now. Some people just don\u2019t re-up because, honestly I\u00a0 have no idea. I can\u2019t fathom why people wouldn\u2019t. But there\u2019s some people who don\u2019t.</p> <p>So usually it hover around anywhere from probably 95, 93, members that are in there. So we always have a couple of spots that are there. So we don\u2019t do any active promoting, but people just kind of trickle in. They hear about it on the podcast and they apply and if there\u2019s room we let them in. If not we say, \u201csorry.\u201d And put them on a waiting list. Every once in a while we\u2019ll open up a waiting list. For the most part, we don\u2019t advertize anymore, it\u2019s just there.</p> <p>So right now, I don\u2019t know how many spots we had left, I would say probably a handful, 5 or 6 spots were still left. I was like, \u201cDo we turn ads back on to promote?\u201d or whatever, I was thinking about it. Then Dan Snapchatted me and he was like, it was a picture of his Stripe account for the day and he made $25,380, something like that. He said something like, \u201cFinally decided to join the inner circle and take the plunge, I\u2019ll just use today\u2019s earnings from my webinar to cover it.\u201d Or something like that, it was really cool.</p> <p>So I took a screen shot of it on Snapchat and posted in our Facebook group and just said, it had his picture from Snapchat and it said, \u201cStep one, get the perfect webinar script for $4.99. Step number two, get Clickfunnels. Step number three, join Russell\u2019s inner circle.\u201d And it had a link to russellbrunson.com, which is where people apply. So I posted that to our Facebook group and that\u2019s it. And what\u2019s insane is can you guys guess, before I tell you the number, I want you to guess how many applications that we\u2019ve got in the last, what is today? Thursday. So it\u2019s been 2 \u00bd days. So in the last 2 \u00bd days, guess how many inner circle applications have come in from that one post? I just laugh because it\u2019s so hilarious. What\u2019s your guess? I don\u2019t want to tell you yet, I want you to guess.</p> <p>Okay, on the count of three, you\u2019re going to say your number out loud. 1, 2, 3 blah. What did you say? Did you guess 5, did you guess 10, did you guess 20, 25, did you guess 30? Well if you guessed 30 you are way too low. We ended up from that one post in our Facebook group, with 43 new applications for inner circle, which is insane. Because we literally, I think we\u2019ve got 3 or 4 spots, I don\u2019t know the exact number. But 3 or 4 spots are open before our next set of meetings.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that crazy? And it wasn\u2019t me selling anything, it was just proof. Boom, here\u2019s proof. So for you guys, I want you to start thinking more and more about that. Most of us are amazing at getting results for the people we serve, but we\u2019re horrible at getting, capturing the stories of that. It doesn\u2019t have to be this huge thing. It can be just capturing it. A good example is in December we launched our Funnel Immersion Fire Sale, Some of you guys may remember that. We sold a ton of them.</p> <p>In our Facebook group everyone started commenting, \u201cThis is amazing. This is the greatest thing in the world.\u201d People were like, \u201cShut up and take my money.\u201d Everyone commenting about how good it was, so anyway, we ended up closing it down and what we did is made, we turned that into an upsell for one of our products. And it\u2019s a $300 product, so normally for a $300 product I have to have a really good video to convince people to buy it. But we didn\u2019t have time for that, so all I did was, we had a video of me like, \u201c hey, if you want this other course, it\u2019s really cool. You should get it. It\u2019s $300\u201d then underneath the video we just had screenshots of other people\u2019s Facebook things talking about how amazing it is. And right now that upsell is converting probably about 2 to 3 times higher than I thought it was going to for a $300 offer, which is insane.</p> <p>Again, it\u2019s just proof, tons and tons of proof. What I would say for you guys is start gathering proof. That\u2019s the key. That is the key to this game. Gathering proof, gathering testimonials. People say something nice on Facebook, snap, screen shot it. Somebody Snapchats you nice things, screen shot it. Somebody does something amazing, pay for them to fly to you and capture it on video.</p> <p>If yo look at how we sell the inner circle, initially I went and served and worked for Drew Canoli for free, gave him a huge result, built him a funnel which by the way, I just found out that funnel\u2019s done over 25 million dollars since I hung out with him, isn\u2019t that crazy? I should charge more for the inner circle, it\u2019s insane.</p> <p>But 25 million bucks he\u2019s made with that funnel so far, and it\u2019s still cranking. All he did was made a video and talked about the result we gave him and that video is what launched inner circle. A little while later someone named Liz Benney saw a good looking picture of Drew Canoli, applied for inner circle, came in and we gave her a good result. And when she came to Boise, we captured that result, posted that video online and that video has continued to fill inner circle.\u00a0 But it\u2019s all come down to proof.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, if you look at Liz\u2019s testimony, go to russellbrunson.com and look at Liz\u2019s testimonial. She never once talks about how money she made, no income claims, no nothing, just her talking about her experience with working with me. That\u2019s it. And that has filled our inner circle and you can do the math. It\u2019s $25 grand to join the inner circle, times 100 people. It\u2019s a good program and it\u2019s built off of proof. So become fanatical at getting results for people and then in return capture those results. Not only are they going to be okay with that, most of the time they are excited by that. It\u2019s you talking about how great they did, and us as human beings, we happen to like that.</p> <p>Remember a couple of episodes ago we talked about significance. We all like it, even if we hate it. It\u2019s there, so don\u2019t\u2026..get people their significance. If they\u2019re doing good stuff, they want to tell their story and most people would love to have you share it, so capture it in whatever format you can because that\u2019s the future of sales. Someone asked me on a podcast interview a little while ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s the future of internet marketing as you see it.\u201d I was like, \u201cI think the future is a lot less selling and a lot more us showing results of people we got.\u201d Because that\u2019s believable.</p> <p>People inherently believe Facebook posts, so those look good. People inherently believe videos that are emotionally connected. Those things are belief because they\u2019re real. So focusing on that.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s what I got, I gotta get back to the book because I have to finish this book this week or else it won\u2019t be published in time for the launch date of April 18<sup>th</sup>. So I\u2019m hustling. Hopefully this gave you guys some value. Go capture some proof and if you want to get in inner circle, there\u2019s 43 people online, but if you hurry maybe you\u2019ll be a better fit than one of the other people. So go to <a href=\"http://russellbrunson.com/\">russellbrunson.com</a> if you\u2019re ready for that. That\u2019s it you guys. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and we\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "14:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/296_-_Proof_Is_Power.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1484849334, "title": "Episode #295 \u2013 How To Weather The Storms When Trials Hit", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Reflections on what happened today when Clickfunnels when down for a little bit.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about a situation that happened with Clickfunnels shutting down for a few hours.

Today\u2019s Marketing In Your Car is actually happening in my office for a couple of reasons.</p> <p>First off, I was getting ready this morning. I was planning on waking up at 5 to start working on the book. I got the last edits on the book going, I have to get it done by the end of the month if we\u2019re going to get it published in time for our launch date of April 18th. But then I had only slept a couple hours that night, so I just every 9 minutes for 2 hours kept pushing snooze. Then finally it was 7:00 I\u2019m like, \u201cOh crap, the kids gotta get up.\u201d So my wife and I got up and started working on the kids, get everything ready and then check my phone to find out that Clickfunnels was down.</p> <p>Some of you guys probably had the same sinking feeling in your chest this morning when you saw that, as I did. So I just wanted to kind of walk through what\u2019s going on in my head. Because one, so you guys know, but more importantly because there are times when there\u2019s going to be disasters and problems and issues with you business. And I\u2019m just going to go through what I did and what our team did. Hopefully it\u2019ll help some of you guys when disaster hits for you.</p> <p>One good thing I have on my side, is I\u2019ve got the most amazing development team on planet Earth. So by the time I\u2019d noticed they\u2019d already known and they were on it and working on it. What\u2019s funny is the last time we had an issue, I\u2019m pretty sure, I\u2019m positive I did a podcast about this when I was in London. It was over a year and like 3 or 4 months ago. Almost a year and a half was the last time we had any issues.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, because at the time Clickfunnels had been built on a database company called Clear DB was the name of it. And we were kind of outgrown them and we knew that and we were trying to move over to the other servers and we were trying to move and they wouldn\u2019t let us, they basically had handcuffed us saying, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want you to move your data and if you do it\u2019s going to have to go this other way and you\u2019re going to have down time for 3 or 4 days.\u201d Whatever.</p> <p>So as we were getting closer and closer to what became the first day our servers crashed, things started working less and less and more issues and more hiccups. It was just their company couldn\u2019t handle what we were putting through to them. And at that time we had about 10 thousand members so we wanted to shift over but couldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>I was actually speaking at an event in London with my family, so I was in a plane flying to London, when I landed in London I figured out how to get international phone, which is not as easy as you\u2019d think. Look at my phone and basically get there and realize Clickfunnels is down. Messaging my team and they\u2019re freaking out, everyone\u2019s freaking out and it was just like, \u201chuh.\u201d</p> <p>We didn\u2019t know the issue, but basically, luckily on my team Ryan Montgomery and Todd Dickerson kind of called an audible, \u201cHey look, we can either wait for Clear DB to rebuild or we\u2019ve got to rebuild this whole structure over on Amazon, where we want to move things.\u201d So they made the decision to start rebuilding. So they jumped into it and rebuilt, basically the whole database structure of Clickfunnels over here in Amazon. And then started restoring entire Clickfunnels database from an old backup. Not old backup, backup that had been, I think we back up every 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 10 minutes, whatever it is, and restored it from backup.</p> <p>Ended up, I think we were down for 12 hours, which was insane. People were ready to kill me. Luckily I was in London, no one could find me. But it was tough. Luckily because our developers had the foresight to rebuild instead of waiting, it ended up taking 3 weeks to restore our servers. So we would have been down for 3 weeks if it hadn\u2019t been for amazing people. I remember when I got there, Facebook was blowing up, my messages. Everything was blowing up and people were angry and I was like, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019d never been in this situation before when literally 10\u2019s of thousands of people\u2019s lives and livelihood depended on us and what we were doing. It was a scary, scary situation. At first I was like, well maybe I\u2019ll make a video and kind of try to calm the storm. Make them feel good. But I was like, you know what? No. I\u2019m pissed, they\u2019re pissed. This is not a good situation, this is not acceptable for us, it\u2019s not acceptable for our upstream providers. So instead in the hotel room I had my kids go in the bathroom and try to be quiet and I recorded, this is pre Facebook Live, so I recorded a video with my phone and I didn\u2019t clean it up or polish it. I said, \u201cLook, this is what\u2019s happening.\u201d And I was pissed and people felt it. And I posted that in our Facebook group.</p> <p>And what came from that was amazing. We had hundreds of people come and comment on our site. Basically like, \u201cLook, we\u2019re here for you.\u201d And they fought hard for us and our guys luckily got things up within 12 hours. We were back stable. And what was interesting was because of that we learned a bunch of things. And because of that we were able to move to a new server which was awesome. Things became more stable and then we spent the next 5 or 6 months just working on stability, which if you remember there wasn\u2019t a lot of new features that came out in that time because we were focusing on building this back end structure making sure that never happened again.</p> <p>And it didn\u2019t for a year and 4 months. And then today it happened again. So the first thing is like, what in the world? Was it our infrastructure? We thought we had built things in a way, looking at server recourses, we had the ability to probably give out ten times where we\u2019re at right now and still be fine. As of today, so this is a year and a half later, we\u2019re at 30 thousand members right now. So we have 3 times as many people using the system, 3 times as many people\u2019s lives are affected when we go down. So we go down and we\u2019re looking on, from a server standpoint we were fine. We weren\u2019t taxing the servers more than we should be, so we tried to figure that out and dig deeper.</p> <p>Finally we figured out it was Amazon\u2019s\u2026.something to do with them. They were the issue. So it was like this really weird thing where we were helpless. We can\u2019t do anything, they have to fix it on their side. And their service isn\u2019t typically the best, we actually just upgraded from the, I don\u2019t know the $1000 a month service plan to $15000 a month service plan. So now we\u2019ve got direct lines to all the backend developers. So we were able to upgrade that for the future. But we were kind of stuck. We don\u2019t know what to do. What do you do?</p> <p>So while we\u2019re waiting for them to fix it, our guys were like, \u201cOkay well let\u2019s rebuild.\u201d And they start going to work and it was just so cool to watch them in crisis mode. They didn\u2019t sit there and do nothing. They said, \u201cOkay, alright. What are our options? How many contingency plans do we have?\u201d And they went and executed the first one and I watched as they tried and failed. Try the next one, failed. Try the next one, failed. And it kept going and going and finally they figured out something to get it live again. And this time we were down for 4 hours, which is the longest we\u2019ve been down since the other one.</p> <p>But they got it up and working again before the Amazon team was able to figure out the issues on their side. Now we\u2019re communicating with them and they\u2019re fixing the stuff on their side. And this time is kindo f the same thing. What do I do? I have all this fear. We\u2019ve got 40 thousand people in our Facebook group, its our only means of communication I have with our audience. People in the Facebook group were like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you email us.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWe use Clickfunnels as well. We can\u2019t log into our email. We\u2019re in the same problem you are. We have status.clickfunnels.com page, we\u2019ve got the Facebook group and most people on the Facebook group are like, that\u2019s the only channel we have to communicate.\u201d</p> <p>So we decided to quickly do a Facebook live and let people know this was happening and be very aware. Again not trying to sugar coat things. In fact people messaged me, \u201cAre you pissed or are you sick? I can\u2019t tell.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cA little bit of both right now, to be completely honest.\u201d But we did that and then an hour later when we had more updates, we did another Facebook Live for updates. Then an hour later we were back live and kind of shared that as well. What\u2019s interesting as you watch people that are, the message, the overwhelming thought was the fact that people appreciated our communications.</p> <p>It was interesting, I remember about 6 months ago Lead Pages went down for about 18 or 19 hours if I remember right. We were watching their server logs and they were down for almost a full day. And they did the opposite. They went radio silent and didn\u2019t say anything to anybody. Didn\u2019t message, didn\u2019t talk about it. It was the opposite and I know a lot of people left Lead Pages that day because of that. And I\u2019m sure, unfortunately we\u2019re going to lose people from Clickfunnels. But I had other people message me in the forum that said, \u201cHey I haven\u2019t joined Clickfunnels yet, but after seeing your communication throughout the day, I\u2019m now joining. \u201c So I think we\u2019ll gain a lot of people as well.</p> <p>It\u2019s just one of those things. It\u2019s kind of, for a lot of us, for me, it\u2019s my first time being a real CEO and trying to figure out these things and I think what I\u2019ve found from this experience is a couple of things. First one is over communication is key. People are okay if there\u2019s problems happening as long as they know about them and you validate it. Number two I think that my initial response when people would complain on Facebook is I want to be very defensive.</p> <p>I had people who were like, \u201cHey, Clickfunnels is down. I lost hundreds of dollars. Do I get a free month. I want you to pay that money back.\u201d The defensive Russell, wrestler Russell wants to fight everybody he sees. You know what? Dude, the second you start paying me, right now you\u2019re paying $97 a month to use our entire platform. The same thing that in the past was costing me 20 to 30 thousand dollars a month to run on our own. For a $100 you\u2019re paying for that. As soon as you\u2019re willing to give me 25% of all the money you make from us, then I\u2019m willing to give you back money when we\u2019re down for an hour or two.\u201d</p> <p>I just, in fact, I even started commenting multiple times that. And then I\u2019m like no, I can\u2019t. That\u2019s not the right response. I think us as a team we all wanted to get defensive because we\u2019re doing our best. It\u2019s not even our fault. It\u2019s Amazon\u2019s fault. Amazon\u2019s not refunding my money, I guarantee that. In fact, we\u2019re spending more to be able to actually get answers from them. It\u2019s so frustrating and multiple times I wanted to do that, so I messaged my team, everyone on support. \u201cPeople are upset, and they have every right to be. I\u2019m upset, they\u2019re upset and we cannot be defensive. That\u2019s going to cause, that\u2019s just the wrong thing. It doesn\u2019t help anybody. We have to have empathy. Empathy\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s right in this situation.\u201d</p> <p>So when people on Facebook complain and send me, mouthing off, by default I want to say, I tried to go to everybody and say, \u201cLook, that sucks. I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s not okay. We\u2019re not okay with it. You shouldn\u2019t be okay with it. We apologize. We\u2019re sorry.\u201d And try to bring empathy to the situation as opposed to where we naturally go. I think that was a big part of it. Communication, I think empathy is big.</p> <p>And I think the third thing is understanding. A lot of the things I talk to you guys about in the last year or so and what the new book is about is really when you build a culture of people where it\u2019s more than just\u2026..the best way to explain it in one of our masterminds is a dude who\u2019s super cool named Noah. Noah in one of the things said, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve bought into you, Russell and I\u2019ve bought into Clickfunnels, I see all your competitors pop out. I see them in my Facebook feed, I see the emails. I look at them for less than a second, just long enough to laugh, then I close it down. Because I bought into you.\u201d</p> <p>And I think that reason why the community is doing okay through something like this and why we\u2019re able to recover from something like this is because we\u2019re not just a product, we try to become more than that. We\u2019ve tried to become a community, tried to build a family, tried to not just give you guys the tool, but the training and the platform and everything else that ties into that. It\u2019s because of that, again on the same side I\u2019ve talked about before, when we were building Clickfunnels, I didn\u2019t want everyone to say, \u201cThat\u2019s Russell\u2019s company.\u201d I want them to say, \u201cThis is our company.\u201d It works both ways. When we have down time I don\u2019t want people, I want people saying, \u201cWe have down time, this is something we\u2019re all struggling with.\u201d And we look at it more as a community as opposed to us, not us versus them, but you know, here\u2019s the service provider and here\u2019s us.</p> <p>I think for all of us, the more you can focus on that. You\u2019ve heard me talk about that a lot in this podcast, but you\u2019ll hear me talk about it more when the book comes out. Because that\u2019s what the whole first section is all about. How are we building a following of people that are part of something bigger that you\u2019re creating as opposed to someone who\u2019s buying your product. And I think that those are the 3 things I kind of learned and more reaffirmed of today as we went through this mini disaster.</p> <p>So hopefully, I hope to see you guys because it may not be today, might not be tomorrow or a year from now, or maybe it will never happen. But if and when it does happen, those are some of the tools that have helped us to survive now 2 disasters in the 2 and a half years we\u2019ve been live. Hopefully if any more come in the future it will help us to wave the, survive the storm as well.</p> <p>But I just wanted to thank you guys all for being listeners of the podcast and I want to thank you guys for being members of Clickfunnels. If you\u2019re not using Clickfunnels yet, hopefully this is just one more reason for you guys to come try it out. Because we really do care. We\u2019re here for you and we\u2019re not leaving. We\u2019re not going anywhere. So if you\u2019re not a member yet, go to Clickfunnels.com, get your free 2 week trial, test us out and see what everyone is talking about.</p> <p>This week Eli said we passed 30 thousand active members, which is a huge milestone for us and our goal is to get 100 thousand by the end of this year. And obviously the only way we\u2019re going to do that on our side is to become better. Become a better infrastructure, become better people, become better teachers, become better marketers, become better at the fulfillment side, become better at on-boarding and I think that this was a really good chance for me and for my team to look at that. Look at what happened and make some really good choices based on that and some decisions and build it stronger and better so that it keeps getting better for you guys every single day.</p> <p>The one big difference I would say between our platform and anything else that I\u2019ve ever seen in our industry is just because of the success we\u2019ve had so far, we\u2019re able to put a lot of time, energy, money back into the infrastructure and make it better and better and better. So that\u2019s why hopefully you feel safe and comfortable building your business and your platform here with Clickfunnels.</p> <p>So with that said, I hope that helps you guys. I hope that in your time of trial, as the leader, the entrepreneur, the CEO or whatever it is your role is, that some of these lessons will help you and give you that foundation you need so that you can wave the storms. And that\u2019s about it. With that said, someone\u2019s ringing my doorbell, I\u2019m going to check out who it is. Appreciate you all for listening. Talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "15:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/295_-_How_To_Weather_The_Storms_When_Trials_Hit.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1484694920, "title": "Episode #294 \u2013 Simple Affiliate Funnels", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Highlights from my keynote speech at Affiliate Summit.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about going to the Affiliate Summit and trying to get 150 affiliates excited about Clickfunnels.

Welcome back to Marketing In Your Car. I just got out of the airport, back to Boise Idaho, sitting in my car and it is so cold, I am dying. It\u2019s literally, I think zero degrees, maybe negative one or two right night. I have a light jacket on so if I\u2019m chattering during this episode, that\u2019s why. I\u2019m driving back to the office, then back home and I just wanted to talk to you guys for a little bit.</p> <p>So I was at Affiliate Summit yesterday, which some of you guys were there. Which is kind of fun, I met some of you guys there. Affiliate Summit is a really strange event. It\u2019s an event, it\u2019s not even an event, I don\u2019t even know. The events I go to, that we put on, Funnel Hacking Live, for those of you coming to Funnel Hacking Live, it\u2019s like a rock concert. Tons of energy and emotion and it\u2019s a really, really fun thing.</p> <p>Here it\u2019s like, a whole bunch of people have booths, we had a booth. Then there\u2019s probably like 500 other booths. Then people come and pay to walk around the booths. Then they have little break out rooms of 100 people at a time, and you can go to the break out room to hear the little speakers. So I don\u2019t normally speak much, but Affiliate Summit was a big deal because a long time ago I went to it and I was like, \u201cThis is so cool, these guys are affiliates who are making money.\u201d I thought it was really cool so I wanted to, I thought it would be cool to speak at. I didn\u2019t realize what exactly that meant until we got here.</p> <p>I was like, oh wow so there\u2019s 6 thousand people at the event, but the biggest room they have holds about 150 people. They\u2019re like, \u201cYep.\u201d And people have to pay extra to come to your session. I\u2019m like, this is the stupidest business model I\u2019ve ever heard of. Anyway, whatever.</p> <p>So the first day we walked around the booth and I walk by and this little guy comes and grabs me, and I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d and I recognized him, you know that feeling when you\u2019re like I know you somehow, but I don\u2019t know how I know you and it\u2019s kind of awkward. I\u2019m trying to not awkwardly look down to your nametag to read your name because then you know that I forgot who you were. So I\u2019m just like, \u201chey!\u201d We were talking, and after a while I realized who he is. He was the media buyer we used for Neuracel, he\u2019s the one who took Neuracel and blew it up over.</p> <p>I was like, \u201coh man, how\u2019s it going?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cI left that company, I went over here to this other company. Dude, I gotta thank you for introducing me to Trey.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cTrey Lewellen.\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cWhen you introduced him to us, he had this really weird flashlight offer that no one thought was going to work and I tried to blow him off four or five times, but finally he was so persistent. He prepaid all this stuff, so I had an affiliate run his offer and dude, you probably don\u2019t know this, it was the biggest affiliate offer in the history of affiliate marketing. That offer did over $10 million in the first 90 days. There\u2019s never been an offer that big.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cDude, that is insane. It\u2019s interesting, I didn\u2019t get a piece of any of that, I introduced you. I could introduce you to a lot more people, but man if you don\u2019t, I got nothing out of that.\u201d I\u2019m just kidding, I was joking with him. But it\u2019s kind of true. At least you should have sent me a Christmas present or something, I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>Anyway, that was kind of cool. He looked at me and said, \u201cDude, Russell, do you understand what you guys have done with Clickfunnels?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve changed marketing forever. You\u2019ve changed affiliate marketing. You\u2019ve changed everything.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cPre Clickfunnels, I had maybe 5 or 6 guys come to me that had an offer that we could run. Now I\u2019ve got 16 year old kids with offers that are converting and they\u2019re making millions of bucks. That never happened. You\u2019ve literally given everybody the ability, everybody equal playing ground, everybody can be in this business.\u201d</p> <p>And I was just like, dang. That was two cool compliments in one thing. I was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay me any percentage of that 10 million bucks now, because that was awesome.\u201d So that was kind of cool, I wanted to share with you guys.</p> <p>Then we had our Clickfunnels booth that was really, really cool. We\u2019re not a big booth company yet. I hate booths, this is why. Every other type of marketing on planet earth, we are very big on. If we can\u2019t see the ROI, the immediate return on investment, track able, then we don\u2019t do it. Booths you can\u2019t. It\u2019s like, okay we have this booth. But it\u2019s like, all our competitors are at these shows and if we\u2019re not there, they\u2019re talking trash about us, we assume. So we gotta kind of be there, it\u2019s frustrating.</p> <p>So we had the booth, it was awesome. Bunch of my favorite people were there working the booth, it was pretty cool. Then I had a chance to speak, the topic they gave me was affiliate funnels. I had 18 minutes to speak. I think they\u2019re trying to be ted talks except they\u2019re not. So I had 18 minutes to speak on this thing, so everyone comes into the room initially. The speaker right before me, I was sitting in the room because I wanted to see what was going to happen, and there were literally two people sitting in the room. I was like, are you kidding me? No one\u2019s going to be coming to hear me, this is so awkward.</p> <p>Because people had to pay extra. You pay to go to the booths, and pay extra to hear to a speaker. Anyway, I\u2019m like, no one\u2019s going to come. So my whole team is trying, I\u2019m like tell everyone. Try to get people to come to my thing. Because I don\u2019t want to be the only talking to myself, that\u2019s really awkward. But luckily, they went and got some people. We ended up with probably close to 100 people in the room. They said it was the biggest audience of any of the breakout sessions, so that was kind of cool, I guess. Of 5 or 6 thousand supposed attendees, we got 100 to sit in a room for 18 minutes.</p> <p>So then I get in this room and it\u2019s set up so weird. There\u2019s this stage, but there\u2019s a pole, there\u2019s all these chairs, it was so stuffy and corporatey. Ugh. I hate this corporatey, crappy stuff. So I start my slides up and jump down off the stage and come out in the front. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not standing behind there guys. We\u2019re hanging out down here.\u201d And I started it and give my whole presentation, and it was funny because I was trying to get this audience to be excited about life and the fact that we\u2019re in the greatest time in the history of the world. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou guys are affiliate marketers. Do you realize what that means? You can and should be making millions of dollars. And you don\u2019t have to go to college, and you don\u2019t have to have annoying bosses and all the crap that comes. You guys are living the dream.\u201d</p> <p>And they\u2019re all just sitting there like, \u201cBlah.\u201d So unexcited. So I spent the 18 minutes trying to get them to smile. I\u2019m telling jokes trying to get fun and exciting. I hate when people\u2019s energy is that low and it\u2019s hard to get them to, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the people. I think it\u2019s the environment. The whole event is so corporatey and it just kind of ruins it. I was telling people, \u201cyou come to one of our events and it\u2019s a lot closer to a rock concert than it is this, at all.\u201d I hated school, so we\u2019re not doing school. We are doing something that\u2019s actually conducive to learning and emotional, I want people crying in our audience. We have that. I want transformations, and that doesn\u2019t happen with school.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know about you but, I cried at school but it wasn\u2019t because I had a life changing moment, it was because I wanted to kill myself because all the crap they taught was useless. So that\u2019s my\u2026where this whole thing happened. So I\u2019m trying to think with these guys. There\u2019s two slides and I showed my first slide. I was like, \u201cI have kind of a unique angle.\u201d At an affiliate summit, just so you know, there\u2019s the vendors who have products or there\u2019s the networks, the affiliate networks, where they\u2019re selling a bunch of products. And then there\u2019s the other side, which are the actual affiliates. So I knew there were two audiences.</p> <p>So I was like, \u201cHow many of you guys are affiliates, how many of you guys are networks, how many are both?\u201d It was kind of split down the middle. I was like, \u201cI come from a unique perspective, because first off, I\u2019m a really successful affiliate. This is a Ferrari I won in an affiliate contest.\u201d I showed them the Ferrari I won, \u201cBut I\u2019m also a really successful vendor, network. In fact, that same Ferrari I gave away two years later. I won a Ferrari as an affiliate and I\u2019ve given away that Ferrari to an affiliate. So I\u2019ve been on both sides of this game. So I have a kind of unique perspective.\u201d And I wanted to show them, this is how simple this business could be.</p> <p>So this is the moral for this for you guys. Those of you guys who are listening and who want to be affiliates. I talked about simple affiliate funnels and I said basically, this is the process. The first thing is you got to find a hot offer. Find what people are already buying. So let\u2019s just say, for you it could be whatever. Something you\u2019re excited and passionate about because potentially you\u2019re going to be writing about it and hopefully someday if you are a good affiliate and make money there, you\u2019re probably going to set up camp there and build an actual business and create your own products and services. But you have to figure out, find a hot offer. So boom, people are buying this thing, maybe it\u2019s weight loss supplements or maybe it\u2019s info product on dating or whatever it is you\u2019re passionate about.</p> <p>You find the hot offer that peope are already buying and that\u2019s kind of the first step. And then let\u2019s say they have a video sales letter. They got some way they\u2019re selling it, I want to watch that video and try to figure out what\u2019s the one most interesting curiosity based thing in this sales process. So I\u2019m watching it trying to figure out. So I watch the whole video. Maybe in the video they talk about, the example I showed was the diabetic, way to end diabetic pain. So I watched the video and in there they\u2019re talking about this shake they make that diabetics can drink in the morning and make it so their hands don\u2019t tingle.</p> <p>I\u2019m like, boom. That\u2019s the one thing, intriguing and interesting. So I took that one thing in the video, pulled it out and made a headline. \u201cDiscover the weird shake you can drink in the morning that will kill diabetes nerve pain for the first four hours of the day.\u201d Something like that. So for diabetics that saw it would be like, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d So I turned that headline, the unique thing I pulled out of the video, make it a headline and put it on a squeeze page. \u201cIf you want to know this one weird shake I make, give me your email address.\u201d So that\u2019s the funnel\u2019s one page.</p> <p>So then I go and advertize on Facebook or whatever. \u201cHey diabetics, here\u2019s one weird shake that you can\u2026.\u201d And they see the ad and click on it, go to my landing page, see the headline, put their email address in. And after they put the email address in, guess what happens. It redirects them to the affiliate offer, they ten watch the video that gives them that one cool thing. And if I set it up right in Clickfunnels, it attracts my affiliate links, when they buy it, I get paid from the product. It\u2019s so simple. Yet, we all try to over complicate affiliate marketing. So the one other thing that kind of, I guess it\u2019s the layer of complexity, but it shouldn\u2019t be. A lot of times, you\u2019re not going to be profitable up front, because you\u2019re an affiliate. So an affiliate, you\u2019re making half the money.</p> <p>That means the other half, the vendors getting, so unless their offer is really converting high, which sometimes they do, you may not break even immediately. You might spend a dollar on Facebook ads and make 50 cents. So what you gotta do next is then that person gave you their email address, now you build an email sequence. So maybe the first three email in the email sequence are like, \u201cHey, did you watch the video about the cool shake? Watch it here.\u201d And your second one is like, \u201cHere\u2019s a testimonial of some dude who took the magic shake and their feet don\u2019t hurt anymore. Watch the video.\u201d Keep pushing back, two or three emails, pushing back to that original video.</p> <p>And every email in that sequence will some to come back and actually watch the video and increase your conversions. And it\u2019ll increase how much money you make off of that, off of each person you got to come through. Then after two or three emails you transition to a secondary product. One thing I do if I\u2019m going as an affiliate in a new market, I\u2019m not going to just find one hot offer. I\u2019m going to find 4 or 5 that complement each other. So we have the supplement, an info product, coaching program, an ecommerce physical product, whatever. I find 5 or 6 different things that that client would want. And then in this email sequence I\u2019m introducing different products.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you tried the supplements, you saw the video about the weird shakes. Hopefully you bought that info product, because it will help you a lot. But the next thing is there\u2019s these really cool supplements over here that have been known to lower nerve pain, you should buy these.\u201d I have two or three emails talking about the nerve pain supplements. Then from there. transition to \u201cIf you\u2019re still suffering from nerve pain you may need \u2018blah\u2019\u201d and I find 5 or 6 different products to serve them and I build email sequences that sell each of those products.</p> <p>When I was showing everybody the thing, the cool thing is when somebody comes in, and hopefully you guys are able to visualize this. If not, I have a way for you guys to kind of see this in action here in a second. If you\u2019re getting lost, that\u2019s okay I\u2019ll show you where to go to see this. Hopefully you\u2019re seeing this. You pay a dollar in Facebook ads, they come in and opt in. Somewhere in the sequence on day one, on average I make 30 cents per offer, day two I\u2019m up to 45 cents. Day three I\u2019m up to 60. Day 5 I\u2019m up to 80 cents. Day 7 I averaged 90 cents. And by day 8 is my breakeven point. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve made my dollar back. So what\u2019s cool is you gotta figure out, where\u2019s your breakeven point?</p> <p>We\u2019ll look at that and say, on average in this funnel we\u2019re spending a dollar on ads on Facebook or Youtube, or wherever you\u2019re buying your ads from. But by day 8 I\u2019ve made my buck back, it\u2019s breakeven. Then guess what happens after day 8? Day 9 and beyond? Day 9 is magic because anything you make from day 9 and beyond is pure profit in your pocket. And that\u2019s the magic in affiliate marketing.</p> <p>It\u2019s like building, it\u2019s like an ATM machine. I want to create some money. I put a dollar in advertising in, I get two dollars back out. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t always happen immediately, at point of sale. It might happen over 3 days, or 7 days or 10 days, but find out what\u2019s your breakeven point. Now I know, hey I\u2019m going to put a dollar in on Monday, by Friday I\u2019ll have my dollar back and then everything I make Saturday, Sunday, Monday and the rest of my life, pure profit. That\u2019s affiliate funnels. That\u2019s what I showed those guys. Pretty cool right?</p> <p>So for those of you guys who may have gotten lost in the explanation, it\u2019s easier when I have a whiteboard because I can draw pictures, and circles and arrows. Those of you guys who have been with me for a while know that that\u2019s what I like doing. There\u2019s that. If you want to see me kind of sketch this out, I did a video that kind of explains this. You can see it for free if you just go to affiliatebootcamp.com. Oh I almost got hit by a Sherman Williams paint truck. I survived. No worries, you guys.</p> <p>Alright, if you go to affiliatebootcamp.com, there\u2019s a video that talks about how to become a Clickfunnels super affiliate, and I walk through how to basically sell, because if you get 100 people to sign up for Clickfunnels, your commission on that is $4000 a month recurring, and it\u2019s a car payment. So the whole video is how you\u2019re going to retire as a Clickfunnels affiliate within the next 100 days. How to sell, basically get one person a day to sign up for Clickfunnels for 100 days, at that point you got a $4000 a month residual check from us, and you\u2019ve got a car, which is amazing.</p> <p>So affiliatebootcamp.com will show you that process. So when you opt in for free the next page is a video from me where I kind of explain this, I just talked about. I talked about creating the squeeze, talking about opting in, talking about that sequence that\u2019s happening, what your breakeven points are. It\u2019ll kind of map the whole thing out for you. If you need, even if you don\u2019t need more details, you should still go through that. In fact, if you have an affiliate program, or you want to run an affiliate program, you should go funnel hack that. That funnels been building our affiliate program really well for us. It\u2019s at affiliatebootcamp.com.</p> <p>Yeah, that\u2019s just kind of another way if you want to look at this a bit deeper. So that\u2019s the magic guys. That\u2019s what I shared this weekend, the affiliate bootcamp. If you guys are, if you listen to this right away, you will find this video. If you listen to it 5 years from now it will be hard. But I did Facebook Live it, so if you go to my Facebook page, which is facebook.com/russellbrunsonhq there is a video, we Facebook Lived the presentation, so you can see it there too if you want. See me trying to get these tired, non-excited affiliates as excited as humanly possible by walking them through this process.</p> <p>But yeah, it was pretty fun. Anyway, I\u2019m back home. I\u2019m almost to the office, I\u2019m going to get a couple of things done and head home, see my wife and kids and get back to the real world. So appreciate you guys all, thanks so much for listening. If you\u2019re enjoying Marketing In Your Car, please go to iTunes and subscribe, share, comment, all that fun stuff.

It is so cold here. Insanely cold. All of the ice, or the snow is now shards of glass and it\u2019s crazy. That was the noise, if you\u2019re wondering why. I was driving over the shards of glass in my car.</p> <p>Alright, so today I have a very special message and this one\u2019s important for everybody including me. Alright so I\u2019ll tell the background of this story. A lot of you guys know I talk about Tony Robins a lot. He\u2019s coming to Funnel Hacking Live, I\u2019ve been a big Tony fan for forever, as long as I can remember. And the first time I met him was a really cool story.</p> <p>So I went to UPW, actually let me step back. What happened is I was at my house one day working when all the sudden my phone rang, I picked it up and it was somebody on Tony\u2019s team saying, \u201cHey, Tony Robins want to meet you. Can he meet you today?\u201d and I was like, \u201cIs he in Boise?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, he\u2019s in Salt Lake, can you come over. He wants to meet you.\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m in Boise.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I thought you lived in Salt lake, that won\u2019t work then. He\u2019s going to be in Tron the next week doing UPW. Can you come and be his guest and then he\u2019ll have a chance to meet you there.\u201d I was like alright, how cool is that, yes.</p> <p>So I booked my everything to go to UPW the next week, and I\u2019d never been to a Tony event, I didn\u2019t know what it was. I assumed it was like a marketing event. So I showed up with my backpack and laptop and I was going to sit in the back and take notes. And I get there and people are jumping and dancing. If you\u2019ve ever been to a Tony event it\u2019s closer to a rock concert than a seminar. Anyway, I was not expecting that. By the end of day one you walk on fire, day two I had shin splints, I lost my voice completely. That\u2019s how crazy it is. So if you haven\u2019t gone yet, you should really, really go.</p> <p>At the event, first thing he teaches this really cool concept called the six human needs and I don\u2019t have time to go through all of them right now, but I need to touch on it, because it\u2019s important for the next part of it. So basically the six human needs, there\u2019s four human needs of the body. There\u2019s certainty, humans want to be certain. And then there\u2019s variety, you want things to be crazy. Those are two needs that kind of conflict with each other, but they\u2019re both there. And then there\u2019s significance, we want to feel great about ourselves. And then there\u2019s love and connection. I think I\u2019ve done a podcast in the past about this, but I could go on for, I could teach a two day seminar just on that because it\u2019s so cool. And then there\u2019s the needs of the spirit, which are growth and contribution which is a whole other\u2026.anyway, we could go deep but I want you to understand that there\u2019s those four.</p> <p>So significance, love and connection, certainty and variety. Those are the four that we have to get met in our life. And there\u2019s one for you. Just so you guys know, there\u2019s one that\u2019s your driving force in life. You\u2019re either significance driven, certainty driven, variety driven, or you are love and connection driven, and it\u2019s interesting.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to leave that there. I wish I could go deeper, but I can\u2019t in this podcast, because I won\u2019t make it to the office, it\u2019ll be a long call. So anyway, so I\u2019m at UPW, he teaches this stuff, I\u2019m fascinated by it and then the next day I\u2019m supposed to meet him. So day two of the event, Tony\u2019s not facilitating it, there\u2019s somebody else facilitating it. So I started getting text messages from Tony\u2019s assistant. \u201cHey Tony wants to meet with you in an hour.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAlright.\u201d Then I get a text like 45 minutes later, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be two hours from now.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, throughout the whole day, I think our meeting was supposed to be at 10 in the morning, I was getting texts every 30 minutes for 10 hours. They kept pushing and pushing and pushing and finally I get a text, \u201cOkay, Tony is ready to meet you. Here is the address.\u201d This is pre-uber and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d So I jump in a taxi and give them the address and they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is like 45 minutes away.\u201d I\u2019m like, are you serious, is Tony not in the hotel?</p> <p>So I get in the car and we\u2019re driving and I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re going to the right place. This is going to be really embarrassing if I\u2019m\u2026.So the taxi driver takes me to this hotel, drops me off, I text him, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m here.\u201d And then this guy texts back, his name is Jay Garrity, and Jay would, just to kind of put it in perspective, so you feel my nervousness of this situation, Jay used to be the right hand man for I\u2019m blanking on his name right now, for Mitt Romney when he was doing the first political campaign, the first time he ran for president. He was Romney\u2019s right hand man, and then Tony hired him after that. In fact, most of Tony\u2019s team at the time were old Romney advisors, which is kind of interesting.</p> <p>So we get to the hotel, Jay Garrity comes down from the elevator, very professional, the opposite of me. He\u2019s like \u201cMr. Robins is not ready to meet you yet, so sit in the lobby and wait.\u201d So I\u2019m like okay. So we\u2019re sitting in the lobby waiting and it\u2019s almost like secret service, that\u2019s what it felt like. Jay kept looking at his phone, looking at his phone. Not ready, not ready. Probably sat there for another 45 minutes. Then all the sudden he\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, Mr. Robins is ready to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>We stand up and I was like, \u201cAhh.\u201d Super intense and crazy. We jump in the elevator, go up to the floor, start walking down this hall really fast. We get to this room, the door\u2019s open, there\u2019s two security guards on both sides inside the room. I\u2019m like, what in the world. We walk through the security guards and all the sudden Tony, this giant of a man, walks in and says, \u201cRussell, welcome!\u201d and gives me a huge hug. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat.\u201d Super crazy.</p> <p>Then he has me come sit down and he\u2019s made me dinner, you know someone made me dinner. And at the time he was pure vegetarian, so its like this dinner that was the most amazing thing in the world and it was pure vegetarian. I was like, \u201cI could be a vegetarian if I had someone to cook this way.\u201d It was amazing. Then he took out his recorder, clicked record on it, set it on the table, opened up a journal and started drilling me for an hour, asked me question after question after question. It was insane, I\u2019ve never been more nervous in my whole life.</p> <p>Drills me for an hour, we\u2019re done. We finish eating, we talk for a little bit and then he\u2019s like, \u201cI gotta go back to the event.\u201d So we go down and jump in this big suburban. Someone\u2019s driving. Tony and I sit in the back and talk and it was interesting while we were talking, he was talking about a deal he was thinking about doing with someone in our market. I won\u2019t say his name because most of you guys would know who this person is. He was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do the deal because he\u2019s very significance driven.\u201d I was like, \u201cHuh, interesting.\u201d</p> <p>And then after he said that, I started thinking, at first I\u2019m like, oh man that sucks for that guy. And then I\u2019m like, wait, what drives me? Am I significance driven? Tony can see into my soul. I\u2019m freaking out, what does he see about me? What\u2019s driving me? I was so paranoid and panicky, it was crazy.</p> <p>Then we got to the event. Tony\u2019s like, \u2018I gotta go, call ya later.\u201d Jumps out of the car, goes into the hotel, and I\u2019m standing in the front lobby like, \u201cHuh.\u201d That was the most intense three hours of my life. It was just crazy. But that thing he said, \u201cVery significance driven.\u201d So I started thinking, what does that mean? Basically it comes back to the four human needs. One of those is the driver for you that drives most of the decisions in your life. But this person he said it was significance.</p> <p>I was like, apparently that\u2019s bad. If Tony didn\u2019t want to work with this guy because he\u2019s significance driven. I was kind of confused at first. Then a couple months later I went to Date with Destiny. If you go to Date with Destiny, it\u2019s a six day event that Tony has, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s like UPW times ten. In fact, I feel bad for people who go to UPW and only get to walk on water because you\u2019re missing the depth of what Tony actually has to offer.</p> <p>So I go to this next event, and the events there\u2019s so much stuff he covers. But if you look at the one, the biggest things you work with at the event. He helps you identify the six human needs, which one is currently the driving force. And for most people it\u2019s either significance, or certainty. I wish we could get into a couple hour talk on this, because it would make more sense, but he also said, the quality of your life is 100% dependent on your ability to, how do I say it right? It\u2019s 100% tied to the need, your driving need.</p> <p>So if your driving need is significance, that\u2019s going to make you miserable. Whereas your driving need is love and connection, the opposite, then you\u2019re going to have a great life. Same thing with the opposite, if your driving need is certainty, while it\u2019s important, it\u2019s a need we have, if that\u2019s the driving force in your life, you always have to be certain about everything, you\u2019re going to be miserable.</p> <p>So it was basically helping you identify what is your driving need. Then learning how to shift that to the other thing. If you\u2019re significance driven, learn, teaching how to be love and connection driven. If you are certainty driven, shifting it to variety. Because the quality of your life is going to be completely dependent upon your ability to have variety and love and connection. That\u2019s what gives you a good quality of life, not the other two.</p> <p>But most people, it\u2019s these other things that drive them. And that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting. I was listening to that and for me, I\u2019m and I think, most entrepreneurs, I\u2019m definitely heavily driven by significance. In fact, now that I\u2019m so aware of it, I hate it. In fact, in the world I work in, most, not most, but the majority of the people that I work with, the reason why they are in the guru business or whatever is because they are significance driven. And that\u2019s why I always hear people, you get to know who these people are, and you don\u2019t actually like them because they\u2019re driven by this thing, no one knows, they don\u2019t know what the cause is, but it\u2019s because they\u2019re driven by significance.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been doing a deal with a person who are trying to, someone who I highly respected and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve done this deal, I\u2019ve never met a human being on planet earth that\u2019s more significance driven than this person. And it\u2019s completely ruined the deal, it\u2019s ruined the relationship so much so, this is someone that I idolized. This is someone that if you would\u2019ve told me 5 years ago that I would have a chance to talk to them, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. And now I\u2019m avoiding their texts, phone calls. One of the most annoying human beings on earth because the significance is such a driving, the only thing this person can see is significance. Everything is tied to his personal significance and it\u2019s destroying him.</p> <p>I looked at this business, the people around him and he\u2019s destroyed everything because he\u2019s so significance driven. As a person he\u2019s still brilliant, but a miserable life. I can\u2019t imagine it. And I have this struggle because it\u2019s a constant thing for me, and I\u2019m sure for a lot of us. Significance drives us, we feel that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re entrepreneurs, why we\u2019re out there. Why we want to be onstage and write books. But I, because I\u2019m aware, I try to check that all the time because I hate that. That\u2019s the thing I actually hate about myself. I hate that I\u2019m significance driven.</p> <p>When people give me good compliments, I thrive off that. I love that. But then when I, after I feel that, it bugs me because I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d I love that, but I can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be significance driven. IT\u2019s not a good quality of life. I need to be driven by love and connection, by variety, these other things that actually increase the quality of your life. Because connection, even if it\u2019s not about \u201cLook about how great I am.\u201d It makes you feel good, but it doesn\u2019t help anything else. Love and connection is where you\u2019re using your tools, your gifts in a more meaningful way.</p> <p>So I don\u2019t know. For you guys, I just wanted to share some of that in a ten minute message, I wish I could go so much deeper. But start thinking about that stuff. What drives you? If your personal significance is the driving force for you, I\u2019d recommend stepping back from that. And it\u2019s always going to be there, but being aware of it, like, \u201cMan, I am just doing this for significance to make me feel better?\u201d and if that\u2019s the main reason you\u2019re doing something, it\u2019s the wrong reason. If the reason is that you really care about people and you\u2019re trying to give them something, you have this love and connection towards them, it\u2019s just a better way to live. I think people will see it and notice it.</p> <p>I hope people notice that for me. I, despite the fact that it\u2019s a constant thing that\u2019s there in front of me all the time, I\u2019m constantly trying to check it and put it in the back and default to the love and connection, these other things because I know what\u2019s important and what actually helps other people, not just your own ego. Ego is the enemy. I haven\u2019t read the book yet, but I bought it and I bought the audible. There\u2019s a book called Ego is the Enemy, I\u2019m excited to read it because I think that\u2019s what holds most of us back from true love and connection. From happiness, growth, from all the other things we want. I feel like, our ego and significance we\u2019re craving is what holds us back from that.</p> <p>And if we are aware of that at least we can do something about it. I wasn\u2019t aware of it. I look at my career the first 5 or 6 years of my business, prior to meeting Tony, I was not aware of it and it drove me, and it drove me, and it hurt my marriage, it hurt my family life, it hurt my relationship with friends. There were a lot of issues and again, I\u2019m so far from perfect. I still do things because of significance, and I hate it. But I\u2019m aware of it now, and I try to not make decisions based on that. I try to make decisions based on love and connection. How will this help others as opposed to how does this put me on a pedestal?</p> <p>And it\u2019s been good, it\u2019s been really good. The relationships that have come from it, because of that. I think our ability to affect change in people\u2019s lives have been tenfold. And the interesting thing, this is the craziest thing about it. As I have tried to push away significance and focus on love and connection, I have become more relevant and it\u2019s weird.</p> <p>I\u2019ve gotten significance by not going after it. It\u2019s weird. This person I\u2019m dealing with, this person, despite the fact that they\u2019re brilliant, they\u2019re no longer relevant in our market, which is insane based on who they are, what they\u2019ve accomplished and done, there\u2019s no relevancy. They\u2019ve been driving and chasing after significance for so long, they\u2019ve completely just destroyed all their relationships. Their market knows that it\u2019s all about them. They\u2019ve destroyed what they sought after. They have lost all significance, because they\u2019ve been seeking after it. It\u2019s so weird. Whereas if you don\u2019t, you seek love and connection, you seek that change in other people, you seek that, you will get the significance you are trying to get as a byproduct of it. It\u2019s so fascinating.</p> <p>So I hope that helps somebody out there. It\u2019s definitely helping me in being more aware of it as I\u2019m watching it unfolding before me.

Today I am actually sitting in my kitchen. The kitchen that all the wood is completely warped from our flood. All my wife and kids are out in the hot tub except for Norah who decided she didn\u2019t want to hot tub. So we are standing here and I\u2019m supposed to be feeding her dinner because she\u2019s hungry, but instead she\u2019s eating a popsicle. That is called good parenting, because it\u2019s the only way to get her to stop crying. So yes, I should teach a parenting course someday. If your kids are crying, just give them a popsicle. Oh man, some days it\u2019s really hard to be a parent. But those days you just give them a popsicle and it becomes easy again. Just kidding.</p> <p>Parenting advice aside, because nobody wants that right now. But I do want to talk about something really super cool. Because we\u2019re in the hot tub, it\u2019s been snowing, Boise has been Boise Snowpocolypse, or whatever you want to call it. The last week we\u2019ve had 3 or 4 feet of snow and then it rained another foot and everything was soaked, and my house was flooding. Oh and today we were filming a testimonial video in my front room and I walked on the carpet and the carpet is soaking wet and I looked at the wall and there\u2019s water seeping behind the paint of our wall. Anyway, it\u2019s a total disaster nightmare. Not gonna lie.</p> <p>But the one nice thing is that the Hot tub is good no matter what. So we\u2019re out in the hot tub in the snow, and we\u2019ve pretty much hot tubbed everyday. Man, we had 5 snow days in a row, almost 10 days in a row between Christmas break and this and everything, we\u2019ve been hot tubbing a lot. And it\u2019s fun because the hot tub is surrounded by tons and tons and tons of snow. So the first day you hot tub everyone\u2019s like, \u201cOooh it\u2019s so cold.\u201d And they\u2019ll touch the snow a little bit and try little things. Take little snow balls and throw them at each other and then dive back into the water. Now it\u2019s insane because they do these things, and this is kind of the point of today\u2019s message.</p> <p>So I was there yesterday with the kids and they\u2019re jumping up and screaming and running around our house, which is a pretty long distance in the snow. First they were doing one lap, then two, then three. Now they\u2019re doing four laps around the house and then they dive back into the water. And then they\u2019re doing snow angels, front and back and then back in the water. And they\u2019re running across the yard, onto the trampoline, doing snow angels on the trampoline and jumping and run back and dive in.</p> <p>All these crazy things. Stuff that\u2019s super painful and super crazy, and they keep doing them over and over again. And what\u2019s interesting and this is the point, before they go, every single time, they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s do it.\u201c and they\u2019re all like, \u201cBut it\u2019s so cold.\u201d And then Dallin, I think Dallin who started this, he\u2019s the one, he always says, \u201cYolo.\u201d And he jumps up and takes off.</p> <p>So it\u2019s like everyone\u2019s freezing. No one wants to get in the cold snow, but then Dallin goes \u201cYolo.\u201d jumps up, steps in the snow and sprints probably I don\u2019t know 500 yards in the snow in around our house a bunch of times and then dives back in. I was like, \u201cWhat are you, when you\u2019re yelling, what are you yelling out?\u201d he said, \u201cYolo.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat does yolo mean?\u201d \u201cYou only live once.\u201d And then he goes, \u201cYolo.\u201d And jumps up and takes off and runs out in the snow again.</p> <p>I was kind of laughing, actually he said, \u201cYou only live once so spend it or live it stupidly.\u201d I don\u2019t know what it was, and then he takes off. So all the kids, every time they\u2019re about to do something crazy that they normally wouldn\u2019t do, they look at that challenge, run across the snow, do a snow angel, a front snow angel and back, three somersaults in the snow and run back and dive in. They sit there and you know when you want to do something cool, there\u2019s that moment of like, \u201cHuh, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d And the second that moment comes to them, they yell out \u201cYolo\u201d and boom, they just go.</p> <p>And I was like, how cool is that? This is way harder, what they\u2019re doing, than what we\u2019re trying to do in business every day. Yet, we come up with plan and this idea and this obstacle and we\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d And all the sudden your brain starts talking to you and your brains like, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re Russell Brunson, you barely graduated high school. You\u2019re super awkward, when you talk people won\u2019t know why you came to talk to people.\u201d All these things start flooding into your mind.</p> <p>What happens to most of us is we sit there like, \u201cMan, you\u2019re right. I am just Russell Brunson. I\u2019m really not that good. I barely graduated from school. Yeah when I get in a group and I talk one on one with people I have no idea. I feel awkward, I don\u2019t know what to say most of the time.\u201d And all these thoughts keep flooding your head and if you listen to them long enough, you start believing them and you have so much fear and anxiety when there are things there, you just don\u2019t take that action.</p> <p>And I think what\u2019s interesting, is that they\u2019re flooding their mind with, as soon as those things start coming up, \u201cYolo.\u201d Boom, they just take off and they go. I think for all of us, if we start doing that think how powerful that would be. If just every time something comes to us, like an idea, when we have that idea, that inspiration, and I think those inspirations aren\u2019t just from our brain. I wish that I was that smart, but I don\u2019t think it is. I think it\u2019s coming from on high. I think that you can call it whatever you want, for me it\u2019s my Heavenly Father. I think we are inspirations we get from him. \u201cHey you should try this thing. Hey you should take this leap of faith. Hey you should go talk to this person. Hey you should create this. Hey you should test\u2026..\u201d Whatever those things are.</p> <p>Those are gifts that we\u2019re getting and it\u2019s like, okay go do it and all the fear and self doubt comes in and stops it most of the time. If we start becoming like my insane kids are, and the second you have the idea and you know it\u2019s right, because you know it pretty quick. Should I do this, yes I should. Oh but\u2026..as soon as that, right before that but comes off, yell out at the top of your lungs, if you\u2019re in a spot where you can, if not say it in your head as loud as you can, \u201cYolo.\u201d Y O L O, you only live once. \u201cYolo.\u201d And just go, just run, just sprint, don\u2019t even think because once that inspirations coming to you, it\u2019s there and if you believe like I do, it was given to you from a higher power, whatever that might be for you, then you\u2019re hesitation to that is, and I believe in an adversary. There\u2019s God and there\u2019s the opposite side of that, there\u2019s Satan or whatever you want to call it, that tries to take things from us.</p> <p>So as soon as you have this inspiration, \u201cThis is what I need to do.\u201d The adversary is going to come and start self doubt and try to keep you from doing that thing that could change your life and change other people\u2019s lives. So I think one of the most powerful things we can do is yell out, \u201cYolo.\u201d The second we get inspiration and start running, just sprint.</p> <p>Ellie just walked in, I\u2019m going to ask her. Hey Ellie, what does Yolo mean to you guys when you say \u201cYolo\u201d and start running in the snow?</p> <p>Ellie: I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>Russell: You don\u2019t know? What does it stand for?</p> <p>Ellie: I can\u2019t remember.</p> <p>Russell: You don\u2019t\u2026.</p> <p>Ellie: Wait\u2026.you only live once or something like that.</p> <p>Russell: You only live once. Then tell us some of the crazy stuff you guys are doing after you yell Yolo.</p> <p>Ellie:\u00a0 we were walking in the snow.</p> <p>Russell: She\u2019s being all shy now. Let me ask Bowen. Bowen just came in. Hey Bowen, what does Yolo mean to you?</p> <p>Bowen: You only live once.</p> <p>Russell:\u00a0 So what are the things you do when you yell Yolo, what do you do?</p> <p>Bowen: Dallin says spend it, you only have one life so spend it stupidly. He actually told me what it says and I\u2019m like, oh that makes sense. (kind of inaudible, this is a guess.)</p> <p>Russell: Then what do you do, you say Yolo, then what kind of crazy things do you do?</p> <p>Bowen: Jump in the snow, ankles hurt to death.</p> <p>Ellie: It\u2019s fun.</p> <p>Russell: It\u2019s fun? How many times did you run around the house?</p> <p>Bowen: 5 times.</p> <p>Russell: 5 times.</p> <p>Ellie: When our cousins were here I went two times around the house.</p> <p>Russell: Does Yolo help you to not freak out when it gets cold? What does it help you do?</p> <p>Bowen: It kills you.</p> <p>Russell: Oh it kills you. So Yolo is the challenge. There it is from the mouths of kids. So that\u2019s what I want to recommend, start thinking about that, think Yolo. When you get that inspiration that you know what\u2019s right, before the self doubt, the adversary, whatever it is that you think, whatever it is, I don\u2019t care. But things start popping into your head about why you can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t or you\u2019re probably not worthy to do it. Whatever those things pop up, just shout Yolo at the top of your lungs and start running. That\u2019s the key.</p> <p>And it hurts right? Did you hear that. Tell them, it hurts right.</p> <p>Kids: I get tons of scratches. It was before the acid rains\u2026.</p> <p>Russell: it was before the acid rains. But was it worth it?</p> <p>Kids: running around the house before was softer.</p> <p>Russell: Before the snow hardened it was more worth it?</p> <p>Kid: Yeah.</p> <p>Russell: Ellie says it was worth it though, right? You only live once, you might as well do it. Otherwise, think if you didn\u2019t do it, would you regret it?</p> <p>Kid: Yeah</p> <p>Russell: You would regret it?</p> <p>Kid: I\u2019d still be running around the house if the snow wasn\u2019t that hard. I mean, it would be a lot more fun.</p> <p>Russell: Would you regret it if you yelled Yolo and sat in the hot tub, would you regret it?</p> <p>Kid: yeah, because I\u2019d be burning to death.</p> <p>Russell: Because the hot tub\u2019s too hot. Plus your life would be boring. Would your life be boring if you did nothing and just sat there the whole time?</p> <p>Kid: inaudible.</p> <p>Russell: Alright, they\u2019re being goofy now. Alright, so Yolo, you guys. That is the message for today. Tattoo it on your forehead, on your hand, on your t-shirt. No tattoos though. Temporary tattoos?</p> <p>Kid: yeah.</p> <p>Russell: K you can do temporary tattoos. Anyway\u2026</p> <p>Ellie: Or permanent marker.</p> <p>Russell: or Ellie says permanent marker, not permanent marker. Just a marker you can do it with. I don\u2019t know if you heard Ellie, if you take a shower it will wash off. Anyway, the key though is, when the self doubt comes, after the inspiration comes and the self doubt comes, Yolo. Run, get out of the hot tub and start running before your brain can talk you out of it. Because it will if you\u2019re not careful. So Yolo. Appreciate you guys. Have a great day and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "10:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/292_-_YOLO_-_You_Only_Live_Once.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1484168880, "title": "Episode #291 \u2013 Funnel Confessions", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A quick glimpse behind the scenes of what I'm really doing to build and launch my funnels.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about being the contractor of your business and finding awesome people to do the work you need to get done.

Welcome back to Marketing In Your Car. Sorry, I just get excited. Anyway, it\u2019s crazy here. We\u2019ve had 5 snow days in a row, but today the kids finally, finally got to go back to school, which is nice. But everything is soaking wet. It\u2019s been raining and flooding. Our house flooded. We have a lot of damage. So that\u2019s kind of a nightmare.</p> <p>But the good news is we just went to the new office and it\u2019s getting close to done. We\u2019re about two weeks away from moving into it, which is the most exciting thing in the world. And as we\u2019re sitting here in the office, and I thought about it last night. Last night I finished, I finished! What? I finished the Expert Secrets book. At least this round of it. This is the most painful round of edits thought. It took a lot of time. I have one more round of edits after this, but it\u2019ll go away faster.</p> <p>So I\u2019m pretty much, for all intents and purposes done with the Expert Secrets book, I\u2019m so proud of it. The crazy thing is it\u2019s almost, its within like 100 words of the Dotcom Secrets book, which is weird. That was not planned, but it\u2019s kind of cool too.</p> <p>So when I got done with that it was 1 in the morning, so I started looking at all the cool projects we have. We use Trello, some of you guys know. James Friel got us set up on Trello, so I was thinking of the projects. So I sat down and I\u2019m like, \u201cWho are all the people involved in getting this project done? What are all the talks?\u201d So I sat down last night and just busted out a whole bunch of Trello cards. Assigning people, getting them doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. All the pieces. Then it was done and I went to bed and passed out and it was awesome.</p> <p>Anyway, I was thinking about that versus how some of you are running your business and I want to just liken this also to the new office. I\u2019m in a new office and the contractor dude is there, and he\u2019s kind of showing us everything and what\u2019s interesting as I look at this, is that the contractor didn\u2019t actually do anything really. If you think about it, right? He was sitting there and he got paid by me, I think, I don\u2019t know how much contractors take, 10, 20, 30% or whatever, they get paid a bunch of money.</p> <p>So we pay him and he\u2019s like, \u201cCool.\u201d So then he goes and is like, \u201cAlright, we need a designer.\u201d And hires a designer. And he\u2019s like \u201cOh, we need someone to do this part.\u201d And he hires someone. And all the contractor\u2019s really good at doing is just knowing what are all the pieces that need to go into launching, or to completing and building, and then hopefully he\u2019s put in time to find really good sub-contractors to do each of those pieces. And that\u2019s it. And he gets paid the lion\u2019s share of the project. And all he\u2019s doing is he\u2019s just figured out what are all the pieces that go into building an office, or house or whatever the project is. And then who are all the people I need to hire to do those pieces.</p> <p>I was thinking about that, for me with our funnels and stuff, that\u2019s all it is. Because I\u2019ve done it so many times, I\u2019ve done this now I think I\u2019m on my thirteenth year or so of this business. Some people are funny, \u201cHow come all the things you do are successful.\u201d The reason why is because I built up a really good team of people over the last 12 years. I look at myself almost like the contractor in my business. I know all the pieces that go into us successfully launching something. I don\u2019t have to rethink that, I just know it. It\u2019s second nature now because I\u2019ve done it so many times.</p> <p>There was a time and a season of my life where we were literally launching something at least once a month and if that once a month thing would fail, we would do one every single week until one didn\u2019t fail because that\u2019s how we had to pay payroll. It was a nightmare, but we launched things all the time. Because of that, I know the process. I know that to get something launched here all the things. I know everything inside of my head. And because I\u2019ve been doing it so long, every single time I\u2019m finding, initially it was me doing everything. But then I realized I\u2019m not very good at design, so I hired a designer. Then I realized this and I hired\u2026..I probably hired a hundred designers in the last 12 years. Now I know 3 or 4 that I really liked and I now I just work with those 3 or 4 people.</p> <p>I probably hired a hundred website builders. I hired a hundred programmers, probably a thousand programmers. I\u2019ve done all these things over the years, and from that I\u2019ve got my hands full of 4 or 5 favorites. So when I know I have a project done, I know Rob\u2019s going to do this, so and so\u2019s going to do this, boom, boom, boom. I task the whole thing out and everyone starts working on it. And what\u2019s cool for me, as the contractor, this isn\u2019t true in all cases, but in the building, the people can\u2019t frame the building until the person is finished doing the foundation. There\u2019s things that have to go in order.</p> <p>With what we do in our business, most people can do their thing independent of everyone else. The video guy can do videos independent of everyone else. The designers can do that. The copywriters, everyone do the thing indepently. The goal is getting everyone to start on all the pieces as soon as humanly possible. Everyone is doing the pieces and they start coming in and then the last step, which for me as a person is my favorite part, so I do it now. But I could have outsourced the part. For me it\u2019s like, here\u2019s all the pieces now, these are all the things I needed to get this funnel done, now I just need to plug them all in. Because of Clickfunnels, I just plug them in. And obviously I work with Steven Larsen on my team.</p> <p>We plug all the pieces in and it\u2019s ready to launch. But if you look at all the projects I have, what\u2019s interesting is I\u2019ve got the next probably 10 funnels completely done. Front end project is done, everything is done. I just have to, all the assets are sitting in Trello boards finished just waiting for me to say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready to launch this one.\u201d Then I login, spend a day and plug all the pieces in and boom it\u2019s ready to go.</p> <p>In fact, yesterday we were working on the Funnel University Newsletter, if you\u2019re not a member of Funnel University yet, by the way, you\u2019re insane. Go to funnelu.com. Anyway, we were\u2026. I got a\u2026\u2026are you kidding me? Road closure. Dangit. There\u2019s some huge pot holes up here. Okay, so now I\u2019m on a road closure and I\u2019m going through a neighborhood and I have no idea. Dang, I\u2019m really bad at these kind of things. I\u2019m so bad at directions. I\u2019m just going to follow the headlights in front of me and pray they\u2019re going the same direction I\u2019m going.</p> <p>Anyway, where did I leave off? So yesterday we were doing January\u2019s Funnel University Newsletter and in the newsletter I was showing the Marketing In Your Car funnel, which we reacently launched and you have all seen. The strategy behind it, the marketing in your car funnel was a couple of reasons. One was to get you guys all indoctrinated listening to Marketinginyourcar.com every single day. That was number one, number two is to get more subscribers. Number three, this was actually our core reason, is I\u2019m trying to get people to join Funnel University. You probably saw that in the upsell sequence.</p> <p>Yesterday in the newsletter I was showing how basically if you look at probably the next dozen funnels we roll out, they will be new, cool front ends to help build our cult-ture and get people excited about Clickfunnels. So different swag things, different cool things, but then the upsell sequence is all pushing, the upsell sequence is identical, it does not change. So I literally in 40 minutes, and I record the whole process, all the Funnel U. Members will be able to see it inside the new forum we\u2019re setting up for you guys. I took the Marketing In Your Car funnel and cloned it.</p> <p>I already had the video done, I already had the graphics. Everything was already done weeks ago, months ago actually. I just drag and drop, boom, boom, in 40 minutes the new funnel is ready to launch and it was done. It came because I knew, whatever, 6 months ago, that I wanted to do a project called Funnel Graffiti. I knew, in fact, it\u2019s been almost a year, because we gave out funnel Graffiti at the last Funnel Hacking Live event, so it\u2019s been a year. So then we filmed the video this summer.</p> <p>But I tasked all this stuff out a long time ago, so it\u2019s all sitting there done and as soon as I\u2019m ready to launch it, it was done. So it took 45 minutes to launch this funnel because I had all these things done. So that\u2019s the powers, if all of us as marketers start looking more at our business as we\u2019re contractors as opposed to the actual sub-contractor working, and you can sub-contract out to yourself, especially the stuff you like to do, I\u2019m guessing if you\u2019re like me, you like building stuff in Clickfunnels, so sub-contract that out to you or a certified partner or whatever. But look at yourself more as a contractor, and become a master at understanding what are all the pieces that go into launching a funnel.</p> <p>And the funny thing is that the only way to know all the pieces that go into launching a funnel, is by launching a funnel. In fact, I try to get this through people\u2019s minds all the time. Because everyone thinks their first funnel is going to be a winner, right. So they create this funnel and go through all the pain and heartache and headache that go through making your first funnel. And there\u2019s a lot. You have to figure out how to write copy, to edit pages, and images and videos and orders and products. There\u2019s so much crap that goes into your first one and then it\u2019s horrible.</p> <p>And most of the time your first one will fail, you will not make any money. In fact, most of the time you will lose money. It\u2019ll be a bucket of money with a hole in the bottom and the cash will be pouring out of it. But you have to be okay with that because the only way for you to learn every single step in the process, for you, is to do it once.</p> <p>Always tell people that the first funnel, you\u2019re going to spend so much time and effort, and it might fail. In fact, you\u2019re probably going to fail but you gotta be okay with that. Because it\u2019s not about you launching this funnel and making a bunch of money, its about you as a new contractor, a new funnel builder learning a new process, all the pieces that go into that. Because after you do it once you\u2019re like, \u201cDang, well now I know I need this and this. I hired these people, this guy sucked and this one was awesome. I\u2019m not going to hire him again, I\u2019m going to hire a new person.\u201d And you keep doing that over and over again and eventually after you launch three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty funnels, whatever that is, you will have your dream team of people that are working with you. You will know exactly who to go to every single time.</p> <p>And if you fast forward six months to a year from now, you\u2019re going to be in the same situation I am. I don\u2019t fail anymore because I know our team. I know what our market wants. I know who is going to do each piece of it, so I can quickly create something and just have it work really, really quickly. For you guys that\u2019s the goal.</p> <p>I had two interviews yesterday from people that were asking about the whole \u201cYou\u2019re just one funnel away\u201d concept, that\u2019s the theme of this year\u2019s Funnel Hacking Live event. And I wanted, during those interviews I explained, \u201cLook, you\u2019re just one funnel away, you don\u2019t know which funnel that is. I wish I could show you guys the landscape of failed funnels that I\u2019ve had in my 12 years in this business.\u201d I\u2019ve got more failed funnels that I could show you, than I guarantee most of you guys have ever even dreamt of attempting. But because of that, that\u2019s how I built my team. How I figured out what didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve mastered the process. All the pieces that go in there like the back of my hand. I don\u2019t have to think anymore, it just happens.</p> <p>So today, excuse me, last night I was like, \u201chere\u2019s the project, here are all the pieces.\u201d I tasked them all out and now everyone\u2019s working on them. I\u2019m not sure when we\u2019ll launch that project, but I do know that the second I\u2019m ready for it, all the pieces will be there and I don\u2019t have to think about it at that point. I\u2019m digging my well before I\u2019m thirsty. I\u2019m getting all the things in place.</p> <p>So think about that you guys. Again, this whole concept, \u201cYou\u2019re one funnel away\u201d Is so powerful. You don\u2019t know which funnel it\u2019s gonna be. You\u2019ve gotta keep building, walking, trying, failing, moving forward. A really cool, I might have shared this with you guys before so forgive me if I have, but it\u2019s worth repeating. Probably almost ten years ago now, maybe even more, I got this Jay Abraham course and I was listening to it. And one of the speakers was Brian Tracey. I had never heard Brian Tracey speak before and he was on stage, and it was just, I loved what he was saying.</p> <p>I remember what he talked about; he said that one day he was watching this TV show with a bunch of millionaires. It was like a news talk show or whatever. There\u2019s like twelve millionaires on stage and they were interviewing them and asking a bunch of questions. And the host asks a question, \u201cHow many times did you guys have to fail on average before you had success?\u201d and they didn\u2019t know off the top of their heads, so they cut to commercial. During the commercial break they did all the math and figured it out. They came back, and this panel of people, they said that they figured on average, they\u2019d each failed about 12 times before they had success.</p> <p>Brian Tracey said something interesting, he said, \u201cDo you think that they just tried something and failed, tried something and failed. And on average the 12<sup>th</sup> time they got lucky and it finally worked? Or do you think that the first time they did it, they didn\u2019t have the resources or the connections, or people, or idea or whatever, but they did it and it failed. The second one, they did it and it failed. The third, they did it and it failed. Each time they failed they learned something. And they figured something out and literally by the 12<sup>th</sup> time, they had failed every way possible.\u201d By the 12<sup>th</sup> time they knew how this process worked and there was no way they can fail at that point.</p> <p>It\u2019s like Thomas Edison, he said when he, every time he failed the light bulb, he was like I figured out a new way to not build a light bulb. He had a thousand ways he tried and didn\u2019t work, but he didn\u2019t look at those as failures. That way didn\u2019t work, that way didn\u2019t work. Cool, this way it worked. We gotta look at things that way as well, you guys. So many of us are getting into this like, \u201dI want a million dollar webinar.\u201d And I\u2019m like, dude that\u2019s awesome, but you gotta put in the work man. Let me tell you how many decades of effort. I guess just one. But I mean, for me to be able to do what I do now, we can do a webinar and make half a million bucks, it didn\u2019t just come magically. It came on the back of ten years of failing and failing and trying and failing and building a team, and learning and growing and learning and growing and coming to that.</p> <p>Obviously, we\u2019ve tried to give you guys a lot of short cuts. Perfect Webinar is a short cut. Clickfunnels is a short cut. Honestly, Facebook\u2019s a short cut. Facebook\u2019s the greatest gift to marketers right now, in the world. And I don\u2019t think it will be here forever, but it\u2019s here now and it\u2019s amazing. All these short cuts, so hopefully you guys don\u2019t have to spend ten years, but do know you are going to have to spend some time. And do know you are going to fail, but if you keep it in your mind that you\u2019re just one funnel away\u2026.I don\u2019t know if that funnel is today, tomorrow, a month from now, six months from now, but if you have that in your mind knowing with absolute certainty that one of these funnels is going to be the one, it\u2019s going to be the freedom maker for you. You have absolute certainty of it, you keep building, moving forward, pushing, I promise you will hit that. But you have to have absolute certainty that it\u2019s going to happen.</p> <p>One of the interviews yesterday, someone asked me, \u201cWhat was the \u201cwhy\u201d behind what got you into this thing and why you push yourself so hard?\u201d I said, \u201cWhen I got started, I was watching these people online who were having success. Back then in was Armand Morin, Alex Mandossian, Marlin Sanders, my mentors. Mark Joyner. All I know is I looked at these guys and I believed them. I believed that what they were doing was making them money and because I saw them doing it, I had 100% absolute certainty that it worked and that I could make it work. I didn\u2019t know how, but I was positive that I could and it would. Because of that I didn\u2019t stop. Because I had perfect that it was going to work, so I just started running and running and running.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0I think a lot of problems that some of us have is that we don\u2019t have faith. \u201cI think this can work. I think this can work for me.\u201d And because of that you try and dabble and try and dabble and doing quite go all in, but if you know with absolute certainty that there\u2019s no way this is going to fail, it\u2019s going to take you a bunch of times, but you know that\u2019s it\u2019s gonna work. It\u2019ll push you through the hard nights, the failures, the funnel flops. But it\u2019ll be worth it. I promise you guys it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s not only worth it for you and your family, because the money that comes from it is amazing, but it\u2019s worth it for the people you are serving with the products and service you are creating.</p> <p>You will touch their lives in a way that doesn\u2019t make sense to you now, but when you see it and you see the fruits of that, it\u2019s pretty amazing. So I want to leave that with you guys today. I hope that helps. I\u2019m at the office now. I\u2019m going from the new amazing office to the old crappy office. In the old crappy office two more weeks or so, then we\u2019re out of here.</p> <p>Appreciate you all, thanks so much for listening.

It is Snowpocalypse here in Boise, so they told us last night. At 1:30 I got an email from Brent, on my team. It was a video from Vin Crosby, the local news dude, it was a ten minute long thing talking about why the next 5 to 7 days is going to be insane. He talked about basically getting a foot of snow that should be starting in about 15 minutes from right now. Then after the snow comes, the next day it\u2019s supposed to rain ice, so it\u2019s going to rain like an inch of worth of water that will instantly turn to ice. Which he said will probably break tons of trees and power lines, which means we got no power, which means basically there\u2019s a good shot there\u2019ll be no power for the next 4 or 5 days. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>That was at 1:30 in the morning last night. So I\u2019m like, crap I\u2019m probably the last person to know about this. I don\u2019t watch the news. So I was going to go race to the store last night, but then I woke up my wife and she\u2019s like, \u201cEverything is closed right now.\u201d So we set my alarm for 6am this morning. The alarm goes off, I jump into the car and head on this journey to save my family from snowpocalypse, which is really fun.</p> <p>I first went to Walmart because they opened earliest. Got tons, like 5 pallets of water and toilet paper, those kind of necessities. Then I went to Fred Meyer and bought food and, it\u2019s funny, Brent was there. I bumped into Brent. It was so funny. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, what are you doing? How funny that you\u2019re here.\u201d\u00a0 He had these two space heaters. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh I\u2019ve got 5 space heaters in my house.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cBut you plug them in, right?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh crap, yes.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell these are ones that run on propane, you need to get one of those.\u201d So I got a propane thing. That was at Walmart. So Walmart was out of propane, so that\u2019s why I went to Fred Meyer.</p> <p>At Fred Meyer I bought 20 canisters of propane. Each propane thing will keep the heater going for 3 to 6 hours. So I got enough to keep me warm in a tiny room warm for 5 days if we need it. And then we got food and stuff so that was awesome. Then Brent was like, \u201cI went over here and I got a generator.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh!\u201d So I run over here to get a generator, they were all sold out. So I went to another place, they were sold out. But then luckily Dave found generators not sold out.</p> <p>And then I went to Dicks Sporting Goods, trying to find a generator, but instead I bought a whole bunch of stuff for the wrestling room. So the wrestling room is all prepped out as well. They canceled church tomorrow, which if you know anything about Mormon\u2019s, we don\u2019t cancel church. So something crazy is about to happen. So we\u2019re all ready for it. The kids are all excited, they\u2019re getting their little tents sent up and everything, and likely nothing is really going to happen. But if it does, we\u2019re prepared.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve been Snapchatting my whole preppers journey. But while I was doing this whole thing, it\u2019s been probably 4 or 5 hours that I\u2019ve been on the road going back and forth from my house to the store, from my house to the store, I\u2019ve been listening to a whole bunch of cool stuff. In fact, I\u2019ve gone through about a day and a half of the 5 thousand dollar seminar while I was here. While I\u2019ve been doing this.</p> <p>It\u2019s amazing you can learn so much. So what I want to share with you guys today, is some internet marketing math. Some numbers for you all. This is a little different than, I\u2019ve done math episodes in the past but here\u2019s some key metrics for you guys to look at. Maybe we\u2019ll call it the KPI episode. So here\u2019s some KPI\u2019s-Key Performance Indicators for your business. Hopefully these will help.</p> <p>Some of these I\u2019ve had in my business for a long time, some of these I picked up today, which were kind of cool. So we\u2019ll start at the very beginning. The first thing is you should know that on average you will make about $1 per name for each person on your list. Honestly, it should be higher than that, but that should be the baseline. You should make at least that if you are emailing your list and actually communicating with them. So that means if you have a thousand people on your list you should be making at least $1000 a month. Ten thousand people on your list, 10 grand a month. Thirty thousand people on your list, 30 grand a month and so on and so forth.</p> <p>The first time I ever heard that, I set a goal. I said, \u201cCrap, I want a hundred thousand people on my list.\u201d And that became my focus. And sure enough, just like I was told and I heard, my income stayed very similar to that for a long time. And by the time I passed a hundred thousand people on my list, I was making a hundred grand a month. So for you guys that are setting goals, make that the first goal. Goal number one is that.</p> <p>Again, $1 per month, per name is on the lower end of the spectrum. Right now I look at our company and we are almost $8 per name on our list. We got a big list. So yes, that\u2019s on the low end. Just to kind of have the metric to shoot towards. So there\u2019s number one.</p> <p>Number two metric is, and this is kind of cool, I learned today. On the continuity program, so if you have someone one a print newsletter or a membership site or whatever it is, there was this test they were talking about. They said that for the test on average, for every dollar someone spends with you for continuity, they will spend $3 more with you throughout the year. So if they\u2019re paying $40 a month, they\u2019re going to average, whatever that is. So every dollar in continuity, they\u2019re going to spend $3 more with you. So that\u2019s kind of cool.</p> <p>Dan Kennedy used to tell me that for thousand people you have in a continuity program, it\u2019s an extra million dollars in revenue you will make that year. And I started looking, after that I launched a print newsletter and sure enough, just like he said, for every thousand people I had on my continuity program, we were making a million dollars a year in revenue. It didn\u2019t come directly from the continuity program, but it came from, because they\u2019re members of your continuity they will start buying other things. So they will buy, who knows, coaching programs, upsells, other products, things like that. Because they are getting it, they will spend three times as much money with you when they\u2019re a continuity member than they will when they are not.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the second thing. If I were looking at your business I would be looking at how many subscribers do I have? How many people are on continuity right now paying me monthly? So that\u2019s the next metric. And then the third one I want to share with you that\u2019s kind of cool. Matt Furey is on this course I\u2019m listening to from probably ten years ago, so it\u2019s older. One thing he said that was awesome, he said, \u201cYou should try to get at least 500 people to buy from you a month.\u201d Obviously first off you have to try to get one person to buy from you. But after you got customers, it\u2019s happening; people need to make at least 500 transactions a month with you.</p> <p>I started thinking about that, it goes back to the RFMS thing that we talked about 2 or 3 episodes ago. Recency, Frequency, things like that. But if you think about that, you need to be getting your customers buying at least 500 purchases, need to be happening per month. Obviously for me, we\u2019re way past that. But it\u2019s still a good metric, a good number to look at.</p> <p>So there\u2019s some new metrics for you guys. Hope that helps a little bit. Because for me, when I look at things, it\u2019s funny whatever we measure grows. If you look at sports, without changing anything else, your lifting routine, your eating, anything, as soon as you start measuring stuff, it grows. It\u2019s like a magic trick. So those are the three things you can start measuring. First off, how many people are on my list. That should be something you look at daily. When I first started doing this I was like man, I wanted a big list. So I start looking, I\u2019m like oh I\u2019m adding twenty people a day. I started looking and I started growing 20 to 30. 30 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 200, 200 to 500, 500 to 1000. You already know, we\u2019re trying to get 1000 people a day on our list. That metric grew because we looked at it. So looking at subscribers.</p> <p>Number two looking at your continuity members. I don\u2019t know about you guys but we\u2019re obsessed with Clickfunnels. Looking at our metrics on that. And Funnel University, the same thing, I got a goal, we are just shy of 30 thousand active members in Clickfunnels, as of today and our goal is 100 thousand by the end of next year. So we\u2019ve got to look at that number a lot, because we have to add a lot of people to get that number. But it\u2019s definitely attainable, we can get it.</p> <p>In Funnel University, our goal is to have 10 thousand members in Funnel University, but I gotta look at that number and consistently have it in front of me. So my CPA\u2019s gotta email me that every single day so I know what\u2019s the number. Because if I\u2019m looking at it, then it\u2019s gonna grow.</p> <p>Then the third metric for you guys to look at is frequency of purchasing. Trying to get, make sure there\u2019s at least 500 transactions a month going through your merchant account. If not, you need to be doing fire sales, you need to be doing cool things, you need to be doing free plus shipping, whatever it is to get your people to buy more consistently. So that should be another metric.</p> <p>So there you go, there\u2019s three metrics for you. A dollar per name per month. A thousand people paying continuity is worth a million dollars a year to you. And you need to be getting 500 transactions a month coming into your merchant account. And if you do those things, you\u2019ll have a very healthy business. So there\u2019s three cool numbers to look at and measure. I hope that helps. I\u2019m home, I\u2019m going to unload firewood I bought today and all the other toys and food and if I don\u2019t survive the snowpocalypse, tell my parents and everyone else who\u2019s not here in Boise that I love them. We will talk to you guys all again soon. Thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "09:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/290_-_Three_Cool_KPIs_You_Should_Be_Watching.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1483992535, "title": "Episode #289 \u2013 Grab The Big Pile Of Cash First", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The process of going from hot to warm to cold traffic.</p> <p>On today's episode Russell talks about re-launching the Marketing In Your Car podcast and how that is going.

Welcome to a freezing cold Marketing In Your Car. Boise has been covered in feet of snow, not foot, feet. Many feet of snow. Everything has been frozen. We\u2019ve had three snow days in a row, back to back to back. But I had to get to the office today because we were doing a webinar, and I don\u2019t trust my home internet connection as much as the office. Plus I miss everybody, I wanted to see them all again. I\u2019ve been working from home the last few days.</p> <p>I still haven\u2019t finished the book, it\u2019s killing me. But we did get launched the Marketing In Your Car free MP3 player. So if you haven\u2019t got yours yet go to <a href=\"http://marketinginyourcar.com\">marketinginyourcar.com</a>. I\u2019m guessing though if you\u2019re listening right now, you\u2019re probably on. We had to do a couple of things, I think I told you. Our old RSS feed, I totally screwed up on so we retired that podcast. So it\u2019s, that one\u2019s kind of paused. It says archived image there. And then if you come to the new one, that\u2019s the one you\u2019re listening to right now. And we\u2019re all hanging out and having fun over here.</p> <p>And what\u2019s been fun, by kind of restarting the thing and launching the free MP3 player, we were able to do a new launch around it, which is fun. So we\u2019ve got over a thousand people in the first 24 hours have gotten a free MP3 player. So hopefully a thousand of you guys are listening to this, or more, that are new. And hopefully we\u2019ll keep growing. I just appreciate all of you guys sharing and all the good feedback for the podcast. Makes me happy.</p> <p>In fact, today was really, really cool. One of my friends, he\u2019s the Clickfunnels member and someone I met, I think at the first Funnel Hacking event, anyway, his name is Travis Cody. He sent me, I got this box in the mail today and I opened it up and there\u2019s a video playing on the screen of this box, talking and it\u2019s Travis talking. And then I looked down and inside of the box there\u2019s these two huge books, and I pull them out and a lot of you guys know I\u2019m Mormon, so there\u2019s a Book of Mormon. It looks like a special font on it, different color and everything. And it looks like two Book of Mormons, but it\u2019s the Book of Brunson. I\u2019m like, what? I open it up and it\u2019s all of my podcasts put in this book. It was the coolest gift I\u2019ve ever gotten.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know, he says he\u2019s got an idea, so maybe we\u2019re going to start selling these as an actual product, but it was super cool. So I got the Book of Brunson now. So if I start quoting scripture, I\u2019m like, \u201cThe Book of Brunson, Chapter 2, Verse 16.\u201d You\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s all coming from this podcast. It was a super cool gift from him. So thank you Travis if you\u2019re listening. Appreciate that, it was really fun. It\u2019s just been fun re-getting excited about this podcast. I\u2019ve been doing it for so long now and at first, I don\u2019t think anyone listened for a long time. But I was doing it because I thought it was fun.</p> <p>And the cool thing is that, because of the way I set up the RSS feed, I had no way to check if people are actually listening. Which is actually helpful because then I didn\u2019t know if anyone was listening, so I didn\u2019t assume people were listening. Now,\u00a0 a few years later, I know we\u2019ve got a lot of listeners. Now that we\u2019re moving things over I\u2019ll actually be able to see how many people are listening and downloads and all that kind of stuff. So that will be kind of fun. But regardless, it\u2019s something I enjoy and it\u2019s been hugely beneficial for me, just to get out my thoughts and ideas and what I\u2019m thinking.</p> <p>And you guys have obviously have been a huge sounding board for me as we\u2019ve gone from near bankruptcy when I started this podcast, to where we\u2019re at today. And I just appreciate you guys listening and sharing and commenting. So if you guys are listening, please I love for you to come and comment on the new feed because we switched over, obviously there were zero stars, I think we\u2019re like 35 or 40 stars now, so that\u2019s good. But the more you guys can come and comment, let me know. Right now, especially for the next week or two, I\u2019m really intently reading comments. So feel free to drop a comment. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll read it, which will be kind of fun.</p> <p>With that said, welcome to the podcast, those of you guys who are new. So for those who are new, the way this works is as I\u2019m driving to the office and back I just share cool ideas and things we are working on and stuff that I think would be helpful for you. I\u2019m heading home from the office right now. I had a webinar today with JLD, John Lee Dumas, which was fun and worked awesomely. We helped serve his people well. We sold a bunch of Clickfunnels, which is the key to happiness for me and for them as entrepreneurs, as you know, which is really cool.</p> <p>And then afterwards we had a Dream 100 meeting. What is a Dream 100? As you listen and you guys catch up on my podcast, I talk about this a lot, but this is the foundation of promotion of business for me. So go back and find some of those calls where we go deeper. Basically Dream 100, who are the 100 people in your market that have your dream customers on their list right now, and how can you get them to promote you to their audience?</p> <p>When we launched the Dotcom Secrets book, we built the dream 100 list, and we started sending people Dream 100 gifts in the mail. We sent them copies of the new book that was coming out, we sent Ferrari key chains because we were giving away a Ferrari.\u00a0 We did all these cool things, we kept sending them out. And we did that to get people to promote. And it\u2019s funny because from that Dream 100 campaign, we got a whole bunch of people promoting the book that I didn\u2019t have relationships with at all.</p> <p>We found who were all the top business podcasters that are out there. So I had a bunch of them and we started sending them the book and stuff. John Lee Dumas was one of them, I never met him at the time. A couple of days later I get an email saying, \u201cRussell, your book is awesome. I want to promote it.\u201d And now we\u2019ve done 3 funnel hack webinars, he\u2019s sold a few thousand copies of my book and we\u2019ve made a bunch of money together. And it came from the Dream 100 concept. John was just one of the many people we did it with. But I built lists of 100 people, and honestly my Dream 100 list keeps growing and growing.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what today\u2019s meeting was about, kind of trimming that down. Who\u2019s our Dream 100 for my next book launch coming up in April? And we\u2019re putting those things together and kind of mapping out a strategy. And a couple of things I want to know. One thing, the book launch is at the end of April, so we\u2019re like almost 3 1/2 months away. And we\u2019re doing this now. A big part of this is digging the well before you\u2019re thirsty.</p> <p>A lot of you will launch a product and then start going and bugging JV partners and stuff and it\u2019s like no, do that work ahead of time. So we\u2019re planning out now, we\u2019ll be contacting everyone and getting people information so they can get it on the calendar,\u00a0 and we\u2019ll be sending copies of the book as soon as they come out.</p> <p>We\u2019re trying to prepare for that and get it ready and build a good relationship with everybody before that. Just to kind of get people excited for the book. But it\u2019s the foundation. So what\u2019s cool is we have our new reality show that\u2019s close to done called Funnel Hacker TV as well. So we filmed the Dream 100 process today so you guys will be able to see it soon. You\u2019ll see how this is the foundation for everything we do in our business, building that list of partners. And initially\u2026..my biggest goal of the Dream 100, if I can get them to promote my book or whatever the thing is that we\u2019re selling, that\u2019s the best. If I can get them to promote on a podcast, or through their blog or email, that\u2019s number one. So we try that initially, but a lot of people can\u2019t or won\u2019t.</p> <p>So after that is done, we try the first phase, which is let\u2019s get them to promote it, that\u2019s a warm audience, excuse me that\u2019s the hot. We got the hot and transition down to warm. The warm audience may not know me but I can market to Toni Robbins\u2019 followers, or Tim Farris\u2019 followers, or things like that on Facebook, so that\u2019s a warm audience. People may know Toni and not me, but I can create a bridge page that bridges that gap between Toni and me, and then get them to buy the book or whatever the thing is, register for the webinar.</p> <p>So we start building bridge pages to our warm audience to bring them from there over. So that\u2019s the second thing, taking the Dream 100 list we have and then going after them as a warm audience. We\u2019re advertising directly to them as opposed to Toni or someone directly marketing to his people. So that\u2019s phase number two in our Dream 100.</p> <p>And then phase number three is to go into cold traffic and stuff like that. So one cool thing we\u2019re doing that\u2019s not live yet, but may be live by the time you guys get this. Changing up <a href=\"http://Russellbrunson.com\">Russellbrunson.com</a>. So again, depending on when you go there. If you go there and see a picture of me standing there with a bunch of links around the sides of me, that\u2019s the new one. I\u2019m doing this blog and the blog I\u2019m going to be documenting this journey of how we\u2019re doing this whole thing from the dream 100 to the book launch and trying to take you on a journey from how we went from 0 to selling hopefully a million copies of my book. So that\u2019s kind of cool.</p> <p>So you\u2019ll see the transitions we go from hot traffic, our own existing lists, then our partners lists, then shifting and transforming down to a warm audience. From there trying to saturate that, and from there transition down to a cold audience. And what\u2019s the differences between going after warm traffic versus cold. Because it\u2019s different. The way I position hot, if you\u2019ve read the Dotcom Secrets book you know about hot traffic, warm traffic, cold traffic, but it\u2019s different the way I sell to each of them.</p> <p>So we start with the hot, it\u2019s funny in my Inner Circle, everyone\u2019s trying to convert cold traffic. I\u2019m like, \u201cWait, there\u2019s a huge pile of cash sitting right in front of you. Grab the big pile of cash first. That\u2019s your warm market, grab them first. That\u2019s the hot market, excuse me. Then there\u2019s the warm market, which is one step back, that\u2019s the next big pile of cash, so grab that before you go for the cold.\u201d Make all the money you can out of the hot market, then go to the warm market, then you go to the cold. And each level of that process, moving from hot to warm to cold, the sales process, the funnels, the messaging, the language patterns, all those things change.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be sharing those and documenting them on the new Russell Brunson blog. How we went from 0 to a million copies of my book here over the next, I mean who knows how long it takes to get me a million bucks, probably a couple of years, which will be kind of cool.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to be doing all sorts of stuff. We already have in the works, plans to do infomercial, radio campaigns, mass market, PR. It\u2019s going to be a ride. It\u2019s going to be a fun journey. So hopefully you guys will come along on the journey with me. But just know that that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re doing. The goal is to show the strategy. How we roll out a book and how we take that book and help it to, the Dotcom Secrets book, when we launched that, it was the foundation that got us, to now we\u2019re almost 30 thousand active customers inside of Clickfunnels. So that\u2019s the goal, how do we do that and how do we leverage a book or any kind of front end product, to build the back end of your company.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the journey that I\u2019ll be taking you guys on. I hope you can join me for the ride. With that said, I\u2019m home. In a day or two or whatever check out <a href=\"http://russellbrunson.com\">russellbrunson.com</a>, check out the blog and we\u2019ll start the first post. I already wrote the first post, and we\u2019re going to start doing that once a week. Sharing the journey and showing you how many books we sold from each of the things and that\u2019ll be the game plan. With that said, I\u2019m home. Appreciate you guys, thanks for listening, thanks for subscribing. Please come comment and share, let me know what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m excited to be on this journey with you guys. Talk to you all again soon.

I hope you guys are doing awesome, it is New Year\u2019s Eve morning. It\u2019s the morning of the eve. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense. But I\u2019m heading to the grocery store real quick to get some stuff for the party tonight. I\u2019m really, really excited for it. Some cool things happening, just real quick.</p> <p>For those of you guys who want a timeline for when, if you\u2019re listening to this in the future, last night Rhonda Rousey fought what\u2019s her name Nunez. The fight lasted less than 48 seconds, it was insane. I got home last night and seriously tried to find a pirated copy online because I had a hot date with my beautiful wife last night. It was crazy. I can\u2019t even\u2026I felt so bad for her. So that happened last night.</p> <p>And last night I went and saw Star Wars Rouge One. I gotta tell you what, people are like, \u201cStar Wars sucks. The new Star Wars is lame.\u201d All these things, right.\u00a0 It was amazing. I don\u2019t know. The fact that, I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you, but the fact that everybody dies at the end was amazing. That was actually, I mean it\u2019s sad, but that was so cool for the story line. And then the fact that the very end that Darth Vader has his fight scene and going through thrashing everyone. How could someone not think that movie was not amazing? I don\u2019t know, anyway, it was amazing.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because I get done, and not that I\u2019m easily amused, but if you listened to my podcast a while ago, I don\u2019t know how much money they invested in that, but I paid $12 for the ticket. Insane, they entertained me for that long and it was amazing.\u00a0 I loved it, it was really fun.</p> <p>But I digress, because today I\u2019ve been wanting to do a podcast because I have something that I\u2019ve wanted to talk about for three days and I keep forgetting to talk to you guys about it. So I\u2019m stopping everything, I almost did it last night at like two in the morning because I\u2019m so excited but I was kind of tired. So I\u2019m talking about it now. This is a cool thing I wanted to share with you guys because it was a big epiphany for me. In fact, let me catch up the last podcast. We told you about my goal, what we\u2019re doing, trying to 3x the company. In one night we had three hundred thousand dollars in new money we had to make, it was insane. So we launched funnelimmersion.com, some of you saw that. Plus we went and hit all of our other Hail Mary passes. Of the five Hail Mary passes we threw up, almost all of them hit.</p> <p>It was crazy, within 24 hours of me doing that podcast, we made over 500 thousand dollars and smashed our goal. It\u2019s crazy. The last two days we didn\u2019t even need to do anything. But then the next two days, because of the momentum of that first initial push, it was insane. So we did, well we\u2019ll see what happens today, in the last 3 days we needed an extra 300 thousand dollars in money, and we made almost a million.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s crazy, for us to triple the company, and I didn\u2019t know this until after we did it. I\u2019m glad our accountant didn\u2019t tell me, because I would have thought it was impossible if he would have told me. I\u2019m so glad that sometimes people don\u2019t tell you stuff. Belief is such a funny thing. But he told me after we had smashed the record he was like, \u201cJust to put this in perspective, for you guys to beat your record, in December, the worst month in the industry, you would have had to make 40% of the money that you had actually made all of the last year.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d It\u2019s just crazy. We ended up doing, we made, actually hit 50% of last year\u2019s revenue in December, which is crazy because last year was an 8 figure year. So 50% of our revenue. We basically got half of our money last year, in December. And way more than 3x\u2019d our company from the year before, which is crazy.</p> <p>So I feel bad for the morons in 2017 who are running this company, because they gotta 3x that again. Oh crap, that\u2019s me. Dangit. I was like, \u201cThe more we do now, the more we have to do next year.\u201d So it\u2019ll just keep raising the bar.</p> <p>Alright, so I\u2019m going to step back. There\u2019s so many other cool things I want to share with you guys. Funnel Hacker TV episode one is finished and it\u2019s amazing. All the other ones are in production. The two comma club video and award thing is in process and almost done. There\u2019s so many, I can\u2019t even tell you guys how many cool things are happening right now. The new Marketing In Your Car mp3/funnel/element in the editor are all going to be live next week, next Thursday. I\u2019ve been going for four and a half minutes and I didn\u2019t talk about what I\u2019m talking about because I\u2019m so excited. There\u2019s so many cool things happening</p> <p>you guys. It\u2019s just blowing my mind.</p> <p>With all that kind of cool stuff happening. I want to share with you guys the gold nugget that I think is huge. That I can\u2019t even, it\u2019s going to be exciting. So here it is. For those of you guys, I feel fortunate that I got started, learning this game, back when the internet was just kind of getting new. So the only people to learn from, Corey Riddle was there. He was the pioneer, Corey Riddle. And then outside of him there was nobody that, there wasn\u2019t a lot of people teaching. Then Armand Morin, there was a couple guys that came out, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of stuff.</p> <p>For me to learn this whole marketing game I had to go back to the old school. There\u2019s no school like the old school. So I was learning from Gary Halpert and Dan Kennedy and Jay Abraham. So most of my foundation actually came from those guys. And then how do you actually apply it to internet marketing? And I feel bad because most of you guys who are listening now came in a day and age where there\u2019s a million internet coaches and you miss a lot of this cool foundational stuff that I was blessed enough to get by studying these old legends.</p> <p>So when I was learning from those guys, it was back, everything they were doing was direct mail. And I was always trying to figure out how to relate that back to what we\u2019re doing. One of the big things, the way that direct mail would work is that you\u2019d have an offer, you\u2019d write a sales letter and you\u2019d rent a list of people that are likely to buy your product. When you buy a list, how do you know if I\u2019m getting a good list or a bad list. So these guys, I don\u2019t know who it was that came up with it. But they came up a form to find out how good a list it actually is. So the formula was based on three letters. RFM. So RFM is like if you\u2019re direct person this is second nature to you, if you\u2019re not let me talk about what it is.</p> <p>So RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and then Monetary value. So RFM. So if I\u2019m running a list, I want a list of people that have bought a business opportunity product. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m selling supplements, I want a list of people who have bought health supplements, or nerve supplements, whatever it is. So the first thing I want is Recency. Somebody who has purchased something recently. You might think that if someone bought something recently they\u2019re not going to want my thing. No, it\u2019s not true. One thing we know about buyers in heat, when somebody buys something, they buy a lot of things right around that period of time.</p> <p>So if I\u2019m selling a business opportunity, I want to sell somebody who\u2019s recently bought a business opportunity. It kind of doesn\u2019t make logical sense, but it makes perfect sense when you understand how buyers work. Think about when you first got into this business and you started learning about how to make money online, or whatever that thing was for you. You didn\u2019t buy one thing. You were a buyer in heat and you bought a lot. So I want to sell to people who have bought things recently.</p> <p>Second thing, is frequency. I want people who are buying things frequently. They didn\u2019t just buy something once and you never hear from them again. I want someone who has bought five business opportunities in the last year. They\u2019re frequently buying.</p> <p>And the last one is M, Monetary value, people who are spending a lot of money. The more money they spend, the more they are likely to spend. People like me, I buy things recently, I buy things frequently, and I spend a lot of money. I\u2019m like the dream buyer in the markets that I\u2019m interested in. So RFM, that was the thing. So when I\u2019m getting direct mail lists, the higher the RFM score is the more, the better that list is for me. What\u2019s cool is in Clickfunnels, in Actionetics, those of you guys who\u2019ve used the Actionetics, we haven\u2019t started training hard core on this yet. That\u2019ll be one of the big things for next year. But\u00a0 we have an RFM score. In fact, we have an RFMS score.</p> <p>So if you look at the action score in contacts. So if you\u2019re in Actionetics, click on contact, and you\u2019ll see a little circle in the top right hand corner, it looks really cool and it\u2019s their RFMS score, it stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value, and then the S stands for Social. Because one cool thing that the internet has brought to us is the ability to watch people socially and stuff like that. One of my buddies, Jeremy Shoemoney, he found out, he did some tests and he said that\u2026.he owned an auto-responder company for a while so he was doing all sorts of cool tests and monetizations and stuff. And one of the magic things he brought to my world, he found out that somebody who joined his list who used their actual Facebook email address, or social media email address that\u2019s hooked to a real social account, is worth 80 times more money than somebody who uses a throw-away email address. 80 times.</p> <p>In fact, if people opted in and they didn\u2019t use their Facebook email address, he would just delete them as a record. He wouldn\u2019t even use them because it was such a waste of energy to market to them. For us, we have social as well, so RFMS. So you get the score on each of your clients that comes and you say, \u201cOh wow. RFMS.\u201d How valuable is this person to you.</p> <p>So you\u2019ll see in Actionetics in the future, RFMS is going to be a big thing we\u2019ll be talking more about. But I digress, let me come back to what I\u2019m talking about. So for me, I had this big epiphany this weekend. As we were doing this launch and people were buying stuff and getting in. There\u2019s something about people buying and new excitement and new energy. We\u2019re doing this Funnel Immersion sale, and we sold a lot of them and people were going crazy. And everyone on the Facebook group was trying to convince everyone else to buy. I felt bad, some people in the Facebook group were like, \u201cSo what\u2019s actually in this? Russell never mentioned it. So why am I giving Russell money?\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cWho cares? Just do it. Russell says buy it, just buy it.\u201d And everybody in our group is just jumping in, it was awesome. It was the coolest thing ever.</p> <p>So anyway, I started thinking about this. And this is the pro and the con of what we\u2019ve been doing over the last two years. My audience, especially my inner circle members and hopefully you guys listening as well. We\u2019ve gotten really good at doing a webinar a week and bringing new blood into your business. Everybody\u2019s doing that. So they\u2019re getting people to purchase but then it\u2019s kind of stopping there. We\u2019re not getting people to purchase more often and that\u2019s why a lot of people\u2019s businesses are struggling. They\u2019re getting really good at selling the first product, but then they have nothing else to offer to our audience to monetize the list that we\u2019ve built.</p> <p>So I started thinking about this and I was like, so next week on Marketinginyourcar.com actually, it\u2019s funny, you guys have been hearing this in the intro and the outro for a while. But we\u2019re finally launching the mp3 player, and it\u2019s amazing. So next Thursday we\u2019re going to have a big launch around it, and we\u2019re going to try to sell, I think I bought 7500 mp3 players. I think we\u2019ll sell those in a week or so and then just go from there. I\u2019m going to do a free plus shipping thing. And there\u2019s not really, people are going to look at me like, \u201cRussell this funnel is no good. You didn\u2019t really monetize that well.\u201d And it will, there\u2019s actually, I think it\u2019s a really cool funnel.</p> <p>But you\u2019re going to notice from me, I\u2019m going to be putting out a lot of things, there just little front ends that are cool. T-shirts, just a lot of front end things, and the reason why, and I had this thing, if what we want our people doing. If someone wanted to rent a list and they\u2019re looking for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, how do we stimulate those in our own lists? How do we stimulate?</p> <p>So there\u2019s different things, but I was looking at frequency. How do we stimulate frequency? No one\u2019s ever talked about that, I\u2019ve never thought about that before. The health of my customer list is going to be based on how frequently they\u2019ve purchased from me. So if I don\u2019t have very many opportunities for them to buy from me, they\u2019re less likely to buy from me. And it\u2019s hard to keep selling new info products. You\u2019ve got to have a new hook, new angle. But I want people to keep buying from me. Because the act of buying is going to keep them warm.</p> <p>In fact, I remember TJ Rohleder, he\u2019s a bus op direct mail guy. I was talking to him one day and he was like, \u201cHey, you want to rent my list of buyers?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat? Why would you do that?\u201d and he was like, \u201cThe more they buy from you, the more they\u2019re going to buy from me. I need to keep these guys frequently buying.\u201d I was like, wow. How interesting. I never thought, it\u2019s just such a different mindset from what I\u2019ve always thought. Only sell them things every once in a while and build up the hype and make it this big thing. So for me, I think one of my big focuses for this year, I want to create frequency in my buying, in my customers buying habits. In your guys\u2019. So I\u2019m talking about you.</p> <p>I want you buying from me often. In fact, I told my team that I want our customers buying something from us at least once a week minimum. I want that frequency up, because if they are buying once a week, they\u2019re going to stay customers and they\u2019re going to keep\u2026..that\u2019s the health of our list. If we want to increase the health of our list, we want to get them buying often. And I think my goal is at least once a week. So what I\u2019m going to be doing, I\u2019m going to try to create something cool once a week. Not like a new training program, or info product, those things are hard. But just a new thing, once a week, that you guys can buy from me.</p> <p>So you\u2019re going to see a couple of things. One, It\u2019s going to be pulling out little pieces of like funnel Immersion. Funnel Immersion ended up with over a hundred hours of content, which is awesome. So I\u2019m going to be pulling out little pieces of that, low ticket things, just to get people like, \u201cGo buy this training on Tripwire.\u201d Just pulling out little pieces. You\u2019re going to see a lot more physical products, free plus shipping t-shirts. Free plus shipping shoes. Free plus shipping Clickfunnels bottles. Tons of little swag things that aren\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to make any money on them. But I\u2019m just going to be stimulating frequency in my customers. Frequency in purchasing from my customers to increase the health of my list.</p> <p>These aren\u2019t going to become front end offers, we\u2019re driving big Facebook ads to it, trying to optimize the campaign and all that stuff. No. I\u2019m talking about the only goal of these things, is to increase the frequency of the buying patterns of my customers and then build a cult-ture. Because they\u2019re going to have all these cool t-shirts and socks and shoes, and playing cards, and stickers. As many cool things as I can come up with. But that\u2019s the thought.</p> <p>Anyway, I want to throw it to you guys. I know I went really long winded on this one because I\u2019m so excited. But think about that. How can you increase the frequency your customers are buying from you? Because that\u2019s how we judge how good the health of a list is. It\u2019s probably how we should judge how good the health of our customer base is. How often are they buying from you? And how do you now, now that you know that\u2019s something that\u2019s important, how do you stimulate that? How do you create cool crap that they\u2019re going to want to buy?</p> <p>It\u2019s not going to be like, because it\u2019s hard if you\u2019re selling thousand dollar courses, you can\u2019t do that every single week. People aren\u2019t going to keep buying it. That\u2019s not sustainable. So if you have a whole bunch of super low ticket things that you\u2019re going to get from me. I\u2019m not going to make any money on my free plus shipping things, but it stimulates the frequency of buying in my customers, which makes them better customers when I do come out with the big things. They\u2019re used to buying weekly from me, they\u2019re enjoying it. There\u2019s an addiction that comes with that. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m addicted to buying things. I love buying things. I want to feed that addiction through frequency.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my thought for you, just think about that. How do you stimulate frequency in your customers? Doesn\u2019t have to be weekly like me, because that\u2019s going to be kind of crazy for most people, even for me. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to keep up with that. But for you, think about that. Maybe it\u2019s once a month, how do you get them, how do you increase frequency of buying?</p> <p>So anyway, there you go. And I\u2019m going to leave it there for today, but hopefully this stimulates some thoughts in your mind. How do you know this? How do you increase the R, the F, the M? How do you increase all those across the board? So if you start thinking about that and stimulating it. I need people who buy recently so, that comes back to frequency too. If I\u2019m going to get people to buy something each week, they\u2019re recent, and they\u2019re frequent. So I kind of kill two birds with one stone. Two things are increased in my list of customer health. Next is monetary value, obviously free plus shipping is not, but if you sprinkle it every six weeks or every quarter with a high ticket thing, boom, it increases monetary value and keeps this thing going. And it increases the health base of your customer list.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about this New Year\u2019s.\u00a0 Hope it gives you guys some ideas as well. There\u2019s some magic to this you guys. I looking right now at our, in fact I got a video from John on our team the other day. He\u2019s like, \u201cLook, our cult is way better than their cult.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat?\u201d and I look at this video and he\u2019s showing our social stuff versus Lead Pages, versus InfusionSoft, and if you look at it, our social profile is like, boom, trending up. People talking about us, trending up. All these things are trending up. Then you look at\u00a0 Lead Pages, trending down. Then you look at InfusionSoft, trending down. No one\u2019s talking about them. Nobody care about them. What\u2019s the difference? Boom, we\u2019re stimulating growth, stimulating conversations, making things exciting, building a culture. Now we\u2019re going to start increasing the frequency of this stuff and it\u2019s going to be insane. I\u2019m so excited.</p> <p>Anyway, appreciate you all. I gotta go get some groceries or my wife\u2019s going to kill me. So I will talk to you guys all again soon. Have an amazing New Years. You\u2019re probably going to hear this after New Years, so I hope you had an amazing New Years. If you\u2019re listening to this after Thursday go get your free MP3 player at marketinginyourcar.com.

Good morning. I hope you guys are doing awesome. It is so cold here right now in my car. Freezing, I forgot to wear a coat. Dang it. Why do I always do that? Anyway, I hope you guys are doing awesome. I just wanted to share some cool stuff with you guys today because I\u2019m so excited I have not been able to sleep.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if you guys have the stripe app on your phone, but last night I was refreshing it every thirty seconds. It\u2019s so fun. I love this game. Seriously, this is the game we get to play, and it is the most insane, fun, cool, exciting, frustrating sometimes, but always rewarding game. So much fun.</p> <p>I want to tell you guys about something that we are attempting to do right now, which is super crazy and fun. And I want to show you my execution plan because I think it will help you with whatever your execution plans are. Just kind of see how I look at the world and how we\u2019re trying to hit a big goal in a very short, finite period of time.</p> <p>So basically this is it, I haven\u2019t told publicly anywhere, but for you guys I can tell you because you\u2019re my people, you\u2019re my peeps. So what our goal was last year in Clickfunnels, we wanted to triple our revenue. And that was one of those, what do they call them? BHAG\u2019s. Big, hairy, audacious goals. So it was like, \u201cLet\u2019s triple revenue.\u201d And it was one of those things that I was like, \u201cYeah, that can happen.\u201d And everyone was like, \u201cyeah, that can happen.\u201d But you never really know, you know what I mean? It wasn\u2019t something that we stressed about everyday like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the revenue, what\u2019s the revenue?\u201d because I\u2019m a big believer in setting a big goal but not, I don\u2019t want to say not focusing on it, but not\u2026..I don\u2019t want that goal to destroy the customer experience. I want to focus more on how do we serve these people and then that goal will somehow magically appear.</p> <p>So that was the goal, so we had this thing where we wanted to 3x our revenue, which is a lofty goal. But why not? We might as well do it, we got nothing else happening this year, let\u2019s do it. So that was the goal and we started going towards it. We didn\u2019t really know what or how we were going to do it, but we were just trying a whole bunch of things. You guys probably watched over the last year a lot of the things we tried. We tried this, we tried this. Some things were huge smashing successes, and some things were failures.</p> <p>So we get to December, this month, the month of the coldness. And I kind of, not that I\u2019ve forgotten about the goal, just hadn\u2019t really looked at it. So I asked Clint who is my accountant, \u201cSo where are we at on this goal.\u201d And he told me and I was like, huh. And the number we had to get in December was, we had to make what we normally do, without sharing revenue numbers, we needed to make an extra 1 \u00bd million dollars on top of what we did the month prior, which was a record setting month for us, to be able to achieve that goal.</p> <p>We were like, huh. So we basically have to break our best month ever and increase sales by an extra $1.5 million. And it was like, okay, maybe. Then we\u2019re like, December is like the worst possible month to do. In our industry typically December is the worst month. No, that\u2019s not going to work. Anyway, all these doubts and fears, like there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to make it. Let\u2019s still make that the goal. So I told him, because this is the big thing with goals, if something is in front of your face all the time, you\u2019re more likely to achieve it. When I want to lose weight, I write on the board next to my scale, how much I weigh each day. It\u2019s visible so you see it.</p> <p>So I said, \u201cokay, every single day, I want you to send how much money we\u2019ve made year to date and then how much money we have to make to hit our goal.\u201d So every morning for the last 27 days or whatever I\u2019ve got an email that says, \u201cHey, so far we\u2019re at this much for the year. This is how much you have to get to beat your goal.\u201d So it\u2019s like, \u201cCrap, we\u2019ve got that much money. That much money.\u201d So we started doing things and started making us be creative. So we started going and doing it. And if you listen to the podcast, we had a webinar earlier this month that did 800 grand, which is awesome.</p> <p>And as awesome as that is, it\u2019s like half of what we needed to do in extra new money. So we\u2019re trying different things and doing a bunch of stuff. And then we have Christmas, everyone is taking a week off for Christmas, and this is happening, that\u2019s happening. So what happened, at the beginning of this week, which is the last week of the year, we looked at it and it was like, \u201cokay this is what you have to make.\u201d And looking at it we were like, we have to make an extra half a million dollars on top of still doing all the other revenue we normally do each day. That\u2019s what we have to do. How do we make an extra 100 grand a day every day this week? That\u2019s what we had to figure out how to do.</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t 100 grand a week, it\u2019s an extra 100 grand. So much stress. What we did, and this the lesson, is we sat down and said, \u201cokay, we can\u2019t just plan on one thing working. We\u2019ve got to have a couple of different back up plans.\u201d So we had a little meeting and I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got some Hail Mary passes. We\u2019re going to throw a bunch of Hail Mary\u2019s in the air, and hopefully we\u2019ll catch one or two or three of them. So we came up with 5 Hail Mary passes. You know in my business, it will be different from yours, but we came up with five. One of them was, I had this idea, what if we took a bunch of our old, unreleased content. Funnel related events, and stuff we had never sold and put that in a packet and call it Funnel Immersion, some of you may have seen that.</p> <p>So we launched that yesterday, and lo and behold the first day, it hasn\u2019t even been\u2026..it\u2019s been like 15 hours and we\u2019ve done more than 100 grand already with that. I was like, \u201cYes, one Hail Mary pass was caught in the end zone. But we haven\u2019t won yet, so what else can we do?\u201d So I started looking at our database, looking at our people and started segmenting things. So okay, what are the other big opportunities to make big money quick?</p> <p>One of them is our certification program. So I looked and over the last 12 months there\u2019s been 14,000 people that have registered for our certification webinar. And from that, obviously we don\u2019t have 14,000 customers, so I said, \u201cokay, we\u2019ll take that segment, they\u2019re obviously interested, let\u2019s push them to take action before the end of the year.\u201d So we sent our campaign to these guys to basically say to call in and say, \u201cHey basically don\u2019t apply. You\u2019ve already applied. Call this number ASAP and we\u2019ll get you in the certification program.\u201d</p> <p>So we did that and the certification is $10,000, so yesterday we came into the office, with phones ringing off the hook. They\u2019re dialing, interviewing people making sure they\u2019re a good fit for the program. And sales are going up, boom, boom, boom. That Hail Mary pass, we threw it up and so far it\u2019s halfway caught? No, it\u2019s been caught. We still have 3 days of sales on there to figure out how much we\u2019re going to get from that, but there\u2019s another one.</p> <p>We had one where people keep begging us for years for the option and we always fought against it inside of Clickfunnels, but we decided to make it available just when people log in. So when people logged in this week, actually started yesterday, a thing popped up saying, \u201cHey, you have a onetime offer. You can get two months for free if you buy yearly right now.\u201d And that was the Hail Mary pass we threw up and it landed. It\u2019s working.</p> <p>And then our event, we\u2019ve got I think 8 booths, and we haven\u2019t sold any booth space yet, so Dave has been out there calling people like crazy trying to sell booths, and he closed the first one yesterday and he\u2019s got three or four more lined up for today. Anyway, we just had all these different contingency plans, and we all jumped in and started executing them. It was based on looking at all our opportunities and segmenting them out.</p> <p>Funnel Emersion goes to everyone. Certification goes to people who have raised their hand last year about certification. And everything is kind of like that. Dave\u2019s going out to different affiliate partners, who are the ones who can bring in a lot of sales in a short period of time? So we\u2019re doing deals with them in the next three days trying to get them to push before the end of the year. Just doing a whole bunch of different things, and looking at it now, we\u2019re still three days away, but I think we\u2019re going to make it, which is insane.</p> <p>It\u2019s so exciting. I\u2019ll let you guys know for sure, if and when we do. But you\u2019ll know if I\u2019m on New Year\u2019s Eve doing a Google Hangout for 22 hours trying to close everybody on buying stuff, then that\u2019s probably why. Just a head\u2019s up, so you guys know on the inside. It\u2019s because we have to reach our goal. We\u2019re so close, we\u2019re going to make it. It\u2019s just exciting.</p> <p>So that\u2019s fun. Now to take that to next year. We set a big, hairy, audacious goal, a BHAG for next year, to triple revenue again, which is insane. Especially when\u2026\u2026it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s just like, \u201cHuh.\u201d But that\u2019s what it was last year too. I was saying, \u201cHuh, might as well. What else are we going to do.\u201d So this year we said let\u2019s triple it again, which if we do that, would be insane. Goll, it would be insane.</p> <p>So my question for me and for our team, how are we going to do that? And we\u2019re like, \u201cHuh. Well.\u201d We can\u2019t just come up with one idea, we need a whole bunch of Hail Mary passes and if one or two or three of them hit, we could actually hit that goal.</p> <p>So we come up with some big Hail Mary passes. One of them is the Book launch, the way we\u2019re executing the book launch, tie the book launch to the infomercial. That\u2019s one huge Hail Mary Pass. We\u2019ve got, I don\u2019t want to ruin all the surprises. We\u2019ve got some cool happening this year. We have four or five Hail Mary Passes, and if one or two, we\u2019ll probably hit two. If two or three of those Hail Mary Passes hit, we\u2019re going to hit it. If they don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. But at least we\u2019ve got like four or five balls up in the air.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a big football dude, but the best games to watch are the ones where they\u2019re down and they\u2019re throwing these Hail Mary passes and they\u2019ve got four downs til the game\u2019s over, and they\u2019ve got four Hail Mary passes. And it\u2019s like, ready, hike, and everyone sprints, quarterback lobs it in the air as far as he can, boom, drops the ball. Okay, we\u2019ve got 12 seconds left, 3 plays, hike. Lobs it up in the air, lobs it up in the air. And they get four shots to lob this thing in the air and they just gotta catch one. They don\u2019t need four, just one and they win the game.</p> <p>And that\u2019s how I feel about this a lot of times. Some of us we go into battle, we go into this game and we\u2019re like okay, all our eggs are in the one basket. If this thing works then I\u2019ll be rich. And then when it doesn\u2019t you\u2019re screwed because that was it. You had no other balls in the air. So I like looking at this as like, okay, not so much contingency plans, but if this doesn\u2019t work, then this. No, let\u2019s throw three things in the air. Let\u2019s try this, this, and this and hopefully one of them will hit. And if it does, then it works, if not that sucks. But at least we got three shots at the goal, right. Three is better than one, usually.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying by this, create three different businesses, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m saying three different ways to execute on this idea to get her done. Anyway, I hope that helps. I\u2019m freezing. I\u2019m going to go inside and get warm. But appreciate you all. I\u2019ll let you know how we do on the goal. And if you haven\u2019t bought Funnel Immersion yet, go buy it. Help support the cause. Help Clickfunnels triple, it\u2019ll be amazing. Alright, appreciate you all and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "11:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/287_-_My_5_Hail_Mary_Passes_To_3x_Revenue.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1482966183, "title": "Episode #286 \u2013 Two Secrets Of Wealth Attraction", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Some interesting things I learned from Dan Kennedy.</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about listening to Dan Kennedy talking about wealth attraction and relates some of the ideas and some of his own.</p> <p>Here are some of the super interesting things you will hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why money doesn\u2019t care if you are a pastor or a pornographer. Good people don\u2019t automatically make more money.</li> <li>Why Russell believes that you should always give away 10% of your money, whether it be to churches or charities or whatever.</li> <li>And why some things don\u2019t make sense when you are generous with your money, but you should do it anyway because it works.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why giving your money away, actually helps you make more money.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everybody this is Russell, welcome back to Marketing In Your Car. Hope you guys are having a great day. I\u2019m actually backing out of Fred Meyer, just picked up some stuff for the kids. Some milk and eggs that we ran out of. While I was there, I\u2019ve been listening to Dan Kennedy\u2019s Wealth Building Course. Or Wealth Attraction, how to attract wealth into your life, which has been a really interesting, really interesting. I\u2019ve been listening to Dan Kennedy stuff forever. If you look at my, some of you know on my phone, I\u2019ve basically\u2026.As we\u2019re moving from the old office to a new office, I\u2019m trying to compress all my courses into\u2026.instead of having 8 billion cd\u2019s and DVD\u2019s, which I\u2019ve had in the past, my brother and I are going through and shrinking everything into audio books and then I put them on my phone.</p> <p>My phone right now has close to a quarter of a million dollars in marketing, sales, and personal development courses on it. If you ever want a ton of cool stuff, steal my phone. Just kidding, don\u2019t steal my phone. So I\u2019ve been going through all the different courses and by far the person I have the most courses from is Dan Kennedy. I think I bought everything he\u2019s ever published ever since the beginning of time. It\u2019s fun, I still go through his stuff and still love it.</p> <p>So this is his wealth attraction course, which is different than his typical making money and marketing, direct response marketing stuff. So it\u2019s been interesting. A couple of things, that are not new things, but the way he said them just re-sparked my brain and I wanted to share a couple of things with you.</p> <p>So first one, he\u2019s talking about, we all know this is true, the entrepreneurs out here, that a lot of people think that what causes wealth? Well if I\u2019m smarter, or work harder, or am a better person. But those things don\u2019t necessarily create wealth. There\u2019s people that are, you can keep trying to become a better person, but the laws of the universe or whatever don\u2019t give you more wealth because of that. And one thing he said that was kind of profound, he said, \u201cWealth does not care if you are a pastor or a pornographer.\u201d That\u2019s not\u2026..the pastor\u2019s not going to make more money than the pornographer. Money does not care, money is paper. It has not soul, it\u2019s just a thing and that\u2019s what it is. S</p> <p>o we have to understand that because a lot of people try to make more money by becoming a better person. I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t become a better person, and you definitely should not be a pornographer. Let me step that back really quick. Just caveat that, lest you think that I\u2019m condoning that by any stretch of the imagination. But it\u2019s interesting if you think about that. Money is indifferent.</p> <p>A lot of times we\u2019re trying to get more money or more wealth and things like that and we\u2019re focusing on things that do not have a direct correlation with more wealth, which is interesting. We start talking like, what are the laws of money that actually cause you to get some, get more and get a lot of it. And you think about it, it\u2019s interesting, again if you rewind back\u00a0 who knows, a couple of hundred thousand years ago, a hundred years, a thousand years, whatever it is. Money was barter. So I\u2019ve got a chicken that lays a bunch of eggs, my buddy\u2019s got a cow that has milk. He needs milk more than I need eggs, I\u2019ve got a ton of eggs and visa versa so we trade. I value, because I have so many eggs, these eggs mean less to me than that milk. And because you\u2019ve got so much milk that milk means less than these eggs.</p> <p>Because of that we both look at it, and the cool thing he talked about in the course, money is not a zero sum game. One person wins and someone else gets screwed. Kind of like, I guess I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t do stocks. But I think the stock market is that way, right? For someone to win, someone else has to lose. With money, the exchange doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s both people can win on both sides of the transaction. So how do you actually make money? How do you get wealth? It\u2019s coming down to creating something that is more valuable to somebody else than the money that they\u2019re holding. And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the laws of wealth.</p> <p>How do you create something that\u2019s more valuable to somebody else than the money they have in their pocket? If you can create something that\u2019s more valuable then they will give you that in exchange. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the magic. That is how you create money. Boom. It\u2019s really that simple. Has nothing to do with you becoming a better person, or working harder. Nothing. It all has to do with you having something that provides more value to that person than the money that\u2019s in your pocket and if so, they\u2019ll trade you.</p> <p>And if you can create something, that\u2019s the power of the internet and the power of digital products and software and all these cool things, you can create it once and then sell it over and over again. That\u2019s how you become wealthy rapidly. So I thought that was kind of interesting. I think all of us, on top of us trying to focus and become better people, it\u2019s understanding the science behind money.</p> <p>What is it that gets people to have more perceived value in that thing you\u2019re trying to sell? How do you actually create an amazing product that is more valuable to people? How do you position it, sell it, get in front of those people who would devalue it? Because not everyone is going to value it the same way. I value a cryosauna at my house really, really high because I love it. But you probably think I\u2019m insane. In fact, most of you are probably rolling your eyes every time I talk about it. But for me it was more valuable than the money, so it was a logical transaction for me.</p> <p>So that was interesting and I think something we should all think about. Keep focusing on being good people though, because that\u2019s really important too. The next part of the course he\u2019s been going through, which is fascinating coming from Dan Kennedy because Dan\u2019s very much like a direct response. You put an X here and this comes back, this is the return on your investment, blah, blah. And he\u2019s talking this whole section about giving. He\u2019s like, \u201cThe math makes no logical sense to the engineers and it works. All you do is give 10% away, give it away.\u201d</p> <p>Which is funny because if you look at church, it\u2019s a tithe. 10% the Lord says that we should pay a tithe. So Kennedy is saying the same thing, give 10% of your money away. And if you do that more money will magically appear. It doesn\u2019t make any sense, the math doesn\u2019t make any sense. Try it for a month, you\u2019ll never go back. Do it often, what you should do, he said that every time he goes on a trip he takes a 100 dollars and breaks it down to 10 dollar bills and over tips every single person. \u201cI just want to give away money as often as possible, because when I do, it multiplies. I don\u2019t know how it works, doesn\u2019t make any sense, but it does.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s cool for those who are Christian, or I don\u2019t know, the other religions that everyone believes, but it\u2019s a very biblical thing. That the Lord has promised that if you pay tithing, if you give, he will open up a window. He will dump so many blessings on you that you can\u2019t even handle it. And as I\u2019m listening to Dan Kennedy, this guy who is very, not a spiritual person by any stretch of the imagination, but sharing these things, I think it\u2019s the most fascinating thing in the world.</p> <p>I remember studying under Matt Furey for a long time, I got a bunch of Matt Furey courses. And Matt is a lot more on the woo woo side of things, so I would expect it more from him, but one thing he said to me that had a huge impact on myself, he said, \u201cThe size of the whole that you give through, Will be equal to the size of the whole you received through.\u201d So if you\u2019re really stingy with your money and really stingy giving it away, and sharing and helping, your ability to receive money will shrink as well.</p> <p>We just finished Christmas, but it\u2019s Christmastime, and I think it\u2019s a really profound thing. Not that we should be looking at this like, I need a positive ROI, I\u2019m going to give money away for a positive ROI, but it works that way. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s one of those things that you don\u2019t have to understand it, and don\u2019t have to do it for that reason, but if you do it, you will get those benefits. In fact, in the scriptures it even says, The Lord says, test me. Try it out, see if you don\u2019t get back more blessings by doing this thing. And I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s\u2026.I pay my tithing through a very official, through my church, a very official form, and some people don\u2019t, they just give it away and I don\u2019t think it really matters, it\u2019s a concept of giving.</p> <p>Like I said, Matt Furey said, \u201cThe size of the whole you give from will be equal to the size of the whole you receive from.\u201d And I think it\u2019s interesting as I\u2019m learning Wealth Attraction from Dan Kennedy, that he would spend probably 30 minutes just on that topic of giving money away. He started sharing tons of stories about people who gave money away who\u2026.And typically, when people give money away, it\u2019s usually out of guilt. They see other people giving and they\u2019re like, oh I feel like I have to give. It\u2019s not that, it\u2019s the opposite. You budget 10% of your money to go towards giving, and then you just give it away. It could be tipping people, paying through churches, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Giving, that service of you sharing, that somehow magically, doesn\u2019t make sense how it works, but it works.</p> <p>And it was interesting to hear that from Dan Kennedy. So anyway, there\u2019s some wealth building to share with you guys that are kind of cool, I thought. One being that money doesn\u2019t care who you are and it\u2019s all about creating things of so much value that people will trade you for their money. And understanding that that\u2019s the law, the science, the laws of how you make money. And that becomes your focus. How do I make this better? How do I make this better? How do I get to more people? How do I get to the right people, people who actually want this thing? That\u2019s how you make money. That\u2019s really the core of it.</p> <p>And then understanding also, that as you are making money to be sure to give because first off, it\u2019s the right thing to do and that will help you with the whole \u201cI want to become a better person\u201d Thing we talked about earlier. But second off, if you\u2019re looking for a positive ROI, there\u2019s no other place you can get a better one that doesn\u2019t make any logical sense. So just do it.</p> <p>I had a friend, this is kind of funny, back in high school. One of my wrestling buddies. And he was a super cool guy, one of my best, closest friends through wrestling, but he was definitely not on the religious, spiritual side of things. He never went to church, he never followed any of what you may call a commandment or rule or anything. But it was interesting, one day we were cutting weight and we were just, when you\u2019re cutting weight in wrestling, you\u2019re losing ten, fifteen, twenty pounds a week and you\u2019re miserable and tired. So the guy you cut weight with you just tell stories and talk a lot and it\u2019s how you get through the pain of it.</p> <p>We are sitting there cutting weight and he told me one time he said, \u201cYeah, I pay tithing.\u201d And I was like, \u201cyou do not.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI really do. I have my dad, he takes 10% of my money and gives it to the church each week.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhy would you do it. You don\u2019t believe anything.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I believe that.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how it works, makes no sense, but every time I do it, I make more money. So I just do\u00a0 it.\u201d I was like, \u201cAre you serious? You don\u2019t even have any belief or faith. All you know is that principle works, therefore you are giving 10% of your money away and it just magically works?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, I don\u2019t know how it works, it just works.\u201d</p> <p>That always stuck with me. How cool of a thing that was. So anyway, I wanted to share that with you guys. I hope that helps. I\u2019m home, my wife just walked out and looked at me like, \u201cWhy are you sitting in the garage talking on your phone? You should be bringing the groceries in.\u201d So I\u2019m going to go. Appreciate you all, have a great day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "12:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/286_-_Two_Secrets_Of_Wealth_Attraction.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1482870732, "title": "Episode #285 \u2013 The Secret Of Contrast", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A powerful tool to use in your storytelling.</p> <p>On today\u2019s special Christmas, hot tub edition of Marketing In Your Car, Russell and his son Dallin talk about contrast and why it makes life and business better.</p> <p>Here are some fun things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why the contrast of being in 102 degree hot tub makes the freezing cold temperature outside more fun.</li> <li>Why we should look for contrast in all areas of life including food, relationships, and business.</li> <li>And what Russell\u2019s Christmas tradition involving Marshmallow Matey\u2019s is.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear Russell and Dallin\u2019s thoughts on why contrast in your life makes it more interesting.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson, welcome to Marketing In Your Hot Tub. It is actually Christmas night and I\u2019m in the hot tub right now. We just had all the kids in here, but all of them have left except for Dallin is the last remaining hot tuber, how you doing bud?</p> <p>Dallin: Good.</p> <p>Russell: So Dallin, if you guys saw Funnel Friday\u2019s this week, was on Funnel Fridays and he actually built a funnel. What was the funnel about that you built?</p> <p>Dallin: Snow balls. Rocks snow balls.</p> <p>Russell: Yeah, Jim Edwards built a script to throw snowballs with putting rocks in the snowballs, evil snowballs huh?</p> <p>Dallin: Yeah, evil. You don\u2019t want to mess with it.</p> <p>Russell: But it was pretty good right? You built the funnel in about 15 minutes.</p> <p>Dallin: Yeah, it was supposed to be 30 but I got under pressure.</p> <p>Russell: Normally people get 30 minutes but I gave Dallin 15 because I knew he could do it.\u00a0 And he did, the funnel was amazing. It was pretty good.</p> <p>Dallin: I\u2019m really good at it.</p> <p>Russell: So if any of you guys are wondering or want to see that, go to Funnelfridays.com and look at the Christmas special and you\u2019ll meet most of my kids, were on that episodes except I don\u2019t think Norah came in.</p> <p>Dallin: Yeah, but Bowen didn\u2019t come in.</p> <p>Russell: Oh yeah, Bowen didn\u2019t come but most of my kids are on there, so if you want to meet them go to funnelfridays.com. But tonight I have a really special message. So that\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you guys about today. The topic I\u2019m talking about is a thing called contrast. So I\u2019m telling you this while we are sitting in the hot tub, it\u2019s 7:54 pm Christmas night. We had a great Christmas day today and now we\u2019re outside and it\u2019s dark and cold, there\u2019s snow, there\u2019s about ten inches of snow. In fact, yesterday we were out in\u2026.we bought this four wheeler rhino thing.</p> <p>Dallin: That\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s like a snow thing that picks up snow.</p> <p>Russell: Yeah, it has a snow plow on the front of it, and we hook tubes to the back and pulled the kids around the yard for\u2026.it was really fun.</p> <p>Dallin: Now I know how to drive a car.</p> <p>Russell: What? Don\u2019t talk about that. So it\u2019s really, really cold and then we jumped in the hot tub and it\u2019s like 102 degrees and it\u2019s really hot. So the kids, would be getting in the hot tub and then they\u2019d jump out into the snow and do snow angels and they\u2019re screaming because it\u2019s so cold and they dive back in and they\u2019re screaming because it\u2019s so hot. And back and forth and back and forth. And what\u2019s cool if you think about that, what\u2019s making this experience really fun is the contrast.</p> <p>And I started thinking about other things where contrast is the key. And I really think that happiness in life is tied to contrast. We had a church Christmas party and they decided to have Collette and I be in charge of it. So we had the chance to throw a party for 500 people and one of the ideas that came out of it, one of the guys on our committee, he had an idea. He\u2019s like, \u201cWe should do a hot chocolate bar.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh that would be awesome.\u201d So we had this huge hot chocolate bar, we boiled I don\u2019t know, thirty gallons of hot chocolate.</p> <p>Dallin: With a lot of good candy.</p> <p>Russell: We had tons of toppings like York Peppermint patties, cinnamon bears, marshmallows\u2026</p> <p>Dallin: And then my favorite flavor ran out right when they came in.</p> <p>Russell: So we had a whole bunch of stuff, and the point of this story, we had a huge hot chocolate bar, which was good, but what made it great was the contrast. We had an ice cream scooper scooping a bunch of ice cream into the hot chocolate. So we have this hot, hot chocolate with cold ice cream and the contrast is what made it magic.</p> <p>You go like that with most foods. If you go to a restaurant and you get sweet and sour sauce, you get sweet and sour is the contrast, that\u2019s why it\u2019s interesting. A lot of foods are that way. They have two\u2026..for Christmas somebody may have sent me a bag of this and may have eaten the whole thing by myself. It was a bag of chocolate covered pretzels. The chocolate is sweet and the pretzels are salty. So it\u2019s salty, sweet and the contrast is what made it interesting.</p> <p>Dallin: Dad, not cool to tell that in front of your kid.</p> <p>Russell: You want to eat it now? But you think about most parts of life, the relationships I have with people that are the most fun are not where they\u2019re like me. I do have a lot of fun with a lot of entrepreneurs that are just like me, but even within that there\u2019s a lot of contrast.</p> <p>There\u2019s contrast within my family, contrast within my beliefs, contrast within ideas. And that\u2019s what makes things interesting. Is the contrast. From food, from relationships, from all these kind of things. What I want to talk about today, a lot of people probably don\u2019t know this, but it\u2019s also the key to good story telling.</p> <p>Dallin: And cars, and hot tubs.</p> <p>Russell: To hot tubs and cars? It\u2019s the key to good story telling, it\u2019s the key to good selling.</p> <p>Dallin: That\u2019s compare and contrast. Boom.</p> <p>Russell: Okay, boom. Dallin\u2019s comparing contrasted. He compared a car and a hot tub. Did you contrast them?</p> <p>Dallin: No, not really.</p> <p>Russell: Okay, so let me explain this. So when telling a story it\u2019s the contrast that makes the story interesting. So from a higher level view it\u2019s like, you tell a story, \u201cfirst I was broke, then I was rich.\u201d That was the contrast. \u201cfirst I was fat, then I got skinny. First I was sad, then I became happy.\u201d That contrast is what makes the story interesting. That\u2019s from an overarching story level. That\u2019s kind of the arch that people normally go on.</p> <p>Dallin: It\u2019s like with the cereal I had this morning too.</p> <p>Russell: Dallin wants to throw things completely off topic. Okay Dallin, let me finish this story and then you can tell about cereal okay?</p> <p>So then it\u2019s also from a macro level, the micro level is the same thing when you\u2019re telling stories. You get down to the actual pieces of the story, it\u2019s also the contrast. You dig down and as you\u2019re telling the details, the contrast in the details is what\u2019s interesting as well. So it\u2019s like, right now if I were telling the story, we\u2019re sitting in the hot tub and part of our body was so hot because it\u2019s 102, 103 degrees. It\u2019s really warm, but my head and neck is above water and when the wind hits you it\u2019s bitter cold. And it cuts you, it cuts you down even into the water because it\u2019s so cold, but then the water is so warm that it pushes that heat back up. So I\u2019m telling the contrast of the cold and the hot, which makes it intriguing, makes it interesting.</p> <p>So when you\u2019re describing each of the individual pieces of the story there\u2019s contrast in all of them. You\u2019re writing emails, there should be contrast in your emails. As you\u2019re talking about things, \u201cI was this and I became this. I felt this, but then this happened.\u201d There\u2019s a scripture that all my Mormon friends would now about where Lehi in the beginning of the Book of Mormon, he talks about how there\u2019s got to be opposite in all things. If it wasn\u2019t for the dark you wouldn\u2019t know \u2026.if it wasn\u2019t for evil you wouldn\u2019t know good. There\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s contrast. Without sadness you can\u2019t have happiness. Without that contrast you can\u2019t know happiness until you\u2019ve had sadness. You can\u2019t know joy until you\u2019ve had pain. You can\u2019t do what\u2019s right unless you know what\u2019s wrong.</p> <p>Dallin: Wrong.</p> <p>Russsell: Yeah, Dallin\u2019s getting it. Hopefully everyone\u2019s catching on at the same time. But it\u2019s that contrast in all things in life. That\u2019s what makes life interesting, is that contrast.</p> <p>Dallin: Sad, happy. Bad, good. Loving it, hating it.</p> <p>Russell: What other contrasts you got?</p> <p>Dallin:\u00a0 Ellie and school.</p> <p>Russell: Ellie and school? Ellie\u2019s is his sister, and school? Okay.</p> <p>Dallin: They\u2019re really far contrasts.</p> <p>Russell: Ellie and school are contrasts. But you think about it you guys. It\u2019s interesting because that\u2019s the key. Depends on how you look at it. If you look at it like, I\u2019m going to eat something, let me make some contrasts. I\u2019m going to tell a story, I\u2019m going to sell something. I\u2019m going to write an email to\u2026</p> <p>Dallin: Billy Bob Joe.</p> <p>Russell: What?</p> <p>Dallin: Billy Bob Joe.</p> <p>Russell: Who\u2019s Billy Bob Joe?</p> <p>Dallin: You\u2019re sending an email to Billy Bob Joe.</p> <p>Russell: Okay\u2026..Alright, that makes no sense, but whatever. So I hope that, amongst the random thoughts, I hope you guys got some value from tonight. From the contrast of sitting in the hot tub while the cold is on my, blowing against my skin and kind of freezing up top.</p> <p>Dallin: That\u2019s why it\u2019s cold, hot tub. Car, contrast.</p> <p>Russell: Yes, alright Dal, you want to tell the story from breakfast this morning?</p> <p>Dallin: Yeah, sure.</p> <p>Russell: Alright, tell it loud so you can all hear.</p> <p>Dallin: So our dad took a huge bowl, one that we use to make cookies and stuff.</p> <p>Russell: A big salad bowl.</p> <p>Dallin: Yeah. For Christmas he got a big Lucky Charm thing\u2026</p> <p>Russell: it was Marshmallow Matey\u2019s. It\u2019s the generic Malt-O-Meal knock off version of Lucky Charms. Speaking of, real quick of Lucky Charms, the reason why it\u2019s so good is the contrast. There\u2019s the oats that are not sweet and the marshmallows that are sweet, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so good.</p> <p>Dallin: Yeah, but our dad dumped it all in and filled the whole bowl up, which he didn\u2019t use a normal cereal bowl.</p> <p>Russell: The whole salad bowl of Marshmallow Matey\u2019s.</p> <p>Dallin: And he ate all the oats first and then he sugared up with all the marshmallows.</p> <p>Russell: So this is my brothers and sisters have done our whole lives. So Santa brings us sugar cereal, we always used to get Marshmallow Matey\u2019s because it\u2019s twice the size of Lucky Charms, because you get a big old Marshmallow Matey\u2019s bag.\u00a0 So I would fill a salad bowl full.</p> <p>Dallin:\u00a0 I wish I did it this morning too.</p> <p>Russell:\u00a0 You can do it, I got leftovers.</p> <p>Dallin:\u00a0 Tomorrow morning I\u2019m going to use a big salad bowl.</p> <p>Russell: And we do it so the rule is you can\u2019t eat a single marshmallow until all the oats are gone.</p> <p>Dallin: Unless we accidently eat one.</p> <p>Russell: No, if you accidently, you have to spit it back out.</p> <p>Dallin: What the\u2026?</p> <p>Russell: Yep.</p> <p>Dallin: But what if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s in there.</p> <p>Russell: Yeah, I guess you don\u2019t know. But you should know. You have to be really careful, it take\u2019s probably 20 or 30 minutes. I Snapchatted me doing it. But then I ate the whole thing, so when you\u2019re done with it though, you\u2019ve got this whole bowl of marshmallows and the marshmallows are oozing into the milk. So the milk\u2019s like syrup as well. So at the end you drink the marshmallow syrup milk and it\u2019s the reward for sacrificing 30 minutes of your life to something that\u2019s completely ridiculous.</p> <p>Dallin: Oh yeah, so tell them about the mission companion thing.</p> <p>Russell: So I went on a mission for the Mormon church, I was in New Jersey and Santa Claus knew how to get Marshmallow Matey\u2019s up to New Jersey. So Christmas morning I pull the huge salad bowl out, it\u2019s tradition you have to do it. So I was eating it and it took like an hour\u2026. Dallin\u2019s dying over here. My companion, after a half an hour is like, \u201cElder Brunson, you gotta stop. I can\u2019t handle the noise of you eating every little piece of cereal. Get out of this room.\u201d Poor guy. He probably hates me for that.</p> <p>Ooh, Dallin. Feel my hair it\u2019s frozen hard as a rock.</p> <p>Dallin: yeah, that\u2019s why I was grabbing it.</p> <p>Russell: So I have one more story for you guys about contrast. Actually it has nothing to do with contrast, but it\u2019s a cool story. When I was a kid we went on a family reunion up somewhere for winter time and it was like this. We went to a hot tub, and we walked from the hot tub back to our condo and it was freezing. And my cousin, Juliana, her hair froze. And she grabbed it, bent it and it snapped her hair off, broke her hair.</p> <p>Dallin: And she didn\u2019t even feel a thing.</p> <p>Russell: Which is crazy. So I wonder if I could give myself a haircut right now?</p> <p>Dallin: Oh, hi Norah. Or Aiden.</p> <p>Russell: Oh, there\u2019s the kids. Oh man. I think we\u2019re going to have to end the hot tub party while everyone else is having fun inside without us. Aiden is in his ninja turtle outfit, driving Norah\u2019s new scooter.</p> <p>Anyway, appreciate you guys for listening. Hopefully you got some value out of today. Remember contrast in all things. It\u2019s the spice of life, makes it interesting, builds\u2026.</p> <p>Dallin: And funniness.</p> <p>Russell: And funniness, it builds your relationships.</p> <p>Dallin: And Billy Bob Joe.</p> <p>Russell: and Billy Bob Joe.\u00a0 Helps you sell things.</p> <p>Dallin: And cars.</p> <p>Russell: Helps you eat better.</p> <p>Dallin: And hot tubs.

I hope you guys are doing awesome today. I\u2019m out driving in a winter wonderland, which is really cool except for the fact that the sun shines off the white snow and it\u2019s totally blinding me, it\u2019s killing me.</p> <p>So I\u2019m excited for a couple of reasons. One is we are super close to launching our Marketing In Your Car Free MP3 player. I know you\u2019ve been hearing it on the outro for a little while. I thought it was going to be shipped here from China faster than it was, and it took forever and now we have it sitting in a warehouse and I haven\u2019t had a chance to write the video, but soon.</p> <p>In fact, I think the first week in January we\u2019re going to launch it. So it\u2019ll be a free mp3 player with the first 250 episodes. If we do this it\u2019s going to bring a lot more of our friends and family into the Marketing In Your Car fold, which I\u2019m excited for. I did a podcast a little while ago talking about the strategy behind what we\u2019re going to do and now we\u2019re actually doing that. So it\u2019s going to be kind of cool to see that and hopefully grow our member base substantially and get more people listening while they\u2019re in their car. So it\u2019ll be cool.</p> <p>Now what I want to share with you guys today, I had a really cool Voxer conversation back and forth with Dana Derricks, which is one of our inner circle members, about a concept. I thought it was super cool and I just wanted to share it with you guys, because I think it\u2019s important. He messaged me saying, \u201cAs I\u2019m getting more and more successful and I see you, how do you justify doing something? How do you justify going to the DMV? How do you justify going and getting a haircut? Because the opportunity cost of your time is so much higher. You go get a haircut, you\u2019re driving there, driving back, an hour of your time. If you were to pay a client that, you would have charged them $10 grand for that hour or $5 grand, or whatever that is. Instead you\u2019re doing this whole thing. It\u2019s way cheaper to pay someone to come to your house and cut your hair while you\u2019re working so you don\u2019t have to slow down.\u201d Or if the pool breaks down you gotta go home and sit by the pool for two hours waiting for the pool guy to come and fix it. How do you justify those kind of things?</p> <p>And I was like, that\u2019s interesting and I started thinking about that from my point of view and it\u2019s funny, recently I\u2019ve been doing all these cool personality tests to learn more about myself, which I recommend for everybody. I did the 16 personality for my wife and for me. We got some crazy cool insights from that. One of them, I\u2019ll just share with you guys to hopefully give you an idea of the kind of gems and gold you can find through here.</p> <p>One of my wife and I\u2019s frustrations we have with each other is a lot of times I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cHey, what do you think about this?\u201d and she\u2019ll be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And she always goes straight to I don\u2019t know, and it used to drive me crazy. You gotta think about it for a little bit. And when she did the 16 personality tests, one of her personality traits was, there\u2019s one like how we do things based on more thinking or more feeling.</p> <p>And James Friel, who was out here with us doing the Trello stuff with us the other day, he had us take this personality test. And my wife\u2019s was very much like, she makes decisions based on feeling not on thinking. So it was 80% was feeling and he had kind of a similar situation, except he\u2019s flipped, he\u2019s thinking not feeling. And he said that Yada, his girlfriend, when she\u2019d say, \u201cWhat do you feel like having for dinner.\u201d He\u2019d be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t feel anything for dinner.\u201d And she\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat do you think you want for dinner?\u201d he\u2019d be like, \u201cI want this.\u201d</p> <p>For him, if he said thinking vs feeling, it would automatically just, his brain could comprehend that. Then he could think exactly what he wanted to think. It was hard for him with \u201cWhat do you feel like for dinner?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything for dinner. I don\u2019t know.\u201d So my wife is the opposite. So the other night I said something like, \u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And I was like wait, \u201cWhat do you feel like, how does that make you feel?\u201d and it opened up this huge conversation. This little tweak and it was huge. So there\u2019s buried gold in these personality tests.</p> <p>16 Personalities is cool. The other cool one is the Disc Profile. So Mandy on our team does a whole bunch of really cool things for the inner circle members, she\u2019s one of the\u2026.me and her kind of coach inner circle. She does more personal development standpoint, I do the marketing standpoint. Together we\u2019re a super cool ninja team that make people even more amazing than they already are, if that\u2019s possible. But Mandy makes everyone take a Disk Profile. When I took mine one thing she told me that\u2019s in there is basically I\u2019m a big believer, or I have to have a positive ROI on things or else I don\u2019t want to do them.</p> <p>I started thinking about that and I\u2019m like, that\u2019s kind of true. If I don\u2019t see an ROI on something, it drives me crazy and I can\u2019t do it. From a religious standpoint, honestly why I struggle reading scriptures and things like that, because I\u2019m reading it, but what\u2019s the point of it? So for me, I\u2019m building in these forced ROI things for me to do what I need to do. For example, and this is more the churchy side, because it illustrates it really well for me.</p> <p>For example, when I speak at church, and I have to prepare that week, I\u2019ll focus on reading, I\u2019ll enjoy it so much, studying and get ready because I know that at the end of it I\u2019ve got to give this presentation, so there\u2019s this ROI. The reason I\u2019m doing this is so I can give a really good presentation at the end. Now obviously I don\u2019t speak every week at church, the way Mormon church works, you speak once every 5 years and everyone gets a chance. So it\u2019s like, alright 5 years from now, I\u2019m going to get speaking opportunities, that\u2019s not going to work. So what I\u2019m starting to do is I\u2019m working on launching my own podcast where basically I will throughout the week study and learn and I\u2019ll be creating a talk and I\u2019ll give that on the podcast and that\u2019ll be my ROI. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be looking forward to. I\u2019ll be working because I have to have this thing for the podcast. Now there\u2019s an ROI, now I can justify in my brain, why you do this or that. Things like that.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s just an example. But everything in my life. What\u2019s the ROI? As Dana asked me that, I started telling him, \u201cyou know, for me, first off, it\u2019s hard. I got a new car and I was supposed to go to the DMV. I didn\u2019t for two years, I just drove around with plates that didn\u2019t work. Me going to the DMV opportunity cost was so\u2026.there was no ROI, it was useless.\u201d One of the ways it\u2019s useful is if I get pulled over. I\u2019m just not going to get pulled over. And I didn\u2019t for two years. Finally someone on my team forced me to go. They took me there and forced me to sit down and I got it done. But it was two years of driving without whatever the DMV\u2019s supposed to give you.</p> <p>The pool example, I kind of told him, \u201cWell you know if the pool, for me to go sit and wait for the pool guy for two hours, it\u2019s going to drive me nuts. There\u2019s no positive ROI other than the pool works. So for me it\u2019s like, what\u2019s the benefit for my wife and kids? What\u2019s the ROI for them? \u00a0Oh here you go,\u00a0 I have a chance to spend two hours with them. I\u2019m going to sit there and whatever that is. But that\u2019s an ROI, it\u2019s not fixing the pool, it\u2019s the time with my kids. And as soon as I can justify that and make that, then I\u2019m like, cool I can do this because this is the ROI for me and my brain.\u201d</p> <p>And I never thought about the hair cutting thing, I\u2019m actually getting my hair cut today, so I thought that was kind of funny. It is kind of a waste of an hour of my day. Just to go get my hair cut, I should pay my girl to come here and cut my hair while I\u2019m working on the treadmill or something, I don\u2019t know. It would be kind of funny.</p> <p>Anyway, I just thought it was interesting. For you guys, as entrepreneurs probably a lot of your brain works similar to mine, where you need that positive ROI. So sometimes when you\u2019re struggling to get something done, at least for me, it\u2019s because I can\u2019t see that. So I have to associate what is the ROI that I\u2019ll get from this. If it\u2019s something I\u2019m excited by I can go do it and I can conquer it. That\u2019s why this book that I\u2019ve been killing myself to get it done, I know the ROI on the other side of it, is the only thing that keeps me moving. Because there is so much pain associated with writing a book for me. But I know in my mind what the ROI is. From a financial, from a transformational, all the things that I care about and why I\u2019m doing it. I see that ROI and it\u2019s what drives me to keep moving forward.</p> <p>Anyway, I just wanted to share that with you guys today because I thought it was important and hopefully you guys can start attaching ROI\u2019s to things that you\u2019re struggling with. And I think if you do that it\u2019s going to give you the motivation that you need to get those things done. So there you go. With that said, take some personality tests cause that\u2019s cool too. Alright, appreciate you all. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "09:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/284_-_My_New_Ninja_Trick_-_How_To_Attach_An_ROI_To_Everything.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1482426000, "title": "Episode #283 \u2013 What To Do With The One And Two Stars", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I apologize in advance, but on this one I get a liiiiiittle bit violent.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about reading the Amazon reviews of his first book and getting angry about the few negative reviews and relates it to an experience he had during his wrestling days.</p> <p>Here are some of the other interesting things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell chose to read the Amazon reviews of his first book.</li> <li>How being angry at the negative reviews made him want to do something he did to a fellow wrestler years earlier.</li> <li>And why the human race is too high maintenance these days and why we need to stop complaining.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out what one and two star reviews have to do with wrestling.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>What\u2019s up everybody, this is Russell. I hope you guys are doing awesome today. I am leaving my house for the first time and it\u2019s almost 4:00. I\u2019m actually leaving my house and heading over to my buddies gym because I\u2019m going to do something that nobody wants to do. It\u2019s going to force me to be accountable to myself and to other people. I\u2019m going to get fat rolls pinched; it\u2019s called a pinch test.</p> <p>He pinches me and says, \u201cRussell, this is your body fat percentage.\u201d And as much as I do not want to know that, because I assume in my mind it\u2019s 7% like I was back when I was wrestling, when I find out that I\u2019m probably at 20, 21, 22 I gotta admit I\u2019m gonna cry a little bit. But then I\u2019ll at least have a standard to know where I\u2019m at and then I\u2019ll have something to work against.</p> <p>A lot of us I think, our biggest problem in life is we just are winging it. We\u2019re like, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing good. I don\u2019t know.\u201d But we don\u2019t have something to measure it against. Not gonna lie, I\u2019m one of those people. In fact, that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s easier to cheat a lot of the time. Whether you\u2019re cheating on eating or exercise or whatever. You\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m not really measuring against anything, so I have no idea if I\u2019m getting better or worse, therefore I might as well just eat this candy, because who really knows.\u201d So this is gonna hold me accountable.</p> <p>I\u2019m gonna do this right now, then I\u2019m going to party it up all through Christmas vacation and then on Monday, the day after Christmas it begins. And I\u2019m gonna be strict and it\u2019s gonna be awesome. So that\u2019s kind of my game plan of what I\u2019m doing right now.</p> <p>But the reason I\u2019m leaving today at 4:00 is because I\u2019m in book writing mode. I literally, if you saw me right now, you would laugh. I look like a hermit, I have not shaved, I\u2019m in my sweats/jammies. I\u2019ve been in my room just writing, writing, writing and I got three chapters done today which is a lot of work, but it\u2019s turning out awesome, which means I probably have 5 left and I\u2019ll be done with this book. We\u2019ll have it over to the editors, actually the editors\u2019 editing while I\u2019m writing. I finish a chapter and send it to the editor, because I\u2019m not gonna lie, way beyond my deadline. I had to be extra to be like, \u201cHey do you mind just doing this weirdly, as I get them done.\u201d So I sent her three chapters today and keep on moving forward.</p> <p>Hopefully I can get two more done tonight, that\u2019s my goal. Then I get out of being grounded. I\u2019m literally grounded. I told my kids\u2026.they\u2019re like, \u201cDad, why aren\u2019t you going to your office.\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019m grounded. I\u2019m not allowed to leave. Too many friends at the office, they just talk. I have to be in this room locked down.\u201d So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s funny, as I\u2019m writing this book, and one thing that inspires me to write this book is the response I got with the first book. How many people have told me so many good things? People, even my peer and mentors.</p> <p>I was so scared for some of friends to read my book. In fact, the person I was most scared of to read my book was, Rich Schefren, someone I totally look up to and respect. He\u2019s probably read more marketing books than anyone on Earth. In fact, if you Google Rich Schefren, book reading process\u2026.you will see a dude who is insane. He has a video on YouTube, 20 minutes long, totally worth the watch, but basically he reads the book and speed highlights it all. Then he goes and cuts the binding off the book. After the binding is done, he scans the book and sends it to the Philippians and the Filipinos\u2019 go and transcribe the highlighted portion because that\u2019s the only portion that he cares about.</p> <p>From there they make this other book file that he takes that book file and puts it on his iPad, and he\u2019s done that for the last ten years. So he\u2019s got like 50 thousand books like that. Then what he\u2019ll do, in the morning he\u2019ll be like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to be giving a presentation on sales today. What are the top 10 sales books in the world. The top 20, top 50 sales books. So then he\u2019ll go and pull his notes from the top 50 sales books, load them into his iPad and then reads it in ten times speed. He\u2019ll sit there on his treadmill for an hour or more in the morning and re-read the 25 top sales books in the history of the world, that morning. At two or three times, and then he goes out and knows everything on earth about sales. It\u2019s the coolest thing ever.</p> <p>I wish I could just hang out with Rich for a week and do that. It would be so cool. But I can\u2019t because I just am not that structured, but I wish I was. I remember when I sent him my book, actually I didn\u2019t send him one. I sent it to a bunch of my friends and I specifically didn\u2019t send it to Rich because I was like, he\u2019s gonna read this and he might not like it. He\u2019s read everything so I was so scared. So I saw him a couple of months later at a Traffic Conversion event before we launched the book. He\u2019s like, \u201cEveryone keeps talking about your book. I want to get a copy.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m scared of you reading it, not gonna lie. If you don\u2019t like it I\u2019m gonna be crushed.\u201d So he\u2019s like, \u201cGive me the book.\u201d So I gave it to him and he read it on his flight home and he loved it, which was cool. He sent me a cool video of him in a smoke lounge talking about it and it was, for me, validation from my peers that I did something good. Which for me, is harder.</p> <p>I assume my customers will like my stuff, but a lot of times my peers\u2026it\u2019s scares me because I want them to like me. We all have the same fears. We want to be liked, and I want them to like me. So that was the big thing. And then I put it out there and people liked it and it transformed people\u2019s lives, which is cool. So cool. It just makes me so happy. So today I was like to give me motivation to keep reading, I\u2019m going to go to Amazon and look at my reviews and read it. And it\u2019s like 4.9 stars or whatever. I\u2019m like, \u201cyeah, everybody loves me.\u201d And I\u2019m reading them all. And there\u2019s a little graph, it\u2019s like 5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars, 2 stars, 1 star.</p> <p>And there was a little percentage that clicked on 1 star. I was like, \u201cWhat? Who doesn\u2019t like my book?\u201d So I clicked on the 1 star and it went there and I was like, these people, I\u2019m glad that Amazon doesn\u2019t give you their address because I\u2019d be in the car and drive to their house. People were like, \u201cThat book was a 250 page sales pitch.\u201d I\u2019m like, are you kidding me? Literally there is a page and a half in the very back where I mention Clickfunnels, that\u2019s it. This is\u2026..I\u2019ve read books that are 150, 200 page sales pitches. This was not, in fact I specifically I don\u2019t want this to be a sales pitch. I\u2019m going to write an amazing book and hopefully if I\u2019ve earned it after 250 pages I can mention one cool thing I do in a page and a half.</p> <p>And all the thing I was mentioning was, \u201cby the way, these funnels I\u2019m talking about, you can do it really easily in Clickfunnels, you should go get an account for free.\u201d I saw a couple of those, people who were like, \u201cThis book is full of fluff.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cFluff? Are you kidding me? That was twelve years of my life, reading over a quarter of a million dollars in books and courses. And then breaking them down and putting them into an actual, logical step by step system. The time it took me to write that book, was ten years of trial and error and like a year of writing to give this book to you. And it was like, it was all fluff. I wanted to just jump at that person. If they were in my wrestling room right now, it would be\u2026..</p> <p>Okay I probably shouldn\u2019t tell this story, some of you guys will lose respect for me. But it must be told because this is what would happen to the person had they been here with me. So there was this guy that used to wrestle with us and he was unfortunately a good wrestler. In fact, he beat me one time and I can\u2019t stand that guy and I won\u2019t mention his name, but for those of you guys who are in my wrestling world, his initials are WW. So I\u2019ll leave that for the few people who will know what I\u2019m talking about. So he was this guy, super annoying wrestler. Nobody liked him. But unfortunately he was kind of good so he beat people.</p> <p>Like I was saying, he beat me once in a Greco match where I was cutting weight and it was just a fluke, but he beat me. And then I beat him like a little girl every time after that, including in college when I had a chance to beat him. I was wrestling in a college match, he was in a different college and I started wrestling him and in the first period he went and did a two on one arm bar on me on our feet\u2026..what\u2019s it called? Baseball grip, he hid my hand under his stomach so the ref couldn\u2019t see and started trying to break my wrist, pushing my wrist in towards me.</p> <p>So I reached back and punched him in the head and shoved him off, to get him off my wrist. He was literally trying to break my wrist. The ref\u2019s like, \u201cWhoa, what are you doing? You can\u2019t punch him in the head.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHe\u2019s trying to break my wrist.\u201d So then I went ape on this dude, I ended up in that period getting up by 14 points and then I pinned him because I wanted to humiliate him and pin him just so it was a double humiliation. I digress, the initial story, this is years of my life beating this guy but he deserved it, so it was fun.</p> <p>So anyway, we were at a wrestling camp, and if you knew him, some of you guys will think, Russell you\u2019re so mean. I\u2019m really not mean. If you understood the situation, who he was and how he treated people. And there was only a couple of guys who were better than him so we had to make sure that he, oh man, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m telling this story, we would humble him. So at the freestyle and Greco wrestling camp he was at with us, our goal was to pick him up and slam him down on the ground over and over and over again so that he knew that we were all better than him.</p> <p>So three of us guys and him and we were wrestling\u2026 and I\u2019m not saying we were doing this against a defenseless guy, he was a good guy, we were just better. We just made sure he knew and he\u2019d feel it. Anyway, that\u2019s what I would do to these guys if they were here. I\u2019d pick them up and slam them down and as they get back up I\u2019d pick them up and slam them down again and just keep doing that until my, like my friend WW, wasn\u2019t able to walk off the mats because he was so sore. Anyway, he recovered and is probably why 5 years later in college he tried to break my wrist, if I think about it. Maybe Karma was coming back to get me. There you go, I was doing the wrong thing as a high school thing. Anyway, my wrist didn\u2019t break, so it all ended up good and I won that match.</p> <p>So there you go. Holy cow, there\u2019s my Russell tangent for the day, so sorry. Anyway, I repented for that, I\u2019m a nice person now and I don\u2019t beat people up. But if I wasn\u2019t and I could see these one star people, that\u2019s what I would do. One and two stars, both. They were just like, one guys\u2019 like, \u201cI got no value. In fact, I stopped reading the book after the first ten pages.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s because you stopped reading the book after the first ten pages. Read page eleven, there\u2019s some amazing stuff on that page. And thirteen and fourteen and all the rest of the pages. I don\u2019t know what else I can give you. The book was free, you covered shipping and handling. Or you went to Amazon, it was $10. Seriously.\u201d It made me go crazy.</p> <p>It reminded me of something Tony Robbins taught me. So this is for me, I\u2019m mostly telling myself this to get me, make me feel okay with continuing writing my book. But he was talking about how high maintenance human beings are in today\u2019s day and age. And what will happen is that people will go out there and risk tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars to make a movie for you. They\u2019ll hire the best actors and screen writers and script writers and spend two or three years of their lives and hundreds of millions of dollars to go and to write a story, create it, build an environment and a fantasy and make this thing amazing and produce this movie, and then they give us this movie\u00a0 and they ask us $10. That\u2019s all, $10 for you to go watch this movie, and look at 2 or 3 years of these guys\u2019 life and hundreds of millions of dollars risked on their side and all their asking is $10. And then they come and entertain you for 2 or 3 hours of a movie.</p> <p>And Tony talked about how, if you look at that, kings back in the day would have Court Jesters and things like to be able to be entertained. They didn\u2019t have a fraction of what we can get for $10 today. Yet we\u2019ll be so pompous and arrogant as to go to a movie that, I\u2019m just going to use this as an example because I really liked this movie and a lot of people didn\u2019t. But the Batman vs Superman, we pay our $10, we go there and at the end we say, \u201cThat movie sucked. It was a waste of my money, a waste of my time.\u201d Are you kidding me, these people risked hundreds of millions of dollars to entertain you and it cost you $10 and two hours of your time and you\u2019re complaining it was a waste of your time and money? Oh people.</p> <p>With that said, I want something for all of you. First off, is when you got people like that who come back to your amazing-ness that you create, that you are putting out there, risking your time and energy and your time away from your family to create and to do, there\u2019s gonna morons out there who complain and say, \u201cLook, it was a waste of my ten bucks.\u201d And for those people, guess what you should do to them, you should freaking WW them. Pick them up, that\u2019s kind of funny. WW Wrestling\u2026but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. You pick them up and slam them down in your mind over and over again until they can\u2019t walk and then you move on with your life because they don\u2019t really matter. Then you go back to the people you\u2019re serving and worry about them because that\u2019s who does matter.</p> <p>This is like the worst moral of the story ever. So that\u2019s half of it. Just forget about those people that are gonna be the complainers. The second half is don\u2019t be that person that complains. The people that do that, you\u2019re not a good person. Somebody is risking all this stuff to give you a gift. Don\u2019t complain about it. If you don\u2019t want to go to the movie, and if you didn\u2019t like the movie, it wasn\u2019t\u2026\u2026but don\u2019t complain about it. The thing that they are giving you and the return of what they\u2019re asking you for, is insanely low and we should be grateful. I\u2019m grateful for people who risk and do these things for us. I\u2019m grateful, after writing now my second book, I\u2019m grateful for anyone who\u2019s written a book, it is not easy.</p> <p>The time, the stress, the headache, pressure that goes into that, I\u2019m grateful. Even if I didn\u2019t like your book or agree with your beliefs or point, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m grateful that you put the energy and effort into it and gave it somebody because you believe it\u2019ll change their life for $10 or $5, whatever a book cost. I just want everyone to be thinking it that way. Because I think that makes all of us better people and makes the world better and gives the creators less fear to go and create. Because that\u2019s it\u2019s. If you\u2019re not creating then what\u2019s the point.</p> <p>So I hope that helps somebody, I don\u2019t know. At least it\u2019ll help me to forget about those one and two stars. And hopefully no one lost respect for me because of what I did to my buddy, WW. But he totally deserved it, so it\u2019s all cool. Don\u2019t worry about it. I didn\u2019t do anything that was outside of the bounds of what someone should do in a wrestling room. So it was all good. Anyway, with that said, appreciate you all, I\u2019m about two minutes away from my pinch test, pray that I\u2019m not over 25% body fat. If I am though, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll get back to work and get back to where I need to be. Thanks everybody. Talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "15:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/283_-_What_To_Do_With_The_One_And_Two_Stars.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1482189243, "title": "Episode #282 \u2013 Before You Complain About Your Circumstances\u2026Listen To This", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Amazing stories from three of our inner circle members.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about heating problems at home and why we shouldn\u2019t complain about our problems with life or business.

Welcome to a freezing, freezing cold Marketing In Your Car. Today it\u2019s cold outside. It\u2019s under 10 degrees, but what\u2019s worse is my house this morning, our bedroom was 55 degrees. We have something wrong with our heaters. I think I probably complained about this last winter too. Our house is kind of big, and with a big house comes heating issues. Trying to keep the whole house warm.</p> <p>Last year we had the same thing. We had this huge struggle. The heater and the water are tied together. We can\u2019t get a warm shower or warm heat. So it\u2019s just bitter cold. I\u2019m ordering all these space heaters. We\u2019ve got the heating guy and the plumbing guy coming over today, but I don\u2019t know. It might be another cold winter.</p> <p>Other than that, today is amazing. I actually wanted to share with you guys two stories today, lest any of us want to complain about our situation, or our business. Because that seems to be something fun that people like to do. I see it on Facebook all the time. I see it in personal conversations, there\u2019s always some excuse about why we can\u2019t have success. So I want to take those excuses and smash them with a hammer and jump on them, then catch them on fire. I guess you can\u2019t really catch glass on fire. We\u2019ll turn it so hot that it freaking melts the glass. And then it turns into sand again, I don\u2019t know. Whatever.</p> <p>I just want to get rid of all those things because if you\u2019re living in America, or Canada, or most countries, we don\u2019t have obstacles and if we do, we need to be able to get over them. There you go. It\u2019s out there. Any time in your mind that you\u2019re like, \u201cI can\u2019t figure this out because of blah.\u201d That\u2019s not a good excuse. You gotta figure it out. Time to stop not thinking and start thinking. That\u2019s it. So I want to tell you guys a couple of stories of some of our inner circle members who have given me, have taken from me all my excuses I ever have about anything, ever again from this point forward, moving on forever.</p> <p>So the first one I want to tell you about, two of our inner circle members, Andrew and Vlad from the Ukraine, they are so cool. They\u2019re from the Ukraine, I think the average salary in Ukraine is like 200 bucks a month or something like that. And over there, they\u2019re not internet savy, people aren\u2019t. Nobody buys things online, it\u2019s not a\u2026..you don\u2019t push someone to a website and they pull out their credit card and they buy. It\u2019s just not something people do. They don\u2019t trust it, they don\u2019t believe in it.</p> <p>So Vlad and Andrew they want to have success online, so they start figuring out, okay here\u2019s this obstacle. Nobody can buy things online, yet we want to sell things online. What do we do? How do we figure this out? So these guys, who, again the average salary for a well paid person over there is $220 a month, and they were like, we want to become millionaires, how do we do that? A million dollars over there is like a billion over here. So that\u2019s wanting to become billionaires over here.</p> <p>So they get to work and start doing everything. First thing, after they join the inner circle and they listened to some of our stuff, they start doing webinars weekly. We\u2019re going to do weekly webinars because Russell said so. They didn\u2019t go, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do a webinar every week.\u201d Or \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get Facebook ads to work every single week.\u201d Or all the other excuses many people told me since I started saying you should do a webinar a week, every single week for the rest of your lives.</p> <p>There\u2019s always some excuse coming out. So instead of making excuses they just started doing it. As they\u2019re doing this webinar they are like, people just don\u2019t\u2026..they can\u2019t push someone to a website to just buy, people don\u2019t trust it. So to get people to buy on their webinar, they set up a little call center. They ended up hiring a bunch of people to take phone calls, but still people are scared to take credit cards over the phone. So what happens\u00a0 a lot of times is that people will actually mail them cash, they will do sorts of things. They were telling us the other day, and this comes back to how afraid that economy is of credit cards. The person was not willing to give their credit card over the phone because they thought it was going to be stolen. So what they did, they took their credit card or debit card, or whatever it\u2019s called and then they wrapped it up in an envelope and mailed the credit card to them, and the letter said, \u201cHey if you guys can take this credit card, go to the ATM machine, here\u2019s my pin code, run it, take the cash out, and then mail me my ATM card back.\u201d So they did.</p> <p>They\u2019re hustling trying to figure out how to collect money. They\u2019re getting people to ship them their ATM cards because that\u2019s more safe for their country than to go buy things online. They\u2019ve got call centers that they\u2019ve built out. They\u2019ve got people sending cash. Every obstacle known to man about collecting cash, they don\u2019t even have merchant accounts, they\u2019ve been able to do it. And guess what they did last year with their webinar? Drum roll please, in a country where the average salary is $200 a month, and people are scared to buy online and it\u2019s so under-developed people can\u2019t even buy online. Last year they did 7 hundred thousand dollars. In fact, that was a couple of months ago, so it\u2019s probably more than that, but that\u2019s last I heard. 7 Hundred thousand dollars from their webinar.</p> <p>Is that insane? Does that not make you think, wow I\u2019m in a country where people love buying stuff online. I\u2019m in a country where people are used to it. I\u2019m in a country where the average salary is not $200 a month, it\u2019s a lot more than that. If you have any issues, like my people won\u2019t buy, they\u2019re broke and don\u2019t have any money. Those issues are not real. They are all in your head. Stories you are telling yourself, stories I\u2019m telling myself. They\u2019re not real. If you\u2019re willing to think through it, and not have those excuses and those road blocks and just smash through them, you can do what these guys have done over there in the Ukraine.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because their next goal is they want to do a webinar here in America. He\u2019s like, \u201cyou guys in America don\u2019t know how easy it is.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI know.\u201d They did 7 hundred thousand dollars over there, they\u2019re going to become billionaires over here. So that\u2019s number one.</p> <p>Number two. Sorry, I\u2019ve got a stuffy nose too, so I apologize. One of our new inner circle members, and I don\u2019t know them super well yet so I\u2019m not comfortable sharing names and stuff, but I will share this story because it\u2019s worth it. As I get to know her better throughout the year maybe I\u2019ll share more stories. But they own a company over in West Africa, Nigeria, that area. They sell supplements and pharmaceuticals and things like that, and they\u2019ve got clinics and as a company they did 50 million dollars last year, which is amazing in and of itself, especially in a third world country.</p> <p>So apparently she saw my funnel hacks webinar and saw how it\u2019s doing selling supplements, so she wants to start selling supplements, joins the inner circle comes in and we had our decade in a day on Friday to try to go through their model, their plan, things like that, and she showed me this thing, and it\u2019s crazy, first off, she went and built out a supplement line, with 70 supplements. She\u2019s like, \u201cAs soon as we release this, we\u2019ll be knocked off instantly.\u201d And I guess it\u2019s illegal to buy supplements in the country right now unless you get all these legal things. So most people buy all that stuff on the black market, so they\u2019re competing against the black market, people who are selling underhand.</p> <p>Second off, is over there, they don\u2019t really have addresses. So if your customers have addresses, you already have an easier job than she does. If your customers don\u2019t have addresses you can\u2019t be like, \u201cHey ship my product out to whatever West, whatever North, whatever. Here\u2019s the street and zip code.\u201d because they don\u2019t have that. They\u2019re like, \u201cwe\u2019re in the third house on the left down from the store.\u201d That\u2019s the reality she lives in. She\u2019s like, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to ship products to people.\u201d If there was, most of the time DHL will do it, but it\u2019s 7 or 8 times more expensive than what we\u2019re paying here. All these hurdles, all these variables. If I would have heard that I would have been like, \u201cWell I guess we can\u2019t sell supplements in Nigeria, we\u2019re going to the states.\u201d That would be my\u2026.I\u2019d be going to where\u2019s the least barrier of entry and kind of slide in.</p> <p>But instead she\u2019s like, \u201cNo, these people need this stuff. It\u2019s going to help them and if we can figure it out we\u2019ll be the only ones here. We will be able to be a monopoly. We\u2019re the only ones who can do it.\u201d So they went and got all the government approval on their supplements. So they\u2019re the only people in the country allowed to sell supplements besides the black market. They\u2019re not allowed but they\u2019re going to do it anyway.</p> <p>So she got this window and she\u2019s like, \u201cWe can\u2019t ship to people \u2018s houses, so we had to figure out a way to solve shipping issues.\u201d So what she did is insane, so cool. You ever heard of Amazon lockers? I never heard of this before, but if you Google Amazon lockers, they\u2019re these lockers that are in different cities. Say you\u2019re in Chicago or somewhere where you may not have\u2026..I don\u2019t know. Anyway, they\u2019re lockers. Amazon will deliver to these lockers and they notify you and you go there, you go to the locker and there\u2019s 50 lockers and you type in a code and it pops out, here\u2019s the product you ordered. It\u2019s pretty cool. Instead of delivering directly to your house, it delivers to these lockers and the lockers, people go and pick up their stuff. Kind of like a mailbox, mailbox etc or something like that. But it\u2019s called Amazon Lockers.</p> <p>So she saw that and was, \u201coh cool. That solves my problem.\u201d So she went out and bought I think like 15 or 20 of these locker systems that she could use, and then she went, they had to be secure because people will break into these things and steal stuff there, so she went and negotiated deals with 15 or 20 banks to have these lockers inside of their banks all around the country. So now she\u2019s got a distribution channel all around the entire country. So when these supplements are done and the funnels done, people can buy it, but once again people don\u2019t\u2026..it\u2019s just crazy. So many hurdles.</p> <p>People won\u2019t buy stuff online over there, so they have to do everything cash on delivery. Everyone has to say, \u201cYes, I want to buy this.\u201d Click the button to buy it and they have to put in some information. I think she\u2019s going to have them pay a dollar or something just to prove they have a credit card. Then she actually delivers to the locker, the locker notifies them and they go pick it up at the locker and they pay cash at the locker to get the actual product.</p> <p>Now, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with this business yet, but I\u2019ve seen how she\u2019s turned less than that into 50 million dollars a year and I think that\u2026my guess is that she\u2019s going to turn this into hundreds of millions of dollars, because she\u2019s figured it out and she\u2019s solved these hard, hard problems.</p> <p>So I wanted to share both of these stories for you guys today, hopefully just to put things into perspective. When there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way. That\u2019s it. If you\u2019re struggling right now and you\u2019re here in the states or in Canada, in a country that has postage, credit cards, zip codes, street addresses. I promise you guys that the answers are there. It\u2019s been done over and over again. The trail\u2019s have been trail blazed. People have gone before you. You just need to look and model. I look at entrepreneurs like this, I\u2019m so grateful to have in the inner circle because they\u2019re an inspiration to me and everyone else. You look at that and you\u2019re like, \u201cMan, if they can figure that out there, what can we do here? What can we accomplish in a society, in a land, in a country where this is something that\u2019s normal. That people want to do. Where people are online buying stuff, 10, 15, 20 times a day, you just got to convince them that your stuff is exciting and cool.</p> <p>I hope that gives you guys inspiration, I know it has for me. I really, every time I look at my life and business now, I\u2019m like there\u2019s no excuses. Every problem is solvable. These basic needs that these guys don\u2019t have, they figure out ways to solve those problems and we can too. We just gotta think and be creative and sit back and try to figure out the answers because they\u2019re there.\u00a0 The good thing for most of you guys is that most people already figured out the answers for you. That\u2019s what Funnel hacking is about. Look at the answers, be able to look at all the stuff people have already solved, look at that and work off of the hard work of others.</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful for everyone who\u2019s gone ahead of me in this industry and business and trail blazed for me so I could step into those grooves and kind of run a path that they\u2019ve already created for us. I definitely was not the inventor of any of this stuff, but a beneficiary of it for sure. Someone who\u2019s proud and grateful for those who\u2019ve gone before us and hopefully I can trail blaze some stuff for you guys and you can jump in and follow me as well. That\u2019s the goal.</p> <p>Anyway, with that said, my nose is so stuffed right now that I\u2019m going to stop this recording even though I\u2019m not quite to the office. Hopefully you guys got some value out of it. I hope you just kind of look at your perspective a little differently and realize that we\u2019ve all got it pretty good. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day. I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "13:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/282_-_Before_You_Complain_About_Your_Circumstances...Listen_To_This.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1481666560, "title": "Episode #281 \u2013 How Mr. Trello Just Saved My Business\u2026Again", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Behind the scenes of what I got from my consult day with James Friel so far\u2026</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about hiring James Friel to help him and his team manage their projects better using Trello. He explains why it\u2019s important when you are running a business to be organized and make everybody accountable for things.</p> <p>Here are some of the awesome things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why it took Russell listening to James talk about Trello several times before he actually is getting around to implementing it in his own company.</li> <li>Why entrepreneurs are more likely to need management software like Trello.</li> <li>And why you should give James Friel money to help your business.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how and why Russell and his team are finally getting organized on Trello.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>This is the end of the year right now, its getting close to Christmas and normally people do all their planning and stuff in January for how I\u2019m going to take over the world next year. But I kind of want to be prepared so when January 1st hits we can be off on the\u2026.out running and sprinting.</p> <p>So because of that, this week became a planning week, which is hard for me to do. I don\u2019t normally plan things. Usually I have a whole bunch of ideas in my head and we start running and everyone kind of learns about all the ideas as we are moving forward, which is a horrible way to manage people, by the way. I think it drives everybody crazy. In fact, Todd, I think you guys all know Todd by now, hopefully. If not, he\u2019s the dude who built Clickfunnels. He told me today that the only way he knows what\u2019s happening in the business is by listening to the podcast. You guys are hearing things as everybody else is.</p> <p>So I\u2019m trying to get better at that. It\u2019s fun, one of the guys who joined our inner circle last year, his name is James Friel, super cool guy. He came in and one of his nicknames is the contract CEO, where people will hire him to be the CEO and go in their company and fix things and make it all work right. And we were trying to figure out how to make a sexy thing for him to sell and it was kind of hard at first, his first headline is something like, \u201cHow to become more predictable and sustainable.\u201d Or something like that and I was like, no one\u2019s going to give you money for that, that\u2019s horrible. We gotta make this sexy.</p> <p>So we worked with him last year, turning what he does into this sexy, exciting thing. So to do it initially he was showing me all the cool things he does, there\u2019s a lot of stuff, he\u2019s crazy talented. But one of them was, his project management system and how he does it with Trello and Slack and Gann Charts and this whole thing. I was like, \u201cI use Trello, I got it figured out, I don\u2019t need help.\u201d And he was like, \u201cDude, I think you need my help more than anyone.\u201d</p> <p>And in fact, this is funny, I\u2019ll tell you the rest of the story but I\u2019ll give you the punch line right now, but he\u2019s been at our office for two days working on this and he told me last night at dinner, out of all the companies he\u2019s ever worked with, mine was the most messed up. He\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing you guys have done as well as you have.\u201d I was like, \u201cyes, good selling can make up for a lot of bad systems.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, so stepping back. So this is in January of last year he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m coming to inner circle meetings, let me come in a day early and I\u2019ll take you guys through the process that I would normally charge people 20 or 30 thousand to do.\u201d I was like, \u201cAlright, cool.\u201d So he came in and showed me his whole Trello system and blew my mind. I was like holy crap, no wonder I never got anything done ever. I need to change everything.</p> <p>So we changed it all around and I implemented I\u2019d say probably 75% of what he said, because the rest I was too smart to listen to. So 75%, which is basically I started using Trello for myself, my own systems, personally. I tried to get everyone on my team on it, but it lasted like 8 seconds, and nobody did it again. But I was doing it myself and things became better\u00a0 because at least I had my thoughts out in a way.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just like\u2026..if you\u2019ve used Trello before, it\u2019s free. You can\u2019t even give them money if you want. They\u2019re the worst marketing company of all time, but their software is awesome. The problem is their software is so awesome you can do pretty much anything you want with it and because of that people like me just screw it up. So James built this system that makes it very simple, very easy. It pulls out the human error and pulls out all these issues, and it\u2019s awesome.</p> <p>So I started using it and changed dramatically transformed my productivity and my ability to get things done, which is probably why we had a lot of success this year. In fact, this is crazy. Last year was awesome, and this year we\u2019re trying to 3x what we did last year and we\u2019re within a few hundred thousand dollars of hitting. So we\u2019re on our march through the end of the year to hit this certain number. If we hit that number then we\u2019ll\u00a0 have tripled what we did last year, which is crazy.</p> <p>Then our goal is to triple it again next year. If we do that, they\u2019re going to have to write a book about it. I\u2019m not writing it because I\u2019m tired of writing books. But someone\u2019s gotta write about it because it\u2019s amazing. Anyway, stepping back. So it was awesome, but I only implemented about 75% because I couldn\u2019t get my team on board and it was hard.</p> <p>Then fast forward, at the next inner circle meeting in the summer he came and everyone basically in the inner circle I found out, was kind of like me. We\u2019re really talented entrepreneurs who are really good at selling stuff and we no idea how to manage ourselves or our processes or anything else. Sound familiar? If that sounds like you, you\u2019re probably an entrepreneur. Welcome to the cool kids club.</p> <p>Anyway, I had him stay and give a presentation to the inner circle group on how it is in the Trello system and I saw it again and I was like \u201cOh! There\u2019s the other 25% I\u2019m not doing. Why am I not doing? I should just do it.\u201d Then I got all excited to do and then embarrassingly to myself and everybody else, I didn\u2019t. Then I had him train our whole inner circle as a whole and everybody got excited again, I got excited again and didn\u2019t do it. Finally at the end of this year I was like, you know what, we\u2019re not doing it.</p> <p>So James what would it cost to fly to Boise for 2 days and sit here and make us do it?\u201d and that\u2019s what he did. Yesterday he was here all day, even as much as I\u2019m using Trello over the last year, we still cleaned it up, simplified it, made it way better. And then we got everyone on the team doing it and now there\u2019s this one key piece that I was fighting doing because it requires a person to be in charge of the whole system and now we got Michelle McPherson running that piece of the system, she\u2019s amazing. And now the whole 100% is going to work. Day one was getting it all implemented. Day two we\u2019re focusing on moving it forward and getting everyone using it, which is cool.</p> <p>And then basically, James every week for the next 8 weeks is going to be doing company meetings. We don\u2019t even do company meetings. We do meetings in different departments, like the programming team meets, and the support team meets, but the marketing side, that I\u2019m kind of in charge of, we don\u2019t\u2026.we do meet but it\u2019s like we get online and talk about the cool stuff we\u2019re doing. There\u2019s no point or focus with anything we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>What\u2019s cool about this new system is that there\u2019s meetings built in that are all tied around Trello and the goals and the dates and everything inside of that, which is cool. He\u2019s going to be teaching us how to do the meetings the right way and then moving forward for the next 8 weeks, once a week he\u2019ll be jumping on our meetings with us and getting us all in this group. So by January we can hit and scale things a lot more rapidly.</p> <p>They always say, \u201cwhat got you here probably won\u2019t get you there\u201d. And I feel like there\u2019s different levels of skill set. There\u2019s a skill set that gets you from 0 to a million dollars, a different skill set that get\u2019s you from one million to 3, at least these were my barriers. There\u2019s a different skill set form 3 to 10.\u00a0 A different skill set from 10 to 30 and I feel like\u00a0 the skill set from 30 to 100 is different and it\u2019s not necessarily my strengths, my ninja skills. It\u2019s something different as this piece. It\u2019s the organization, structure and systems.</p> <p>We were building systems out in Trello, we were like what\u2019s all the things you do every single month consistently, the exact same thing? So we made these systems for it. I was like, holy crap this just made my life so much easier. Funnel University is a good example. There\u2019s like\u2026..we do the exact same thing every single month. And every month we\u2019re like, \u201cWhat do we do next? What\u2019s the next thing? Oh yeah.\u201d And we re-think it through every single time. And now it\u2019s like, there\u2019s a system. Just a Trello card. We just copy it every January, it\u2019s a recurring thing. Or every first of the month It pops in. Automatically recurring, it just pops into the thing, we know what we gotta do it, and we do it and it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>And now we know we gotta do it too because someone\u2019s in charge of running it. Everyone\u2019s got due dates. Everyone has things and they\u2019re held accountable to somebody, which is awesome. Including me, I\u2019m held accountable. \u201cHey Russell, why didn\u2019t you get that crap done?\u201d \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know. I need to get it done.\u201d I\u2019m held accountable too, which is awesome and everyone\u2019s held accountable.</p> <p>And there\u2019s somebody who knows what\u2019s happening. Right now, I kind of know what\u2019s happening at least on the marketing side of all the projects. But I\u2019m the worst person\u2026.me as an entrepreneur is the worst person to know everything because then everyone has to come to me for every single thing and nothing ever gets done. So now the way that the systems built out, I\u2019m not tied into it.\u00a0 Michelle will be that person that knows everything and then I\u2019ll just have to know my pieces of the thing, which is so cool.</p> <p>So anywho, so that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s been awesome. We hung out at dinner with him last night and talked about over the last year. A year ago is when I kind of\u2026.I was the one telling James, \u201cThis is awesome. You should be selling this.\u201d And so he\u2019s been doing this for a bunch of companies, where people hire him and they come in and he actually becomes the CEO of their company to implement this system and spent three or four or five months with them in this last year. He\u2019s also worked with twenty or thirty entrepreneurs where he does the whole thing remote and get\u2019s the team on for half a day and builds the whole thing out remote. Works a lot less expensive than having him fly out to your office like we did.</p> <p>But regardless, if you are an entrepreneur or someone who wants to become an entrepreneur, but especially the entrepreneurs that are out there listening, and you guys are like me at all and because you\u2019re good at selling and marketing and because you kind of figured things out you are able to do a lot of things that\u2026\u2026..good marketing makes up for a lot of things. Dan Kennedy used to say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that the good sales letter can\u2019t solve.\u201d And I kind of believe that. But\u00a0 I think there\u2019s a limit. I think good selling can get you so far, but it\u2019s the systems and the organization and structure and all that nerdy stuff that they probably teach in business schools, I don\u2019t know I didn\u2019t go. But I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what they teach in business schools that we\u2019re not good at.</p> <p>So if you guys want to be able to expand and grow I highly recommend figuring that piece out. And there\u2019s two ways to figure things out. There\u2019s the school of hard knocks and do what I did, spend ten years trying to figure it out and realize one day that you\u2019re an entrepreneur and that\u2019s not your skill set. And the second way is to give James money and he\u2019ll do it for you. That\u2019s what I did.</p> <p>This is someone who I had him out doing it once in my office, then I sat through it twice more and then I still paid him to come out because it\u2019s that important to our growth.\u00a0 So for any of you guys who that\u2019s the piece where you feel like you\u2019re juggling too many things. Or you know I should be systemizing things and I don\u2019t know how to. Or your team is always confused.\u2026.</p> <p>Or I think it\u2019s more for you the entrepreneur, because if you\u2019re confused, \u201cHow do you guys not know what we\u2019re doing? I know exactly what\u2019s happening, how can you not read my mind?\u201d If you\u2019ve ever felt that way before, which I think most of us do, then you should definitely give James money. You should just write him a check and not ask any questions. Write it blank and then have him fill it in for whatever it\u2019s worth because it will be worth it.</p> <p>Anyway, if you want to work with James, this is not a pitch. Yeah it is. This is a pitch, this is a blatant pitch. I paid him money; you should pay him money too. The link, if you go to <a href=\"https://cheatsheet.jamespfriel.com/\">cheatsheet.jamespfriel.com</a>\u00a0and I think there\u2019s an opt-in where you get a cheat sheet with some cool stuff and the next page there\u2019s a video with me talking about my story. That was my story from a year ago. So imagine what my story would be like even now. It\u2019s even that much better. But if it\u2019s something better that you guys need, than I need, then I would definitely message him and see if there\u2019s a way he can do this for you.</p> <p>Like I said, you don\u2019t have to go as intense as I did and hire him and his team fly out and help you guys set it all up. You can do it remote. He did it for a dozen plus people over the last year remote as well and it works. You can get your whole team on board.</p> <p>It\u2019s one of those things that\u2026 I read the e-myth, I went through the e-myth course, I understand the value of what this piece is and I thought I was kind of doing it, but then when you have it right , you\u2019re like oh wow. I don\u2019t think we even had a system technically.</p> <p>It was funny, I was listening to this Dan Kennedy thing from back in the\u2026.probably 15 years ago. And in there he\u2019s talking about, \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to figure out how to put a system into their business, the reality is you\u2019ve already got a system, everybody\u2019s got a system, but your system kind of sucks right now.\u201d So you can take the crappy system you\u2019re using or you can try to strategically plug in the right system, because the wrong system is going to hurt you more than no system. It\u2019s impossible to have no system, if you\u2019ve got no system it means you\u2019ve just got a really bad one. Because something\u2019s happening, it\u2019s just happening really poorly.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if that made any sense, but it sounded cool, right? Just kidding. Alright, I\u2019m at the office, I got day two with James and the crew. We\u2019re going to be in Trello and slacking everything, getting things built out. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing today and that way I take one little step backwards, to plan to focus, system so I can go a thousand feet forward and take over the world a little bit more next year. So that\u2019s the game plan guys. Appreciate you all, have a great time. Go visit James, tell him hi. Give him some money, write him a check. I get nothing for this endorsement other than James is awesome and helping me and he should help you too. Thanks guys, talk to you soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "13:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_281.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1481587227, "title": "Episode #280 \u2013 Why To Promote Consistently To Your Existing Buyers", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I didn\u2019t think this was going to work, but it totally did.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about some results of his recent webinar. He also talks about why being consistent with your own email list is important.</p> <p>Here are some of the cool things you\u2019ll hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Some slightly vague stats from Russell\u2019s recent webinar that listeners have been dying to hear.</li> <li>What emailing to the consistent buyers list about the same offer for 2 1/2 years has taught Russell about being consistent.</li> <li>And why you should continue to email your own list because when it comes time for them to buy, they will buy from the person at the top of their email.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to see why consistency is important and could end up making you money.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell, I want to welcome you guys to Marketing In Your Car. It\u2019s a cold, snowy day here. Two of my kids have got fevers at home, sick. Man, you gotta love the winter time. We had a fun birthday party for the twinners on Saturday and church was good Sunday, so I\u2019m excited for the week.</p> <p>This week we are focusing on planning internal system structures. We got James Friel, AKA the man, who is flying to Boise, I guess he\u2019s probably already flown to Boise. Gonna meet with him in like 12 minutes. So he\u2019s coming in, Michelle McPherson on my team is coming in, and all the marketing side we are focusing, the next week, on getting our systems built out so that we can be more consistent so that next year, we\u2019ll just focus on selling the stuff all day, every single day. It\u2019s gonna be awesome. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening today in our world.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because a couple Marketing In Your Car\u2019s ago I was talking to you guys about how I was doing a big webinar and I\u2019ve so many people hitting me up on Facebook and Voxer and all the channels that people can grab my attention on, asking me for results show. \u201cRussell, we want a results show. We want to find out what actually happened on the webinar.\u201d Honestly, I get nervous sharing the results with people. I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s part because back in the day when we used to sell to more of the business opportunity market, people would only buy if we talked about the numbers, and now it\u2019s like, we don\u2019t talk about numbers, we just talk about results and the results for our customers, you know what I mean, let\u2019s talk about what happened to these people and these people, and that\u2019s what we focus on more, so I don\u2019t ever really share our own stats that much. It\u2019s just weird. So I won\u2019t share them exactly, but I do want to share a little bit. Just enough to get you guys excited. That\u2019s the goal.</p> <p>If I can inspire action, that\u2019s the only thing that matters. Because it does not matter what we made to anybody, except for me I guess and probably some guys on my team. But for the most part it doesn\u2019t matter. What should matter, hopefully it insights you to take action on what you\u2019re doing.</p> <p>I\u2019ll tell you the moral before I tell you the punch line. The moral of the story is that you should be promoting your internal list often. Back six years ago we had our first auto webinar ever, we made it a point once a quarter, we\u2019d promote our webinar to our list and make the same amount of money every single time. It\u2019s like, it doesn\u2019t make sense though, because if you\u2019ve all heard it, you heard me talk about it, you should have already bought it, if you haven\u2019t bought, why are you not buying this? What\u2019s going on? But for some reason it worked and we did that for 2 years. Every quarter we\u2019d redo our webinar, promote it to our same list and make the same amount of money.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting. I think I told you guys, we\u2019re planning on retiring this webinar, changing the offer, and increasing the price. So we thought let\u2019s just do one more big webinar to our own list, which is crazy because, again, if you follow me, I\u2019ve kind of been talking about the same thing for two and a half years. Talking about Clickfunnels and funnel hacking and funnels. Anyway, so I just always assume that everybody on our list, who has ever heard my voice has already bought Clickfunnels. But apparently I\u2019m wrong.</p> <p>In fact, some of you guys right now are listening to this and you\u2019re not a Clickfunnels member. Are you serious? Do you hate money that bad? Do you not trust me? I don\u2019t even know what to do anymore. If you\u2019re not a Clickfunnels member, I don\u2019t know, honestly\u2026.if I didn\u2019t have Clickfunnels, I have no idea, I can\u2019t even recall how we had success in the past. I don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s so easy with Clickfunnels, so there you go. There\u2019s my shameless plug.</p> <p>Again, I assumed everyone had purchased it. So we did the webinar, we promoted it, we ended up getting almost, not quite, but I think it was almost 6 thousand people from our list register for the webinar, which is crazy. I think it was like 5800 or something if I remember the numbers right. And then we had affiliates promote another one that was happening the next day, which was basically a replay of the one we just did. We got some affiliates, it didn\u2019t go huge, we had about 1 thousand register through the affiliates, probably upwards of 7 thousand people total registered for this webinar, which is nuts.</p> <p>Actually, it\u2019s interesting, probably closer to 7500. Okay, that\u2019s interesting. Alright, so I\u2019ll just share the number that\u2019ll help you get to the number. Basically we averaged about $100 for every single person who registered for the webinar, is about what it ended up being. From this campaign from 5 day webinar sequence. We had about a little of 3 quarters of a million dollars is what we pull out of our own list in December, promoting the same offer we promoted every single day for 2 \u00bd years, just because we made an event out of it and made people exciting again and kind of redid it.</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting is, Dave Woodward, on our team went and pulled all the stats and numbers and what\u2019s crazy is that a lot of people who were signing up, they were people who, a lot of people who never had a Clickfunnels account, which is interesting to me. People who had had a Clickfunnels account, but had canceled. People who had had a Clickfunnels account, but it was paused and then there\u2019s people also who are Clickfunnels members, but the majority of people who bought were people who had exited, who had left, isn\u2019t that crazy?</p> <p>So somehow or another they came in, they had used it, they drank the kool-aide and decided they didn\u2019t like it and they left or whatever. Then this campaign got them re-fired up and re-excited and re-bought into the vision of Clickfunnels and Funnel hacking and that kind of thing. Our one big fear is, is it going to cannibalize our MRR? So for software, the metric that drives all of the focus is MRR which stands for Monthly recurring revenue, so every month we\u2019re watching that number increase and grow and trying to keep it a very steady path or percentage. We\u2019re trying to keep the consistency, so our big fear is, man if everyone who is a CLickfunnels member takes this, because when you buy the software you Clickfunnels Backpack and Actionetics free for six months. That could kill our MRR if everyone buys it.</p> <p>But what\u2019s cool is it didn\u2019t, it actually spiked our MRR because more people were coming in. Plus, yesterday for example, was Sunday, so we had queued up two emails for Sunday, and we sold a lot of funnel hacks packages, but we also had over a thousand people who created Clickfunnels accounts yesterday. So not only did it get people to buy upfront, people who didn\u2019t buy upfront, it got them sold on Clickfunnels, they went and created an account anyway. Isn\u2019t that crazy?</p> <p>So there\u2019s all this lift that happens from that, from the live event, from a promotion like that to your own existing customers. Anyway, I thought it was really interesting, so my moral of the story for you all who are listening, those of you guys who have been doing what we have talked about since last year, where you\u2019re doing a webinar every single week, go back to your list of these webinar people and do a webinar to all of them. \u201cBut Russell, they already heard about the webinar, they already saw it.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter, now they\u2019re ready and prepared to take this journey with you, when they might not have been before.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, one thing that kind of puts it in perspective for me, I have a friend in the dating market, his name is John Alanis and he spoke at, he\u2019s the one that actually taught me the whole attractive character stuff, he\u2019s awesome. And he spoke at Daegan Smith and I had an event a little while ago called the Invisible Funnel. At that event he spoke probably three or four hours about the attractive character and he was showing us his email marketing strategy and, it\u2019s funny when I first met him he was emailing his list twice a day and trying to convince me to do that. I never got to that point yet. I still get paranoid.</p> <p>I got to a point where I started emailing at least once a day, most days. So that\u2019s kind of where it started with, but then he, at that event, he showed how he emails his list 9 times a day now through different personalities and personas. I was like, 9 times a day! That\u2019s crazy. Why would you do that. He said, \u201cRussell, you gotta understand. My men, they are on my list for entertainment purposes only. Most of them got girlfriends, they joined, they\u2019re interested, they want to learn stuff, we have a good time hanging out. It\u2019s not until somebody breaks their heart that they need my thing. When their girlfriend breaks up with them, that\u2019s when what I sell actually matters. I gotta make sure that second that that happens that I am at the top of their inbox. If it happens at noon and someone else is at the top of their inbox, they\u2019re buying that guys stuff. So I gotta keep emailing consistently so whenever the breakup happens, whenever the heartbreak, whenever that pain happens, that\u2019s when you want to be at the top of mine.\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019m not that aggressive, but think about it. People buy your product because they\u2019re in pain at that time, or there\u2019s a need for them at that time, that might not have been there the first time that they registered. When they registered, they came through and were like, \u201cThat sounds kind of cool.\u201d But they didn\u2019t take action for some reason. The second time around is when they\u2019re like, \u201cWow, this should and must become a must.\u201d And so you never know when you\u2019re going to hit thme, so it\u2019s just being consistent in your messaging and you\u2019ll find people when they\u2019re ready.</p> <p>There you go guys, I\u2019m at the office. Going to go hang out with James Frill, get some Trello on. James Friel, AKA mister Trello. I hope that\u2019s the name he\u2019s still going with because he was going to get an image done and everything. I\u2019m really excited.

My second podcast in one night because I love you guys so much. I got to the office, had an incredible time going through all the cool stuff I was sharing with you guys, with the team and getting it built into the book and then working on Funnel Hacker TV. It\u2019s so exciting, so many fun things happening.</p> <p>I wanted to come back and check in with you. I\u2019m driving home right now. It is snowing, it\u2019s incredibly cold, I forgot to wear a coat because I\u2019m a genius and I\u2019m driving about 1 mile an hour because my car does not do well in the snow. This way, we\u2019re all hanging out so if I die or something I can let you know to let my family know how much I love them. So that\u2019s the game plan, no, just kidding. The nice thing is that the drive to my house from the office is all back roads. That\u2019s why I do Marketing In Your Car is because there\u2019s no fear of scariness.</p> <p>For all of you guys that yell at me every once in a while, \u201cRussell, don\u2019t do the podcast while you\u2019re driving, you\u2019re going to kill the baby animals.\u201d Or whatever.\u00a0 So do not worry, it\u2019s all good.</p> <p>So with that said, I just offended half of my audience. I will repent by sharing some magic, cool stuff for your guys if that\u2019s okay. So earlier I talked about the Hero\u2019s two journeys and hopefully got you guys some cool ideas and thoughts on that. Now I want to talk about the conflict, the piece in the middle.</p> <p>So the conflict is what creates the emotion for the story and its key. I\u2019ve been working off of this epiphany bridge script, which has been good. It\u2019s working awesome. But I think tonight I\u2019m going to rebuild that and tie it more into this because when I saw this piece of it we started looking at it like it\u2019s insane, so cool.</p> <p>If you\u2019re vision, you should all do this along with me, picture you\u2019re one of my sketches from my book. The top of your sketch write out the 5 turning points of conflict. Underneath it we\u2019re going to have 1,2,3 and then underneath that 4 and 5. There\u2019s kind of\u2026.didn\u2019t fit 5 across in a big line, at least with all the text I have.</p> <p>If you look at any story, the back story happens. We get to know the character, we fall in love with them and we\u2019ve got this relationship. Then they physically leave their location, they\u2019re about the leave something and the first thing they do when they leave, the reason why they leave, they\u2019re introduced or given a new opportunity, which is actually really symbolic. If you start listening to my old podcasts and talked about this whole new opportunity thing and building your culture and building a following. So the character gets a new opportunity, that\u2019s turning point number one. It\u2019s like Lightning McQueen gets this shot to go race again for first place.</p> <p>What are other movies. Rocky gets this opportunity to fight Apollo Creed, in every one there\u2019s this opportunity that happens. So they physically leave wherever they\u2019re at and they\u2019re going to this new place for this new opportunity. It\u2019s hard to read my handwriting here while I\u2019m driving. But they\u2019re moving to a new situation. So that\u2019s the first turning point of conflict. This new opportunity that\u2019s presented to them and then they move to a new situation.</p> <p>The first situation is all about getting climatized, figure this thing out, it\u2019s kind of cool. And then all the sudden in the second turning point of conflict happens. This is called the change of plan. Number two is the change of plan where it\u2019s like, I thought I was going here for this thing, but then there was this change of plan, so something changed.</p> <p>So Lightning McQueen was leaving to go, hopefully I can pull out all the stories while I\u2019m doing this all at the same time\u2026..so Lightning McQueen is going on this journey to California to race but then there\u2019s this change of plans and he\u2019s stuck in Radiator Springs and now he\u2019s gotta figure out how to get out of this situation. There\u2019s always a change of plans.</p> <p>My potato gun story. My first opportunity was I can sell things on the internet and started doing that and it\u2019s awesome making money. Then all the sudden Google slaps me and there\u2019s a change of plans. So I had to change my plans and move things around and then we start making progress within this new realm that was different than we thought it was going to be. So the progress happens, which then brings us to turning point of conflict number 3, which is called the point of no return.</p> <p>Now, every story, the hero comes to a spot, a point of no return. They\u2019re sitting there and they can either go forward or they go back to their old life. And it happens in all of the movies. Where Nemo\u2019s got to decide\u2026not Nemo but the dad is going to decide, am I really going to go after Nemo or am I going to go back? This is a scary journey, am I really going to do this or not?</p> <p>Michael Hauge talked about the movie The Firm, I\u2019ve never seen the movie but I read the book in high school. And in that scene that the guy, the lawyer, he has an opportunity to work in the best law practice in the world and he gets in there and figures out, this might not be what I think it is. These guys are actually bad guys. And all the sudden it comes to this point of no return, he\u2019s got two options. The FBI\u2019s contacting him saying look, you\u2019re working for the mafia and you can help us take them down, and he\u2019s got to decide. Do I go with the FBI? Do I take down this law firm that I thought was my future, or do I go back to the law firm and make money off the mob and know that things are wrong and that his point of no return he has to decide one way or the other. That\u2019s he\u2019s with the good guys or the bad guys.</p> <p>Every story\u2019s got that, the point of no return. They\u2019ve got to make the choice and finally they make the choice and as they do that, then it adds this whole new level and layer of complexity and complication and increases the stakes. Now it\u2019s like, alright you picked the FBI, now you\u2019ve got to take down the firm. Whatever the story, it\u2019s the point of no return. That\u2019s where they\u2019ve got to go to the next part of the story. Going through this thing, new higher stakes, and then what happens, typically, is that you hit turning point number 4, which is the major setback.</p> <p>This is where you hit something that\u2019s like, you\u2019ve got this plan, everything you are focusing on and all the sudden all is lost. You get this setback and the thing you\u2019ve been trying to do is no longer possible, it\u2019s gone. All hope is lost, it\u2019s gone. You have no more opportunity for that thing. All of the sudden there\u2019s this one little glimmer of light that\u2019s like, the only way this can actually work is if this thing happens.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, Michael Hauge when he was talking about conflict, the conflict has to be so insurmountable that it\u2019s almost impossible, otherwise people won\u2019t care. The thing has to be so huge that it\u2019s impossible because that\u2019s what creates the emotion. That\u2019s what makes the desire, that\u2019s what gets us excited and buying into the character. So right here is kind of the last thing. Everything is going along and it\u2019s been harder and harder and all the sudden it\u2019s like boom, this new setback and it\u2019s like, I can\u2019t win. There\u2019s no way I can win, it\u2019s physically impossible. Unless\u2026.then there\u2019s this little glimmer of hope, unless somehow I can get to that. But that\u2019s not possible. The odds of that are almost zero, but you have to look at that and say, well we have to do one last shot. This is our final stand.</p> <p>So that transitions you to the final push, which pushes you to turning point number 5 which is the climax of the event, which is boom. Here\u2019s this huge thing that\u2019s about to happen, the climax. And that is usually the end of the story. The big thing happens, Lightning McQueen does the race. The climax you can win, you can lose, it depends. But the climax is usually where, again it\u2019s the death and the rebirth of what we talked about last episode, which is the death of their faults and beliefs and the rebirth of the new person. And it\u2019s at the climax. They become who they\u2019re supposed to become.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the last big turning point, the climax. Then after that, the movie has to show the aftermath. Because the aftermath does a couple of things. First off, it shows us that the hero completed their journey. They got what they were actually looking for. They may not have won what they wanted. Rocky didn\u2019t beat Apollo Creed in the first one, but he accomplished it, that\u2019s when Adrien runs out. Adrien, Rocky I love you. That\u2019s the aftermath, we saw that he hit his goal, so we feel complete as the viewers of it. You see who they\u2019ve become, you see that they were able to cast off this identity they had and become something different. And they have new beliefs and new faith in themselves. And that\u2019s what the aftermath\u2019s all about and to kind of wrap up the story.</p> <p>So isn\u2019t that cool? I know it\u2019s kind of hard to hear through a podcast and it\u2019s easier when you read it, so that\u2019s why you gotta get the book when it comes out, because it\u2019ll make more sense. You can see the diagrams and the graphs. But it\u2019s cool, the five turning points of conflict.</p> <p>Turning point number one is the opportunity that they take. Turning point number two is the change in plan. Turning point number three is the point of no return. Number four is the major setback, and number 5 is the climax. Then there\u2019s a little arrow going between each of those ones. So the arrow from opportunity to the change of plans is called the new situation. Then we\u2019re going from the change of plans to the point of no return. The arrow\u2019s progress pushing to the point of no return. After they\u2019ve gone through that there\u2019s an arrow that says complication and higher stakes, that arrow pushes you to the major setback. Then there\u2019s an arrow that says final push that pushes you to the climax. And from there we have the aftermath.</p> <p>Oh crap. Sorry I\u2019m slipping a little bit. Someone slammed on their brakes in front of me. There you go the five turning points of conflict. So based on that, that\u2019s the overarching theme of all movies and most stories and novels and things like that. I\u2019m going to take the old epiphany bridge script that we\u2019ve been using up to this point and try to see how I could, if I could weave it into that. I was playing today with that. I was telling a bunch of my stories with this overlaying on it, and it was interesting with how much more full it made the stories, which is cool because I was thinking my potato gun story, which hopefully you\u2019ve heard a billion times by now, it\u2019s so annoying.</p> <p>But I told with the old epiphany bridge story, it worked but it wasn\u2019t quite emotionally impactful. So I laid this on top of it, I was like, \u201cOkay, what is the new opportunity for me?\u201d The new opportunity for me was, I wanted to make money and learn about internet marketing and selling information products, which lead me to this new situation where I created a potato gun product. Boom, boom, boom. Started making money selling it and life was good. All the sudden boom, I had this change of plans where Google slapped me and I wasn\u2019t profitable and I was like, crap.</p> <p>So I tried to figure out this new world. What do I do? I\u2019m making progress and trying different things and moving along and having a little bit of success here and there but a lot of things aren\u2019t working. All the sudden I come to number three, this point of no return, which is basically my wife who is supporting me is like, \u201chey, are you going to help support us or are you just going to be broke our whole lives?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201cyou either got to make this internet thing work or you gotta focus in school so you can get a job someday.\u201d I was like, oh there\u2019s my point of no return.</p> <p>So I was thinking, what do I do? I hate school, I\u2019m barely graduating. I\u2019m not going to get a good job. Or over here I can try this thing that\u2019s not work, but I love it and believe in it. I\u2019m at this point of no return and I say, screw it. I\u2019m not going to focus on school. I\u2019ll do enough so I can get my degree and I can wrestle but I\u2019m an internet marketer, this is who I am, who I want to become. So I transition and start trying to figure things out and so that\u2019s my point of no return. I start on this journey and then we\u2019re going through and let\u2019s see\u2026..</p> <p>So then we had a major setback, so then I\u2019m trying everything and nothing seems to work, I\u2019m about to give up and then all the sudden I get a call from my friend and he says, \u201cRussell, all my sites are failing. I just want to figure out this thing it\u2019s called an OTO, it\u2019s called Upsell.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat?\u201d there\u2019s a ray of hope, what if that worked. If that worked, holy cow that would change everything.</p> <p>So I\u2019m like, okay I gotta try it out. So I take this one last hail -mary pass and throw an OTO in there, turn my ads campaign back on and boom, it worked. We started selling products again profitably and things were good. And that was the climax, number 5. We start selling, profits coming in. Potato gun market\u2019s not huge but we learned the model and we start doing other businesses and now look at the aftermath and it\u2019s like holy cow.</p> <p>Because I did this thing called funnels, everything\u2019s amazing. And I\u2019m not sure on there, the internal and external. The journey of achievement is to be successful online, which I hit. And the second one is the journey of transformation. And I learned that it\u2019s not just trying to sell products and being transactional but creating experiences for people and its serving them at a higher level. That\u2019s the power of an upsell, the power of funnels. You\u2019re looking at your clients like, how do we actually change their lives? We do that through the process we take them through. When I discovered that it became everything.</p> <p>Now I focus on transformation and blah, blah, who knows\u2026. Anyway, there\u2019s me telling the story while I\u2019m holding my paper trying to go through the process. But do you see how more full that is. It\u2019s showing all this stuff.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that helps. I\u2019m almost home. If this didn\u2019t help and you\u2019re completely confused, I totally understand. Do not worry, the book will be out soon and you can read it in there and it\u2019ll make way more sense. The book eventually will be at expertsecrets.com, I think the page is blank right now, but someday it\u2019ll be there, if I finish it. So cross your fingers. That\u2019s what I got. Thanks everybody, we\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "14:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_279.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1481317242, "title": "Episode #278 \u2013 The Hero\u2019s Two Journeys", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Holy crap!

I love the snow, it\u2019s so much fun. I hope you guys are having a good time wherever you\u2019re at in the world. Some of you guys are probably super hot, on a beach hanging out, which is cool. For me, I\u2019m here driving in the snow. It\u2019s about 12:30 in the afternoon, I\u2019m going in late because I\u2019ve been writing, trying to get the book done. So I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time at home locked away. I\u2019m trying to get things done without people around me, and then I have to go and share the ideas because it gets the energy of everyone in our office, gets me fired up and gets me motivated to keep writing and creating.</p> <p>But it\u2019s kind of fun, the last three days, I was supposed to have the book done last week. Last 3 almost 4 days now, I\u2019ve been focusing on the one chapter and it\u2019s the epiphany bridge and if you listen to the podcast you hear me talk about the epiphany bridge and as I\u2019m explaining it\u2026\u2026it\u2019s tough because when you explain things live there\u2019s an easy way to do it. You guys have probably heard me explain the epiphany bridge on the podcast and I think most people probably got it. But as you\u2019re writing there\u2019s a lot of things you have to fill in because your audience may not have the context.</p> <p>When you guys are hanging out with me, we have context, we know\u2026..there\u2019s understanding you have when I share something it\u2019s like, \u201cOh that\u2019s how it fits in the context of all the stuff Russell\u2019s been sharing with me.\u201d But a book there\u2019s a vacuum where someone could be getting off a book shelf and have no idea who you are. There\u2019s more filling in between the lines you have to do.</p> <p>So the epiphany bridge, I could explain it easily, but to get the full impact that I need, I need more. I spent the first night, I can\u2019t remember if I told you or not, but I spent three hours studying the story just to get back into that state of how you actually tell a good story. What\u2019s the structure?</p> <p>And I think I mentioned there\u2019s a really good audio called the Hero\u2019s Two Journeys, by Michael Hauge and Chris Vogler teach the story. And Michael Hauge is like a consultant for script writer in Hollywood, and Chris Vogler does similar stuff for novelists. I kind of resonated a lot more with Michael Hauge, in fact Michael came and spoke at one of our events.</p> <p>Dayton Smith and I a couple of years ago taught this concept called the Hero\u2019s two journeys. And it\u2019s cool because I listened to the audio of it, and he spoke at our event. And he was, it was super awesome to see the story. You look at all movies and all books, they follow a very similar story structure, so that was fascinating back then, but I didn\u2019t really know how to apply it. I\u2019m not doing Hollywood productions or Hollywood movies, so how to this apply to our world? That was probably 5 or 6 years ago that he spoke at our event. It\u2019s been kind of up in the air for me for a long time.</p> <p>This week as I\u2019ve gone back through it, and I\u2019ve been looking at it and listening to it through a different lens. I have a structure with my epiphany bridge story, is it the same as the hero\u2019s two journeys? Is it different? What things am I missing that I should be bringing over? And it turned into this 4 day geek out session on Story, which has been so much fun. But now that it\u2019s happening, I\u2019m seeing this clear picture of\u2026\u2026it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to give Mike Hauge credit for a lot of this stuff because I\u2019m learning it again through him and I\u2019m trying to tweak it in a way that fits into my lens that I view the world through.\u00a0 But some cool things, and I\u2019ll share a couple of them and then I\u2019ll be out of\u2026probably wont have time to go through all of them.</p> <p>The cool thing is first off, talk about every good story, there\u2019s three core components. There\u2019s a character, then the desire of the character, where he\u2019s ggoing, the physical desire ( I need to go over there) then there\u2019s the conflict. So if you have those three you have a story.</p> <p>You have a character, little red riding hood. She has a desire, I want to take my grandma a bag of goodies. Then the conflict, the big bad wolf wants to eat her along the way. And that\u2019s the story and if you have those three elements, you\u2019ve got the story. The three core things.</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting is that typically as marketers, we look at the desire is where we try to create desire in people\u2019s minds. I want the big house or car or wherever this thing you want to get to is. I want to lose weight\u2026.we try to create desire in that. But what\u2019s interesting is in the story desire is not created by the desire, emotion is not created by the desire. The Desire, the emotion we want in a story, the emotion comes from the conflict. That\u2019s what people actually care about it. If there\u2019s no conflict people won\u2019t care about the story.</p> <p>If my story is that I woke up and drove to the office, there\u2019s no conflict there, nobody cares, it\u2019s boring. So the conflict is what creates emotion, which makes the story actually interesting. There\u2019s kind of that.</p> <p>We talk about characters, always the back story, and I\u2019ve kind of pulled out, there\u2019s about 5 or 6 ways you can build rapport with it, and with a character. In a movie they try to do those things prior to\u2026\u2026it\u2019s the first ten percent of the movie, so prior to the attractive character, or the character, or hero, whatever you want to call it, leaving on this journey. So you try to build rapport and usually it\u2019s happening in one spot.</p> <p>And about ten percent into the movie there\u2019s this thing\u00a0 that happens that usually physically they leave the location that they\u2019re at and go somewhere else. Frodo leaves the shire and he goes on this journey. What happens is there\u2019s always this visible desire we have called the Journey of accomplishment, the hero\u2019s first journey, the journey of accomplishment. I need to accomplish this thing. I gotta take the ring to Mordor and throw it in this lava pit. Every story\u2019s got that. There\u2019s this journey. That\u2019s the journey we\u2019re all watching and we\u2019re visible and we\u2019re aware and going with this character on this journey trying to help them achieve.</p> <p>But then there\u2019s also this second journey, that\u2019s why he calls it the hero\u2019s two journeys. And the second journey is not visible to the naked eye. We don\u2019t see it. Frodo\u2019s got to become a man, we don\u2019t see that piece of it. All we see is the desire of where they\u2019re trying to get to. And then the conflict that\u2019s happening along the way.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s fascinating, there\u2019s this second journey happening, and that second journey is the journey of transformation. The first journey is the journey of accomplishment, second journey is the journey of transformation, them becoming a different person.</p> <p>So if you look at the back story of the story, what\u2019s happening is that we\u2019re creating an identity that this character believes about themselves. It\u2019s all their old beliefs or all their current beliefs. They believe this and this and all these things that are important and have created their identity. And then they go on this journey of accomplishment and during the process they have this journey of transformation where this identity of who they think they are breaks away and these old beliefs fall off and then these new beliefs are born and it shifts from their identity to their essence.</p> <p>And essence is the key. That\u2019s where we want to get to, that essence of who we actually are and having the hero discover that during this journey. What\u2019s interesting is that in good stories the hero will accomplish the thing that they wanted to, that they went on this journey of accomplishment, they accomplish that thing. But then usually it doesn\u2019t matter. They throw it away or they don\u2019t care because the real journey was this journey of transformation, where the character became something more.</p> <p>So as I was, yesterday as I came to the office I started geeking out, so I mapped out on a whiteboard and showed the whole thing to a bunch of guys on my team. I was explaining it all to them and then everyone was kind of like, \u201cGive me an example of this journey of transformation.\u201d And I was thinking and all the sudden it popped in my head and I remember this story of Cars.</p> <p>So Cars is, we just watched it on the Disney Cruise with my kids like 25 times, so it\u2019s top of my brain right now. Lightning McQueen is this hero. There\u2019s this back story, we hear all this stuff, he almost wins the Piston cup, there\u2019s a three-way tie, so now they\u2019re gonna race. So now he\u2019s got to leave, he\u2019s physically leaving this spot.</p> <p>During the back story we understood his identity, what\u2019s important. He\u2019s a rookie, He\u2019s in line to win the piston cup, blah, blah. We also see his character flaws, we find out before he leaves on his journey that he doesn\u2019t have any friends, even Harv, his manager, he thinks is his friend isn\u2019t actually his friend, he doesn\u2019t even like him.</p> <p>He\u2019s getting in this car and we realize that he\u2019s actually\u2026there\u2019s this pain that he has and he doesn\u2019t know who he is. He\u2019s going to win this thing and that\u2019s his identity. He has to win the Piston cup or else he\u2019s a failure in life. He\u2019s gonna be the first rookie ever, so he jumps into the\u2026\u2026Harv, they start on this physical journey. Leaving the current location for somewhere else. The desire for him is to go to California to win the Piston cup. That\u2019s the visual goal we all see. Then what happens, Harv falls asleep, he falls out of the car, gets stuck in Radiator Spring and that introduces conflict. And all this conflict starts happening. And through this conflict he becomes a different person.</p> <p>Then what happens is the end of the story he gets the ability to go accomplish his desires. So he leaves Radiator Springs, he goes to the race, gets in the thing, doing this race and has this opportunity to win. He\u2019s out there racing the track and goes through and it comes down to the last minutes of the race. He\u2019s going through and passes everybody and he\u2019s in the front and he has become the victor, he\u2019s gonna win. His desires that he\u2019s been trying to accomplish this entire movie, the whole journey of accomplishment is now his, he owns it. And then all the sudden Chick Hicks hits the King\u2019s wheel and the king flips up, boom, boom, boom, car wrecks. Smashes everything and he looks up and as he\u2019s about to cross the finish line he looks up and sees in the monitor he sees the King destroyed.</p> <p>And he remembers the story about Doc and him being destroyed and all the sudden he realizes in that moment, he changes. And he realizes that this journey of accomplishment, things he\u2019s trying to accomplish, does not actually matter. And he throws it away, slams on his breaks and stops an inch in front of the finish line and he sits there and Chick Hicks flies past him and wins the race. And then what does he do? He backs up, goes back and finds the King, goes behind him and he starts pushing the King to the finish line. The King says something to him. He says, \u201cWhat are you doing, Rookie? You realize you just threw away the Piston Cup?\u201d and then this is where we had this glimpse of the transformation Lightning McQueen had. He said, \u201cYou know an old race car once told me, all it is, is an empty cup.\u201d And he pushes the king through the finish line and the story\u2026..the hero\u2019s second journey, that transformation, he accomplished it. He became somebody more. Something different, something better.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that amazing. And it\u2019s like, that is the story line for movies. It\u2019s the hero\u2019s two journeys. And when you see it, it starts becoming so clear that all these, every movie there\u2019s this external journey, the external desire they are going for, but then there\u2019s this internal journey that happens and I want you to think about this for yourself. Because, we\u2019ll get more when you get the book, it\u2019ll explain how this fits into the epiphany bridge and all that stuff.</p> <p>But for a lot of us, that\u2019s our life. We all get into whatever we\u2019re doing because we have this thing. I got into wrestling because I wanted to be, at first a state champ, I wanted to be a national champ. Here\u2019s my journey of achievement. That was all I lived, thought about. That was the only thing that mattered. I went on this journey and hit my state champ, I became an All American and went to college and my last goal was to become an All American in college. My whole life, everything rode on this journey, I was going on this thing, and I didn\u2019t hit it. I fell short, I didn\u2019t even qualify for the national tournament my senior year, fell short. And it was over.</p> <p>And I didn\u2019t get my thing that I\u2019d been trying to achieve. But then for me as a person, I stepped back and I looked and I said, \u201cWhat happened in the last 12 years of me pursuing this dream?\u201d what was the journey of transformation for me? Who did I become because of that? If I didn\u2019t go on this journey, even though I didn\u2019t hit my desire, even if I would have hit my desire, what was put in my path? Who did I meet? How did I change who I am? How did I become someone different, someone better because of that?</p> <p>If I hadn\u2019t gone on that journey where would I be today? It would have been a whole different trajectory. But the journey of transformation happened because I was chasing that desire. So let\u2019s get into business, want to make money, that\u2019s the desire but then what happens along the way? Holy cow, you feel, you realize and this is true for me, you realize that the things you create actually have an impact on people and it can change their life. And suddenly it shifts from I need to make money to how can I have an impact? A transformation, that\u2019s the switch.</p> <p>That\u2019s why there\u2019s so many people who go through weight loss, this desire to lose weight and in the process they\u2019ve learned something about themselves. And they have so much passion about it and they want to share it with other people and that\u2019s why they become trainers and coaches and experts and all these crazy things.</p> <p>It\u2019s so fascinating. It\u2019s in movies, in life. All over the place, the hero\u2019s two journeys. It\u2019s excited. So that\u2019s what I got for you guys to you. I\u2019m almost to the office. I have more that I want to share, but I\u2019ll have to save it for another podcast. Maybe I\u2019ll do it on the drive home tonight because I have the paper right here. The next thing I\u2019m looking at is the conflict. How do you break down the actual conflict that\u2019s happening inside of this story. The hero\u2019s, after he\u2019s left home, he\u2019s going through this thing, what are the levels of the conflict. I actually have it sketched out right here; it\u2019ll be in the new book. I\u2019m calling it the Five Turning Points of Conflict, and it\u2019s awesome. So maybe I\u2019ll share that tonight or whenever the next podcast comes out. Least that\u2019s the game plan. If not, then go read my book because it will be in there for sure.</p> <p>I hope that is exciting for you guys, gets you a little pumped up about story and thinking through that as you\u2019re telling your stories. Because the end of the day no one really cares if the hero achieves the accomplishment. The audience cares that the hero becomes something and gets the journey of achievement, or the journey of transformation. That\u2019s what we actually root for. That\u2019s how we fall in love with characters. Rocky part 1, Rocky didn\u2019t win. But who did he become? That\u2019s why we love Rocky. Alright, I\u2019m at the office, guys. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day. I\u2019ll talk to you guys probably later on tonight. Alright, bye.</p>", "duration": "15:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_278.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1481232185, "title": "Episode #277 \u2013 The Model For The Next 12 Months- Part 2", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Final Clickfunnels webinar?</p> <p>On this extra long episode Russell talks about doing a webinar for Clickfunnels today, and why it\u2019s the last time. He talks about where he was a year ago, and how things have changed for Clickfunnels in that year.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things you will hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell thinks doing a webinar a week for your business is still a must, but why his business is different.</li> <li>What revelation led to The Expert Secrets book and the possibility of doing an infomercial with Dean Graziosi.</li> <li>And what you can expect to see with Clickfunnels when things change in January.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear what kind of changes are coming for Clickfunnels in 2017 and why.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson I want to welcome you guys back to Marketing In Your Car. Now, it\u2019s funny I get people all the time that ask me what microphone I use due to its amazing audio quality, and it\u2019s just my phone. I don\u2019t do microphones, I just hold it and talk into it. I figured if I had to get a microphone set up I never would have done it. I just want to be able to do these whenever I want to. Whenever I want, so I need at least the most simple, easy setup possible and that\u2019s how we did this, which is really cool.</p> <p>I actually just got a brand new iPhone, so this is my first time recording on this new iPhone, which I\u2019m kind of excited about. With that said, it snowed last night, if you follow me on Snapchat\u2026.I may be killing Snapchat, I haven\u2019t decided yet, but it\u2019s kind of frustrating but it\u2019s also kind of fun. I may be moving it over to Instagram Stories or something, I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>But we went, half my kids are out in the snow playing in it. Norah and me were in the hot tub, it was really fun. Then the kids want the fireplace on, so I ran in my bare feet in the snow to turn the fireplace, it was some good times, but I survived it and lived to tell the story.</p> <p>Today is exciting day because today is webinar day. We\u2019re doing a webinar, I was doing the stats, 4500 people registered. What? Which is going to be exciting. It\u2019s funny, we\u2019re getting towards the end of the year now and I want to share a message that\u2019ll loop back to the beginning of this year. For those of you who have been listening to the Marketing In Your Car podcast, if you haven\u2019t been, go and binge listen to all of them and catch up because there are some important things you\u2019re missing. Just kidding, kind of.</p> <p>There was a podcast I did, I think in January. I was driving home and it was snowy as well. I think it was called the business model for the next twelve months. So if you go to marketinginyourcar.com and search on the page for business model, or twelve months, it should pull up and you listen to it. But I walk through a challenge I give to everyone, that basically do a live webinar every single week for the next twelve months and transform your life and business and it\u2019ll be amazing.</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting is that, as I\u2019ve been saying that over and over and over again, very few people have. Surprise, surprise. But the people that have are doing some amazing things. Some are speaking at Funnel Hacking Live, some are doing different things. One of them, I\u2019m going to brag, I hope they don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m sure that they\u2019re probably listening to this, but Brandon and Kaelin Poulin are examples of people who just, every time I\u2019m like, \u201cHey you should do this.\u201d Just do it and it\u2019s amazing. And last month, and they\u2019re in the weight loss space, they sell $147 product and you might think, well how much can someone make doing a webinar a week every single week for a year? And I tell you it compounds. It\u2019s a compounding interest game.</p> <p>I remember some famous guy said something about compounding interest, which was cool, but I don\u2019t remember the quote or the actual concept behind compounding interest. I only know how to sell stuff. But it\u2019s the same thing I think. It compounds. Just to put into perspective, when I met them at Funnel Hacking Live, they were doing about $100,000 a month that was in March or April, whenever Funnel Hacking Live was. Then they joined Inner Circle and kept doing it, and kept compounding and compounding.</p> <p>November, I actually sent an email out the other day, I was like they did almost half a million dollars in November. And Brandon messaged me back, \u201cWhat? We passed 600 grand in November.\u201d\u00a0 So I want to put it in perspective for you. $600,000 selling a $147 information product in the weight loss industry. That\u2019s the power of what we\u2019re talking about, this compounding interest, this compounding effect of consistently doing the same thing over and over and over and over again. And I\u2019ve shared it with some of my friends, people who are successful, I had one friend I won\u2019t mention his name. A great marketer and super cool guy, and his company has been stuck at about $3 million dollars a year for a couple of years.</p> <p>Which is funny, for some reason, I was stuck at 3 million a year for a long time, that was my sticking point. There\u2019s different sticking points, for me to break a million dollars was really hard, took me four or five years in a row, I was trying to break a million dollars from January 1<sup>st</sup> to December 31<sup>st</sup>, and I missed it multiple years in a row by a couple tens of thousands of dollars, like 20 or 30 thousand dollars. There\u2019s some mental block, and after I broke that I shot to 3 million and stuck there for a long time. Could never really break through that, in fact, I broke through it one time, when we built a big company up and had a huge staff, but our profits were horrible, then we shut that down and I was stuck at 3 million again for 3 or 4 years consistently, could not break that mental barrier.</p> <p>What changed it for me was that transition to selling a lot of different product, because that\u2019s the mindset of marketers, I gotta create the next big thing, to make more money to how do I make something consistent that I just keep pushing people through. For me it was the webinar. We did the webinar and I committed to our team, because everyone\u2026.it\u2019s funny, when we launched Clickfunnels, a lot of my friends, and I saw it in forums, in Facebook groups, people were like, \u201cClickfunnels looks cool, but it\u2019s Russell\u2019s flavor of the week. I don\u2019t want to move my whole platform and then next week he\u2019s on to a new thing.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cCrap, I have to show people that I\u2019m serious about this. This is the future, this is my focus.\u201d So a lot of my friends actually, didn\u2019t sign up for a year and half to two years because of that. They were afraid I was going to move on, because that was my pattern. That\u2019s all of our patterns. We do something initially to build a big audience of people. Then the way we start making money is create new things to sell to them. And that\u2019s part of the strategy, there\u2019s value in that, but what\u2019s more valuable is creating a front end offer that\u2019s evergreen, consistent, that you\u2019re always driving people into. There\u2019s a consistent message, consistent onboard, everyone comes through the same channel, buying the same thing, understanding the same concepts, then as you\u2019re building your culture and all these other things, come off of that.</p> <p>So I started doing these one things consistently, that was kind of my promise to Dylan and Todd initially, \u201cThis is going to be my focus, don\u2019t worry guys. I\u2019m not chasing the next shiny object. We\u2019re going to focus on this.\u201d It took me three months before we figured out how to sell it right. We had multiple failed product launches initially. Then we figured out the webinar was how we were going to sell it, and it worked.</p> <p>We did the webinar over and over. And I did the webinar every week for almost a year, probably more than that. Some days I would do two to three webinars in a day, which is a lot. I don\u2019t know if I could handle that nowadays. When we first got started, that\u2019s what I was doing. I\u2019d do a webinar and get off, then do another one and get off. If you do it, those of you who have done a webinar, a two hour webinar, it drains you. All your energy is going into it, and to do two or a couple times three in a day, it was tough. But I was learning my message, finding my voice, understanding where people were getting stuck, perfecting it and going over and over.</p> <p>And the nice thing about doing it live is it gets everyone on your staff and team focused on this thing. This last year, we had so much success and the webinars were kind of shifted over to automated webinar, and that\u2019s been running for most of this year, so I haven\u2019t been doing them live that much this year. But I paid my dues, so it\u2019s okay for me. For you guys, you gotta pay your dues first then you can. After you\u2019ve done it 50 or 60 times live, you\u2019re allowed to automate it.</p> <p>So we automated it a lot this year, it\u2019s been good, a consistent stream of money, but it hasn\u2019t been this big focal point. So we wanted to do one big last hurrah, which is happening today in a couple of hours, to do the funnel hacks webinars. So we did a big push and got 4500 people on it. 4500 people means we\u2019ll get a thousand on the webinar. We consistently close 20 percent, that means 200, so we\u2019re looking at probably 150-200 thousand dollars live on the webinar. And then from replays we should double that. Gets us to 3 or 4, but then we\u2019ll also have a big urgency and scarcity scare since this is the last time we\u2019ll be doing this webinar, in fact we\u2019re doubling the price of this offer and changing the webinar as a whole coming into the new year.</p> <p>So there\u2019s a lot of built in urgency and scarcity. So my guess, we\u2019ll probably end up with 5 or 6 hundred thousand from this in immediate sales, but the lift from that is huge as well, because even people that don\u2019t buy, now they are indoctrinated into our process. They sign up for Clickfunnels, they start buying the books, all the other pieces start happening and there\u2019s so many big benefits that come from the consistency of the webinar.</p> <p>So I just wanted to kind of circle back to when we talked about, almost a year ago, and get back to that. Like I said, my friend who\u2019s stuck at $3 million I told him, \u201cThis is the model. You gotta do a webinar every single week.\u201d He was like, \u201cI can\u2019t write a new webinar every single week.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, you do the same webinar every single week.\u201d He was like, \u201cI can\u2019t do the same webinar every week, my audience will get tired of it.\u201d I was like, \u201cExactly, that means you gotta bring in a new audience.\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo, that won\u2019t work. We make our money by creating new things, and it takes me a couple of months to create a new thing.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re stuck at 3 million dollars, because you can\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s a hard, hard road to grow past that until you find\u2026\u2026</p> <p>I know that, from a decade, ten years of me trying that and launching and re-launching. No, focus on creating a front end, it becomes so amazing, good, and powerful that you can consistently bring new blood in that brings new blood in.</p> <p>The second half is that you\u2019ll find these businesses that are stuck at 2 or 3 million dollars a year. Usually after a year or two of that they start getting atrophy and it starts shrinking and there\u2019s usually a couple of reasons. One is the entrepreneur is burned out of creating new offers. Number two the audience starts shrinking. I don\u2019t know what it is, we all get good at bringing in an audience initially, and then we have it and we stop focusing on that. We\u2019ve gotta be focusing consistently on new leads coming in. It\u2019s a life blood of your business, even if you don\u2019t want to grow, just want to maintain, it\u2019s essential to have.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, I have been listening to an old course, an old Kennedy, actually Bill Glazer course, it\u2019s called Think and Grow Rich for Renegade Entrepreneurs, or something like that. I found it somewhere. So I\u2019ve been listening to that and the firs thing he talked about is renegade entrepreneurs thinking to grow rich is that they all have a focus on consistent new lead generation. No matter how good their business is doing, they are always focusing on consistent new leads coming in.</p> <p>As I move into this new year, we are changing the webinar offer. We\u2019re changing the pricing. We\u2019re doing a lot of cool things inside of Clickfunnels and how we sell it, but I\u2019m not going to be doing this webinar anymore. So for me it\u2019s like, what\u2019s the new horizon? What are we shifting to?</p> <p>I still recommend for 99.9% of all business, the focal point should be a front end webinar. In fact, we will still have webinars that are selling on the front end. But for me, I think I\u2019ve talked about this with you guys before, my whole goal now, we just passed, it\u2019s crazy. This week we passed 25 thousand active customers inside of Clickfunnels. That\u2019s not people who signed up and left, that\u2019s people who are actively being billed, happily. It\u2019s\u2026..we never thought we would get to that. We talked about that, \u201cOh yeah, when we have 100,000 customers\u2026\u201d but we never thought that was a real thing. But a little over two years in we\u2019re at 25 thousand active customers, which is crazy.</p> <p>So for us, it\u2019s like how do we expand that market? How do we get it bigger? We can keep doing it through webinars, and we will, but I think for me and my business, and again, I\u2019m not saying this for all businesses, because I do not think this is across the board, but for Clickfunnels to grow\u2026.we\u2019ll continue to grow in the channels we are, people that have existing businesses that need a funnel, but the big opportunity for me and our team is, and it\u2019s funny because a year and a half ago when I started down this project, for new customer acquisition, how do we keep the fuel in the pump? It was funny, we were looking at, trying to figure out, what\u2019s the offer I create so that all small businesses will start using Clickfunnels?</p> <p>I was stuck for 3 or 4 four months, trying to think through that, trying to figure things out. And it\u2019s funny, I may have told this story before, if not it\u2019s worth telling again. So you guys may hear it twice. A year and a half ago I had joined Joe Polish\u2019s 25k group and the night before the first meeting, I got invited by some cool people to come to this little dinner party. It had about ten people in it, so I come to this dinner party and Dave Woodward came with me to the trip, but he wasn\u2019t able to come to the dinner. And prior to that Dave and I were talking about it, \u201cHow do I create, a book I need to write, or is it a webinar? What do we need to do to penetrate and get all of small businesses to start using Clickfunnels? And we\u2019re thinking through it and thinking through it. And it\u2019s funny how when your brain is on something how things just open up.</p> <p>So I\u2019m at this dinner and sitting across the table from me is Dean Graziosi and Dean is someone I\u2019ve always looked up to and he\u2019s been on TV for 15 years selling his books. I think he\u2019s probably sold more books through direct response marketing than any other human on earth. The person who might be closest is Kevin Trudeau but he\u2019s in jail right now so I\u2019m not going to work with him. But Dean\u2019s the best, and he does things in a really clean way that aren\u2019t cheesy, that aren\u2019t like the dirty stuff.</p> <p>And I\u2019m sitting across, looking at Dean and we\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t even know, something unrelated, and as we\u2019re talking I had this epiphany, I don\u2019t know, I look at it probably more like a revelation from Heaven, but who knows, whatever it is. That thing that is like, \u201cRussell, you are going to be writing a book, you\u2019re not going to be targeting small business owners, that\u2019ll take care of itself. You have to expand the market and the book you\u2019re going to write is going to be called Expert Secrets.\u201d I own that domain, but that was never in my vision to write a book called that. \u201cThe book\u2019s going to be called Expert Secrets and somehow Dean\u2019s going to write an infomercial for you.\u201d I\u2019m sitting there listening to Dean talk about his kids or whatever, and I was like, \u201cWhat? Did I just hear that right, because I don\u2019t know if that makes any logical sense whatsoever. Then my brain comes back and its like, it doesn\u2019t need to. I was like, alright cool.</p> <p>All I had was this little glimpse, \u201cOkay, you are writing a book called Expert Secret, it\u2019s going to help you expand the market and Dean\u2019s going to write an infomercial.\u201d I\u2019m like, okay do I tell Dean that he\u2019s writing an infomercial for me? No, don\u2019t tell him, he\u2019ll think you\u2019re weird. It\u2019s like on a first date, I think this is my wife, should I tell her? No, don\u2019t tell her on the first date, hold that in. That\u2019s how I kind of felt. So that was kind of the beginning of it.</p> <p>So I went back that night to the hotel room and I saw Dave and I was like, \u201cDave, I\u2019m writing a book, it\u2019s called Expert Secrets and the whole goal is to expand the market.\u201d And he\u2019s like \u201cI got chills. Yes, we need to do that.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAlright.\u201d So Julie, who is my writer, helps me with my writing projects, I voxed her that night. \u201cOkay Julie, I\u2019m writing another book.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYou said you were never writing a book ever again.\u201d I was like, \u201cI know, we\u2019re doing it anyway. I\u2019m wiring you some money, give me the info again.\u201d That night. I wire her and then I start writing this book and we start going down this process and I have no idea how all these pieces are going to take place, I just know that it\u2019s supposed to. So I\u2019m going to start running that direction.</p> <p>So we start running. Some of you might already know I wrote the whole book and then this summer I was editing it and trying to get it ready for the publisher and I realized that I hated the book. So on Snapchat I highlighted all 250 pages of it and deleted it. Messaged Julie and said, \u201cWe\u2019re writing a new book.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cWhat? We just wrote a book.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re writing the same book again, but this one is going to be way better.\u201d And started over, I\u2019d been working on that project, in fact, today I finished Secret number 7, which is chapter number 7. For some reason I have to name everything secrets, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, I just like secrets better than chapters, so whatever.</p> <p>And the book is legitimately, I\u2019m so proud of it. I can\u2019t even\u2026.so proud of it, so excited to share it with everybody. It\u2019s gonna change a lot of lives. Change how people look and view how we sell and how we influence and how we can affect people\u2019s lives. So it\u2019s gonna be awesome.</p> <p>And then I\u2019m in Genius Network, I go to that\u2026.Excuse me, now I\u2019m going to rewind back. This is the next morning after hanging out with Dean, I\u2019m in the genius network and I love Joe and Genius Network\u2026..Just the way that\u2026..I\u2019m not a super huge fan of some of the way that\u2026\u2026.I\u2019ll leave it there.</p> <p>I\u2019m out in the hallway talking to Jason Fladlien. Jason\u2019s a big mentor of mine and I\u2019v e learned some things about belief that\u2026.I was telling him the last time we were hanging out, \u201cDo you realize those things you told me about belief have changed my whole life.\u201d He was like, \u201c I don\u2019t remember talking to you about that.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally? It was a really big deal to me.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t remember that.\u201d It was funny.</p> <p>I was talking to Jason and I told him we had launched a certification program, I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d He was like, \u201cWhy would you shut it down.\u201d I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s not working.\u201d And we tried to talk through it and we were going to shut it down, and he was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find some rock star to run it for you?\u201d and then I was thinking, if I can find the right person, then yes I would do it. But I don\u2019t see that vision.</p> <p>Then a couple of days later, we\u2019re sitting in a room talking about shutting down the certification program and all the sudden, I can\u2019t remember who it was, but someone mentioned Norah and all of us in the room got chills, it was like, yes, she is the right person. She will take this to the next level. Norah is that person. We called her up, begged her and she came in and built the certification program. And what\u2019s interesting, the certification program, we\u2019re certifying all these amazing people now who were building funnels\u2026</p> <p>I just pulled up and Steven is looking through the office window in a Santa hat, waving at me going crazy and saying Webinar Day.</p> <p>Anyway, this certification program is certifying all these amazing people who are now going and penetrating getting funnels into local businesses, which is cool because I was trying to figure out how to get that, how to go that direction and it didn\u2019t make any sense. Now I know that those markets will be filled through the certification program, which is so cool to now see the vision later.</p> <p>So we\u2019re working on the book, go to the next Genius Network, and I went to the last one and I was like I was not planning on re-upping, so I was like, it\u2019s been good and I like it but it wasn\u2019t what I needed right now in my business. The night before the last meeting, Dean\u2019s like, \u201cHey come to my office.\u201d So I swing over to his office and we talk for a bit. He shows me his infomercial studio, I\u2019m sitting in this thing and I\u2019m like, this is where he\u2019s going to be filming an infomercial for me, but he doesn\u2019t know that yet, how do I not awkwardly bring it up? \u201cHey man, just so you know you\u2019re building an infomercial in this studio.\u201d \u00a0It was pretty cool.</p> <p>And then, I was talking about how cool it\u2019d be to have him do an infomercial. I just dropped it as if it just came in my head, not that I\u2019d been plotting it for a year and knew it was going to happen someday in the future. I was like, \u201cMan, that\u2019d be so cool to have you do an infomercial. What does it look like?\u201d an d he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t do infomercials for people, but I might be willing to do one for you.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.\u201d And he gave me some cool compliments and I was like that\u2019s cool.</p> <p>And then he kind of mentions in bypass, Joe Polish and I are thinking of doing a 100k group, would you be interested? And I said, \u201cIf you help me do an infomercial I\u2019d definitely be interested.\u201d And he was like, \u201cAlright, I think we can make that happen.\u201d And we kind of left it at that. I was like, oh my gosh. That night I was all giddy, this may actually happen. There\u2019s now a path that this could actually, that this might possibly happen.</p> <p>So the next morning at the 25k meeting, the first thing Joe and Dean do is they launch, \u201cHey we\u2019re launching a 100k program.\u201d Dean\u2019s like, \u201cBrunson\u2019s thinks he\u2019s in.\u201d and I was like, \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d and they handed me an order form, I filled it out and joined the 100k program. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know the answer but I know that this is the path. Somehow Dean\u2019s making the infomercial and I just need to be closer to him.</p> <p>So that was kind of it, and now the 100k program, we had our first meeting a couple of weeks ago, I think I talked to you guys about that. And what\u2019s cool, is at the meeting he asked me if I would train for a little bit. I was like, \u201cWhat do you want me to train?\u201d and he asked what I thought would be best for this audience. And I said, \u201cI know what would be best.\u201d So I shared some stuff in expert secrets book, it\u2019s almost like a test to see how this audience would respond to it, and they went nuts. Insane. I was like, yes the message is right. The book is right.</p> <p>And I told Dean, my book\u2019s about this concept. And Dean\u2019s like, \u201cI want to help you with the infomercial.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI want you to help me with the infomercial.\u201d And he text the other day, \u201cI think I have the perfect host for your show.\u201d I\u2019m freaking out that all this stuff is happening. For me the market expansion is the book, Expert Secret and using it through an infomercial. I mean we\u2019ll be doing a normal book launch and pushing through channels that we\u2019re good at. But I see a very clear vision of how we can use Expert Secrets to create the market to get people to\u2026\u2026</p> <p>Because the hard thing with a small business owner, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a chiropractor. If I go and I\u2019m like, \u201cI want to show you this thing called Clickfunnels.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cAlright.\u201d And I show it to him, \u201cLook you can drag and drop and move things on the page.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cIsn\u2019t that how all website builders work?\u201d because he doesn\u2019t build his website. It\u2019s the consultant that they hired or the webmaster that does that. To them it\u2019s not a big deal, so the only way to get to them is to become a consultant, which is why the consultant program is working so well.</p> <p>I\u2019m like, if we want to expand, we have to create people who are going to be using Clickfunnels. How do I create somebody? I show them the value they have within themselves. I show them that they\u2019ve got talents and hobbies and skills and the thing that they goof off on the weekends because they love it, could actually become a career for them, if they learn how to structure it right. As soon as I can convince them of that, which is the goal of the book, then they need Clickfunnels the tool to be able to actually implement it. And that\u2019s the magic.</p> <p>So that\u2019s how we are going to be expanding our market. That\u2019s going to become our new front end. Don\u2019t forget, unless you\u2019re worried I\u2019m shutting down webinars, after they go through the book the next funnel is the webinar. The message will be a little bit different. In fact\u2026..it\u2019s already been 21 minutes. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been sitting in the parking lot freezing because I\u2019m so excited to hang out with you guys. So I\u2019ll just tell you some more.</p> <p>So what\u2019s going to happen is they\u2019re going to get the book, through radio, infomercials and online, all these different channels are gonna be pushing it. After they get the book, then there\u2019ll be a survey they take. The survey will identify what type of business they are and then there\u2019s a different webinar based on each of those types. And that\u2019s the future, where we\u2019re going. At least I think so. It could definitely change in the next few months. But that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. And Dean may decide next week that he hates me and not do an infomercial and I\u2019d be totally cool with that.</p> <p>But so far I said, that\u2019s the direction I\u2019m going. But for most of you guys, the book is a much harder direction, longer and I think that for every one of you guys, if you join the inner circle, 99% of you guys, I\u2019d say, you need a webinar and you need to do it every single week. And you\u2019d say, \u201cI want to automate it.\u201d And I\u2019d say, \u201cGo back to this podcast episode.\u201d And I\u2019d make them go back and listen to it and say, \u201cAfter you have perfected your message then you have my permission to automate it, but not before.\u201d And that\u2019s kind of the same thing I wanted to mention today.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a year now. And those that heard that message a year ago, if you\u2019ve been listening, you could be in the spot where Brandon and Kaelin are, where you did 600 thousand in sales on a webinar in November. Or maybe you haven\u2019t done the webinar yet, and it could be both ways.</p> <p>There\u2019s a kid, I\u2019m learning his story, 4 or 5 people keep telling me, I haven\u2019t met him yet. In the Clickfunnels group, he\u2019s an 18 year old kid who was a pizza boy a little while ago and he learned the perfect webinar and he did like, I don\u2019t know, 3 or 4 hundred grand selling something through a webinar. And he\u2019s a young kid, first time he\u2019s ever done it. But he did it and he\u2019s doing it consistently and that\u2019s what you guys gotta do. So I\u2019m asking you right now to recommit. Because I don\u2019t want to have this conversation next year with you.</p> <p>The conversation I want to have next year with you is, \u201cRussell, I made so much money this last year. What should I do?\u201d I\u2019m going to say, \u201cCome to Kenya with us and let\u2019s build some schools together. But first we gotta get you to a spot where you can.\u201d And the way we get you there is by having a consistent funnel. You\u2019re bringing leads in every single day, new blood into your business every single day.</p> <p>And it\u2019s happening through a front end webinar. And that\u2019s the model. So go back, marketinginyourcar.com search for the next twelve months, or business model for the next twelve months, something like that. And listen to that, and follow that like it\u2019s the gospel truth, because it is.</p> <p>There\u2019s times for all these other funnels and all these cool things we\u2019re doing, after you\u2019ve acquired the customer. What\u2019s cool is that you can focus on doing the live webinar once a week and the rest of the time you can focus on cool new products and services you can create for the existing audience, but all of your ad money, your time, your effort, your focus, should be on getting new people in through one consistent message. After you have that, then you can go back and create new things for those people. But that should be your focus.</p> <p>There you go. This may be the longest marketing in your car in the history of all time. We\u2019re at 24 minutes and 15 seconds. I\u2019m going to bounce. I got some work to do. We\u2019ve got a webinar today. I have no idea what the numbers will be, but I\u2019m excited to do it. And then retiring this message, which is kind of sad. Not completely retiring, I\u2019m just definitely changing it for the new funnels to be very specific.</p> <p>The one\u2026\u2026 for people wondering why, this webinar I talk about supplement funnels, which has been a double edged sword. It\u2019s got a lot of people excited about supplements, but people who don\u2019t have a supplement, there\u2019s always just gap after bridges. So the new version webinars, webinars-plural, we identify who they are, and if they\u2019re a retail store, we have a webinar showing them retail funnels. If they are an expert, we\u2019ll show them expert funnels. There an ecommerce person will show them ecommerce funnels. We\u2019ll be very specific to funnels we show in the webinar to the type of person who\u2019s listening. So that is what we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Because the first two years of this has been brute force. We try to get everyone with the best message we can create. The second ten years will be more like a sniper war where we craft the message perfectly for each audience. It will hopefully increase conversions, stick rate, decrease churn, and build the culture even better. Thanks everyone for listening. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I will talk to you all again soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "26:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_277.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1480359733, "title": "Episode #276 \u2013 To Those Who See Things Differently\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Important insights on developing your future based mission.</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about starting a supplement business with a friend and some of the challenges he faced with naming it.

It\u2019s been a little while. We just got done with our Thanksgiving vacation, instead of doing what normal, sane people do and stay home and make turkey we decided to take our kids on a Disney Cruise, which was a lot of fun. other than more than half of my kids throwing up on the boat, which is a story for another day. But it was awesome, we had a good time.\u00a0 Glad to be back now, getting back to work.</p> <p>Pretty much, last night after spending a week off, I plotted out world domination and I have a blueprint and game plan and it is insanely exciting, so I\u2019m excited to get to the office and executing on said blueprint. Because it\u2019s going to be amazing. And my goal is to get all of them before the live event, which is 3 months away. By the way, last year we were pushing tickets all the way to the last week or two. I think we\u2019re going to sell out today. Today we raise the price, because it\u2019s black Friday today, and so we\u2019re raising the price at midnight and I do not think we\u2019ll have enough tickets to keep selling after the price raise, so it may just sell out today, which is insane because it\u2019s getting bigger every year. So I\u2019m excited for that.</p> <p>But today, what I want to talk to you guys about, excuse me. I almost did a podcast on the boat two or three times but between puking kids and everything else it just never happened. Been working on my book as you know, we\u2019ve talked a lot about this, I cannot wait for you guys to read this, it\u2019s going to be awesome. But in the book, one of the things I mention a lot is how to build a mass following, and there\u2019s three things. The charismatic leader or attractive character, then there\u2019s the future based vision of where things are going, and then there is the new opportunity. I\u2019ve talked a lot about new opportunity, but today I want to talk about the second piece there which is the future vision and stuff like that.</p> <p>Because, this is one of the things\u2026.I didn\u2019t craft any of things for me initially, but they\u2019ve been crafted as we\u2019ve been growing and it\u2019s been fuel for the fire. So the big part I want to talk about today is, first off, identifying exactly who your market is and from there creating something that calls them out When we first launched Clickfunnels, funnel hackers is what we became. The community became funnel hackers, they identified with that. They got t-shirts that say, \u201cI am a funnel hacker, I funnel hack.\u201d And it became a part of this mass movement, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>As we launched the funnel hacking event this year we came up with the headline, and not a headline, it\u2019s more like a rallying call that became the headline. It\u2019s funny because the headline initially, I don\u2019t know if I told you this story or not. It was like, \u201cYou\u2019re one funnel away from becoming rich.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re one funnel away from quitting your job.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re one funnel away from growing your business to the next level.\u201d And every time we\u2026..every variation of that headline was lame because that\u2019s true for a small percentage of people, but everyone\u2019s different. Then finally I deleted everything, I was about to start writing again, so I deleted everything. It just said, \u201cYou\u2019re one funnel away\u201d I looked at it like, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the rallying call. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>So I shifted my emails, every email comes now says, \u201cPs, don\u2019t forget you\u2019re just one funnel away.\u201d The headline from the event, \u201cYou\u2019re one funnel away.\u201d I started doing these Facebook Live\u2019s where it\u2019s like the state of the union address and I sign off all of those, \u201cDon\u2019t forget you\u2019re just one funnel away.\u201d Drew Canoli, my buddy who owns Oganify and Life TV, I initially saw him do this with his movement and I thought it was so cool and I was jealous that I didn\u2019t have one, so I got one and I want you all to have one too.</p> <p>So his was, he always says, \u201cDon\u2019t forget guys, we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d So he gets everyone to be like, we\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re all losing weight together. We\u2019re all juicing together. We\u2019re all\u2026\u2026.it becomes more of a community. We\u2019re all part of this thing. That\u2019s how Drew did his.</p> <p>So mine now, with the whole, \u201cDon\u2019t forget you\u2019re just one funnel away.\u201d It gives hope and vision. It\u2019s so inspiring, because you hear that and you\u2019re like, even if you failed ten times, \u201cMan, I may have failed ten times, but I\u2019m one funnel away. The next funnel\u2019s going to be the one.\u201d It gives you a reason to keep moving forward and keep driving.</p> <p>In Clickfunnels side, it\u2019s been fun but recently, one of my buddies, Darin Stevens, who will be speaking at Funnel Hacking Live. A year ago actually, he came to me, \u201cI want to start to do this supplement company.\u201d I was like,\u201d I sold my supplement company. I\u2019m not really interested. Unless it\u2019s a new tropic company, I\u2019m totally obsessed with new tropics, and it would be cool to make supplements for entrepreneurs. I would be totally interested in that.\u201d And I did have some other stipulations like, I don\u2019t actually want to own the company. But I do want royalties on it and stuff like that. He was cool enough to work, it worked out good. We\u2019re basically, I do the cool parts that I like to do, but he gets to do the cool stuff he likes to do. We\u2019re working through some stuff.</p> <p>One of the very first supplements we\u2019re going to do is, it\u2019s interesting, a supplement I created in the past called Ignite, it was actually based on a supplement one of my buddies did a while ago called Fighter Fuel. It was energy for MMA fighters, which is kind of cool. We found out Fighter Fuel, after he had sold a whole bunch of them, was trademarked, as good entrepreneurs do, we don\u2019t check that out ahead of time, so we had to change the whole thing. So we changed it to Ignite. It was called MMA Ignite. So we went off in the MMA world, but we found out that, I thought MMA would Ignite all the different martial arts, but turns out it pushes all your markets away. So I\u2019m like, crap.</p> <p>So then we were going to do, maybe we\u2019ll call it Gamer Ignite and go after gamers.\u00a0 Or call it CrossFit Ignite, go after CrossFitters. So we re-branded again, called it just Ignite, so we could leave it kind of open. But then it was kind of this vague thing. We never sold any. I have a whole warehouse of it. But Clickfunnels was literally built on Ignite. Everyone, that\u2019s how we pulled as many all nighters as we did. If you go back about two years in the podcast when we were launching this puppy, you\u2019ll remember my late nights coming home at 4 in the morning every single night. Ignite is what we used to get through.</p> <p>So with Darin, I said, \u201cHow about Ignite. I love that supplement. It tastes good, people love it, we just never sold it.\u201d At my live events I give it to people all the time, people are trying to order it. I\u2019m like, \u201cWe don\u2019t sell it.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cBut I need it. I\u2019m addicted.\u201d So it\u2019s always a good problem when people are trying to buy something you\u2019re not selling.</p> <p>So anyway, we decided for the first supplement for our new company we were going to sell Ignite. What\u2019s kind of cool about it, we were trying to go for a long time with a name. I wanted a cool name that would be cool. We couldn\u2019t name, we tried a whole bunch of names that were good names, but nothing that was amazing. Then one night, I was watching Limitless, the TV show. It was actually the pilot and on there he talked about how \u201cwhen you take NZT it unlocks your mind and you have unlimited potential.\u201d I was like what? Unlimited potential, U P, Up. I was like we should call it UP Brain. So I ran upstairs and bought Up Brain, bought every variation of that domain. So the supplement company is going to be called UP Brain, unlocking the limited potential of your mind, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>So that\u2019s like the overarching theme of the company but then each supplement is kind of different. We had this Ignite thing, before the cruise we were kind of finishing the boxing. It\u2019s called ignite, but I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat is this, an energy drink. Who\u2019s it for? Everyone?\u201d That\u2019s the problem with most energy drinks, they\u2019re for everyone. Pre-workouts are for body builders, there\u2019s all sorts of energy drinks, but they\u2019re kind of for everybody. I was like, if we need to carve out our segment, we need to call out our people. This comes back to the cult building 101. We need to call out our people and get them to come to us.</p> <p>So we\u2019re like, who are our people? Initially I was like, its entrepreneurs. Let\u2019s call it Ignite: Energy for Entrepreneurs. But it\u2019s not entrepreneurs that take this, in my world it\u2019s the entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs. The people inside the company who are helping us drive this vision and mission. I\u2019m like, who are our people? If I can\u2019t call them out, then how am I supposed to advertise to them?</p> <p>All the sudden, like a bolt of lightning, I had this inspiration. It was a quote from Steve Jobs popped into my head. I\u2019m going to try to read this quote while I\u2019m driving. I\u2019m at a stop sign right now, hopefully this won\u2019t kill my recording. Let me see if I can record this. Hopefully it will work.</p> <p>The quote says, \u201cHere's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\u201d</p> <p>I think that was Steve Jobs. It said Steve Jobs before but I was searching for it when I was driving and some other guy\u2019s name came up. But I think it\u2019s Steve Jobs, so I\u2019m quoting Steve Jobs. I said, that\u2019s my rally call. That\u2019s my people. That\u2019s people I want to market to, it\u2019s not body builders or fitness anything, it\u2019s the people who are\u2026\u2026what we came up with was people who see things differently. So the supplement is Ignite: Energy for people who see things differently. Then we\u2019ve got Steve Jobs quote on the side. Boom. And then every single packet has Steve Jobs quote on it.</p> <p>People say, yes that\u2019s me. I see things differently, I\u2019m the rebel. Or whatever, that\u2019s my people. It\u2019s the entrepreneurs, the intrepraneurs, the people who are trying to change the world. That\u2019s who this supplement is going for. So that\u2019s what we came up with. Then it comes back to, how can I make a t-shirt out of this? I need them to be able to self identify with the movement. So the t-shirt says, \u201c I see things differently.\u201d Boom. How cool is that? I cannot wait to have that shirt and wear it and drink the supplement and have all those pieces come together.</p> <p>We still want to have the rallying call, the \u201cYou\u2019re one funnel away\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together\u201d. That\u2019s the next step here in the building of a future vision of this new supplement company. I\u2019m excited by it. I hope that you guys are excited to. Just thinking about the things in your business, because they\u2019re the same right. How do we build a movement that\u2019s bigger than us? If you\u2019re thinking your business is a product, you\u2019re going to become transactional and it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s something where you\u2019re constantly looking for the next kill, the next thing.</p> <p>I have a lot of friends who, that\u2019s their businesses and I love them, but man they\u2019re going\u2026\u2026Eat what you kill. And they live off of that and they die off of that. I\u2019ve seen businesses grow and collapse because of that. You really shift your thinking from I\u2019m selling products, transactional things to I\u2019m building a community, a culture, whatever you want to call it. These are some of these elements that come into it, where people self identify with the brand.</p> <p>I told people with Clickfunnels, I don\u2019t want people thinking Clickfunnels is Russell\u2019s business. I want people thinking Clickfunnels is our company. This is us. I want them to be part of it. And that\u2019s what makes it cool. I want the same thing with the supplements. Yes, I see things differently, that\u2019s why I take these supplements. Because I\u2019m different. I want people to identify with that.</p> <p>Sorry I\u2019m at four-way stop with tons of construction. That\u2019s why I was able to sit there for so long and read my stuff because\u2026Now I\u2019m going and trying to figure out the route I\u2019m taking a bunch of weird streets.</p> <p>Anyway, hope that helps you kind of start thinking through those things for your business because with Clickfunnels a lot of things I didn\u2019t think of, luckily we stumbled upon them and as they happened we saw the impact of them, so we tried to engineer those more now that we\u2019re thinking through it. And now, especially with new companies to work with, and people in my inner circle, those are the things we\u2019re talking about. How do we create those things? Because the better you create those things, the more powerful it will be for you and your community. It will take your business from a transactional thing, where you\u2019re hustling for each deal to something where it\u2019s more than that and it become part of people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>When that happens, that\u2019s when life gets really fun. Think about the products and services that you interact with every single day, they\u2019re not a product to you, they\u2019re part of your life. For me, Clickfunnels is definitely a part of my life. There\u2019s supplements I take that are part of my life. My phone is part of my life. There\u2019s those things that aren\u2019t products for you anymore. My iPhone, and I don\u2019t know if you have this same issue, iPhones have been crapping out lately. I thought it was just mine. Mine would hit 30% and then it just dies. I\u2019m like, Oh, my phone\u2019s dead.</p> <p>Then someone on Facebook posted and 800 other people were like, it\u2019s happened to me too. So apparently its global. I was telling my wife, \u201cMan, I\u2019m so pissed, my phone keeps collapsing, every time it\u2019s 30% it dies and I have to reboot and recharge it. It\u2019s a huge nightmare.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, we should get Samsung\u2019s.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cBut your phone doesn\u2019t work.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m part of this really cool cult. And we all have these phones and it\u2019s cool. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s not transactional at this point.\u201d</p> <p>So there you go. Hope you guys get some benefit from this, I\u2019m almost to the office, I\u2019m going to bounce. I will talk to you all again soon. Have a great day and remember you\u2019re just one funnel away.

There\u2019s a weird echo. That is why\u2026..I think yesterday I did one from my house. We\u2019re not even in a car anymore, we should change the title of this thing if we\u2019re going to keep this pattern down. Just kidding.</p> <p>I\u2019m here tonight because I am actually in Scottsdale, Arizona and I\u2019ve had a bunch of people asking me why I\u2019m here, second off, more specifically why am I here? Because I recently joined a part of\u2026..I mean, I\u2019ve been in mastermind groups a lot for ten years now. And I joined Bill Glazer\u2019s back when my business was floundering and I didn\u2019t realize how much it cost to join the mastermind group, all I knew was that I\u2019d gotten some Dan Kennedy cd\u2019s in the mail that were Dan Kennedy talking about his platinum group and I listened to them and it was the most amazing conversation I\u2019d ever heard. So I was like \u201cHoly cow I just wanna be in that room.\u201d</p> <p>So I called up GKIC the company at the time, I said, \u201cHey I want to be in Dan\u2019s platinum group. I heard about it and I wanna be in it.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cSorry, it\u2019s sold out for three years.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo I need to be in it.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cSorry.\u201d We keep going back and forth and finally after I bugged them enough, I had a friend on the inside who got me in. And they said, \u201cYou\u2019re accepted fine. Here\u2019s the money.\u201d And they sent me the order form and I didn\u2019t realize it, I thought maybe it was 5 grand or something but it was $25 thousand. I was like, \u201cGoll!\u201d So I didn\u2019t have that money, but I didn\u2019t want to tell that after I bragged about how cool I was to get into the group that I couldn\u2019t afford. So I just did it.</p> <p>And I jumped right in and went to my first event and I thought it was Dan Kennedy\u2019s mastermind group, and I got there and Dan Kennedy was nowhere to be seen. There was this old guy in the back, who later became one of my first real mentor. His name was Bill Glazer and he\u2019s someone I love and respect a ton. He\u2019s like my marketing dad. And he was in the room and I didn\u2019t know what to expect when I sat down, and it was my first mastermind. The experience at first it confused me and then it transformed me.</p> <p>For the next six years I was in that mastermind group and it went from having a tiny business to making a million dollars a year to making ten million dollars a year to losing it all and then growing it back up. Kind of this huge cycle of my life, it was awesome. Then Bill sold the company and I decided to not keep going to it. I was looking for other mastermind groups, and I joined a couple other ones. I won\u2019t mention their names because none of them were that awesome. I plugged in and there were pieces that were good and people that were good, but it was just never home for me. So I tried a couple of times and just didn\u2019t have any luck.</p> <p>Finally I was like, \u201cyou know what? If I\u2019m going to do this, I need to create it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s created what I wanted. So that\u2019s when I created my Inner Circle which has become amazing. As you know, last month, or this month, we did 8 days of meetings that were a hundred people in the Inner Circle. We have 4 groups of 25 and it\u2019s just amazing. I facilitate mine very similar to how Bill Glazer used to facilitate his. Although at this meeting, the last meeting we had, Garrett White came and added some really cool things, we\u2019re going to start adding to our meetings. So it was really awesome.</p> <p>So it\u2019s been really, really good but at the same time it\u2019s really hard. When it\u2019s your event you have to be on the whole time. You don\u2019t get to sit back and just be there. So I kind of miss that. And I was hoping and looking and joined a couple other programs, and I even\u2026..and I\u2019ll say this now. I joined Joe Polishes 25k group, and if I\u2019m completely honest the networking was amazing. I would say the networking is second to none. But I didn\u2019t get what I\u2026..what I want a mastermind for is different. Networking is good, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m there.</p> <p>I\u2019m there because I\u2019m trying to learn in a different plane, different level, different vibration, whatever you want to call it. Learn on a different level and I never got that in 25k. So I wasn\u2019t planning on renewing and then I was there, they offered this 100 thousand dollar thing, so I thought about it for 5 seconds and I said I\u2019m in.</p> <p>A couple reasons why and I want to share them with you because hopefully it will help you understand why I\u2019m here and hopefully it will give you guys permission to invest back into yourselves. The first reason is Joe Polish is running it with Dean Graziosi. Dean has been on more successful infomercials, has done more successful infomercials than anyone I have ever met. And he\u2019s done it with books in the financial space, which is \u201chey, by the way, I have a book coming out in financial\u201d or the how to make money space. Similar.</p> <p>Part of me wants to do an infomercial or a radio deal and he\u2019s been crazy successful in infomercials and radio and events and a bunch of things that is in the avenue of business I\u2019m a part of, so that gets me excited. Second Joe Polish is one of the best network connectors I have ever met in my life. And I didn\u2019t want to lose\u2026.I wasn\u2019t planning on rejoining 25k because I didn\u2019t get what I was looking for out of it. But I didn\u2019t want to lose that relationship with Joe because there\u2019s a lot of value there. He\u2019s super cool, and super connected to everybody on planet Earth.</p> <p>So I was like, I don\u2019t want to lose that relationship and this could be the ability to have that at a higher level. Third thing is that, you know ever since me and other people have 25 thousand dollar group, a lot of people have them and a lot of people get into them. Joe\u2019s is, I know other people have done it, but he was one of the first pones that\u2019s done 100k group. And I thought the people signed up to do a 100k is typically a different caliber of people. Those that can write a check for 100k is a different caliber of person. So it\u2019s going to get me the ability to be in the room with people at a higher level and hopefully plug in and find out the next two days what we get. Hopefully they have some different ideas and different things that are thinking different levels that I typically do. That\u2019s what I\u2019m really excited for, that piece of it.</p> <p>Then I\u2019m trying to think of the reasons. I know the last one. The last one is one that hopefully will be good for you guys. The last one is because I\u2019ve thought about doing a 100k group before. I don\u2019t know if I will or wont, I have no idea. I\u2019ve thought about it but I was like I can\u2019t ask somebody to give me 100 thousand dollars, if I haven\u2019t given somebody 100 thousand dollars. There\u2019s something about that. After Bill Glazier took my 25 thousand dollars happily I decided I wanted a mastermind group and I sent out an email while I was at the first mastermind group and I got 30 applications and I launched my first mastermind.</p> <p>Because I\u2019d spent 25 thousand dollars I felt like I had permission to do that. Justin and Tara Williams, when they joined my Inner Circle the first time, they had a $2,000 product, and I think the very first meeting, we were all like,\u00a0 \u201cYou should launch a $25 thousand program.\u201d And I think it was partly because they had done it, they had paid 25 grand, second off, they got permission from all of us and they went and did it. I think they said, I can\u2019t remember the number, but it was like 18 people paid them $25k off the first promotion. They didn\u2019t even have a sales team in place. They just sent some emails and took credit cards, which is nuts. It\u2019s so cool.</p> <p>But it gave them, the best part, we gave them permission. I think it\u2019s funny how sometimes we\u2019re not congruent with ourselves. We want to ask people to buy stuff, but then we don\u2019t buy things. I have friends who pirate everything. They don\u2019t pay for videos or movies or games or anything. So they\u2019re basically stealing everything and then they\u2019re trying to sell people their products. There\u2019s some kind of incongruence there that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible for some people.</p> <p>I have a friend, there\u2019s this pirating website, and I don\u2019t know the call but, where you can get basically every internet marketing course known to man is on it. You have to have a secret login and then you can download\u2026kind of like Napster back in the day, but it\u2019s kind of like internet marketing Napster. Every product ever is on there.</p> <p>I had a friend that was on that site and he was downloading everybody\u2019s products and courses and going through them. And he told me that for 5 or 6 years he never made money online, despite the fact he had every course known to man. Then one day he woke up he realized that, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to ask people for money, and I\u2019m not willing to pay money then I\u2019m a bad person and I\u2019m not going to be successful. I canceled my membership to the account, deleted the account\u00a0 and then started buying people\u2019s things. And just by the nature of me no longer stealing and actually investing, people were more willing to invest in me. I grew a company and business because of it.\u201d</p> <p>So another big part for me is just that. I should be able to invest something like this so that when if I ever someone for 100 thousand dollars, I\u2019m not going to be freaking out because I\u2019ll know, was it worth it for me? I\u2019m going to create something that will be worth it for them. Those are the best couple of reasons. So that is why I joined the 100k group, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m going to be here the next two days and I\u2019m excited to see what I get, what I learn, if I get any big aha takeaways, I\u2019ll come back and report and share with you the good stuff.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also good to just step away, I\u2019m so much in the heat of business for a long time, it\u2019ll be nice to sit back and be able to think. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in Scottsdale and that\u2019s why I invested that much money. Hopefully the fruits of this will be good. I\u2019m going to be speaking to the group actually tomorrow about some ninja funnel stuff, which will be really cool.</p> <p>My real goal of this, some of you guys know, Clickfunnels we just passed 23 thousand active customers, maybe more than that now. We\u2019re trying to get to 30 thousand by the end of the year. We\u2019re getting close. We\u2019re pressing a little. We got a big campaign in December, those things should hit it. And then next year we\u2019re trying to get to 100 thousand. It\u2019s a more than 3x leap, which companies don\u2019t do that. Especially now with DC capital. We did, we set a goal, a big hairy audacious goal.</p> <p>Anyway, we set the big goal and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do next year. If I\u2019m going to do that I gotta think different. I gotta look at things differently and have a strategy going into it. Some of the people in this room I think are going to be key to that strategy actually\u00a0 working. We will find out what I will know soon. That\u2019s the game plan. Appreciate you guys, I\u2019m going to go to bed, because I\u2019ll be busy tomorrow and I need to get some rest. Appreciate you all. Thanks for listening and now it\u2019s time for you to go join a 100k group, or 25k group, or 10k or whatever it is for you. Because that investment will somehow magically give you the ability to let people invest in you too. I don\u2019t know how it works, but it does. There you go. Alright you guys, appreciate you all. Have a good night, talk to you all tomorrow.</p>", "duration": "12:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_275.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1479156559, "title": "Episode #274 \u2013 The Switch Vs.

I recommend everyone writing a book at least once in your life. Because it looks at what you do through so many different lenses and angles. So just write a good book, some people just write a book. The entire time writing a book, for me, when I\u2019m writing this book I want it to go down in the histories of time, Dotcom Secrets book the same way. I want them to be evergreen. When I die I want people to read it and be like, \u201cDang.\u201d</p> <p>I was telling my kids the other day, \u201cHow cool will it be when I\u2019m dead and you actually read my book. Who knows if you\u2019ll be marketing guys or not. But you\u2019ll read it and be like my dad was actually awesome.\u201d That\u2019s the goal. So I\u2019m working on this book and it\u2019s supposed to have the final draft by today. I\u2019m going back through so deep. I\u2019m on page 50, I have 250. Not getting it done today. No way on earth. But it\u2019s okay because\u2026..in fact, Bowen just came up and said, \u201cDad you\u2019re only on page 50, supposed to be done today. Are you scared?\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s more important that the book is amazing than it\u2019s done on time.\u201d So there you go.</p> <p>Okay, you guys ready, this is so exciting. Some of this is going to be out of context for some of you guys who haven\u2019t been geeking out with me the whole time on this journey recently. Some of you guys this will be the next step, the next layer. One of the things I\u2019ve been talking a lot about in the Inner Circle, I think I\u2019ve talked about it a bunch on this podcast as well, the difference between an improvement offer and a new opportunity. If we build a mass movement you cannot\u2026\u2026not only a mass movement, but if you want to make money, flat out. Improvement offers are horrible.</p> <p>The analogy I keep using in the book. If you have a Volvo, there\u2019s two things you can do. One is you can sell people how to make this Volvo better. Lets paint it, get the dents out, make the engine run better. Or\u2026do you think people want that? No, they want a new car. That\u2019s the new opportunity. Don\u2019t offer people ways to make them better. If they admit that they\u2019re\u2026\u2026If you\u2019re selling, \u201cI\u2019m going to show you how to make yourself better.\u201d The nature of them giving you money, they\u2019re admitting they\u2019ve failed. So it\u2019s a huge hurdle.</p> <p>Then it\u2019s never inspiring, exciting. They\u2019re just like, \u201cYeah, this is a little bit better.\u201d So the goal is to always to position what we do as a new opportunity. So I\u2019ve been geeking out talking about a new opportunity. Everyone\u2019s in a different aspect. How do I position my sell as a new opportunity? And I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d</p> <p>Inner Circle, the last two or three weeks, we talked a lot about this in a lot depth and details with everyone. Iv\u2019e been thinking about it and writing about it. In fact, I spent three hours the other day trying to explain this and in three hours I got one page written, which is why this book\u2019s never going to be done. But if\u00a0 it ever does get done that page is going to be amazing.</p> <p>So tonight I had another big breakthrough. I\u2019m trying to think, how do you position your new opportunity? And initially I had ten different ways and I started widdling and I\u2019m like, these two are the same and these are the same. Finally when it all broke down to it, there were only two ways to position your new opportunity. So this where it gets good. You guys ready?</p> <p>So the first way, what I\u2019ve written down here, I\u2019m calling it an opportunity switch, and the second way is called an opportunity stack. I\u2019m just gonna read a couple of paragraphs.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there are a lot of ways to start your improvement offers, there are only two ways we can position a new opportunity. There\u2019s an opportunity switch or an opportunity stack. The first thing you need to understand is that when anyone runs into your new opportunity for the very first time, they\u2019re either looking to change from whatever opportunity they are currently using to try to get what they want. Or they are looking at ways to get more from their current opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Says opportunity like ten times, I might clean that up a little bit, but regardless, the gist of it is when they come to you, you know the first time they\u2019ve been trying to lose weight, lets say that\u2019s the vehicle they\u2019re going into, \u201cI need to lose weight.\u201d They\u2019re looking around, they\u2019ve tried other things. You\u2019re not the first typically. Or they\u2019re trying to be more happy or make more money, whatever their thing is, you\u2019re not the first.</p> <p>They\u2019re currently in an opportunity. They\u2019re in a vehicle driving around doing something and they see yours. So when they see they do either one of two things. They\u2019re like, \u201cmy car is awesome and I need, I want more from this.\u201d Or they\u2019re like, \u201cI hate my car, I need a new car.\u201d</p> <p>So it says, \u201cRegardless which of these people you\u2019re talking to the answer for them is your new opportunity. But you need to present differently based on if they\u2019re looking for change or if they\u2019re looking for the same.\u201d So the first opportunity switch. Opportunity switch is like, hey you\u2019re currently doing this, but I\u2019m going to shift and do this instead. O this comes back to, \u201cyou\u2019re driving a Volvo and your Volvo sucks. So do present an improvement offer, which is new paint or whatever.</p> <p>You shift them over and say, \u201cLook your Volvo sucks. We\u2019re selling you a new car. We\u2019re selling you a Ferrari.\u201d Or whatever that new opportunity is. So that\u2019s the opportunity switch. So if your in the weight loss market, you\u2019re like, \u201cyou\u2019re on the Atkins diet? The Atkins diet sucks. We\u2019re switching you over here to the Bulletproof diet.\u201d Or whatever that is. You\u2019re shifting the opportunity of whatever they\u2019re doing currently to get their end result to whatever it is you want them to do.</p> <p>The second thing is an opportunity stack. They already have an opportunity and loving it. You\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get rid of this opportunity, I\u2019m trying to stack on top of it.\u201d So let\u2019s just say, you\u2019re an internet marketer, and you\u2019re loving internet marketing but you\u2019re like \u201cI was to invest my wealth.\u201d So I\u2019m stacking. Keep your internet marketing, but we\u2019re going to take some of your money and put it into real estate, stacking opportunity. So that\u2019s kind of an example.</p> <p>It\u2019s me like, if you got a Volvo I\u2019m like \u201cCool, I like your Volvo. Keep driving it to your office every single day, but on the weekends you need a Ferrari.\u201d So we sell you a Ferrari.\u00a0 So it\u2019s stacking opportunities. So I\u2019m doing those and I just wrote that whole section of the book and I\u2019m like cool that breaks them down for you to think through. My position is an opportunity switch or an opportunity stack. And almost every offer, it\u2019s really easy to see how this is an opportunity switch, that\u2019s easy. But the opportunity stacks are harder.</p> <p>Some things, I feel like everything can be positioned as an opportunity switch, almost. Some things can\u2019t be a stack, if that makes sense. It\u2019s harder. So I started thinking, what should people do? All the sudden I realized, holy crap, so I actually wrote this paragraph and be completely transparent. This book is an opportunity switch. I\u2019m bringing people in, read this book and my goal of the book is to give you an opportunity switch. I want to switch you to my book, if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s called Expert Secrets. I\u2019m shifting you, trying to give you this opportunity switch from whatever you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re in network marketing, real estate, you\u2019re an employee. Whatever it is you\u2019re doing, I want to switch you to have the opportunity to this expert career. I want to make you an expert.</p> <p>So there\u2019s the switch. Then after they\u2019ve switched and I\u2019ve got them, then I start doing the bolt on opportunity stacks. Now you say I\u2019m an expert, cool. The next opportunity for you is Clickfunnels. I\u2019m going to stack that. You get Clickfunnels and I\u2019m like, the next thing you need is called Funnel Scripts, I\u2019m going to stack that. Then there\u2019s fill your funnel, I\u2019m going to stack that. Then there\u2019s Clickfunnels certify, I\u2019m stacking. This becomes the value ladder.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking at, if you guys could see my image here, it\u2019ll be in the book I just sketched it out. It\u2019ll be in the book, don\u2019t worry. The front says opportunity\u2026. it\u2019s kind of a value ladder, the front says opportunity switch, it\u2019s got the picture of the expert secrets book. The side says opportunity stack and it\u2019s got a little value ladder. And it\u2019s taking people up and each rung in my value ladder is a stack. So I\u2019m stacking, stacking, stacking all the way up. Isn\u2019t that crazy.</p> <p>People always ask me, \u201cRussell I\u2019m building my value ladder. Where should I start? Front, back, middle?\u201d Now I know the answer, I never knew the answer before. But the answer is you start your value ladder wherever the opportunity switch happens. Someone come to you initially that\u2019s your first job, is the switch. Now that I\u2019ve switched them, they\u2019re in your value ladder, and you do opportunity stacks. You\u2019re stacking on these opportunities. Holy crap, I don\u2019t know if that made any sense to you guys, but I am freaking out right now.</p> <p>This is like, it just opened my mind to so much coolness that I didn\u2019t even know was there. So I hope that you got a little bit out of that, if not read the book. But that\u2019s the key you guys. You lead with an opportunity switch, and after they\u2019ve switched then the rest of your value ladder becomes the opportunity stacks. That\u2019s why a lot of people will build 4 or 5 webinars and they\u2019re like \u201cOnly one webinar works.\u201d And that\u2019s the reason why.\u00a0 For the most part, a whole different marketing efforts, depending on paid efforts, should be focusing on one thing, switch.</p> <p>After they switch and then all the other things will all into that current audience. that\u2019s the transition from cold market, to warm to hot. They come in cold, they get switched, they get warm. And then from the switch they get hot and then you send them up the value ladder. Holy crap this is so cool. So freaking cool, so exciting.</p> <p>I cannot wait for this book to be done you guys. You are all going to love it. So awesome. So that\u2019s all I got. So what\u2019s your opportunity switch. Think about it, people are coming to you, they\u2019re already driving some vehicle, they\u2019re already doing something to try to get the end goal they want. But they\u2019re probably not happy, so you gotta come in and say, \u201cYou\u2019re Volvo is driving you where you want to go, but you\u2019re miserable. Time to get out and go over here. I\u2019ve got a Ferrari.\u201d Or I\u2019ve got a Lambo or a\u2026..whatever, a jeep. Whatever your opportunity is, bring in the opportunity, opportunity switch. Now they\u2019ve switched you can focus on opportunity stacking. Holy crap, game changing stuff.</p> <p>This books literally going to re-change how selling is done, I think. At least for the people that read it, the rest of the people won\u2019t even know. All of you guys and me, who all geek out on this, we\u2019ll just take over the world. Appreciate you all, thank you for listening, I\u2019m going to get back to work. I will talk to you guys all again soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "11:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_274.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1478724596, "title": "Episode #273 \u2013 The Humbling Experience I Learned Watching Last Night\u2019s Election", "author": "", "summary": "<p>When you look at their intentions, it changes your perspective.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about people having good intentions in the aftermath of the US election.

I hope that you all had a good election night last night. Some probably good, some probably bad, some just confused in the middle. Totally understand that. You know what, this morning I woke up, the sun is shining. My little daughter, Norah did not want me to leave today, so she was crying when I left, she was sad. I drove around to the front of the house she was there and gave me a kiss. So that was\u2026.It made the whole day good.</p> <p>So yesterday was kind of an interesting day. I don\u2019t know if you follow Snapchat, or all the other channels were publishing stuff so you see kind of behind the scenes of what we\u2019re doing. Part of Funnel Hacker TV, one of our episodes with this guy named Robert Jones, who\u2019s super talented man in the beauty space. He was in town and we were filming some videos with him and it was just really cool day.</p> <p>We werer working on his software and overall a really good day. It was the last free day I have until my book is done. I\u2019m going in the office to lock myself down and do nothing but write my book. It was a fun day and then we came home and the election stuff was, we were eating dinner. And then the kids were all into the election because at school they\u2019d been talking about it. They all had maps out and they were coloring the states as they went to red and blue. It was kind of a fun experience.</p> <p>Robert and Bart and Sunny were all at our house, then they left and we just sat on the couch with the kids and watched the news. Just watching as the day unfolded. Obviously now at this point, we all know what happened, but it was kind of crazy. We were watching it and we all passed out on the couch. I woke up at about 1:00 or 1:30 in the morning, whenever it was that Trump was giving his speech talking about the fact that he\u2019d won.</p> <p>And I was watching it and I was like, \u201cWow.\u201d It\u2019s just kind of crazy. Two days ago the media convinced everyone that there was no way that he would win and then he wins. It was crazy. I was sitting there and I looked at Facebook because I wanted to see everyone\u2019s responses. Honestly it was kind of sad. I saw friends on both sides, yelling at each other and fighting. I just felt kind of a sick feeling. And what was interesting a few hours earlier I had an experience that kind of put this whole crazy thing into perspective for me.</p> <p>So I opened up Facebook live, and clicked play. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to talk about, but I started talking. Some of you guys may have seen that. I want to kind of go back to that conversation because I think it\u2019s important. I think I was half asleep, so I was watching it this morning and some of the stuff I said, didn\u2019t make sense, wasn\u2019t very concise. So this is my shot to make it permanent on the podcast and hopefully it\u2019ll help some of you guys who are\u2026\u2026wherever you may be in your journey right now, with this and with other things.</p> <p>And basically what I talked about, a few hours earlier that night, Robert Jones and I got in my car and we driving from the office back to my home. And he came over for dinner along with Bart and Sunny. Robert is someone I have so much love and respect for. What he does, how he serves, the value he provides this world. And we obviously do not see eye to eye on some things.</p> <p>If you look at me, as most of you know at this point, I\u2019m a very devout Mormon on this side. And he\u2019s got very different beliefs and things on the other side. Which is totally cool and it doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ve got friends and family members and partners and things that they completely disagree with me on many things, I completely disagree with them on other things. And that\u2019s why I think it was so important for me.</p> <p>As we get in the car, we\u2019re driving, he calls his significant other and they were talking, and they were obviously rooting for a different person than I was. I kind of overheard ten seconds of the conversation. They said basically, \u201cHopefully it will go good, say a prayer and pray for the best.\u201d or something like that. And as I was driving there I was thinking, \u201cWow.\u201d Because in my mind, I don\u2019t know, I think we get into the heat and the marketing of the elections, which by the way has been really fun. We should do a whole marketing podcast on the election stuff later, could be really fun.</p> <p>But we get into that and it\u2019s funny because you start perceiving people, I\u2019m thinking candidates specifically as evil. This person is evil because of this and this. And then the other side, this person is evil because\u2026\u2026it\u2019s almost how we start perceiving these people. I was thinking about that last night as I was saying prayers with my kids, and praying for what I thought was right for the country and looking at what Robert was praying for and it was completely different. The polar opposite of me. And that\u2019s okay, because Robert\u2019s not evil; the person he\u2019s voting for is not evil. I\u2019m not evil. We\u2019re all acting out of what we think are the best intentions for us, our families, and the country.</p> <p>And I started thinking more and more about that last night at 1 or 2 in the morning. It got kind of fuzzy after a while. But as I\u2019m thinking this I\u2019m like, you know what, all of us, and I would argue in every situation that we make our choices based on good intent. What we think is best is for us or for our family. Things like that. I don\u2019t think people act out of malice or hate or spite. They do it sometimes, but not because they\u2019re hateful, because they believe that that is the right intent.</p> <p>Sorry the construction guy I drove past, and he\u2019s giving me thumbs up for my car.</p> <p>Anyway, they believe that that\u2019s the right intent. I was thinking back, and I\u2019m probably going to slaughter this story and I wish I knew the details better, but the principle\u2019s the same. I was at a Tony Robins event and he was telling this story about one of the Day of destiny\u2019s he was at. Day of destiny has 3 or 4 thousand people in the room and usually have partners and your working through things and you have workbooks.</p> <p>I guess one of the attendees had written down that his plan was after the event he was going to go home and murder his wife and kids and then commit suicide. The guys partner was looking at his book and was like, \u201cWow, my partner is an evil person who\u2019s trying to kill his wife and kids and I have to stop him. This guy\u2019s got evil intentions.\u201d</p> <p>So he goes and finds some of the tony Robin\u2019s staff and says, \u201cLook, this guy is a psychopath over here and you guys should fix him.\u201d So they\u2019re going through the event and Tony finds out about it, and I don\u2019t know the exact details, but Tony does interventions at his events. So he does an intervention because he knows that this guy is going to go home and slaughter his family. If you look at that from the outside, what do you think? How do you feel when I say that? That this man\u2019s intent is to go home and slaughter his family and kill himself?</p> <p>You think that this guy is a psychopath, this guy is evil, the worst of the worst. So Tony does this intervention with this guy and finding out why. What\u2019s the purpose behind why he\u2019s doing this? What is the underlying issue? Comes and works through the whole thing and finds out when this guy was young, and I can\u2019t remember if his dad died or left or something. But this man\u2019s father had left him and when his father left him, his whole life collapsed.</p> <p>His mom, it was horrible for his mom, the kids, the family. So much so that he associated his dad leaving as worse than death. He wished he would have died because his life after his dad left was so painful and so horrible, that death for him would have been a release. So this man was in a situation now where he was in a marriage or family that he was not happy with and he knew that he needed to leave.</p> <p>Whatever that looked like, I don\u2019t know the details. But as he was looking at that he was thinking about his kids that he loved so much. I love my kids, I love my wife, but I have to leave. But if I leave it would be better for them to be dead than for me to leave. Because if I leave it will destroy their life; but I have to leave. So because I love my kids and wife so much, I have to kill them so they don\u2019t go through the pain that I went through. That was his perception of the world.</p> <p>When you hear it from that lens you\u2019re like, \u201cWow, this guy, yes, the method and the process were wrong, but the intentions were good.\u201d He honestly thought this is what he needed to do to save his wife and kids.</p> <p>I think about that with all of us. I don\u2019t think people inherently have bad intentions. I look at history. And I don\u2019t know these people; let\u2019s say the worst of the worst. I think about Hitler and I think about any of these people, what they did was horrifically bad. No excuse, wrong and evil. But in their minds, their intentions were probably not bad. This is what we need to do. The lens that I\u2019m viewing this world through, this is how I\u2019m going to make the world a better place. Yes, the lens and direction were wrong. I\u2019m not excusing that because it\u2019s horrible what happened. But their intention was probably good. And maybe there\u2019s situations where people just really do have bad intentions, it\u2019s probably there, but I think that for the majority, 99.999999% we have good intentions and that\u2019s why we make the decisions we do. What we think is best for us.</p> <p>I think about, for me, I have close friends and family members who\u2019ve left the church that I love. There\u2019s times that I get sad and angry and frustrated, all those kinds of things, but I look at them and I love them and I love their families. I look at that and I\u2019m like, despite the fact that I don\u2019t feel the direction they\u2019re going is right, I can love them because they have good intentions. They\u2019re not doing this out of malice or hate or anything. It\u2019s because they feel like for them, this is the right direction. So I have to respect that even though I disagree with it because it\u2019s their good intentions. They\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best with the information they have.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same with politics, religion. It\u2019s the same with, I think most things. So I hope that as this political hailstorm has ended, that as we\u2019re looking around at our candidates and our friends and family members and people around us who disagree with what we\u2019ve picked, that we remember that. They didn\u2019t pick it because they\u2019re evil, they didn\u2019t pick it because they hate things. They picked it because for them, that was\u2026\u2026the intentions were right. They honestly felt that that is the best thing for them.</p> <p>And I think if we look at that through there, hopefully it will not divide us but make it have more love and respect for each other. But it\u2019s hard. I get that, I understand that, especially when you feel people are doing things that don\u2019t make sense and you don\u2019t agree with it. And sometimes it makes you cry because it\u2019s so painful. We can still love them because we know that they have pure intentions. That\u2019s the key.</p> <p>I hope that helps. It helped me yesterday. Like I said, when Robert made that comment when he was in my car and I heard it, it gave me a change of heart and more love and respect for him and just for everyone around me. And I hope that this helps you and all of us as well. That\u2019s what I got.</p> <p>Anyway, now the elections are done, it\u2019s time for us all to get back to work. Because despite the fact that we all voted, no offense, none of your votes really even matter. There was no election, it came down to two people.\u00a0 Anyway, just joking. The only thing that really matters is what we do, what we give, how we serve. So I recommend all you guys focus on that and continue to have good intentions and continue to try and change the world in the way that you see as right. And as you do that, good things will happen. With that said, appreciate you all. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys all again, hopefully tomorrow.

I guess it\u2019s not that late. You guys have hung out with me when it\u2019s like 4 in the morning. So a kind of late night of Marketing In Your Car. Alright, it\u2019s 10:15 I\u2019m driving home from Barbacoa. If you guys ever come to Boise Barbacoa is by far the best restaurant here. We had a group of some of the people in our...anyway, they came to dinner with us. Sorry my brain is so fried.</p> <p>It\u2019s been insane the last, and you guys heard me talk about this, but over the last two weeks, we\u2019ve done four mastermind groups of 25 entrepreneurs in each group so we\u2019ve had a hundred entrepreneurs come through. And what\u2019s amazing, compressing decades into days is literally happening. It\u2019s insane. I was able to get insights from a hundred different business owners on what\u2019s working right now and get feedback on ideas. There\u2019s so much gold and so many little tangible takeaway\u2019s that I wish we had 8 days and I could share them all with you guys.</p> <p>But I thought you might be interested in, \u201cRussell, what\u2019s the core thing?\u201d People always ask me, \u201cWhere do you think internet marketing is going? What\u2019s on your mind right now?\u201d But it\u2019s crazy because there were two definite things over the last 8 days. What\u2019s cool is the last two days Garrett White and his wife attended the inner circle the last two days and so for those of you who know Garrett, he\u2019s pretty intense and it was just cool because a lot of stuff we\u2019ve been talking about everyday were dramatically amplified in this last two days. He brought a bunch of cool tools and things that we\u2019re going to be adding into Inner Circle meetings from now because it had a huge impact.</p> <p>Anyway, there were two core things that if I was to give you the most important pieces of this, and I feel bad because no matter how cool I try to make these sound you are going to be like, \u201cOh cool. Awesome. That sounds great.\u201d But it\u2019s like when you see it happening in the room, when you see an entrepreneur who\u2019s trying to so hard to not only change the world but to change themselves. And there\u2019s this pressure and this stuff we\u2019re hitting against and you see when this is given to them, it\u2019s this release and I can\u2019t tell you how many people broke down in tears, myself included over the last 8 days, which was unique. That\u2019s never happened in my groups before, to be honest. But it happened consistently, a lot of times because of these two things.</p> <p>And again, when I share these two things they\u2019re almost going to seem to simple and I don\u2019t want you to dismiss them because of the simplicity. Because they are probably, my guess, are the two issues that most of us, me included, in this have the biggest problem with. So you ready for them? Drum roll please.</p> <p>In all seriousness, I just wanted to make sure you, I try to build up the drama so that you pay attention, but please pay attention because these are important. The first thing is focusing on one thing. Sounds so simple, we\u2019ve heard it a million times. But all of us entrepreneurs are doing more than one thing. How many things are you doing right now in your business? If it\u2019s more than one, you need to stop. I\u2019m talking to myself right now, and you included. What\u2019s the one thing you\u2019re trying to do?</p> <p>And it\u2019s kind of a sub-thing from that, I can\u2019t tell you how many people have things that are successful that they stop doing. Whatever\u2019s working, keep doing that. We keep looking for what\u2019s the next thing. It\u2019s just the nature of entrepreneurs. What\u2019s next? We\u2019re adding things we\u2019re layering things, we\u2019re doing things. One of the pro\u2019s and cons of the Dotcom Secrets book, I talk about a concept called the value ladder, which is vitally important to the long term growth of a company, but it\u2019s also one of the things that stifles someone from immediate growth because they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s next. So some of those things, it\u2019s important to understand and to know where you\u2019re going, but not to get caught up in this value ladder of, \u201cWhatever is working, I made a thousand bucks last week, gotta build a high ticket item.\u201d</p> <p>No. just do one thing on the value ladder and master that. Make a million dollars on that and then you can go and layer stuff, but don\u2019t do that now. Look at what\u2019s working and do more of that. Just do one thing, focus on one business, one core part of your business and have people on your team focusing on one thing. There\u2019s a million different angles that that matters and is important, but it\u2019s all coming back to what\u2019s the one thing. And if you focus that, you can call it the 80/20 if you want. What\u2019s the 20% that gives you 80% of the results and focus there.</p> <p>Because for some reason we get caught up in all these things that don\u2019t actually impact or do anything. So that\u2019s number one, focusing on the one thing. And the second thing, and this one\u2019s hard. It\u2019 something I\u2019ve struggled for a long time. Years and years and years. I still struggle with it. It\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think was essential even ten years ago, but now the world we live in today, it\u2019s the only thing that matter. It\u2019s the most important thing. And it is being vulnerable with your audience in all situations. Not just selling, but definitely in selling.</p> <p>We had people in our group who I\u2019ve known for a long time and for whatever reason, because of the environment and the people and the situation and whatever, were finally willing to get vulnerable and share things with the group that they normally wouldn\u2019t or have never shared before. And because they were vulnerable people connected and it opened up so many things.</p> <p>Because they opened up and they were vulnerable with me and other people, it was just great. I wish I could share stories but some of them are\u2026\u2026they\u2019re all way to personal of stories for me to tell. They\u2019re not my story to tell, so I can\u2019t. But because they shared those stories, they were able to have the breakthroughs that they needed.</p> <p>And the same thing is in your selling. It\u2019s hard, especially when we\u2019re communicating with our audience, the front that we have, you guys know. Here\u2019s Russell on stage, he\u2019s got stage presence or whatever. There\u2019s this thing, but the reason people connect with me is not because onstage I seem like whatever, it\u2019s because I\u2019m vulnerable, it\u2019s because I share things like this through my podcast and through Snapchat. I share things like that through videos. I\u2019m vulnerable, I open things up. As embarrassing as it is, I\u2019ve cried on video. But that vulnerability is what causes connection, which lets people in and let\u2019s people trust me, which is the reason why I\u2019ve got so many great connections to so many great people, is because of that.</p> <p>And I think about areas of my life that I\u2019m not happy, it\u2019s primarily tied to me not being willing to be vulnerable. Because I\u2019m afraid of fear or rejection or fill in the blank, whatever fear it is for you. So this isn\u2019t just a business lesson, this is a everything lesson. Being vulnerable, because as soon as you are it softens the people to whatever it is. If you\u2019re trying to build a relationship, or you\u2019re trying to sell something, whatever it is. Trying to build a connection, it\u2019s you opening yourself up and being vulnerable that allows people in.</p> <p>It\u2019s scary because sometimes people are bad people and when you open things up, they say bad things, do bad things, I get that. But I feel like putting your barriers down and opening yourself up is what allows amazing things to happen. and those two things, it was really coming back down and saying, \u201cLook, focus on one thing, number one. And number two, be open, be vulnerable, share your story and then don\u2019t do it once or twice, but do it consistently.\u201d</p> <p>It was funny, in the last group, again I wish I could share the stories, but they\u2019re too personal. But someone was talking and it was just Garrett kind of came back and said, \u201cLook, for me to learn my message this is what I had to do. I did a podcast everyday for 600 days. I did warrior weeks, every month for 76 months. I did video on Facebook three times a day for 5 years. I did this and this and this and consistently.\u201d And when he said that I said, \u201cHow many Marketing In Your Cars have I done? I\u2019ve probably done, I don\u2019t even know what episode we\u2019re on. 3 or 400. I\u2019ve podcast, I\u2019ve blogged. I\u2019ve done this so many times.\u201d And Garrett asked me, \u201cWhy do you keep doing them.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to learn my message.\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019s like, \u201cDo you hear that. Russell\u2019s been doing this for 12 years and is still trying to figure out his message.\u201d So for people that come in and try it once and to dabble and\u2026..\u201dI did a podcast and it didn\u2019t work. I tried a webinar and it didn\u2019t work. I did whatever and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d \u00a0The difference between me and them, I didn\u2019t stop. Garrett didn\u2019t stop. The successful people don\u2019t stop. How many webinars did I have to do to learn to discover, to create, whatever you want to call it, the perfect webinar. It was a lot, it\u2019s in the hundreds and hundreds.</p> <p>The Clickfunnels webinar alone I\u2019ve done at least fifty times. Over and over and over and over again to learn my message, to learn how I tell my stories, to learn all these kinds of things. So if you want to be in this game, you want to succeed in this game and you want to change yourself. You want to change other people. You want to change the world. It\u2019s a commitment, a sacrifice. And again, the two things.\u00a0 Number one, focus on the one thing, focus on that thing. Number two, focus on consistently doing it over and over and over and over again. And open yourself up and being vulnerable. That\u2019s how you cause those changes.</p> <p>I hope that helps you guys. Again there\u2019s, laced inside of that, probably a hundred pages of notes for myself and action items and to do\u2019s. Those are definitely the overarching things that I think everybody can gain value from. I wish and hope that someday each of you guys will have a chance to experience our inner circle, not because I want or need money, that\u2019s not the point of this group. But because of the transformation that comes from it. It\u2019s a group I love, I care about all the people in it. I\u2019ve built some friendships and relationships that will last the rest of my life.</p> <p>I care more than you have known about, about all your businesses. But these ones I have a chance to really affect and be a part of. With that said, someday I hope to have you in our group so you can be part of it, you can experience it at that level. Because that\u2019s where I feel the best transformation I can provide people comes from.</p> <p>With that said, I\u2019m getting close to home. I\u2019m really tired and kind of thirsty. So I will talk to you guys all again here, very soon. Probably a few days. I need a couple days to chillax. Next week though, next week\u2019s crazy because I have got to finish the Expert Secrets book. I found out for me to have the printed copies in time to give them out to all of the attendees at our live event, funnelhacking.com, I have to have the final draft to the editor by the end of next week. So I am spending next week in a hard core editing, rewriting, book focusing thing that\u2019s going to be crazy intense, but will be good. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing next week, so I\u2019m sure I \u2018ll be sharing some of the ups and downs of the immersion week I\u2019ve got next week to finish my book. Appreciate you all, talk to you again soon.</p>", "duration": "13:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_272.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1478215007, "title": "Episode #271 \u2013 The Perfect Webinar For Email?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Holy crap, this works for email too!</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the Perfect Webinar and an epiphany he had involving it while at a recent Inner Circle meeting.</p> <p>Here are some of the interesting things you should listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>A quick recap of what The Perfect Webinar is, and what you can get out of it.</li> <li>What one Inner Circle member did with The Perfect Webinar Script and how it inspired Russell.</li> <li>And How Russell plans to use The Perfect Webinar Script in an email sequence.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why The Perfect Webinar in so perfect, and why it\u2019s not just for webinars.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, good morning, this is Russell Brunson and welcome back to Marketing In Your Car. I\u2019m heading in to day 7 of 8 of our Inner Circle, Mastermind meetings. We got a new group coming through today, which is going to be so awesome. Not gonna lie, I\u2019m a little bit worn out and tired, but I get so fired up by hanging out with these people that it\u2019s all worth it and amazing.</p> <p>Each new group, it\u2019s interesting there\u2019s such a different dynamic for each group that comes. I get so much different value from each one. Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cWhich group is your favorite?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cEach one is so unique, there\u2019s so many different reasons. It\u2019s just amazing how it all just works.\u201d Anyway, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just grateful and blessed to have a chance to be part of this, and be able to facilitate it. It\u2019s insane. I gotta pinch myself. I can\u2019t believe this is my life right now. I get to hang out with all these amazing people.</p> <p>So that\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m heading in, so I wanted to give you guys, I\u2019m driving right in the sun, I literally can\u2019t see anything. The car in front of me, I\u2019m just looking at his tires, hoping that he doesn\u2019t slam on his brakes, because I cannot see his brake lights. Anyway if I die, if I crash, that is why. I\u2019m driving into the sun.</p> <p>Alright, so I got a big insight that I got yesterday that I thought was kind of cool. The Perfect Webinar, as you guys all know, it\u2019s perfect. The only time it doesn\u2019t work is when people screw it up. Because it\u2019s perfect, you don\u2019t mess with the Perfect Webinar. It\u2019s perfect. In fact, if you don\u2019t have a copy of the script yet, got to perfectwebinarsecrets.com, I actually owned perfectwebinar.com but it expired somehow and some dude bought it and wanted to sell it back to me for like 20 grand. I\u2019m like, you know what? I\u2019m going to buy perfectwebinarsecrets. Take that, $10.</p> <p>So if you haven\u2019t got the script go get it. We over the last two and a half years here in the Inner Circle stuff; we\u2019ve gone deep with people. I can\u2019t even tell you how many millionaires have been created from the Perfect Webinar Script, which is so cool. In fact, Expert Secrets, the whole book, is basically focused on building out the perfect webinar, but it goes insane deep. Perfectwebinarsecrets.com gives you the script and the psychology behind it. When Expert Secrets comes out it\u2019ll give you how to build your cult based on the perfect webinar. So cool. I mean culture. I can\u2019t even wait.</p> <p>One of the big insights I had yesterday, which was interesting and I\u2019m excited to test and I hope some of you guys will as well. If you look at the Perfect Webinar Structure, it\u2019s based off convincing somebody of one big idea. What\u2019s the one big domino that if I can convince them of this one thing, then they have to give me their money. For example, if I can convince you that you have to have a sales funnel to make money online and that Clickfunnels is the only sales funnel software on earth. If I can convince you of that, then you have to give me money. There\u2019s no other alternatives.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the goal, every business. How do you create that one belief. If I can get them to believe this, then they have no choice but to join my cult-ture. They have to. So that\u2019d be the first part of Perfect Webinar, and again I talk about it in the original script, I know that. It took two years of working with hundreds and hundreds of people on their webinars to figure that out. That\u2019s number one, figuring out that. What\u2019s the one big domino that if you knock down that domino everything else becomes irrelevant? It either knocks down every domino or they become irrelevant. So that\u2019s the number one thing to figure out for your perfect webinar pitch, or any pitch. I say webinar, because I always talk about webinars. This is actually the point of this podcast that this works outside of webinars. But I digress.</p> <p>Let me step back, so that second thing after the big domino, I gotta get someone to believe that. So there\u2019s a lot of things we do to cause that belief. Seriously the guy in front of me just stopped in the middle of the road. Come on.</p> <p>So there\u2019s a lot of things to do. We talked about the epiphany bridge story. We talked about how we tell the stories to get people on the same state that we\u2019re in when we had that epiphany. These are all things I\u2019ve talked about tin the podcast in the past. If you look there are typically 3 core beliefs that keep somebody from believing whatever your big domino is you\u2019re trying to knock over. The first thing is they have to believe in the vehicle you\u2019re trying to convince them. So I had to get people to believe in funnels. Then I had to get them to believe in ketosis. You had to get them to believe in membership sites, whatever it is that have. You have to convince them of the vehicle, the right vehicle. So that\u2019s secret number one, tied to their false belief pattern around the vehicle and convince them the vehicle is right.</p> <p>After you convince them, yes the vehicle is correct, I do need funnels. Ketosis is a way for me to lose weight, whatever that thing is. Then the second thing that happens, people are like, \u201cThat\u2019s cool but I don\u2019t know how to use a funnel.\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s cool but I can\u2019t not eat candy.\u201d So the second one is that you\u2019ve got to break down their false believes about their internal believes. What do they believe about themselves? \u201cI can\u2019t do this because I\u2019m not technical.\u201d Or because, \u201cI don\u2019t have willpower. You gotta convince them, it\u2019s so easy, you can do it. Let me show you why and how.</p> <p>So the second secret is always tied to a belief in the internal self. Third secret is typically tied to some external thing. Well I believe funnels is the way, I believe I could use Clickfunnels, but I don\u2019t know how to get traffic, so even if I did it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Okay, I believe that ketosis is the way for me to lose weight, I finally believe that I have the will power to do it. The problem is my spouse. My wife makes me chocolate ice cream for breakfast everyday and there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to stop. Or whatever, what\u2019s the external things you\u2019re going to blame it on? Because after a while people are like, \u201cWell I could do it, but this thing over here is causing me to not have success.\u201d So you gotta figure out what\u2019s the external belief and smash that one too.</p> <p>And then you transition to the stack, the pitch, the close, all that stuff. There\u2019s like a five minute run-down of the perfect webinar that is hopefully, if it\u2019s the first time you heard it, you probably have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. If you\u2019ve gone through a little bit, you\u2019re just like, \u201coh Russell, just went another level deep.\u201d So I hope that helps. If it didn\u2019t help go get perfectwebinarsecrets.com, watch the video and then come back and listen to this and this is just the next layer on top of that.</p> <p>And again, when the book comes out, it\u2019ll go deep. Deep in a cool way, not like a nerdy deep when you\u2019re so lost and confused where you\u2019re just confused. But deep like, you\u2019re like, \u201cThis just gets cooler and cooler every page.\u201d Hopefully. That\u2019s the goal.</p> <p>So I digress, once again. Sorry ADD coming back. Alright so the whole point of today\u2019s podcast is during Inner Circle I had some epiphany. Obviously I perfected the perfect webinar standing on stages in front of a big audience trying to sell them stuff. Which is the best way to master a skill because what happens when you\u2019re in front of a thousand people trying to sell something? Either they stand up and run to the back of the room and give you money or they don\u2019t. There\u2019s no way to fake that. Everybody can see.</p> <p>So after being humiliated on stage multiple times, not selling anything. I thought I have to master this. So I spent about two years of my life on this circuit. On the road speaking and perfecting this thing and it\u2019s still always evolved, as you can tell from today, it keeps evolving. But initially it came from me onstage speaking and selling. So that\u2019s kind of where it started and then it transitioned over to tele-seminars, which was awesome and then it transitioned over to webinars.</p> <p>So I call it Perfect Webinar, but I almost feel like I\u2019m cheapening it by calling it that. In fact, in the book I\u2019m trying a different name for it. It\u2019ll still have the word perfect in it though, because it is perfect. Don\u2019t screw it up. The Perfect Webinar, we\u2019ve done it on stage, teleseminars, webinars. So a little while ago I wanted to see, \u201cI wonder if this work in sales videos?\u201d so I did a couple of sales videos. We did one in our market. We did Funnel University, we did it as a sales video. I just created one for Have It All Moms, which is a weight loss product we\u2019re part of. A couple of other places, and guess what? It worked as a sales video script. In fact, I think it\u2019s superior to any other script ever.</p> <p>In the DotCom Secrets book I call it, star, story, solution, but it\u2019s not as good as Perfect Webinar. I gotta think of a name because you don\u2019t want to be like, \u201cHere\u2019s my VSL webinar.\u201d No. so obviously VSL is truncated, it\u2019s shorter, stories are faster, but it\u2019s the same pitch. Identical, in fact you\u2019ll be able to see those soon. The Funnel University one\u2019s a longer one. It\u2019s almost like a real webinar. But I\u2019ve done ones on Facebook Live that are shorter. I\u2019ve done ones, Have It All Moms is about a 25 minute video I think. It\u2019s compressed but it\u2019s the same process.</p> <p>You take them through, what\u2019s the one big domino? What\u2019s the vehicle? What\u2019s the internal believe? What\u2019s the external belief? Move them through the stack and create an irresistible offer. So that\u2019s kind of how it works.</p> <p>Yesterday, one of the guys showed me that he did a whole product launch, kind of like a product launch but not really. He didn\u2019t want to go create a whole webinar because he\u2019s like, \u201cIf I do a webinar and it\u2019s 2 hours long, and I do it and people don\u2019t buy, I don\u2019t know what spot kept them from buying. I didn\u2019t know, so I didn\u2019t want to do a webinar until I figured it out.\u201d So what he did, it\u2019s John Hutchinson by the way, he\u2019s a super cool dude in the financial market. So he went and recorded a video of each thing, so the intro and a video of secret one, secret two, secret three stack, and then close. Then he made it, I\u2019d say a product launch, but it\u2019s not really a product launch.</p> <p>But he drove people to the first video and they watched it and then on the video it\u2019s like, \u201cclick here to go to the next page.\u201d Or \u201csee video number two\u201d. Clicks there, boom takes them now to secret number one, then click to secret two and secret three and then click to close. So what he did, he was watching what happens between video one and video two. Video two and video three. So he could see, where\u2019s the drop off point? What is not inspireing people to go to the next step?</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting is the transition from video one to video two and video two to video three sucked and three to four, four to five and five to close were amazing. So he\u2019s like, I know the last two thirds of my webinar is flawless but the first third is boring people because they are not progressing at a high enough rate. So he\u2019s going back now and tweaking those things. He\u2019ll keep testing it and eventually turn it into a webinar.</p> <p>But I thought that was really smart, really intelligent way to think about things and look at things. And while he\u2019s doing that, all the sudden I had this thought. Some of you guys may know this, some of my emails recently have been super long. I hired this dude named Levi and what we\u2019re doing is, when I write emails and I write them out, I don\u2019t know why I hate writing email copy. And I had these cool storied, but I get annoyed writing copy so I just truncate them so they\u2019re not cool. So I hired this guy Levi and I vox him an email. So I\u2019ll send him a ten or fifteen minute vox, he transcribes it, tweaks it, cleans it up and turns into an email, throws it in the auto responder, I read it, make a couple of tweaks, re-read it and click send, which is why I\u2019ve had a whole bunch of these 2,000, 3,000 word emails that are converting like crazy.</p> <p>Just telling stories, the way I would tell a story if I was talking in person. I thought what if, what if I did the Perfect Webinar as an email sequence? Email number one is addressing the big domino and telling my first epiphany bridge story. Email number two was secret one. Email three, secret two. Blah, blah, blah. Like that. And I was like, \u201cHoly crap this is the perfect webinar in a five day email sequence. This could be as good, if not better than even actually doing the actual webinar.\u201d How insane is that?</p> <p>So what I\u2019m going to do, I\u2019m going to test this either next week, or the week after. I\u2019m not sure when. I will try to return and report my results to you, but basically I\u2019m going to vox Levi all of the emails in a five email sequence that goes through the perfect webinar and send them out and we\u2019re going to see what happens. My thought is it\u2019s going to be amazing. So I\u2019ll find out, and I\u2019ll report back to you.</p> <p>The moral of this story is that this perfect webinar script, as perfect as it is for webinars, is the perfect selling script. The perfect selling system, the best way to create and present a pitch or an offer since the history of mankind. I don\u2019t want to take the credit for rediscovering how sales should work, but I\u2019m going to take credit for it right now. Just kidding.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, I was trying to hire all these researchers to go and figure out who was the fastest growing non-VC backed SASS platform in the history of the world, and I realized there\u2019s no way to test that because if they\u2019re not VC backed they don\u2019t have to report the numbers so there\u2019s no way to know. I have to realize that I think I am the number one and if I\u2019m not, someone should come challenge me. But I\u2019m going to just tell everyone that I am from now until the rest of time. So if you guys wonder what Clickfunnels is, it\u2019s the fastest growing non-VC backed SASS company in the history of the world. And I\u2019m sticking to that until somebody proves me wrong, because I\u2019m pretty dang sure I\u2019m right.</p> <p>Same thing with this. I\u2019m going to call this the greatest sales something, something\u2026\u2026..nothing cool yet. I\u2019m going to think on that. If any of you guys have an idea, shoot it over to me because I honestly wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u2026when I was putting this together, Steven Larsen on our team was like, \u201cthis redefines how sales as a whole should be done forever.\u201d I was like, \u201choly crap, it is.\u201d It\u2019s so amazing. I\u2019m excited for it. I\u2019m proud of it.</p> <p>I cannot wait for you guys to have the Expert Secrets book, but until then go to perfectwebinarsecrets.com, go get the script. It\u2019s $4.95 shipping and handling. It\u2019s free. I think we order form bump the power point slides, which I know that 47% of you will take that, because it\u2019s the greatest up-sell order form bump I\u2019ve ever had. So thanks for that. But you\u2019ll get the power point keynote slides, so you can just rebuild your webinar quickly.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s an up-sell where we did a three day event on a perfect webinar. I\u2019d recommend getting that too because in that course, at one of our Ignite events I had 100 people in the room and I actually did the perfect webinar live on stage with an audience. We made like $30 grand and everyone watched me do it live and it was super, kind of intimidating and scary. But that whole video\u2019s in there of me doing it. So you can see not only me doing the pitch, but see from how I stand, how I actually deliver it. All that kind of stuff. I hope it helps.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m at the event center. I gotta bounce. I am one minute early. That\u2019s actually not too shabby. Appreciate you all and we will talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "15:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_271.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1478127879, "title": "Episode #270 \u2013 DON\u2019T Outsource Your Love Making", "author": "", "summary": "<p>You wouldn\u2019t outsource your love making, why would you outsource this?</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about how the marketing part of running a business is comparable to the sex part of a marriage.

I\u2019m feeling a lot better. I gave you guys a podcast yesterday while I was a little bit stressing out. Today\u2019s a new day, it\u2019s beautiful outside. Halloween was amazing, I\u2019m feeling good. So no one will stress about me, pressure is gone and I\u2019m back to a million percent. So I\u2019m really, really excited.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to be heading out to go hang out with the inner circle members and I can\u2019t wait. The next four days are going to be amazing.\u00a0 I pinch myself knowing that this is my life. I get to wake up, go hang out with entrepreneurs from around the world who are changing the world in their own little way and they paid me to be here, which is crazy. I would pay to be in this room and I\u2019m hanging out with these rock stars, it\u2019s awesome and I\u2019m loving it.</p> <p>I\u2019m driving in right now to go hang out with those guys. It\u2019s interesting, I gotta something to share with you guys. I hope that\u2019s alright, I hope you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve never really done client work before, until just recently on a couple of projects. Mostly because I\u2019m using my super power, ninja funnel building skills to win friends and influence people. I look at Tony Robins, I built him a funnel. We built Dave Asprey a funnel. We built Milt Strauss a funnel. We built five of Marcus Lemonis\u2019 companies funnels, we built the Flex Watch funnel. With Funnel Hacker TV we\u2019ve been building funnels for people.</p> <p>Anyway it\u2019s the first time in my life where I\u2019ve done other people\u2019s stuff. Not going to lie, it\u2019s not my most favorite thing on planet earth. I would rather just do my own stuff all day long. But because of circumstances, that\u2019s been happening and I\u2019ve done a bunch. It\u2019s interesting, very, very interesting. In fact, I think I mentioned, I did a rant last week about people wanting me to do their funnels for them and stuff like that.</p> <p>Yesterday one of my friends, they have a really successful ecommerce business and they lead a blog and did that. Someone on their team is trying to figure out Clickfunnels and that person is frustrated. They started to email us and the subject line was \u201cClickfunnels limitations.\u201d I thought it was so funny. \u201cThe limitations in Clickfunnels is, we can\u2019t up-sell people into our Shopify store.\u201d I can\u2019t even\u2026..It just made me laugh.</p> <p>Because we built Clickfunnels because of limitations of a traditional shopping cart. You can\u2019t do anything important. All you can do is have a random store with a bunch of crap in it. And this girl is complaining to them and it just got back to me. \u201cClickfunnels is too limited.\u201d Are you kidding me? The only thing that\u2019s limited\u2026I told them, \u201cThis girl sounds awesome, but she\u2019s all concerned about a couple of pennies over here, but if she would just turn her head there\u2019s tens of thousands of dollars over there. And she\u2019s tripping on these pennies because she\u2019s getting all caught up on that. But if you look at it from a different perspective, turn your head a little bit you\u2019re like, \u2018Holy crap, wait. Screw those little pennies. There\u2019s a crap ton of money right there. Let\u2019s run that direction instead.\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019m trying to explain that to them. And then one thing while I was talking to him, I sent them an email and then I recorded an audio to explain to him a little more. I said something to him, just the top of my head that all the sudden was a big aha moment for me. What I told him, \u201cSo you guys have this company that\u2019s doing well and you want to grow it. The problem is you\u2019re outsourcing the marketing.\u201d I understand outsourcing the fulfillment of the marketing, but outsourcing this strategy of the marketing to somebody that doesn\u2019t understand it. If you look at the marketing and the sales, that piece of it, that is the sex of business. It\u2019s the most pleasurable, most fun, best thing in the world. That\u2019s how you get customers. That\u2019s the best part.</p> <p>Then afterwards you\u2019ve got customers, now you\u2019re going to soccer games, you\u2019re doing homework and all the other stuff, and if your kids are awesome like mine then it\u2019s amazing. But the reality is the best part of business is not the fulfillment of the products, or anything else, it\u2019s the selling. That\u2019s the best part. And I was like, \u201cLiterally, right now you are outsourcing your love making. Why on earth would you ever do that? That\u2019s the best, most important part of the entire business. Everything else is just the stuff you have to do so you can go and have sex again.</p> <p>I apologize for those listening like, \u201cRussell, you\u2019re my nice Mormon friend. Why are you saying these things?\u201d But it\u2019s true. Think about this you guys. That\u2019s what that is, and if you are outsourcing the strategy for your marketing, you are literally outsourcing your love life. How well do you think your marriage is going to be if you are outsourcing that piece? It can\u2019t be good. It doesn\u2019t matter, it cannot be good.</p> <p>What I\u2019ve found with all these people I\u2019ve built funnels for, not all but for the most part, the one commonality is the entrepreneur is the artist who\u2019s good at doing the thing. So their trying to outsource their love making and they want their company to grow. You cannot do that. You can\u2019t. If you outsource that in your marriage it would not grow. And this is the exact same thing in business.</p> <p>Again, you could hire people to do that actual fulfillment, but you as the entrepreneur, has to be able to think through the strategy because that\u2019s the key. That\u2019s the most important part of this entire business. People always laugh. \u201cRussell, I\u2019ve got this kind of business, I don\u2019t know if what you do would even work for me.\u201d Are you kidding me? What I do works for every business. It\u2019s the strategy behind it. You can give me any product off the street and I can plug it into one of our strategies and it would work.</p> <p>I\u2019m driving down the street and I can a payday loan place, a cigar walk-in place, there\u2019s a cabinetry place, an ink place. What else we got? Home furniture, the DMV. For every business there I drove past except for the DMV, their screwed because they\u2019re run by the government, which is a whole other story for a whole other day. Every other business, I don\u2019t care which one, you could hand it to me and I\u2019d plug it into one of our strategies and it would work. Because I understand that piece of it and it\u2019s the most important part.</p> <p>So I told my friend, I said, \u201cLook the people I like working with are companies that the entrepreneur still runs the business and the entrepreneur is obsessed with the marketing of the business.\u201d And I started thinking about that. Hey tomorrow I get to see the Inner Circle members and guess what? The one commonality with every single person in our Inner Circle is that the entrepreneur still runs the company and the entrepreneur is obsessed with the marketing of the business. And guess what the commonalities between all those companies are? Holy crap, they\u2019re successful.</p> <p>I don\u2019t care what it is you do right now. You could be selling fish, you could be selling McDonalds, whatever it is does not matter. Until you become obsessed with the marketing of that thing, you\u2019re going to struggle. You will hit plateau\u2019s you will not be able to grow because you\u2019re outsourcing your love making. And until you take that back in and take the responsibility and the own-ness on your shoulders, you are going to struggle consistently until you do that.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my message for you guys today. If you are an entrepreneur listening to this and you run your company and you\u2019re obsessed with the marketing, which I\u2019m guessing if you\u2019re hanging out and listening to me you probably are a little bit into that. And if not you\u2019re going to be getting more and more into it.</p> <p>I would say become obsessed with it. That is the only thing that actually matters in a business. So crazy is the fact that in 2008, the economy\u2019s crashing and everything, and my friend works for the marketing department of some company and the economy started collapsing so what do these morons do? They went and they fired the marketing department because it was too expensive.</p> <p>Do you guys see any problems with that? That\u2019s like driving a car and it\u2019s about to run out of gas, and you\u2019re like, \u201dCrap, I can\u2019t afford gas.\u201d So you stop putting gas in it. And what happens? The car stops running. It\u2019s a self fulfilling prophecy. It\u2019s insane. They fired the marketing team because they were tight on money and the whole company, bankrupt. How do you not see that one coming?</p> <p>I remember there was a Dennis Leary stand-up comedy thing one time. He was talking about different deaths. He was like, \u201cDid you ever hear of Lou Gehrig? He died of Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. How did he not see that one coming?\u201d That\u2019s how I feel. Oh crap, our company\u2019s struggling, lets fire marketing and sales. They cost the most. They\u2019re the only ones that actually matter. That\u2019s what gets customers to give you money, which makes everything else work. Everything else is fulfillment. And obviously your fulfillment has got to be good or the customers will not come back to you. You can sell something amazing once, but if the support and fulfillment is not awesome, that\u2019s the other side.</p> <p>There is value in that, just like after you\u2026\u2026in your marriage, then you have kids and your kids are amazing and there\u2019s so much value and blessings that come from that. But if it wasn\u2019t from that act. You cannot have a family unless you have sex, it\u2019s impossible. Look around, there\u2019s a whole bunch of people around. They all got here the exact same process, without any exception. There\u2019s only one way it comes in. Same thing, the only way cash comes into a business, is through this one thing. If you are outsourcing that piece to somebody else then your marriage, your business is in trouble.</p> <p>So now it is time you guys, to take it back upon yourself and say, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been trying to outsource this, but I care enough about my business, customers, and the fact that hopefully I want future customers someday, that I\u2019m going to make this my priority.\u201d So the next question, \u201cHow do I do that? How do I geek out on this?\u201d</p> <p>First off, hopefully keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Listening to my podcast, reading my book. There\u2019s other great marketers out there as well that you can geek out on. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m the only one, because I\u2019m definitely not. There are people way cooler than me. But plug in somewhere and study and learn and become obsessed and think about it. If you sit there and just think for a while, it\u2019ll be amazing all the ideas that kind of pop into your head. And that\u2019s the core piece you guys. Nothing else really matters. So whatever business you are in, realize that the only business you are really in is the marketing of that thing. It\u2019s the only business that actually matters because the other business of the thing that ou actually do, will not survive long, will not get into the hands of people. Will not change people\u2019s lives or the world unless you become obsessed with the marketing of that thing. That is the commonality among everyone successful that I work with.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, I was talking to one of my buddies., BJ Wright, he was talking about how in business there is the is initial lift off time where it takes an entrepreneur with pigheaded disciple who doesn\u2019t have any logic or reasoning to go and to push this thing into orbit. And it\u2019s hard for those of you guys who have done it or are doing it right now, you know it is not easy to lift one of these puppies off the ground. It\u2019s just like there\u2019s a rocket on it. A rocket goes off and you look at the space shuttle, there\u2019s this spaceship and there\u2019s all these huge rockets and so much force and momentum and inertia to get it out of the atmosphere and eventually you get it out into where it\u2019s in orbit. Where it\u2019s not being sucked back down by the gravity of it all. It\u2019s in orbit, hanging out and floating around the world.</p> <p>At that point you can go plug in the Harvard MBA\u2019s and all the professional people and that kind of stuff. What\u2019s funny is at that point unless they totally screw it up, you\u2019ve got enough momentum, you\u2019ve got enough critical mass that it\u2019s going to survive. I\u2019ve got, I\u2019m going to pick on some companies, one really good example of a company here in Boise. I have so much respect for the people who began it and some of the people who run it. They\u2019re in kind of this boat and it\u2019s Clickbank. Clickbank, there was a time when it took a lot of initial inertia to get it off the ground and get it into orbit. And now it\u2019s up there floating around the world and the moon like a satellite. It\u2019s out there.</p> <p>It\u2019s amazing how many things that these Harvard MBA\u2019s to bring in to run it, how many things they have done to try to destroy this thing. For those who have used Clickbank over the last 5 or 6 years, you\u2019ve seen it. They\u2019ve done so many things, it\u2019s almost like when Trump gets up and starts talking and says something. You\u2019re just shaking your head like, \u201cAre you serious? You said that? Why don\u2019t you think for 5 seconds before you start talking? It would save everybody a whole bunch of headaches.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s kind of the same thing. Clickbank does thing after thing and it\u2019s just like, wow. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that they were already in orbit this whole thing would be crashing into the earth and it would be done. It would be dead. But they have so much critical mass, some entrepreneur\u2019s worked their butts of to get into orbit, no matter what these people do, it\u2019s really hard to break a business. And that\u2019s when you outsource your love making. When it\u2019s in that spot and it\u2019s gonna be alright.</p> <p>But everything prior to that, it\u2019s got to be you. You are the only one who cares enough to be like the 3 huge rocket things that with the jet that push it into orbit. That\u2019s the hardest part. You can\u2019t pay somebody to do that because they don\u2019t care enough. It\u2019s not just something like\u2026\u2026I think that\u2019s why\u2026..you know how anti-VC money I am, but that\u2019s what screws up most businesses. You get this person with an idea, they then get someone to come in and give them, here\u2019s $5 million. They strap on these rocket engines and it shoots into orbit. Now plug in all the MBA\u2019s and the MBA\u2019s freaking screw it up and it\u2019s not really in orbit because there was no foundation built by an entrepreneur to shove that thing up into the atmosphere. And these companies collapse.</p> <p>That\u2019s the Dotcom Secrets bubble over and over and over again. Nobody freaking pushed that thing into the atmosphere. Someone just cheated and bought their way in and because of that, these companies collapse. It\u2019s rare that you get companies that survive that.</p> <p>I got a long ride this morning, you guys. You have to bear with me, we\u2019re at 14 minutes, that\u2019s like twice the length of a normal podcast. I hope that that makes sense. And I hope that it inspires you as the entrepreneur to get your mind back into the marketing of your thing. Because you are the few that will get into orbit and someday it will be up there and you can plug in some MBA\u2019s and they\u2019ll screw it up for you but it won\u2019t matter because you did such a good job getting it off the ground that at that point it doesn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>But today\u2019s the time for you to become obsessed with the marketing of that thing that you do. And that\u2019s the most important thing you can do. There you go guys. I hope that that helps. I got eleven minutes til Inner Circle starts and I\u2019m stuck in freeway traffic not moving. So my friends in the Inner Circle, if you hear this and I\u2019m not there yet, I apologize, but I\u2019m hustling and I will be there soon.</p> <p>With that said, you guys, I appreciate you all. Thank you for being entrepreneurs. Thank you for focusing on your marketing. Thank you for caring about your customers because if it wasn\u2019t for people like you, the world would not keep spinning. It would keep spinning literally,\u00a0 but\u2026..it would be in trouble.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking as we\u2019ve got this whole election thing happening in the next week or so, how messed up we really are. There\u2019s no hope. No matter what happens, its bad news blues either way. The only thing we can control is what we do and ho we market our business and how we change people\u2019s lives. So quit focusing on the election, it doesn\u2019t matter, your vote doesn\u2019t count. Just kidding it kind of does. I\u2019m going to vote, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t stress about that, it\u2019s so far out of our control. Focus on what is in your control.</p> <p>The government is going to jack it up. They\u2019re going to give us new rules, a new set to play. It\u2019s like you\u2019re a kid and you\u2019re playing a game with your sister and you\u2019re thrashing her, and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh wait, the rules just changed.\u201d And she\u2019s changing them and then for a while she starts thrashing you and then you figure out the rules again and then you win.</p> <p>Wrestling is the same way. When I was in high school, we used to cut a lot of weight. I was cutting about 30 pounds a week. I would weigh in on Monday at 160 and I would wrestle on Friday at 130, so I was cutting tons of weight. Then my senior year two kids actually died. Two or three kids in a month period of time at the college level died cutting weight. So they changed all the rules, which they should. It was great, and it\u2019s been a thing that\u2019s been good for wrestling.</p> <p>But they had these new set of rules of how to make weight and they were ridiculous at first. I would have had to wrestle heavy weight based on their rules. I was no, I got to be a 165 pounder. So I\u2019m in college and the first year everyone is freaking out because no one can make weight and it\u2019s all jacked up. But then within a couple of months we figured out the system and how to beat it. And even with us beating the system it was still better for wrestling, first off. Don\u2019t say that\u2026\u2026..it\u2019s awesome. We figured out how to bend the rules. What we found out, so the way that\u2026\u2026..sorry it\u2019s a long commute, you guys get all the stories in full detail.</p> <p>So the way that the new rules would work is that basically you come at the beginning of the season and they test your body fat percentage and then you had, they test your body fat percentage, and you had to wait, and then you had to do a hydration test at the same time. And based on that they give you a calculation of what you\u2019re able to cut your weight down to. The problem was, you come in and they take your body fat percentage and that\u2019s first thing. The wrestlers were skinny. I was like 7 percent body fat back then. The more your body fat percentage was, the more weight you are able to cut, because they figure if you\u2019re a 5 percent body fat, what would you be at? And that\u2019s how they figured out the ratio. So what we learned is someone does a pinch test and they have to pinch you, if you flex your muscles, it pops you up about 3 or 4 percent body fat. So we figured out one way to try to tweak the system.</p> <p>Number two is if any of you right now were to go take a hydration test like the test we had to take, you would fail. It\u2019s literally impossible to pass hydration tests. Unless you sit there and you drink four or five gallons of water right before. So what\u2019s the problem, a gallon of water is 8 pounds. So just to pass hydration test, you basically have to gain 8 pounds, which is all sorts of messed up. So we\u2019d fail our hydration test, but we had so much weight that we couldn\u2019t hit the metrics.</p> <p>So finally one day, I don\u2019t know who the genius was that figured it out, but somebody figured out, \u201cHey what if we get super hydrated, drink a whole bunch the night before, come in the next morning, don\u2019t pee, hold all that hydrated pee inside your bladder and then go put on your plastics and cut weight for 12 hours, lose 15,20 pounds, then when you go to do your hydration test you\u201d\u2026\u2026because you had to do all three of these things at the same time, body fat, hydration and the pinch test. So then you got this hydrated pee in your body, even though your body is completely dehydrated, but your bladder is full. So basically for 12 hours, you\u2019d have to pee so bad, you were going to die because you just drank a gallon of water the night before. You\u2019re like, I\u2019m going to die literally.</p> <p>But you have plastics on, weight cutting. 12 hours your cutting weight and you\u2019re trying to hold this pee in, and then you go and you do your hydration first, so you pee and all the pee in your bladder\u2019s completely hydrated because it\u2019s from the night before, and then you pee out 8 gallons, so you lose 8 more pounds and then you lost the other 15 pounds through cutting weight that day, and then you flex on pinch test and move between those three metrics, now you\u2019re able to hit the weight you need to hit.</p> <p>So it\u2019s like, the rules are going to come out and they\u2019re going to suck, but as soon as we think through we\u2019re going to find a way. And as entrepreneurs that\u2019s what we do, right? I mean, the wrestlers figured it out, and I love my fellow wrestlers, but we\u2019re not the sharpest group of males in the bucket, you know what I mean. So we figured that out, I just know the entrepreneurs, the government is going to jack things up. Raise taxes or change things or do stupid things that only make sense to people that aren\u2019t us, and it\u2019s going to suck for 5 minutes. We\u2019ll figure out a work around and be back to normal. So don\u2019t stress about it, just stress about learning how to market your thing better because that\u2019s the only things that\u2019s really going to matter.</p> <p>So there you go guys. We are twenty minutes in and I am right close to the hotel. So I\u2019m going to leave for today. Hopefully you got your money\u2019s worth and a whole lot more. Now if you guys ever need to cut weight you know the secret, which is pretty awesome. I hope that helps. Alright guys, I will talk to you soon. See you guys later, bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "21:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_270.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1478029707, "title": "Episode #269 \u2013 Look What Happens When I Start Coaching Myself", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Intimate, behind-the-scenes, message from Russell to Russell.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about being under a lot of pressure and tries to coach himself through it before turning off \u201cBusiness Russell mode\u201d and turning on \u201cDad mode\u201d for his kids\u2019 Halloween activities.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things you\u2019ll hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>What are some of the things Russell has committed to that are making him feel the pressure.</li> <li>How Russell coaches himself through the pressure and what some of things he can do that will relieve it.</li> <li>And why it\u2019s important to remember that no matter how busy he is, that he should always make time for family.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how Russell plans to relieve some of the pressure he\u2019s currently under.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone this is Russell Brunson and I\u2019m excited to have you here for Marketing In Your Car. It is Halloween, which is my favorite holiday and it\u2019s one day that I look forward to most in the year. It\u2019s funny because so far today has been a tough one. It\u2019s 2:17 and I\u2019m heading to the kids school for the Halloween parade that I\u2019m really looking forward to, and then the Halloween stuff tonight.</p> <p>I\u2019m just curious, people always ask me all the time, \u201cRussell, how do you get so much stuff done.\u201d And I usually pride myself, I can usually handle a lot of weight on my shoulders, but today collapsed a little bit underneath that weight. I know we don\u2019t normally talk about those kind of things, but I just want to kind of talk through it because it\u2019ll make me feel better probably.</p> <p>But on the other side, hopefully it helps you guys somehow. Who knows? It\u2019s funny, Dan Gable, he\u2019s the Michael Jordan of wrestling. I was watching a thing one time when he was coaching, you know he was one of the best wrestlers of all time, but also one of the best coaches of all time, of any sport. He won like 20 or 30 NCA championships in a row. Someone asked him I f he believes in pressure. He said, \u201cWell I believe that pressure is there, I just don\u2019t believe in putting myself underneath it.\u201d I think for the most part, I try to take that approach. I\u2019m not putting myself under pressure. Its there, but I\u2019m dodging it. I\u2019m getting around and we just keep moving forward. But today was one of those days where I thought I could get all just hit on my shoulders, and I just couldn\u2019t handle it all. It\u2019s actually good that I\u2019m leaving.</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of crazy. We had the Inner Circle last week for 4 days, which is so much fun and I love it. It\u2019s hard though at the same time, because it\u2019s four day, pretty much 5, pretty much a whole week that you\u2019re not in the office moving things forward, so there\u2019s stuff happening, especially when you\u2019re running a big company there\u2019s a lot of stuff. And usually we have a couple of weeks between each mastermind, but this time, because the timing sucked, they had to be back to back. In fact, mastermind starts tomorrow. So basically I had one day today, well part of a day, til 2 to get it done, all of last week and all next week.</p> <p>So basically after that I\u2019m kind of out of commission again. I had a whole bunch of stuff I\u2019m trying to get done. Today was like, \u201cHey Russell, you\u2019re here.\u201d And the brunt of everything is all falling and its tough because\u2026..oh and then this weekend, we\u2019re trying to get the Expert Secrets book done in time for the live event. And they told me to do that we\u2019d have to have it all done in the next two weeks. Which means I have to have it all done this weeks, which means, we don\u2019t have this week to do it. So I spent all day this weekend editing the book. I spent all day yesterday, and I spent half of today and so far I got the introduction and part of chapter one done. So I\u2019m totally stressing about that because if I don\u2019t have the book for the event, it throws off this huge timeline sequence of events around that, so that\u2019s kind of crazy.</p> <p>And then for my church, I\u2019ve got two callings. I am the eleven year old scout master, and I\u2019m also the secretary for a group called the Elders Quorum, so that\u2019s two assignments. And then we called yesterday, they called us and asked if my wife and I would take on the ward Christmas party, which means basically you\u2019re in charge of throwing a party for 500 people. Plus my wife also has the company Christmas party a week after that. So it\u2019s like, there\u2019s new pressure there.</p> <p>If I told you all the things I\u2019m doing, most people wouldn\u2019t believe me. There\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff on the Clickfunnels side. There\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff on the sales side. I\u2019ve got tons of Inner Circle members messaging me questions. It\u2019s fun, I love going back and forth but sometimes it adds up. Right now I\u2019ve got probably 30 messages from Inner circle members on Voxer that I\u2019m behind. Half of them will be here tomorrow so I\u2019m stressing, trying to catch up on those.</p> <p>And then the Funnel Hacker TV episodes we\u2019ve been filming, it feels like a lot of the entrepreneurs we\u2019re doing stuff for coming back needing help and getting stuck and can\u2019t move through the process and need me to rewrite webinars or review things or check things. And then I got, I feel bad, one of the guys on my team, he wrote a book and wanted me to write the forward for, and I\u2019ve been telling him for two or three months I was going to, but I haven\u2019t had time. So today he was asking me about that, and to meet about something else. All these things and it was just like, all these things just came to a point today where I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>So yes, I feel pressure. Yes, some day\u2019s it\u2019s tough. Some day\u2019s it\u2019s really, today was really tough. Not gonna lie. It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m so excited to go see my kids in the parade, but I\u2019m feeling guilty because of that. I have so much to do, but what\u2019s the point of doing any of it if I can\u2019t go to my kids Halloween play? That\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m at right now. But I don\u2019t want anyone to be concerned about me.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, any time I do a podcast where I kind of rant a little bit, seems like I always get people messaging me trying to help. It\u2019s not that I need that; I just need a place to vent. And hopefully it gives you guys whatever it is you need. Because I know all you guys go through that as well. We all do it, where there\u2019s so many things happening. I\u2019m the king of over committing. I get so excited by things so I say, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll do this.\u201d And it gets to a point where I can\u2019t handle it all.</p> <p>Anyway, so before I left the office, there\u2019s a couple of things. I tried to buy myself an extra two weeks on the book, which is relieving pressure. I haven\u2019t heard back, but I just kind of trying to go back to all these commitments that I have and place more realistic timelines, and cutting some things out and do things like that. And it\u2019ll be good. By the time we\u2019ve got mastermind this week, which again, I\u2019m so excited. Two groups are coming, it\u2019s going to be nice. For me to just unplug and stop stressing about everything and just hang out with some amazing entrepreneurs.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t normally care about politics too much, even the stress of this election. Because I\u2019m stressed out if either side wins. I don\u2019t want either of those, the election\u2019s coming. I\u2019m really excited to hang out with entrepreneurs who are trying to change the world, for the next four days. I\u2019m looking forward to that, and it\u2019s going to be good.</p> <p>I\u2019m just going to kind of\u2026..I think one of the problems that I have, one of the things that make me good at what I do, it also becomes one of the constraints, is I\u2019m really good at placing\u2026I\u2019ve talked about this a lot in different trainings. Lead or Gold. I set deadlines for myself of when things have to happen. Sometimes I forget in my mind that I set those deadlines, and they\u2019re not actual deadlines. So I think it\u2019s me coming back to a lot of my lead or gold deadlines for things I have and re-shifting them, which is against what I tell you guys to do. It\u2019s like, set a lead or gold deadline and don\u2019t deviate from it unless you\u2019re going to kill yourself. I tell you guys that because it\u2019s true for me. When I set a deadline, this has to happen this day. It HAS to happen that day.</p> <p>It becomes so real for me, that I put myself in insane amounts of pressure because of that. For me, things come back and I just got to tonight, hopefully get some extensions like on the book and a couple of things like that. And then kind of reset some timelines. I gotta get better at telling people no. I get so excited about opportunities and everything that I just say yes to things way too easy. So I gotta get better at the magic word no.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m coaching myself. If one of my Inner Circle members voxed me the last 7 minutes, I know exactly how I\u2019d coach them. So I\u2019m kind of coaching myself as if I\u2019m me. \u201cSo Russell, the first thing I would do is, you gotta set realistic expectations. I know you think you\u2019re the man, but you\u2019re not. You can\u2019t survive everything. The second thing I would do is, you gotta go back to the people you made commitments to and you gotta tell some people no, and it\u2019s going to be hard, and it\u2019s going to hurt their feelings sometimes. But it\u2019s not personal, and you know it\u2019s not. You just have to tell them it\u2019s not and you love them. It\u2019s just not possible. You\u2019re going to crack and everything will fall apart for you and for everybody if you don\u2019t. So that\u2019s the second thing I would do.</p> <p>The third thing, Russell, that you should do is, you need to get your book extension. If you\u2019ve got to pay more money, whatever it takes to just tell them that you gotta make the extension and that you will pay whatever it takes to make that work. And that money will hopefully help solve that problem, get that out of the way. With these other people, you\u2019re working with in Funnel Hacker TV. Remember these are businesses you\u2019re helping with; you\u2019re not doing those businesses, so you need to put the owners back on them. Get them to work harder, get them to think through things. You can\u2019t answer every question for them. And they need to understand that. Let them kind of run with it and just do it. And that\u2019s going to help them grow more. You\u2019re so stressed about them making money that you forget that it\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s about growth for them. And if they don\u2019t grow, every time you take your eye off the focus, it\u2019s all going to collapse on them again. Help them understand that.</p> <p>Leverage people on your team, everyone wants to help you, and sometimes you\u2019re scared to ask for help because you know that everyone is doing so much anyway and you just think you can add it to your plate and not worry about it, but they\u2019re there to support you and help you so make sure you leverage them. Because again, if you\u2019re not able to handle this, it\u2019s really bad for all of them. They\u2019ve put their lives, and hearts and soul into it as well and it\u2019s important that they do what they need to do and you do what you need to do. And they want you to be there. So those are the things I\u2019d recommend Russell. I hope that helps. We\u2019ll talk soon.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s how I\u2019d vox myself. So there\u2019s my advice for myself. Hopefully take it for yourself as well. I actually feel a lot better just saying that out loud. So thank you guys for bearing with me. The other things that\u2019s interesting, we talk about hiring consultants all the time and it\u2019s funny, we\u2019re always like, \u201cWell if we\u2019re going to hire a sales consultant, what would we tell ourselves?\u201d And usually we know all the answers. You guys just saw me do it here live, I just consulted myself. You should try consulting yourself the next time you have an issue and you\u2019ll probably solve all your problems.</p> <p>So with that said, I\u2019m at school. I\u2019m about to run in and go see my kids dressed up\u00a0 as Halloween costumes, which is going to amazing and a ton of fun. And everything else is going to fade away and I\u2019m going to get into a state and be with my kids and family right now. Business Russell is turning off because none of that stuff actually matters, and Dad is turning on because that\u2019s what matters.</p> <p>With that said, you guys don\u2019t forget the famous quote from David O McKay. \u201cNo success can compensate for failure in the home.\u201d So go to your kids Halloween parties, have some fun. Talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "11:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_269.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1477514568, "title": "Episode #268 \u2013 Why Don\u2019t You Just Build Your Own Funnels? \u2013 Part 2", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Continuing my thoughts from yesterday\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about a couple in the Inner Circle group that has implemented the things they learned at the last Inner Circle meetings and how building a culture has worked for them. He also apologizes to people he may have offended in the last podcast.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What kinds of things Brandon and Kaylin did to help build their cult-ture, and why they are the best implementer\u2019s ever.</li> <li>And why Russell didn\u2019t intend to offend people with the last podcast, and why he is just trying to motivate.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how you can follow Brandon and Kaylin\u2019s example to build your own cult-ture.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and I am heading home from the first days of the inner circle, which were just amazing. I\u2019m a little tired, a little worn out. I have two more days the next two days. I gotta get some good rest, start over the party tomorrow with the next group of our awesome members. I\u2019m looking forward to it.</p> <p>But I just wanted to do a couple of things. First off, I know before I headed in Monday, I talked a little bit about the fact that I want people taking the stuff and running with it. And I had a couple of people who messaged me afterwards. I wasn\u2019t speaking to anyone specifically, but as a whole. I want everyone believing more in themselves, and that\u2019s the message I was trying to get out. I was probably ranting a little bit, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t anyone to think that I was mad at them specifically, but I do want people to believe that you\u2019re good enough now. You\u2019re ready, you can do it.</p> <p>Hopefully that was the message you got, because that was the message that was intended. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s interesting, in our coaching program that\u2019s a commonality. I do a lot of coaching, but the majority of it is really people asking for permission. \u201cHey, I think I should do this, what do you think?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d Or maybe not.</p> <p>That\u2019s what a lot of people need and I get that. I\u2019m in the same spot. I\u2019ve got my coaches in different aspects of my life, but I would say for most people, give yourself permission. You can do it, you\u2019re good enough. Use that as fuel on that side, and hopefully there was nothing negative that you guys got from that. That was not my intention. Sometimes I push record, and I\u2019m in a weird mood. But there you go.</p> <p>So a couple of cool things from Inner Circle today. One thing that\u2019s interesting that I\u2019ve found, this is kind of funny. You know how when you learn from somebody and you see them from afar for a long time and their name is their name. For example, Mark Joyner is my first mentor, so I always called him Mark Joyner, Mark Joyner, Mark Joyner. So the other week Mark was out here working, in fact I\u2019ll say it right now, I felt awkward. When Mark Joyner was here, it was funny because Brandon who was doing video stuff, he kept calling him Mark. I was like, \u201cHis name isn\u2019t Mark, its Mark Joyner. Why are you disrespecting him like that?\u201d\u00a0 And that\u2019s how I felt. And I realized that. I didn\u2019t think much about it until I realized recently almost all of the Inner Circle people, when they say something to me it\u2019s never \u201cHey Russell\u201d it\u2019s always, \u201cHey Russell Brunson\u201d and I think it\u2019s interesting and I totally get it.</p> <p>For me Mark Joyner was always my mentor. Dan Kennedy, Tony Robbins, I never called him Tony. That felt awkward calling him that. It\u2019s kind of a fun thing I\u2019ve noticed. Tons of people here keep calling me Russell Brunson. It\u2019s funny because in your normal life, you never call somebody by their full name, but in those situations\u2026..it\u2019s so fascinating to me. I thought it was kind of cool.I definitely look at that as a term of endearment, which is kind of cool. So I\u2019ll leave that there.</p> <p>And then the last cool thing I\u2019ll share, and then I\u2019m almost home which is kind of nice because I need some sleep. With our Inner Circle group, we have a Monday/Tuesday group and then a Wednesday/Thursday and then on Tuesday night we have a big dinner with both groups. So we just did that tonight, just got out of it.</p> <p>And it was cool because Brandon and Kaylin, at the last Inner Circle meeting one of our big things, and if you follow along with the podcast, I\u2019m sure you heard it. It was all about building your cult-ture and what you have to do to build that up and grow. And it was really, really cool, they are some of the fastest implementers that I have ever met, hands down, ever. So they basically went home. On the flight home they were like, \u201cOkay we\u2019re building a culture.\u201d And they changed their branding, their name, their Facebook, everything. They re-did in the last four months, and they came back tonight and showed, \u201cThis is everything we\u2019ve done based o three months ago, to build our culture out.\u201d And it was amazing.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in the Inner Circle, we Facebook live it in the Inner Circle Facebook Group. So you guys who are Inner Circle members can go watch that. And if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s time to join the Inner Circle, what are you waiting for? Oh, maybe the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s sold out. Maybe you can beg your way in if you\u2019re not in it yet.</p> <p>It was amazing, thing after thing. I was taking notes as fast as I could and it was amazing. The coolest thing is the result of them focusing on building a culture and all these kind of things. Its crazy, there churn decreased by ten percent, which is hundreds of thousands of dollars. They now do these, kind of like our Funnel Swag t-shirts we do. They do these Lady Boss Swag launches where they\u2019re like, \u201cWe have this new t-shirt designed. There\u2019s a hundred in these sizes. Go. First come, first serve. When they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.\u201d They sold $25,000 in t-shirts in 24 hours and then closed it out.</p> <p>They\u2019re doing those kinds of things and they\u2019re using it to sell programs and to upsell things to upgrade and to get people to actually fulfill and get things done and lose weight and there\u2019s all this built in accountability. It was amazing to see what they created just from this thought that we had about building your culture.</p> <p>So for any of you guys who heard me talking about that over the last few months, it\u2019s time to start running and doing like they do. Because man, 3 \u00bd, 4 months later, to see what\u2019s happened because of that and because of their action based on that has been amazing. So there you go guys. I\u2019m doing it, if you want watch Brandon and Kaylin, they\u2019re doing it. A bunch of other people in our group, they\u2019re doing it. Time for you to do it as well.</p> <p>So there you go. I\u2019m at home you guys. Appreciate you all for an amazing night. Know that I care about you guys and that if I ever say anything mean, it\u2019s not to be mean but it\u2019s to hopefully get you guys to take action. Because you are good enough, you can do it. The people that you serve deserve it. So there you go. Thanks everyone, have a good night and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "06:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_268.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1477340113, "title": "Episode #267 \u2013 Why Don\u2019t You Just Build Your Own Funnels?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>You\u2019re good enough now!</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about why people in his life that ask him for help building funnels should just follow the blueprint he has laid out, and then they can\u2019t fail.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>How many friends have asked Russell to build funnels for him in the last 10 days.</li> <li>Why it\u2019s not that hard to build funnels yourself if you follow the guidelines that Russell is handing over.</li> <li>And why its important for everyone to learn how to build their own funnels for their own business.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how Russell figured out that building funnels for other people is really a disservice to them, and why he doesn\u2019t want to do that.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey this is Russell Brunson and welcome back to Marketing In Your Car, you guys. Glad to have you here. I am on my way into the first of four Inner Circle Mastermind meetings that are happening in the next two weeks, which is kind of exciting. It\u2019s actually really exciting for a couple of reasons.</p> <p>First off, as some of you know, depending on when you are listening to this, we are in the middle of the elections, which is pretty much a train wreck. The good news is that I\u2019m in a state where everyone always votes republican, therefore no has to run any advertising here, therefore I don\u2019t have to see any of the ads, which actually I would like to see the ads. I\u2019m sure they are hilarious and funny and depressing all wrapped into one. But I want to see that.</p> <p>I don\u2019t get a lot of the noise of the election, which is kind of nice. I\u2019m sure, especially a lot of you guys in swing states are getting bombarded by it. The second thing is that we\u2019ve got, as you know, 100 people in the Inner Circle, which means there\u2019s 25 people coming today and tomorrow. 25 people the next two days and then next week we\u2019ve got 25 and 25.</p> <p>So the next two weeks before the election, I\u2019m going to be stuck in a room with a hundred of the coolest entrepreneurs on earth. All of which, I don\u2019t know the right verb or noun, but all of whom are trying to change the world in their own little way. They are looking at what\u2019s happening around the world. They\u2019re turning the tv off and saying, \u201cI could be better.\u201d</p> <p>They are trying to be a positive change and impact on people\u2019s lives and companies and it\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s what I get to do and completely flush out the noise of the media and spend time with people who give me hope and faith in the world. Because to be completely honest, there\u2019s sometimes I look around and I don\u2019t have much hope or faith in people or in the world. So I\u2019m just excited and grateful for those who are in the Inner Circle, to be able to spend this time with you guys.</p> <p>So first off, thank you. I\u2019m excited to be with you guys here, for those who are inner circle members. And it\u2019s been fun. One of the things I do every Inner Circle meeting is look back at the last 4 or 5 months since our last meeting, and look at what are the coolest things done, have had the biggest impact. Looking at those things, what are the coolest things I can share? So it\u2019s been fun kind of putting those things together the last day or two. Printing out little handouts and getting people ready to show some cool stuff.</p> <p>So I don\u2019t have time obviously to go deep into all those things, I\u2019m going to spend probably 2 or 3 hours today showing everybody the cool stuff. Then we\u2019ll have everybody else share all their cool stuff, which is so fun. So I basically get everybody\u2019s ideas over the next 8 days. It\u2019s going to be insane, I love it. I\u2019m so excited as you can probably tell.</p> <p>But the one thing I wanted to message to you guys about, there\u2019s been this really weird, recurring theme over the last 10 days of my life. It started, today\u2019s Monday morning, just to give context. So it started a week ago Thursday, so about ten days ago. So from Thursday til the next Sunday, like 4 days, in those 4 days 6 people in my own personal life, so this is not talking about Clickfunnels members, because I\u2019d say the number if you did that would be about 10x. But 6 people in my personal life all came up to me about partnering with them on sales funnels.</p> <p>And they\u2019re all close friends and I don\u2019t want to just, I\u2019m talking down about any of them, because they\u2019re all amazing people with great ideas. But they\u2019ve all consistently come to me with basically, \u201cI\u2019ve got this idea, lets partner on it together and we\u2019ll split the money.\u201d And I get those deals all the time from Clickfunnels members, to be completely honest.</p> <p>We probably get a dozen or so requests a day, if not more. We just can\u2019t answer them, we just ignore them or tell them no. But it\u2019s weird; it\u2019s strange when it\u2019s like your friends. Even friends that didn\u2019t even know what funnels were or what I did or anything. I see them randomly at soccer games and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, so\u2026.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, come on.\u201d</p> <p>So what I want to tell them and you and everybody listening, is something that\u2019s very, very, very important. I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time, which is why I think people want to lean on me. \u201cHey Russell, do this or help with this.\u201d I want you to know that I have been giving as many clues and hints and cheat sheets and blueprints and things as possible for you guys to look at and to model and to copy. I don\u2019t know what else I could possibly do, besides just doing it for you, which doesn\u2019t serve you, it doesn\u2019t serve anyone. You have to learn this process, and if you don\u2019t want to learn this process then you shouldn\u2019t be doing this. You should go back and do whatever you want to do.</p> <p>I don\u2019t go to my friends who are doctors and be like, \u201cHey man, so this is the deal, I\u2019ve got the flu, I want to cut myself open. Can you help me cut myself open? Just real quick show me how it works. I know you know you know how; you went to medical school for 12 years. I know you know how to do it.\u00a0 Just come over, show me how to do it real quick, so I can do it. Or just do it for me, cut me open.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not how it works. You have to earn it. In fact, it\u2019s been interesting since I\u2019ve seen, and it\u2019s kind of one of the downsides. I\u2019ve had people and I\u2019ve gone and helped them. A really good example, and I\u2019m just going to be blunt. The guys at Flex Watches. We came in and just did their whole thing for them, gave it to them, it was on The Profit. It was really cool. But the problem is that since we short-cutted all the thinking for them, now they\u2019ve got this thing and they don\u2019t know what to do with it. And they can\u2019t figure it out because they didn\u2019t have to earn\u2026.I just ran a red light. Crap.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t have to earn this, they just got it handed to them. So because of that, now they can\u2019t think on their own. They can\u2019t figure out the next step. All these other things they\u2019re stuck on. They just messaged me yesterday, \u201cHey Russell, um, it\u2019s not working very well. What should we do?\u201d if you would have created it, you would have thought through these things, you would have seen the vision and all those things. IF I just hand it to you on a silver platter, you miss all that, which means that I get tied into doing it over and over again.</p> <p>And every single person I\u2019ve done that with, and I\u2019m seeing it a little bit now with some of the Funnel Hacker TV episodes, where we just build a funnel and hand it off to the entrepreneurs. Same thing, we hand it off, but they haven\u2019t thought through all those things and now it\u2019s almost like a disservice to them by doing it.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t want to do that. You guys are smart enough now to do this on your own. For some reason everyone wants permission and I\u2019m going to give you permission.\u00a0 You are good enough today. You can do this. You just need to go and do it. You don\u2019t need me helping. You don\u2019t need me doing it for you. Yes, that would be great for me to do it all for you, and I totally understand that, but that\u2019s not what this is all about. Because if I do that, you don\u2019t learn what you need to learn.</p> <p>You cannot truly serve someone, I don\u2019t believe, unless you learn this side of the business. This is the only really important part of the business, is the marketing. The marketing of the thing is so much more important than the actual thing. I know I\u2019m going to offend people with that. \u201cNo, my things the most important thing in the world.\u201d And it is, but unless you\u2019ve mastered the marketing of that thing it doesn\u2019t matter because no one\u2019s going to know about it.</p> <p>\u201cBut Russell, I outsource my marketing.\u201d Are you serious? That\u2019s like outsourcing your love making. What\u2019s the point of being married if you just outsource that crap? That\u2019s the best part. Don\u2019t you understand? Why in the world would you outsource that part of it? It\u2019s the most important thing. It is more important than the thing you were actually selling.</p> <p>So it\u2019 s time for everyone to stop having excuses and stop saying, \u201cI wish Russell would do it, or someone else would do it.\u201d It\u2019s time for you to bite the bullet and just figure it out. It\u2019s really not that hard.</p> <p>So this is what you got to do. First off, read the Dotcom Secrets book, 5 times. And I\u2019m not saying that because eI like my book. Literally study it. That\u2019s 12 years of my life put into a book. So you can go and read 500 books like I did and 300 courses and spend 10 just looking at it, or you can get the cliff notes. If you haven\u2019t read my book at least 5 times, you haven\u2019t read enough. You don\u2019t understand these concepts.</p> <p>So there\u2019s number one, read the book over and over again. Number two, I would say go\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m trying to get my parking ticket in the parking garage. Sorry about that. I\u2019m driving a stick uphill, it always stresses me out.</p> <p>Number two, now that you\u2019ve done that you\u2019ve got to become a master. You need to funnel hack a lot of people. So you need to go buy a bunch of people\u2019s products, to see the process. Buy my products, not because I want you to give me money, I do, but that\u2019s not the purpose. The purpose is that I want you to see what a good sales funnel looks like over and over and over.</p> <p>Spend a thousand bucks. \u201cBut Russell a thousand dollars, I can\u2019t afford that.\u201d If you can\u2019t spend a thousand bucks at this point in your life, you need this more than anyone. You need to go find a business partner who\u2019s got a thousand bugs, who\u2019g going to let you funnel hack other guys. Because if you don\u2019t have a thousand bucks at this point to invest in your business, you don\u2019t have business having a business. I understand that, I\u2019ve been broke. When I got started I was completely broke, but you\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get money. Because if you don\u2019t invest something you can\u2019t do it.</p> <p>Third off, get a Clickfunnels account. \u201cOh Russell, it\u2019s so expensive.\u201d Are you kidding me? It\u2019s not expensive. Holy crap, I can\u2019t believe\u2026.when Frank Kern heard we launched Clickfunnels, Frank Kern said, \u201cYou should charge $5000 a month, minimum for this service.\u201d And he was dead serious. I was like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to make it $97 a month.\u201d And he was like, \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it anyway.\u201d And we did it anyway, and guess what? And then there\u2019s a $300 a month Actionetics. And people are like, \u201cI can\u2019t afford $300 a month.\u201d</p> <p>You are running a business. This is the foundation for you running the world. $300 a month, if you can\u2019t afford that, once again, go get a side job until you get $300 a month extra. It\u2019s only $30 a day. If you get a job paying\u00a0 $15 bucks an hour, 2 hours a day extra to pay for the foundation for your entire company. Or find a partner or something. But you have to have that.</p> <p>Now I remember back when I got started, because I couldn\u2019t do it for $300 a month, I had to have a programmer and a webmaster and host and a designer, all these things that you no longer have to have. Do you understand that?</p> <p>Third off, I\u2019d recommend you guys get certified. The Clickfunnels certification program, even if you\u2019re never going to sell funnels for other people, is amazing. It\u2019s like school. It forces you to do homework assignements and be accountable and actually do something. It would be so good for you guys. If you\u2019re not going through our certification program yet, do you hate money that bad that you don\u2019t want to learn and master this skill? Go to cfcertified.com, go through the webinar, sign up for the certification program. It\u2019s a little expensive, but it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s a lot cheaper than college or type of tuition you\u2019re doing, but go and do it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m at. There\u2019s a bunch of things. This is the key guys. It\u2019s time to immerse yourself. It\u2019s time to stop relying on Russell or anyone else. I\u2019m putting out as much stuff as possible. I\u2019m doing Funnel Fridays, I\u2019m doing this, I\u2019m doing that. Funnel Hacker TV\u2026I\u2019m doing as much stuff as we can, not because I want to get a whole bunch of people who want me to build a whole bunch of funnels. I don\u2019t want to do it. I want to build my own funnels.</p> <p>I want to give you guys so much inspiration, so many clues and blueprints and just ways to master the skill that you can\u2019t possibly fail. The thing is you gotta geek out on it. You gotta get excited. You gotta say man, this is the most exciting part of this entire business, this piece of it. Then start immersing yourselves in it. Immersion is the key. Because this stuff is not that complicated, but you gotta be excited about it. You gotta get into it and look at it from many different angles and it\u2019s time to look at it as a business.</p> <p>When you do that, you can do this. It\u2019s not that hard, it\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s funny, people keep asking me, \u00a0I had a guy interview me the other day, \u201cWhat\u2019s the future of funnels?\u201d There\u2019s no future of funnels, it\u2019s the same as always. Simplistic, easy, powerful funnels. Look at my funnels, they\u2019re all simple, easy, they all convert, and make money.</p> <p>Which kind of funnel should we use? There\u2019s one of five funnels. If you read the Dotcom Secrets book, there\u2019s millions of funnels you could make, I only use six funnels. That\u2019s it, some variation. All my products are variations of 5 or 6. Master those 6 six things. It\u2019s a finite number. It\u2019s not some moving target that gets bigger and bigger. It\u2019s very finite. This is what you have to master to be amazing. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>So there you go. I hope that I didn\u2019t offend too many of you guys, but what I want you to understand is first off, you are good enough right now. This stuff is not super hard, but it does take some focused immersion time. The more you can immerse the better. Start with the book, if you have no money just buy the book. Dotcomsecretsbook.com, immerse yourself in that. Read it 5 times.</p> <p>That\u2019d be number one. Then as you can invest in things, invest in more. Just reading the book will give you guys the foundation and the strategy and then you can go deeper with funnel hacking people. Then you can get software, then you can go and try to get certified. But I would keep looking at this as an investment. Keep reinvesting into yourself because that\u2019s the key to how this whole game is played.</p> <p>You guys have it easy, seriously. I don\u2019t know how many more times I can just give you guys funnels that are pre done or show you funnels over and over again. I didn\u2019t have that when I started and I\u2019m not that smart. I guarantee almost everyone listening to this podcast right now, is smarter than me. Guaranteed. The only thing that I do is I\u2019m really good at modeling.</p> <p>I look at what people are doing and say, \u201cWow that\u2019s awesome. How can I model that?\u201d And I don\u2019t copy; I hate people that copy things. But how can I model it, how can I make it better? How can I put my spin on this concept? But I model and I don\u2019t deviate from the model that\u2019s working. I just make little tweaks and make it my own.</p> <p>I\u2019m through building a funnel for one of the Funnel Hacker TV episodes and guess what I did? I found a funnel from 7 years ago, it was one of our best converting cold traffic funnels, took that and I modeled it and it looks identical to that one. Because that\u2019s how I do all my VSL ones, they\u2019ve all been identical because that\u2019s how VSL ones convert. So I don\u2019t try to deviate or make up my own thing, I just do it the same way.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that helps you guys. I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m at the hotel and I\u2019m going to go check in and hang out with the Inner Circle guys. We\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "15:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_267.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1476724397, "title": "Episode #266 \u2013 What\u2019s Your Morning Routine?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A play-by-play of what I got done this morning before most people were even awake.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about his morning routine and what has been working for him.

Welcome back to Marketing IN Your Car. I appreciate you guys hanging out with me. I\u2019m heading into the office right now and I\u2019ve had an amazing morning. It\u2019s 8:49, I have a meeting in 11 minutes with the entire Clickfunnels Dev team, which is exciting. We\u2019re making a big directional change today, which is always scary, fear and scary. But it\u2019s going to be the best for the customers, which is all that really matters when all is said and done. It\u2019s going to be good for you guys, so congratulations.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got 10 miles left until I\u2019m out of gas. I\u2019m hope I make it to the office before then, because I need to make it. And I\u2019ve had an amazing morning so far. I want to talk about it because we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but I think that the more I focus on it, the more everything else becomes more amazing. And it\u2019s your morning routine. In fact, I bought a domain; I think I bought, whatsyourmorningroutine.com. I think this week we\u2019re going to record my morning routine because people always ask me what is it and how does it work?</p> <p>There\u2019s some weird things I do and some cool things I do. I just wanted to show a little bit of all that put together. That is the game plan, so it\u2019ll be kind of fun. I want to walk you guys through basically what the morning routine looks like, because it\u2019s getting more and more exciting and fun and hopefully you guys get some ideas for yours.</p> <p>So the first thing I found out is your morning routine starts the night before. It\u2019s the hardest thing to get to bed on time. So I\u2019ve been trying to get to bed by 10 o\u2019clock each night. Kids go down about 9, and then I\u2019ve got an hour to just scramble and get everything done and go to bed, which is hard because I\u2019m a night owl. I\u2019m the guy that usually goes to bed at 1 or 2 in the morning. So that\u2019s been a big shift. And then days that I get to bed on time, everything works good. The day\u2019s I don\u2019t become really, really hard.</p> <p>So I\u2019m trying better. And on thing that\u2019s been helping a lot, Joseph Clough who is one of our Clickfunnels inner circle members, he built a custom hypnosis track for me. He\u2019s got an am one a pm one and a boost one for whenever in the day you need to take over the world, you listen to this other one. So it\u2019s been cool, every single night I go to bed, I listen to that. It\u2019s kind of getting me excited to go to bed each night because there\u2019s this really cool thing I\u2019ve been looking forward to and I get excited for it.</p> <p>So last night I listened to that. In the future I\u2019m going to try\u00a0 to\u2026.I have a float tank, so I\u2019m going to try to listen to it while I float at night. It\u2019ll be like float while I listen to that and then go to bed. This light\u2019s been red forever. The day\u2019s you\u2019re in a rush, the light takes forever to change.</p> <p>Anyway, sorry my ADD kicked in again. So that\u2019s how it began, and then fell asleep. And under my bed I have these pulse\u2026.I think it\u2019s called Earth Pulse. These electromagnetic fields that go under my bed. And it\u2019s kind of geeky and amazing at the same time to make you sleep better, recover faster and a bunch of other awesome stuff. So that\u2019s the night before.</p> <p>Then I wake up in the morning. I\u2019ve been setting my alarm for 4:45, I think I\u2019m going to start setting it for 4:30 though, because my pre-morning stuff seems to take longer than I hope. I keep thinking I\u2019m going to get done in 15 minutes, but it takes 20 to 25 minutes. Anyway, today was 4:45, tomorrow it\u2019ll be 4:30. So 4:30 my alarm goes off, I wake up, there are 3 major goals. One is thanks to Alex Charfen, hyper hydration. So I get a big Clickfunnels bottle full of water, I try to pound it as fast as I can, no matter how much it hurts and it usually hurts. I don\u2019t know how people do that, especially first thing in the morning. It\u2019s hard, drink as fast as I can.</p> <p>Number two I mix together like 30 different powders. A lot of them are like mushrooms and B Manna, and Green Drink and Red Drink and a whole bunch of powders, so I drink that. So hyper nutrition\u2019s number two. I want to get as many nutrients in my body as possible because I\u2019m not going to be eating until 2 in the afternoon, so I want my body to have as many goods as it needs to run off of.</p> <p>Number 3 is hyper oxygenation, which Anthony, my buddy at Biohackersguide.com, and Wim Hof. Wim Hof kind of developed this method, and Anthony recorded this really cool audio for me where I can just push play on my phone and then I can actually listen to Anthony coach me through the Wim Hof. So I sit in my backyard in the fresh air and I do it. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s what I dread the most in the day because it takes work to breathe hard, to hold your breath and all that kind of stuff, it\u2019s not my favorite when it happens but when I\u2019m done, it\u2019s the equivalent of having like 10 shots of caffeine. You\u2019re just wide awake and you feel good.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of what happens in the first\u2026.trying to get that all done by 5 o\u2019clock. So 5 o\u2019clock I hit the road running. I\u2019m trying to spend 30 minutes of spiritual time. So some of you guys may or may not know, I talked about this probably a dozen episodes ago, I wanted to buy a first edition Book of Mormon on ebay, but I didn\u2019t. But I almost did. I eventually did it.</p> <p>So right now I am actually reading the original copy of the Book of Mormon, one of the first 5,000 that were ever printed. Which for me, is totally geeking out. Most of you guys who are Mormon are thinking, that\u2019s awesome. The rest of you are thinking, that\u2019s weird, why would you spend that much money on an old book? But for me, it\u2019s awesome. So I\u2019ve been reading that in the mornings, which has been cool. Try to get at least 30 minutes of reading in there.</p> <p>And the last 30 minutes is, I try to nickname all my different times, so I\u2019m nicknaming this my\u00a0 big domino time. Where I have the next 30 minutes to figure out what is the big domino of the day. The big domino comes from Tim Farris, I heard him speak one time, \u201cA lot of people go and make these huge to-do list and try to knock out a million things. I usually just sit around for 3 or 4 days at a time trying to identify what\u2019s the one big domino and if I knock down that domino it makes every other domino, it knocks them down or makes them irrelevant. So that\u2019s been my bid domino time. Where I\u2019m planning and figuring out, for me to succeed today, what is that one big domino I gotta knock down? This funnel or this piece, whatever that big thing is and make that the priority and try to task out everything else to either help me knock down that domino or to get everything else off my place so I can focus on it.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be happening. That\u2019s kind of a new edition to the morning routine. From 5:30 til 6. Then at 6 o\u2019clock, at least on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Dave and Stephen and sometimes Brent and John show up and we go for a morning jog to try and get more oxygen pumping through our body and then we lift hard. We lift for about an hour, probably about 45 minutes. Really heavy because that\u2019s the way I like it. And then from there we jump in the Cryosauna, freeze the crap out of ourselves.</p> <p>And then go in and hang out with my kids, get them out the door.\u00a0 And then clean up and head out the door as well. At this point I still have not eaten anything, and I won\u2019t. It\u2019s 9 o\u2019clock. So I\u2019ll eat in about 5 hours from now and that\u2019s the first time I will eat. And it\u2019s funny because I used to always think, I have to eat to have fuel to have energy. But the interesting thing is if you are doing all these things, you get energy from oxygen, you get energy from the nutrients, you get energy from the water, you get energy from all these things. I don\u2019t even feel hungry anymore. It\u2019s kind of weird. I should be starving right now, and I\u2019m feeling pretty good.</p> <p>And my lunch time at about 2 o\u2019clock, I\u2019ll have the biggest salad known to man. It literally takes about 3 or 4 hours to eat. It\u2019s got kale, and peppers, avocados, salmon, and a bunch of other cool stuff. And that\u2019s\u2026.I eat that, and then I\u2019m not that hungry the rest of the day. Usually at night I\u2019ll eat some stuff because I like to socially eat with my kids and my family. And then start the process over.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my morning routine. So I think we\u2019re going to record it and film it and show all the fun stuff and intricacies and hopefully inspire a couple of you to tweak yours. It\u2019s been a fun development over the last 2 years trying to really think through it and figure it out and add things to it. I\u2019m still not perfect, not going to lie. But the days that I execute on it correctly, like today, I feel like a million bucks. I\u2019m excited to go in and conquer the world.</p> <p>So I hope that inspires you guys to kind of sit back and think through your stuff and figure out what your dream morning routine is going to be. Because when your day starts right, it ends right. When you start wrong, it ends wrong. I know that because the days when I wake up and go and get French toast for breakfast, the whole day is done. I get nothing done that day.</p> <p>The day\u2019s I wake up and Wim Hof breathe, drink a ton of vitamins and minerals and get some spiritual time in, and figure out my big domino are the days that I actually knock down the big domino. And the days that I get home and have energy for my kids and my wife and it\u2019s awesome. So there you go, you guys. So what\u2019s your morning routine, that\u2019s my question. Check out soon to a funnel near you. I think it\u2019s whatsyourmorningroutine.com. I\u2019ll be posting that here in a little bit. And it\u2019ll be fun to actually show you guys behind the scenes what I\u2019m doing and then hopefully get some of you guys inspired enough to go and do it on your own. That\u2019s all I got today. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "10:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_266.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1476389460, "title": "Episode #265 \u2013 HOLY CRAP\u2026 Step Back", "author": "", "summary": "<p>You\u2019re so close, you\u2019re actually missing it\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about having a breakthrough while trying to write a script for a video to sell Clickfunnels.

I hope you are as excited about today as I am, if not we gotta wake you up. What should we do? For me, if you guys want to know, there\u2019s a song that instantly gets me in state every time I listen to it, it\u2019s Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes. So if you\u2019re down right now, go get your Spotify account or go search YouTube or whatever, search that song and play it and it will get you ready for work. It does it every single time. In fact, we listen to it multiple times throughout the day. Every time my energy starts getting sluggish, the White Stripes bring me back and I\u2019m ready to march on. So there you go, there\u2019s one of my tricks.</p> <p>Alright so today, I want to talk about something, it\u2019s so interesting. I\u2019ve been selling Clickfunnels for a long time. Two years, it\u2019s been my focus. Been selling it and selling and we\u2019ve done pretty okay, we\u2019ve done amazing with it. Not going to lie. I\u2019ll pat myself on the back, I am proud of what we\u2019ve done. We are taking over the world and it\u2019s been really, really fun.</p> <p>We are stealing all of Leadpage\u2019s customers, which is not even a goal for us anymore because I\u2019m pretty sure we passed them in revenues and members and all that kind of stuff, so that\u2019s awesome. Target number one done. That was easy. Now we\u2019re going after InfusionSoft. That\u2019s the next thing. And they are scared of us, they keep us out of their partner con because they\u2019re like, \u201cYou guys are our competitors, you\u2019re stealing all our customers.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, what do you expect? Your software sucks.\u201d So that\u2019s target number two. I say, give us a year, we\u2019ll pass them and then we\u2019re going to keep on going. It\u2019s been really fun. I\u2019m having the time of my life. It\u2019s been amazing..</p> <p>With that said, I don\u2019t know about you guys, but sometimes you get so close to your own project, that you miss it. I\u2019m curious how many of you guys have felt that way. For the last two years, my argument that I\u2019ve been selling against has been that funnels are basically the evolution of the website. The death of the website was one of our promotions. \u201cWebsites are dead. Here\u2019s a funnel.\u201d</p> <p>And I kept trying to tie these two things together. This is a website, this is a funnel. In my mind they are both online properties. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been arguing it. Trying to convince people when I tell people, \u201cOh you know what a website is? Websites are dead. This is the evolution and it\u2019s called a funnel.\u201d And I keep going to this thing, and I thought that was the right way to sell it.</p> <p>It\u2019s so funny because, when you guys read The Expert Secrets book, which is coming soon to a funnel near you, it\u2019s funny. We have a whole section in there about how to structure offers the right way. We talk about how to build a cult-ture, and in there we talk about the three things that have to happen to become a vehicle of change. To become a vehicle of change, there\u2019s three things that have to happen.</p> <p>Number one, the charismatic leader, or attractive character. Number two is a vision of the future. Number three is a new opportunity. There\u2019s been no mass movements ever created on an improvement. Perry Belcher calls them improvement offers. An improvement offer is like, \u201cOh you\u2019re going to do this thing better.\u201d An improvement offer, first off they\u2019re very, very, very, hard to sell. Second off, you can\u2019t create a movement around that. And nobody gets excited. \u201cOh this is a better way to do a website.\u201d That\u2019s not the movement.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been pitching it and talking about it and coaching it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about. What I realized\u2026.actually let me step back. It\u2019s been fun, we\u2019re working on, I think I told you guys before, we\u2019re working with the Harmon Brothers, they\u2019re the guys that did the Squatty Potty commercial, and Fiber Fix and a bunch of other ones.</p> <p>Anyway, the Fiber Fix video when crazy viral but the funnel wasn\u2019t converting. So we just rebuilt it all for them, launched it and it\u2019s been live for 12 hours and so far we\u2019re more than doubling their old funnel, which has been awesome. So that\u2019s been really, really cool. But while we\u2019re working with them, we\u2019re trying to think about\u2026..we wanted to work with them because we wanted to do a cool video, like a Squatty Potty commercial for Clickfunnels.</p> <p>So how do we do that? Me and my team sat in a room for probably 3 or 4 hours trying to figure out the coolest way to pitch it, and every argument kept coming back to website vs funnel, website vs funnel. And it was hard, we could not figure out the right hook or right angle or anything. And 3 hours into this, I think it was by the time you\u2019re like there\u2019s so much pain because you can\u2019t figure out the right answer and your defenses start going down and you stop trying to think you know everything and all the sudden, that\u2019s when the magic happens.</p> <p>Which is why brainstorming sessions are so important. We come in with our own ideas and our own things we want to do and then no magic happens until we\u2019ve broken through and realized that you\u2019ve gone through your pride and you\u2019re like, \u201cHuh. I\u2019ve got to humble myself to figure out the answer to that one.\u201d So we got to that point and all the sudden I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, you know the book I\u2019m writing. Chapter six we talk about this\u2026the way we\u2019re pitching this is an improvement offer. A funnel\u2019s a little bit better than a website. That\u2019s not sexy, it\u2019s not motivating, it doesn\u2019t do anything for anybody.\u201d</p> <p>I thought, for an entrepreneur, a funnel is a new opportunity. I\u2019m about to use a bad word, but screw websites. The website is a dead antiquated thing that\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m not comparing it to that. You can have a website if you want. That\u2019s not our goal. Our goal is to build a funnel; it\u2019s a whole new opportunity. This is a thing you can plug into any product.</p> <p>You take any product, you plug it into a funnel and boom it\u2019s\u2026..it\u2019s not a website. A website does not do what a funnel does. It\u2019s completely different, this is a new opportunity. What\u2019s the difference between a website and a funnel? They\u2019re completely different. A website\u2019s some stupid thing you have over here that looks good. A funnel\u2019s how you make money. And positioning it as a whole new opportunity, and when we did that, the coolest thing about it is no longer will we have to make the argument of website versus funnel because it\u2019s irrelevant.</p> <p>I\u2019m not trying to improve upon the website; I\u2019m talking about a new opportunity called a funnel. If you are a new entrepreneur, or want to be, or a beginner or startup, whatever that is, this funnel is the new opportunity. When you understand the power behind this, it changes everything.</p> <p>And when we did that, it was like angels singing, lights come on and within 15 minutes we had the perfect script idea, concept, which we are working on right now and it\u2019s so exciting. I think I told you guys before, we\u2019re trying to get Jon Heder, the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite to be in the video. I don\u2019t know if that will happen or not, but if we do it\u2019s going to be amazing.</p> <p>Anyway, I just wanted to share that with you guys because my guess is that like me, many of us are so close to our projects that we\u2019re presenting it wrong. We went from 10,000 customers year one, to our goal of 30,000. We should hit that, we\u2019re pretty dang close to that, we got a couple months left. So we should hit 30,000. And then our goal for next year is to 3x it again and get to 90,000. And if we\u2019re completely honest, 90,000 is lame, I want 100,000.</p> <p>More than 3x next year. How do we do that. Well, we\u2019ve got to change the conversation, and it\u2019s moving away from stuff like that and transitioning over. Transitioning to this opportunity and explaining it to the right market that way. And that\u2019s the magic.</p> <p>In the Dotcom Secrets book I talk about hot traffic, warm traffic, cold traffic. So hot traffic, those guys bought Clickfunnels because it was easier. Warm traffic is where we spent the last two years, people that are already kind of entrepreneurial and already doing stuff online. How do we convince them that this is the solution to their answers. Now our next phase to be able to get to 100,000 is how to take it out there to people who don\u2019t even know this is a problem and presenting them with this new opportunity.</p> <p>When we do that, that\u2019s the magic. That\u2019s when it comes like, \u201cWow. I didn\u2019t even know funnels were a thing. Now that I see that my eyes have been opened. I have this vision of the future.\u201d And if there happened to be a charismatic leader involved, now they\u2019re part of a cult. That\u2019s the goal now.</p> <p>I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m so excited. I wish I could tell you guys more, because the idea for the sketch is so good. It\u2019s going to be Squatty Potty on steroids. I\u2019m excited. And we\u2019re actually doing this one, so it\u2019s kind of a funny story. It\u2019s kind of hard to explain. I\u2019ll just wait and let you guys\u2026.first off, if we get Napoleon Dynamite to be the character in this video, that\u2019ll be one thing and I\u2019ll be going crazy. I think we\u2019ll get him.</p> <p>And the second piece, obviously is just creating it all and putting it all together. It\u2019s such a good idea I don\u2019t want somebody to use it before we\u2019ve executed on it. Anyway, usually I\u2019m pretty much an open book. But this time I\u2019m holding this one close to the chest just because it\u2019s so awesome.</p> <p>Alright that\u2019s what I got. Appreciate you all. I want you guys to step back and look at your offers and think about that. Think about how you\u2019re positioning them, and get an outsiders perspective. Ask people. If I was to ask ten people, \u201cWhen you think of Clickfunnels, do you think of it as a better way to do a website?\u201d I bet most people would say no, outside of the people who are probably consultants who are trying to pitch it and have heard me pitch it that way. You know what I mean?</p> <p>We need to change that, we need to make this. For me, here\u2019s this new opportunity and for you guys, the same thing. Present your offers as a new opportunity, that\u2019s how you\u2019ll get engagement. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll increase your sales, everything like that. It moves you from being in a red ocean, which we talked about in the past. Where everyone\u2019s fighting over the scraps and there\u2019s blood everywhere to a new ocean where you are a category in and of itself. And when you\u2019re there it makes it really, really fun. Alright guys. That\u2019s what I got. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys again soon.</p>", "duration": "11:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_265.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1476307262, "title": "Episode #264 \u2013 Operation: Growth", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My game-plan for personal growth so that I can increase my contribution.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the six human needs that Tony Robins teaches about.

I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m so excited for today. A lot of cool things happening over here. First off, I woke up this morning at 4:45 and jumped in the float tank and did some floating and meditating. I haven\u2019t quite figured out the whole meditation thing yet, but I\u2019m trying. It\u2019s really hard. Maybe someday that will work. Regardless, I got to float in salt water, and it was warm like a bath tub for a long time, so that was sweet.</p> <p>I went and lifted weights with Dave Woodward, which was awesome, and then hung out with the kids, and now I\u2019m heading into the office. So a couple of cool things, one is we\u2019re doing this really cool project with Fiber Fix, is a cool viral video that went viral a little while ago, but their funnel isn\u2019t converting, so we\u2019re doing this swap with them. They\u2019re going to help us with this video in exchange for us helping them with their funnel, if we can beat their funnel. So the test goes live today and I\u2019m crazy, crazy proud of the funnel, so I\u2019m excited to see how that goes. So that\u2019s going live today, with a bunch of other things.</p> <p>But what I wanted to talk to you about today, because this is an exciting day, when I start talking and geeking out and getting really excited about it. And it kind of ties into something I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about, and I\u2019ve even done some podcasts about this. But I want to bring you guys in on this thing because it\u2019s going to be really cool and exciting.</p> <p>If everyone is doing it, we\u2019re all going to grow together. So you can choose to be part of it or not. But if you choose to be part of it you will see insane amounts of growth in your life. So here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, first thing, I need to set this up a little bit. If any of you guys have ever studied Tony Robins, one of the things he talks about is the six human needs. There\u2019s four needs of the body and two needs of the spirit. Our body, a lot of people never actually get their needs of their spirit met, they just don\u2019t because they never get to that level. But everybody gets the needs of their body met. So the needs of the body, I don\u2019t know how many times we have to go into this.</p> <p>Basically there are four human needs. Four needs of the body. One of them is significance. We need to feel significant. The opposite of significance is the second one, which is love and connection.\u00a0 So there\u2019s this internal dilemma we have as humans. We want to feel significant, look how great I am. But we also want love and connection, which is like look how great you are. There\u2019s this connection. So two of the human needs.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s, I\u2019m going to blank out right now\u2026.Love and connection, significance\u2026.then you\u2019ve got variety. We need excitement, change, all these things happening. But we also want certainty. So there\u2019s the other two human needs. Variety, which is craziness and new things, and then certainty which is like, I need to be certain in everything. So during this podcast, I don\u2019t have time to go into all of those things. I\u2019ve done some podcasts in the past and maybe I\u2019ll do some in the future because it\u2019s exciting. Part of our whole goal here on earth and in this life is to master our body.</p> <p>So understanding those first four human needs and how to create addictions and how to break addictions all through those human needs is fascinating and we could talk about that for a year, in fact, maybe I will sometime. But after you get the body mastered and figured out, the next step are the needs of the spirit. The first need of the spirit is growth and the second is contribution. I always think about this, there\u2019s times in people\u2019s lives where we need to grow. You go to school, you\u2019re growing. When you are starting new career, you\u2019re in a growth phase. There\u2019s a time in your life when growth is super important. But eventually you start to grow and some people get stuck in this. They learn and grow and study and they love going to school, they grow, grow, grow\u00a0 but they never transition to the next need which is contribution.</p> <p>When you\u2019re going through this growth phase, you\u2019re trying to become something. But eventually, if you just keep growing, the only person that benefits is you, which is kind of a selfish need when you look at it. But it\u2019s necessary because as you grow and as you become something more than you are now, then you can turn around and contribute that to other people. So you contribute in a lot of ways. As an employee, you\u2019re growing and then after a while that growth of what you\u2019ve learned you start contributing to your company and help some people.</p> <p>If you\u2019re an expert, for a while you\u2019re in a phase where you\u2019re trying to learn and become something and then you turn around and start teaching and coaching other people and now you\u2019re contributing. So there\u2019s this transition from growth to contribution that\u2019s fascinating. And again, we could talk about that forever, it\u2019s so exciting. But that\u2019s kind of what I wanted to do today.</p> <p>Dave and I are talking about today about a bunch of things we want to do. We thought how fun would it be to create a phase in our life right now where we get back to growth. In Clickfunnels, what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re in this huge contribution phase and we\u2019re contributing. And I feel like, me personally and everyone on the team\u2026..me personally, I went through ten years of growth, trial and error. Learning and studying and everything to be able to contribute at this level we\u2019re at right now. And the problem is that I\u2019ve seen this so many times from friends and mentors and people I know. There was a time where they grew and started contributing, but then they stopped growing and then the contribution stopped. And it freaks me out and I do not want to be that person who is not able to contribute anymore because I stopped growing.</p> <p>I think there is a cycle between growth and contribution. Because as you contribute you start growing. And then it grows and you\u2026.there\u2019s a really cool spiral that makes everything rise together. It\u2019s been a couple of years since I\u2019ve focused on my own personal growth. I do things here and there, things are happening where I\u2019m trying to grow. But not where I was like, I\u2019m going to go back and grow and really focus on growth for a period. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a month, six months, a year, two years. I don\u2019t know what that is, but I feel like right now if I focus more on growth, it\u2019s going to make my contribution bigger. So I\u2019m excited for that.</p> <p>I think back about the big growth phases in my life. When I first started this business, I went through a huge growth phase, where I was consuming for 18 months. I think we all do this, we consume, we learn, we\u2019re trying things. We aren\u2019t having success yet, but that growth we go through is what makes it so we can contribute and if we don\u2019t go through that, it\u2019s hard. In fact, it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s one of the things that\u2026.yesterday my coach, Tara that I was working with talked about. Some of the people we work with, we\u2019re giving them\u2026.we\u2019re building out a whole funnel and giving it to them and they didn\u2019t have to grow to get it, so their struggling to have the contribution and have an impact on their business because of that. There\u2019s value in going through that growth phase.</p> <p>So when I first started my business I went through this huge growth phase that got me from not knowing anything to, \u201cI now have something that I\u2019m selling online.\u201d There\u2019s a huge initial growth. And then I started selling stuff and it was awesome and it worked for a while. Then I kind of stopped growing and I was just contributing from the momentum I\u2019d gotten from my initial growth phase. And I was doing well, and probably the next year and a half, two years, I was in that contribution phase and was doing well. But then I started making enough money where I could start blowing money on courses.</p> <p>Right now, we\u2019re moving. We\u2019re about to move offices, so I\u2019m trying to clear off my 1,000 book shelves. It\u2019s insane. Everyone in the office calls me a book hoarder and a course hoarder. And I\u2019m totally hoarding these, but I went through this phase then for the next probably year and half, two years where I started buying everything. Literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in courses and trainings and books and CD\u2019s and everything. And I went through this time where I was just geeking out and studying everything.</p> <p>And what was cool at this point, I had this little business it was fledgling, it was kind of doing well enough to support itself and give me money for my addiction which became marketing books and courses. But as I would learn things I would immediately go back and apply to the business and we started growing. Probably two or three years I went through this phase where I was buying everything. All my money went reinvested back into education. And I was going through this huge growth curve which gave me the ability to contribute more.</p> <p>And after two or three years of that, then I stopped focusing on growth and started focusing mor eon contribution. It was good, and that\u2019s kind of what brings us to today. So I kind of want to stimulate a growth period in my own personal life and my team\u2019s life. I want to challenge you guys to do it as well. .This is what we\u2019re doing. Dave and I talked about it today, I\u2019m going to have a meeting when I\u2019m at the office and get everyone on board because it will be fascinating and cool.</p> <p>I\u2019ve basically been taking all of my courses, because in the move I\u2019m trying to clear off bookshelf space. I\u2019ve got hundreds of thousands of dollars in \u00a0courses that I\u2019m ripping all the CD\u2019s and putting them in audio format and putting them on my iPad and my iPhone. I\u2019ve got maybe 50 or so courses now that have been switched to that. I\u2019ve got every Dan Kennedy course ever created. Every Jay Abraham course created. Dan Solomen, Matt Furey, John Rees, Mark Joyner, all of the classics, all of the good ones. Everything.</p> <p>So now they\u2019re in a format where I can start consuming them. So I\u2019m going to do this with my team, I\u2019m going to get all the people that, not everyone geeks out with this, but there\u2019s a group that do, and I want to get the 5 or 6 of us together and say each Monday or Friday we\u2019ll pick a course and each person picks a different course. Then you\u2019ve 7 days to speed learn it. Go through it, take notes, study it. And then the next week later come back together as a group and say, \u201cOkay, what did you learn from this course?\u201d and have everyone share it. \u201cThese are the 5 or 10 things that I learned in this course that are applicable to us.\u201d</p> <p>So I just got this growth and I\u2019m going to contribute it back to you now, and we can contribute it as a company, now the growth flows into contribution. And I figure if there\u2019s 5 or 6 of us pounding through an entire $2,000 marketing course each week, I think the growth and contribution we\u2019ll be able to do is going to be insane. So that\u2019s part number one of this. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.</p> <p>I would recommend you finding a group of peers or friends or people in the Clickfunnels group, or people who work with you, but find a group and do this together. This is something that\u2019s hard to do by yourself. If you\u2019ve got some accountability it will be easier and better. It doesn\u2019t have to be a $2,000 course, it could be an audio book, it could be pounding through a book a week. It could be whatever that is, but find a way to compress decades of information into days.</p> <p>Tony Robins is the first person I heard say that, he said, \u201cYou can read a book that takes a decade of someone\u2019s time and energy and put in a format where you can consume it in a day, and you can literally learn in a day what took somebody a decade to learn.\u201d That\u2019s the power of books. That\u2019s what I want to do through here. I want each week for me to get a decade worth of stuff in a couple days. But multiply that by 5 or 6 guys on my team. I\u2019m getting half a century\u00a0 worth of stuff every single\u00a0 week.\u00a0 And as a team we\u2019re growing and contributing and it\u2019s going to be awesome. That\u2019s kind of the first step.</p> <p>The second step is, and I talked about this a little while ago, I want to, not just from a learning\u2026..Did you hear that car, some guy thinks he\u2019s way too cool. So that\u2019s the firs thing, the second thing, I don\u2019t just want to grow from a learning standpoint, that\u2019s a big piece of this. But the other piece I want to learn, is I want to grow in other aspects of my life as well. I\u2019m going to use this opportunity fo rboth.</p> <p>What we talked about doing today, Dave and I. And I talked about this a little while ago, figure out all the different tests we can take on ourselves to figure out where we are in things. So Wellness FX for example, has an amazing blood work. You can do all this blood work and they \u2018ll give you back this panel for everything, your testosterone levels, your fat levels, your cholesterol, everything. So I\u2019m going to go and I think Dave\u2019s going to go and try to get everyone else to go do\u00a0 a Wellness FX and get our initial blood work done, and I want to do another food allergy test. I want to do a 23 Me test, which is like, I actually already did that one. But everyone else is going to get a 23 Me test, which is going to tell you your genetics.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to make lists of as many different tests like that we can take. Personality test, we did a disc profile recently. Other ones like that and try to get baselines of all this stuff, so I get to become more aware of all this stuff. My body, my personality. The love language test, all these things so I have a better picture of where I\u2019m at to figure out where to grow from there. Half of growth is being aware of where you are today and most of us don\u2019t really know. We\u2019re kind of just wandering around bumping off things and hoping we\u2019ll eventually get to where we want to go.</p> <p>But the best way to get to where you want to go is having a map to help you get there. So we\u2019re going to be doing all these tests to figure out , here\u2019s the game plan and map of where we\u2019re trying to go. We\u2019re going to make an excel sheet and bust out as many tests as we can find. Personality, health, blood, urine tests, if that\u2019s what it takes. I don\u2019t care, whatever it is. Take tons of tests so we can get some baselines as well and from there make cool decisions.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m going to meet today with my team and see who wants to get in on it. And we\u2019re going to start going through a huge growth phase of our learning and also getting tests done to figure out where we\u2019re at and figure out how to evolve and grow from there.</p> <p>So we can grow more, contribute more, and help change the world even better. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve got some big visions to change the world and I feel like we\u2019ve just gotten started. Anyway, I hope this gets you excited, it gets me excited. What I would do is find 3 of your friends and have them listen to this podcast and become accountability partners. Each of you pick a book or a course a week or whatever it is and start mass learning and figure out how you can apply it to your businesses and figure out how you can apply it to your life. If you wanted to test things as well. There\u2019s a bunch of them, Wellness FX is a great one, it\u2019s kind of expensive. But you get all your blood work on everything, it\u2019s a good place to start. The Disc Profile is awesome. If you\u2019re in my inner circle, we\u2019re giving everyone in the inner circle the Disc Profile and Mandy is our, besides me, the other coach in the inner circle. She\u2019s coaching everyone through which has been amazing.</p> <p>But start finding those things so you can start getting baselines of where you\u2019re at on everything. It\u2019s going to be a fun project. So there you guys go, operation growth has now officially begun in my life. And it\u2019s now, you\u2019ve got permission to start on your life as well. I hope that helps you guys. I\u2019m at the office, I\u2019m going to go have my meeting. Talk to you guys soon, bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "14:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_264.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1476223011, "title": "Episode #263 \u2013 Coaching Yourself Through The Symptoms", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to become more aware of what\u2019s bothering you so you can actually do something about it.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the value of having coaches in his life.

I hope you are doing awesome today. I was up late last night. I went to a\u2026..I worked til about 3 in the morning, which was really fun actually. I\u2019ve not done that in a long time.</p> <p>But then I was getting delirious and I was like, \u201cI gotta get to bed.\u201d So I went to bed. Then I had a call with Tara, one of my coaches, at 6am. So I did 3 hours of sleep and then Iwas up and did my coaching call with her, which was really awesome as always.</p> <p>Then I got the kids out the door and then passed back out for 2 hours, then I got up again. It\u2019s a beautiful day, just so you know. It\u2019s sunny here, leaves are falling, I\u2019m wearing shorts and flip flops. It\u2019s a little bit cooler and it\u2019s just kind of nice. Last night we stayed up late with the kids playing Wolf in the Graveyard, running around outside. If you watch me on Snapchat, we had a bird. The kids were taking pumpkins out to the front porch at like 9:30 at night. We open the door and this huge bird, my kids are like, \u201cDad, there\u2019s a bat!\u201d But it was a bird that flew into our house and went nuts.</p> <p>It took me 20 minutes to catch it and get it back outside. It was insane. The last 24 hours or 12 hours I guess, have been pretty awesome. That\u2019s been happening today, just heading in now for a fun day. I was just thinking about, do you guys remember a couple of weeks ago? I was talking to you guys about hiring coaches and trying to figure out parts in your life that you\u2019re not 100% happy with, and figuring out why. \u201cWhy am I not feeling good?\u201d And then trying to find coaches to work through those things.</p> <p>Sunday for example, for some reason Sunday, I kind of know the reason, but Sunday I was not in a good mood. I was sitting in the backyard after church, after dinner, sitting in this chair watching my kids play around. I was like \u201cWhy do I not feel good? Physically I feel fine. I\u2019m not sore, kind of tired.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be very aware.\u201dWhy am I not feeling good. Something\u2019s bugging me and my mind is trying to hide it so it\u2019s not there, but what are the actual things?\u201d So I was trying to think through it and it was frustrating me.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to become very aware of it. That was one thing, and then from there, that was Sunday. But then on top of that I\u2019ve been working with different coaches in different parts of my life, different aspects, it\u2019s kind of cool. So my call with Tara today was all about things I\u2019m frustrated by and we went in a whole different direction than we\u2019ve ever been before. It opened up this whole new world of the understanding\u2026..my relationships with other people and why some are really good for me and why some are not so good for me. It was really, really cool.</p> <p>And then on the other side of that, one of my other friends, one of my Inner Circle members, his name\u2019s Joseph and he does hypnosis stuff, he\u2019s awesome. He started doing these things where he does custom hypnosis tracks. So he asked me, \u201cWould you like me to build a custom hypnosis track for you?\u201d I was like, \u201cAre you kidding me? Of course I would, you\u2019re amazing.\u201d So he sent me this list of all these different questions, and it was kind of cool. It was basically a wish-list of \u201cWhat are your limiting beliefs that are holding you back? What are the beliefs you wish you did have?\u201d So I spent last night, probably until 2 o\u2019clock in the morning, 2 or 3 in the morning writing all these things out and creating this thing.</p> <p>So he\u2019s going back now and building this custom hypnosis track to listen to at nights to help me break my false beliefs and strengthen the beliefs that I want and that I need and things like that. And it\u2019s so cool. So I just wanted to kind of come back and restress and reemphasize to you guys how cool it is to try and step back and be aware of what you\u2019re feeling and why you\u2019re feeling it.</p> <p>For some reason, us as humans, we don\u2019t like, I don\u2019t know what the word is\u2026We don\u2019t like, I\u2019m going to use the word counseling, because it has a negative connotation. Because we don\u2019t like counseling we fight everything else. The thing about sports, when I was wrestling, I always had coaches around me. So every match, from a match that we had done, I\u2019d step off the matt immediately after my performance. My coach would say, \u201cLook, you did this, this and this that were great, but I noticed that you\u2019re stepping far with this leg. Or you\u2019re leading with this arm, or your elbow is flaring up.\u201d Just little things I was doing.</p> <p>So right in the moment when it happened, I\u2019d get this immediate coaching thing, so I would know that. I\u2019d be like, \u201cOkay, I gotta remember that for next time, not to do that.\u201d And then the next match happens and the same thing. And the second the match is over, it\u2019s like, \u201cBoom. This, this and this. This is what I\u2019m noticing. This is where you\u2019re leading. This is what you\u2019re doing.\u201d It was this constant coaching process, every single match. Match in and match out.</p> <p>And I\u2019d have tournaments where I\u2019d have\u2026.we\u2019d do a Freestyle and a Greco tournament on the same time sometimes. We\u2019d end up having 15, 16 different matches. So 15, 16 matches, and 15, 16 times throughout the day I\u2019m getting coached on the little things. And every time you get better and better and better and better.</p> <p>And for some reason in the real world we don\u2019t do that. We do something, we get frustrated, we try to drown our problems in whatever the thing is we use. For some people it\u2019s drugs, some people it\u2019s alcohol, or TV or food, everyone has their thing we try to drown it, and hide it. And I think how much that doesn\u2019t serve us, especially when there\u2019s people, there\u2019s some amazing people out there that can help us with all these different problems we have, different issues.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, in the inner circle, one of my coaches, her name is Mandy Keene now, she got married. But Mandy was one of my wife and I coaches after we went through Tony Robins\u2019 stuff. She lived here local in Boise and she\u2019d done some work for our company in the past. We had hired her to be a coach for both me and her and it was awesome.</p> <p>The insights we got from her, some one with outside perspective looking in. And these little tweaks and changes and how awesome that was. So we brought her in the inner circle. So right now it\u2019s been interesting. Most people come in the inner circle because they have marketing or sales problems or they want to scale things.</p> <p>They come and they want to work with me, but I think I don\u2019t want to tell her or anybody this\u2026..A lot of times people get more value from what she\u2019s bringing. She\u2019s doing coaching calls each week and figuring out limiting beliefs and what\u2019s keeping them from it. And constantly coaching you, coaching an dpushing through. Tweaking and changing and this progression that\u2019s happening within the inner circle.</p> <p>And it\u2019s funny, people cleared up these beliefs, they don\u2019t have to fix their marketing, they fix the things that are holding them back and then their marketing and everything else starts working.</p> <p>So I just wanted to replug this for all of you guys. Get better at noticing in the moment how you\u2019re feeling. Like I said, on Sunday I\u2019m sitting there, \u201cWhy am I not feeling so good. Something\u2019s messing with me, I should feel awesome. I\u2019m watching my kids, it\u2019s a beautiful day. It\u2019s Sunday. Everything should be awesome. Why am I not feeling good.\u201d I\u2019m trying to figure out what are those reasons.</p> <p>Just like if I had a coach there. If I got off the wrestling match and I lost, I\u2019m not going to go and hide in the bleachers and try to think I\u2019m too good for a coach. No I\u2019ll be like, \u201cCoach what did I do? You can see a lot better what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cDude, your elbow is out every time you\u2019re shooting.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cEvery time.\u201d</p> <p>So I pull my elbow in the next time I shoot and that problem is gone and I win the next match. We need to be doing those things more often for ourselves. Sometimes you don\u2019t have a coach, at least in life typically you don\u2019t have a coach following you around watching you. Everyday like, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d So part of that\u2019s gotta be on us. Slowing down and stopping and say, \u201cHey, why do I feel this way? Something\u2019s messed up because I should not feel this way right now. I should be feeling good and I\u2019m not. So why?\u201d and think about it and figure out what those things are.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably tied to one of a few things. Probably tied to a relationship, multiple relationships, finances, tied to something. So figure out what it is that\u2019s causing that, that incongruency that\u2019s not making you feel good. And then, you know one way\u2019s to try to figure it out on your own. But I think a smarter way is find someone who can help you with that.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not a bad thing. I didn\u2019t become an awesome wrestler because I went through this bad thing of I had a coach help me. It was so embarrassing. I don\u2019t like coaches. I don\u2019t want anyone to know I had a coach. No, coaches are awesome, it\u2019s good.</p> <p>There\u2019s business coaches, life coaches, health coaches. All those kind of things. I\u2019ve been lucky in my life to have access to a lot of coaches. I think that for you guys, I would dedicate part of your budget towards that. And I would look at where\u2019s the area you\u2019re struggling with the most right now and find a coach to help fulfill that piece of it.</p> <p>And if it has anything to do with making money or mindset now you can use the inner circle because you got Mandy and me. In all seriousness, there\u2019s great people out there and find someone. There\u2019s also bad people out there. I\u2019m going to pick some fights today, I would say, oh man\u2026\u2026</p> <p>So I would say, don\u2019t go the traditional routes. I have so little faith in traditional routes. Don\u2019t go to a real marriage counselor. Go find the person who\u2019s written books and spoken on stage and changed people\u2019s lives and go find them. Anyway, that\u2019s my thoughts. Find the people who are in the trenches doing it in masses, because they get a lot more info, intel, and insight than a person who learned in school. There I just said, okay leave it there.</p> <p>Yeah, I went to a traditional counselor for a while, and almost everything that went through hurt more than it helped. So find people that you respect. Find someone that you can look and see what they\u2019re doing for other people and do that way.</p> <p>That\u2019s all I got. I\u2019m at the office, it\u2019s like noon and I gotta get to work.

I hope you guys are having an amazing day so far. It\u2019s bright and early for me. My wife actually left me today, not like the real way. She\u2019s going out of town on a girls trip for the next four days, which is scary and exciting and sad and happy and everything wrapped into one. So I saw her off this morning, she jumped in an uber and took off and now I am the mom and the dad. But we also have an event this week, so I\u2019m driving right now to certification program and I just basically do the first 2 hours in the certification event which starts in 28 minutes and I\u2019m totally stuck in traffic. So I\u2019m hoping and praying to get there in time.</p> <p>But it opens up a little window for us to hang out and talk about some important things which is pretty cool. Also today, thanks to Bart Miller, some of you guys if you are faithfully listeners and fans and followers, you know that we\u2019re creating a tv show called Funnel Hacker TV and one of the episodes was with a guy named Robert Jones, who owns a beauty academy and we\u2019re basically building out a whole funnel with them and his business partner is Bart Miller. And Bart and son are super cool people. Anyway, while we were out there they took me on a shopping spree to teach me how to dress. So they got me skinny jeans and shirts with cuff links and weird shoes and all these things, which is totally not Russell things. But today I\u2019m wearing brown shoes, gray socks, skinny jeans, purple shirt with cuff links, and the cuff links look like Clickfunnels gears and it\u2019s so cool. But I totally feel like not me. But whatever, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying out today.</p> <p>So I\u2019m heading in right now and just getting so, so, so excited about so many cool things. I don\u2019t know about your guys, the other night I read my kids a book, If You Give A Mouse A Cookie. You all remember that book right? If you give a mouse a cookie, he\u2019s going to want a cup of milk. If you give him a cup of milk, he\u2019s going to want a look in the mirror to see if he\u2019s got a milk mustache, if he\u2019s got a milk mustache he\u2026.if he sees his milk mustache he\u2019s gonna know his hair\u2019s long and he\u2019s gonna want to give himself a trim. If he trims himself he\u2019s gonna have hairs\u2026..and it goes through this huge thing. And the mouse ends up at the very end of it drawing a picture and putting it on the fridge. Sees the fridge and realizes he\u2019s thirsty and wants a cup of milk. You know what would go good with a cup of milk, a cookie. And that\u2019s the whole book.</p> <p>So I read it to my kids the other day and then Monday came and I was like, \u201cHere\u2019s my major project I\u2019m trying to get.\u201d We\u2019re revamping how we do our auto responder sequences, and really excited. So okay, this is the plan for the next two weeks focusing on getting this piece rebuilt and dialed in and I\u2019m really excited for that. So we started mapping the whole thing out and getting everything in place but then we\u2019re like, \u201cOh to get all these things done, we can\u2019t do it yet because this has to be in place.\u201d Which is all auto responders for us. If you look at, if you read the Dotcom Secrets book, we have value ladders and move people up through a sequence. For me, \u00a0basically all of our auto responders are leading on the front end\u00a0 are leading people to this new quiz funnel we\u2019re building where we have a really cool quiz, which identifies which one of 6 or 7 types of businesses you are. And there are 6 or 7 webinars in the back depending on what type of business you are. And you watch the webinar and we follow a sequence very specific to your niche, your industry, your market. And it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>But that means before I can launch the email sequence I have to have the quiz funnel done. The quiz funnel means I have to get 7 webinars done. Then in front of the quiz funnels, I wanted to do a really cool video to make a quiz funnel, which means either I gotta make a video or we gotta hire someone to make a video. If we\u2019re going to hire someone to do the video I want them to be the best. I think I told you guys yesterday, we had a couple of calls from the Harmon Brothers, who did Squatty potty and Fiber Fix and a bunch of amazing videos. And they need help fixing the Fiber Fix funnel and I want a video so we\u2019re trying to swap\u2026.I don\u2019t know if I told you this, they charge $500,000 to make a video, it\u2019s insane. So I was like, okay that\u2019s cool. How about I do your funnel for you, in exchange for video. So I\u2019m trying to negotiate that, which may or may not go through.</p> <p>At the same time I\u2019m also talking to the Ackerman Brothers, who are these other guys who worked on the Poopourri video, really good script writers to write the script. I\u2019m also taking my own whack at the script because I was like, well crap. I\u2019ve written a couple of scripts in my day, maybe I can write it. So I started writing this really cool script based on the difference between being unemployed and being an entrepreneur. The fine line between being unemployed and being an entrepreneur and the whole script that I was writing is like, this dude down in his mom\u2019s basement and his mom\u2019s like\u2026.\u201dHey, what\u2019s your son do for a living.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s unemployed.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cMom, I\u2019m not unemployed, I\u2019m an entrepreneur.\u201d There\u2019s a fine line between unemployed and an entrepreneur. What is that line? And they start going into all these different things. Just showing that fine line and the fine line is a funnel.</p> <p>So we\u2019re writing that as well, so now I\u2019ve got three potential things, writing scripts and if I do write\u2026.and if the Harmon Brothers write the script I gotta fix the whole Fiber Fix Funnel. And the way it\u2019s working with them, is basically I put the owe-ness on me. I like doing that sometimes. They showed me their conversion rates on the funnel and they told me what their conversion rates needed to be to start scaling media. So I told them, I\u2019ll do this. I\u2019ll do the work for free and you don\u2019t have to do anything unless I beat that control. Unless I get to the numbers you\u2019re looking for. So they were like, sweet. So I basically gotta come and do the whole thing for free. And if we smash theirs, which I know we can, then I\u2019ll get them to do my thing for free on the other side.</p> <p>So I got three people working on the script. So when the scripts done, then the webinar will be done, and when the webinars on the backend. So then we look at the webinar and basically these new webinars are going to be kind of front end of where everything is leading. So I\u2019m changing the webinar pitch a little, similar but just kind of make it more mainstream. Right now the current funnel hacks webinar is very much towards, positioned towards the internet marketers. Because that\u2019s like, this sexy candy that gets my market excited. But as we go more mainstream it\u2019s a little over a lot of people\u2019s heads, so it\u2019s not dumbing it down, but changing the language patterns. So all the seven webinars we\u2019re kind of rewriting to match the language patterns of each of the industries.</p> <p>So then on the back of it, we\u2019re tweaking the offer, which means we have to change the product a little bit. So I\u2019m like if we\u2019re selling funnel hacks, we should go back to funnel hacks and make a new version that\u2019s even better, and then we\u2019re like if we redo a version and it\u2019s even better, we should also have a physical product in the mail because it will increase stick rate. Because if we increase stick rate it drops churn and everything else. So then we\u2019re like, well now we gotta make a physical product. So then we started to look at the types of physical products, and there\u2019s binders, there\u2019s DVD\u2019s, there\u2019s booklets, there\u2019s USB cards, there\u2019s all these kind of things, so we spent a whole bunch of time going down that rabbit hole.</p> <p>That was yesterday. So it started with, \u201cHey this is the project.\u201d And then it was this whole if you give a mouse a cookie thing that took us on this huge, long path and I realized if I want to get the email sequences done I\u2019ve got to update the core funnel, I gotta update the course, I gotta update the webinars, I gotta update the quiz funnel, get the quiz funnel done, then I can do the email sequences. And in my mind, I\u2019m like I want all that crap done today, I don\u2019t want to wait six months or three months or even a month. So now it\u2019s like, how do I get all that done in the next two or three weeks? And that\u2019s the question. Some people ask me, \u201cRussell, how do you get so much done so fast?\u201d And for me it\u2019s because of that. I\u2019m so impatient. In my mind I can see it all and it\u2019s amazing so I want it all done today.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do at night. Since my wife\u2019s not here I got all night long to work. So as soon as I get the kids to bed I just added 4 or 5 hours to my work schedule until I pass out. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be working on for the next few days. It\u2019s going to be so exciting and so fun. I\u2019m just curious on you guys, if that ever happens to you as well.</p> <p>So amongst all of that, that\u2019s my project for the next however long it takes to get done. Plus we\u2019ve got I think 7 funnels for people, or maybe 8 funnels for Funnel Hacker TV people that we\u2019ve filmed part of the episode and we\u2019ve got the funnels partially done. So this week we\u2019re also launching Mark Joiners new mind control marketing funnel, which is so cool. It turned out amazing. Sean Stephenson, we did a webinar, not a webinar, we did a membership site funnel for him. I got the videos back and they turned out amazing. Anyway, Biohacking\u00a0 Secrets, we\u2019re launching the Biohacking store and Biohacking week. All those projects.</p> <p>Plus book number two, this week should be done with the first round and then we start the editing process. I can\u2019t tell you how excited I am for this book. Those who\u2019ve been following, you know this summer I had about 230, 240 pages done of the book and one night I was sitting there reading it and I just wasn\u2019t happy so I opened up Snapchat, I highlighted an entire book and deleted. Started over. And it was scary and one of those things just like, man I\u2019ve spent six months doing this. And everyone who had read it was like, this is a really good book. I was like, I didn\u2019t sign up to write a good book. A lot of people write good books. I wanted to write a great book. I talked to you yesterday how good is the enemy of great. So I deleted it and started over. I tell you what, now it\u2019s a great book. I am very enthusiastically proud of it now. And I think that it\u2019s going to change. Honestly, I mean it\u2019s kind of one of those things people always say, we\u2019re trying to change the world. But I honestly think that this book and the platform, obviously Clickfunnels behind it will change the world and that\u2019s what I\u2019m so excited for.</p> <p>So there you go you guys, if you give a mouse a cookie. If you give Russell a cookie, that\u2019s where it goes. If you\u2019re all like me, and you\u2019re an entrepreneur who does that, don\u2019t feel bad because I do it too. So the question though, is it happens to most people, including me. Even last night I was sitting there like, I\u2019m overwhelmed. I don\u2019t even know what to do or where to go. So for me I just, one of my processes is, the day after I get done with an event is kind of write out all of those milestones and then place them in a chronological order. I think the problem that most people have; including me is that we\u2019ll see here are the 8 things I have to get done, so we start dabbling in 8 of them, and we\u2019ll do a little here, a little here, a little here and nothing every gets done because you are slowly pushing forward 8 things. So what I do, and hopefully this is the nugget of wisdom at the end of this. So after I get the, let\u2019s say 8 different major things done. So I know there\u2019s a quiz video, there\u2019s a quiz funnel,\u00a0 there\u2019s a new webinar, there\u2019s a home study course, there\u2019s an updated online course, there\u2019s the email sequences. So there\u2019s the major\u2026big things right.</p> <p>And the first thing I do, day number one is that I know that each of these things, it\u2019s kind of like\u2026 I failed all my project management classes, which is funny basically that\u2019s all I do all day is project management. But I know there\u2019s an order. I\u2019m like next Thursday I want to work on this. I start working on Thursday, but the logo guys haven\u2019t gotten back to me, all the pieces I need to execute on that thing, I don\u2019t have. Then it\u2019s like, crap okay. You start tasking out everything, you come back a week later and hopefully you have those things and all that kind of stuff happens, right.\u00a0 So for me what I do is the first day is I go and I map out, here\u2019s the 8 things. Then I look at what are all the things that I know I have to have to get this project done that take time, that aren\u2019t on me. So logo people, copywriting people, design people, logo\u2019s, merchant accounts. I look at all of those things that I know that aren\u2019t me just sitting down and grinding it out. That for me to sit there and be able to grind it out, I have to have all these assets to make it possible. So I\u2019ll probably do that today, just go out and start tasking out all the tangible pieces I know I need to get this project done.</p> <p>Now everyone\u2019s got it, so now in the background they\u2019re all working on a dozen different things that I\u2019m going to need in the future, but I don\u2019t need yet. But I think through that ahead of time, so they\u2019re all working on everything, then I pick whichever one, honestly the one that gets me the most excited. And then I dive into there hardcore and I focus on that. And I get it done. And then during that interim while I\u2019m getting it done all these little pieces will be coming back and I\u2019m like cool and I take them and throw them in a Trello board, I keep putting all the assets in there so I know that hey next Tuesday is the day I\u2019m focusing on this. Everything\u2019s there and Tuesday I log in and boom I can just run. There\u2019s nothing holding me back.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of how I work. So I hope that kind of helps you guys. Because I know\u00a0 a lot of people get stuck in that paralysis, or the process of I\u2019m trying to work on stuff, oh I don\u2019t have anything that I need to work on it. For me, that\u2019s the number one thing, making sure that all those external things that I can think through that take more time than I\u2019m going to do on that day to make sure they\u2019re done. For example, this week we had a planning meeting for all the different funnels that we\u2019re doing Funnel Hacker TV and I was like, okay here\u2019s all the funnels and I was like, okay it\u2019s Thursday, so that\u2019s tomorrow it\u2019s Biohacking Secrets day. So Thursday we\u2019re building these two funnels, they have to be done.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the pieces I need. l was like Anthony I need this, this and this. Designer, I need this. So I gave everyone all the things I need. So the lst three days I\u2019ve been coming in like crazy. I even hired some copywriters to do some bullet points. I sent them a whole bunch of stuff. I\u2019m like I need these Thursday morning, can you do it. And they were like, it\u2019s an extra $500 to do it in two days. I\u2019m like done. I need them by Thursday morning, because Thursday morning I know I\u2019m sitting and I have to get that funnel live so if I don\u2019t have those, the whole thing falls apart. So that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about for me. It\u2019s just making sure that everyone knows this is the day I am sitting down and I\u2019m focusing on launching this project, so if I don\u2019t have all these pieces back by this time, you are fired. Or whatever that might be, you know what I mean.</p> <p>Because I don\u2019t know about you, the worst feeling in the world, is you dedicate a day to get stuff done. Like I know tomorrow is Biohacking Secrets day. And I\u2019m going to be busting out 2 funnels for them. And I know next Wednesday I\u2019m finishing Mind Control Marketing with Sean Stephenson, so I have to have all those assets back that day, otherwise I wasted the day. I don\u2019t want to get the funnel halfway done and have to rebook another day to get things done. I want to have everything done so that when I show up I can start, I can end and I can wrap that day up and know that projects completed. So what are all the things I have to have to get that done in time.</p> <p>I have this huge dump truck in front of me going two miles an hour. So yeah, I hope that helps. I\u2019m at the venue and I\u2019m actually fifteen minutes early. Well I still gotta get in the parking garage, but as a whole this is not too shabby. Alright you guys. That\u2019s all I got today. I hope there was some value there. I hope that you guys probably don\u2019t do as much stuff as I do because it\u2019s harder to get stuff done, but if you do hopefully that gives you guys a couple of ideas of how I do it. I appreciate you all for listening. We\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "15:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_262.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1475614795, "title": "Episode #261 \u2013 How Changing Your Environment Can Take You From Good To Great", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A few simple ideas to get you out of your rut.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about how making a simple change could help reinvigorate your business or how you feel.

I hope you guys enjoyed the new intro. Was it pretty cool? So we\u2019re matching and modeling, I\u2019m not sure if I told you guys this, but the Funnelhacker.tv TV show intro which is coming soon to a Youtube channel near you. So it\u2019ll be at funnelhacker.tv, if you go there you can kind of see the actual intro, which is really, really cool. So this is kind of\u2026.we\u2019re trying to like kind of blend those things together. So we decided not to change the name Marketing In Your Car, we\u2019re keeping it Marketing In Your Car, but it\u2019s basically Marketing In Your Car for Funnel hackers. Its showing you guys what we\u2019re doing in real life each day as the funnel hacker.\u00a0 Anyway, I hope that you enjoy that. For those that have been faithful followers for a long time, you know for the first 100 and something episode it was like a disco, 70\u2019s music then we switched to a quick thrown together one and then this one is\u2026..anyway, who knows. It could be worse, but at least it\u2019s changed. Change can always be good.</p> <p>So speaking of change being good. I wanted to talk about that for a little bit, because right now we\u2019re going through some fun changes. We just bought a new office and now we\u2019re rehabbing that. I think next week we start knocking down walls and kind of starting that change. You know last year we changed our home and moved to a new home, there\u2019s just a lot to do with that. I was listening to a Matt Furey call. I don\u2019t know I bought a whole bunch of these really random Matt Furey CD\u2019s from back in the day and they\u2019re all over the place. I think its like, the grab bag was 8 grand, every CD he\u2019s ever done, so I just got the whole thing. So there\u2019s one random one, so I don\u2019t know if anyone could ever find it again, but he\u2019s talking about the energy of a room and how you can change it. He\u2019s talking about how if you go sit in your room and look around, or your office. Sitting in your office and looking around and see your desk, your monitor, your computer and there\u2019s a certain energy that\u2019s from that. And this is the Woo Woo side of things, so I don\u2019t really understand this stuff. But you kind of feel that, right? You sit in there and you\u2019re like, this is my world and my things. And what happens is, after a while we get comfortable in our situations and things. And sometimes that can be a good thing and sometimes that can be a very negative thing. Complacency is one of those things that\u2019s like, if we\u2019re complacent then we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m good.\u201d And then you don\u2019t try to grow.</p> <p>One of my favorite things that I\u2019ve ever read was in the book, Good to Great, it talks about how good is the enemy to great. Why are there not more great marriages? Because there\u2019s a lot of good marriages. Why are there not a lot of great careers or jobs? Because there\u2019s a lot of good ones. Why is there not a lot of\u00a0 great companies? Well there\u2019s a lot of good companies. So because of that people get complacent and they don\u2019t grow. So good is the enemy to great, which is so cool and interesting and intriguing to think about. And so this is just thinking about changes and thinking about you know, moving offices in a couple of months. But even right now I\u2019m in this office and I\u2019m looking at everything and there\u2019s definitely an energy or whatever you want to call it, but there\u2019s something from that situation. There\u2019s some positives and negatives. There\u2019s some really good patterns I\u2019ve developed in that space and in that spot where I\u2019m sitting. And there\u2019s some negative one\u2019s too. So it\u2019s like,\u00a0 moving and change is good because it breaks this pattern. And it gets us out of a state of complacency. I think complacency a lot of times is what gets us in trouble.</p> <p>Now there is, this is always a two edged sword. There\u2019s the other side of becoming complacent. Complacent sounds like a negative, maybe it\u2019s not for everyone, for me it sounds like a negative word, but the reality is it\u2019s not always negative either. You know if you study Tony Robins, he talks about the two core things he does with people. He\u2019s not a motivational speaker. If any of my friends call him a motivational speaker I\u2019m going to knock them out. One of my good friends went on this huge rant about Tony talking about how he\u2019s a motivational speaker and how bad it was, so I ended up buying him tickets an flying out to the event and making him go experience. I\u2019m like, \u201cLook, he\u2019s not a motivational speaker.\u201d So what it Tony? Tony focuses on two things. First is the science of achievement, so how do you achieve more in life, right. How do you get more done. And notice the words, the science of achievement, science. So there\u2019s a scientific process to achieve something that can be replicated over and over again. So the first thing he helps people with is the science of achievement. And the second is the art of fulfillment. And fulfillment is harder, especially for super aggressive entrepreneurs who\u2026we\u2019re trying to achieve, achieve, achieve and no matter how much achieve, how much you get, how much you help and grow and whatever those things are that are important to you, you always on the other side, most of us struggle with fulfillment. Actually feeling like, man I\u2019m good.</p> <p>I gotta be honest, I sometimes envy people who are complacent, who can just sit there and be like, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d So there\u2019s a fine line of complacency that keeps you from living the life you want and serving the way you can and impacting people and places in this world versus\u00a0 the other side of the coin, which is how to do you have fulfillment. How can you\u2026.and notice he said the art of fulfillment? So science is the system, it\u2019s a replicate-able thing. Art is different. I like to talk about that with funnel hacking and Clickfunnels as well. There\u2019s an art and a science to every funnel right. The science is like, the structure. Here\u2019s how it works. The art is like, what gives it that sex appeal. Gets people excited and intrigued and gets them to opt-in and buy and register. So there\u2019s an art and the science behind everything. I\u2019m going down some rabbit holes on today\u2019s thing, I don\u2019t know why, you guys. I apologize.</p> <p>But I think the main thing I wanted to kind of go on and hopefully I haven\u2019t gone on too many tangents from this, but the main thing I want to stress is just look at your life and realize first off that good is the enemy to great and it\u2019s okay to be happy and have fulfillment, but also look at things\u2026..like, \u201cI could do better. I know I could achieve more, I could help more, I could serve more, I could be more.\u201d And look at those things and say, \u201cOkay, what do I need to change this thing? What\u2019s the pattern? What\u2019s the rut I\u2019m in that\u2019s keeping me in this spot right now?\u201d And a lot of times its as simple as changing your environment. Changing the way you sit, taking your office and flipping the desk around and moving everything around. And it\u2019s such a weird thing, but that change will cause\u2026..it\u2019s weird. How does shifting my desk from here to here change things? How does me standing where I\u2019m working versus sitting, how does that change things? All those kind of things, but it does. It breaks these patterns.</p> <p>Our life\u2019s a series of all these different patterns that we\u2019re developing. Some patterns serve us for good, some for bad and some kind of just get you in a rut. That\u2019s why we call it getting in a rut. So if you\u2019re in a rut and you want to grow and expand I\u2019d recommend change. And it can be, for now let\u2019s look at changing environment, because that\u2019s such a simple thing to change. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of work, it\u2019s just moving things around and shifting how you sit. Changing whatever it is.\u00a0 Just a radical change of your environment. That\u2019s what that Matt Furey thing was all about. Take your desk, flip your monitor around, move your desk. Change the pictures, open a window, paint a wall. Do all these and it seems so ridiculous and dumb, but that change will be the catalyst that will break a pattern and get you out of a rut and help you go from good to great. See that all tied together right? I\u2019m totally counting that.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably my ADD mind today. We\u2019re working on a new funnel. It\u2019s going to be awesome. I think I\u2019ve talked about this before, but we pretty much identified in Clickfunnels, there\u2019s 6 or 7 different types of business owners who use Clickfunnels and they all use it for different reasons. So we\u2019ve done a bunch of surveys and stuff to find out what those are and based on that I\u2019m writing, it\u2019s so much work, but I\u2019m writing 7 different webinar pitches, one on each customer type. So that\u2019s the project of a lifetime for me. Trying to get the first presentation perfect and then rebuild it for the other 6 to 7 markets. I\u2019m kind of\u2026..I say 6 to 7 because there\u2019s one that\u2019s a crossover and I\u2019m debating on one presentation or two.\u00a0 And then basically what we\u2019ll have is a site where someone comes and they take a survey, from that it will identify what kind of business owner they are. And\u00a0 from there we\u2019ll have an email sequence, a landing page, a webinar registration. Everything that\u2019s very, very congruent to who, what type of business they actually are. And that is what we are working on here at Clickfunnels headquarters. So my goal is in the next 14 days, have that all done, recorded, live.</p> <p>And then the other cool piece I want, I really, really, really want, it\u2019s been interesting. I want a cool\u2026not a viral video, but that\u2019s the best way to describe it, but a cool video to get people to take this survey, so I\u2019ve been looking a lot. Obviously some of the fun ones are Squatty Potty and Poopouri and Vidangel is really good. Fiber Fix, the guys that did all those is a company called Harmon Brothers, so I\u2019m working with them because they\u2019ve got a funnel that\u2019s not converting, so we\u2019re talking about trading. Having them do a video for me in exchange for me fixing one of their funnels. But it\u2019s just so many things happening. It\u2019s like how do I stop everything to go fix their funnel, which we looked at. The problem is blaringly obvious so it\u2019s a simple fix, but in exchange am I going to get a cool video that we can use to get people to take the survey that then helps Clickfunnels take over the world.</p> <p>Lots of cool stuff.\u00a0 So that\u2019s it you guys. Speaking of changing environments. So this can work with your customer list as well, it\u2019s kind of interesting. We\u2019ve been doing this Dream Car Contest for the last year and a half, two years. Trying to get people engaged, we\u2019ve tried all sorts of stuff to get people engaged. \u201cGo give away Clickfunnels accounts, get a car.\u201d So finally I was like, \u201cLet\u2019s change the message.\u201d So we created a site called affiliatebootcamp.com, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, go check it out. It\u2019s like a training course, it\u2019s completely free. I did a pattern interrupt, if you go to the page you will see it\u2019s not a typical sales video. It\u2019s me doodling and sketching things out and it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know, turned out pretty cool. The conversion rates are amazing. Just that change in messaging to get people re-engaged in our affiliate program has been huge.</p> <p>We did the math, if we could get basically 100 credit card signups a day for the next 100 days, which is how many days were left in the year when we started the program, we\u2019d be at 30 thousand customers at the end of the year, which is awesome. That was our goal. So we launched it and right now we\u2019re getting a lot. Like closer to 200 members a day that are signing up right now. We get between 4 and 5 hundred to sign up for Clickfunnels that do step one of the process, but then\u2026.before it was closer to 70 or 80 a day that actually put in the credit card in step 2. Now it\u2019s closer to 200 a day, which is awesome. So it\u2019s working. But again the same message we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s changing the environment. The frame that we push people through to get them engaged in the process. So it works on a lot of different levels if you think about.</p> <p>Anyway, you guys I hope that helps a little bit. I\u2019m at the office. I got a fun day of webinar building. So I appreciate you all. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys again tomorrow. Bye.</p>", "duration": "12:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_261.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1475533547, "title": "Episode #260 \u2013 How Your Posturing Is Probably Screwing You Up", "author": "", "summary": "<p>You\u2019re actually doing everything backwards.

I\u2019m really excited, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done one and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve been trying to get a new intro for forever. This episode\u2019s not going live until the new intro\u2019s live. We tried to hire a company, we tried to hire another company, we tried another company. Nobody can do it, I just want to\u2026..you guys\u2019 that we\u2019re hiring are professional-podcast-intro-maker people, you\u2019d think they\u2019d be good at making an intro. Anyway, we\u2019re coming back to the drawing board and we\u2019re going to do our own. So I\u2019m going to do it this morning and my brother will get this one and he will get the intro, he\u2019s going to make it, because he\u2019s magic. And when this goes live we\u2019ll have the intro. So hopefully you guys just heard the new intro and hopefully it\u2019s cool. Did you like it? I don\u2019t even know what it is yet, but I\u2019m guessing it was amazing or else we wouldn\u2019t have pushed it live. So I cross my fingers that it was amazing.</p> <p>With that said, I\u2019ve been missing you guys. It\u2019s been a while. I\u2019ve been driving to the office wishing I could talk but I was like, I\u2019m waiting for the new intro, waiting for the new intro. So I\u2019ve been hanging out again, so I apologize for slacker-ness. But the good news is because of my slacker-ness, Stu Mclarin told me he started listening to some past, back archive issues and got some good nuggets, so maybe you guys should all just start at the very beginning. Anyway, we have the new pre-loaded MP3 player coming soon. Just waiting on China. Apparently China takes week long holidays, the whole country. So they\u2019re in the middle of a holiday. They were supposed to ship it all before the holiday, but they didn\u2019t. So now we\u2019re hoping they ship it soon. So that\u2019ll be coming very soon.</p> <p>Anyway, today I want to talk to you guys about something that\u2019s very, very important. And it\u2019s all about positioning. Now this is not the kind of positioning that normally we talk about which about how to find your positioning, how to put yourself in the right spot and elevate, blah, blah, blah. But what I\u2019m talking about is the opposite, the negative side of positioning. Recently, and I\u2019m not going to name names but some people I\u2019ve been working with who have been insanely concerned about their positioning on everything and annoying so. And because of that, they have become completely irrelevant. They are, I\u2019m trying to make sure I say this without alienating or anyone thinking they know who I\u2019m talking about, it could be anyone. But this person, we\u2019ll just say this person, is so concerned about positioning that they won\u2019t do anything awesome anymore, because they are afraid that if they do something awesome and it fails it will lower their what? Their positioning, their status. So they\u2019ve positioned themselves in this spot and they\u2019ve drunk their own Kool-aid. They think they are the most amazing person on Earth and because of that, and because they\u2019re so concerned about positioning, they won\u2019t take risks or gamble or anything and they\u2019d become completely irrelevant because of that.</p> <p>This whole business, it\u2019s hard to stay relevant. Especially when you\u2019re an expert or a guru or whatever you want to call yourself. And you\u2019re out there and you\u2019re trying to keep on top of mind in market sharing. Keep people aware. So it\u2019s been interesting. It\u2019s made me think a lot about my positioning and making sure that I don\u2019t position myself in a way where I become irrelevant because of how\u2026..I could tell you guys stories about the stories, because it would make even more sense. It\u2019s more so kind of a warning because I\u2019ve seen it happen in the last week, multiple times, which is just interesting. It\u2019s kind of all been on the top of my mind this week because I\u2019ve seen it happen a couple times in the last week or so.</p> <p>So for you guys, I want you to think about, and this comes back to the whole attractive character and how you position yourself and things like that, but I would definitely pick a positioning standpoint that allows you to risk, where if you fail, it doesn\u2019t lower your status. For me, I\u2019ve kind of put myself in a cool situation, where I tell you guys everything. When I failed, I\u2019m like \u201cHey, I failed again.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t lower my status because I haven\u2019t positioned myself as an infallible person who never screws up, I\u2019ve positioned myself as someone who screws up all the time. But because of that, because of all the failures and the mistakes and issues and the problems, that\u2019s how I\u2019ve learned and how I grow and I share with you guys the pros and cons and ups and down. That\u2019s what Marketing In Your Car initially was. Let me give you guys a glimpse at what we\u2019re doing. And I\u2019m not going to just sugar coat it and show you guys all the ups. I\u2019ve had many episodes where I\u2019ve talked up the downs. I\u2019ve had episodes where I\u2019ve been in depression and I\u2019ve told you. I mean my depression usually lasts for a couple of hours, but I share those things with you guys because it\u2019s real and it\u2019s not fake and it\u2019s what\u2019s actually going to serve you the best. Whereas if I position myself as this infallible being who never screws up, man I\u2019d be scared to try anything or test anything or risk anything, or be in the public spotlight because of that. And very, very quickly I\u2019d become irrelevant and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to the person or persons. Plural or singular, it\u2019s up to you to think. That\u2019s happened to them though, because they don\u2019t want to screw things up and because of that they\u2019ve become irrelevant. In their mind they don\u2019t they have become irrelevant. But if you were to survey the market and ask people who should care who tey are, I believe that they\u2019re kind of gone.]</p> <p>So I just wanted to warn you guys about that. So not be so, and we\u2019ve talked about this in the Dotcom Secrets book a little bit when we talk about the attractive character. We talk about, without your character flaws people can\u2019t relate to you. But because of our positioning or our status, we\u2019re so scared to share our character flaws that we just freeze. We don\u2019t share anything and then we\u2019re scared to fail because people will see our character flaws, man it causes so many issues. Think about any comic book character, what makes them interesting? It\u2019s the character flaws. Superman is super boring until kryptonite is introduced now it\u2019s like, sweet now he can die. Imagine if it was Batman vs Superman , the whole movie is this big climax and then Batman and superman step out there and Superman does his superman flying punch and batman is dead in 5 seconds. You\u2019re like, \u201cHuh, well that was boring.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for Kryptonite, that whole movie was super boring, uninteresting. I mean, Superman as a character would be uninteresting if it wasn\u2019t for Kryptonite. Batman\u2019s the same way. What makes Batman interesting. It\u2019s the fact that, he\u2019s got family, he\u2019s go these other people he loves who could be injured.</p> <p>We watched Spiderman with the kids for the first time. Spiderman is this amazing being who can do everything, but if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019s got MJ and his uncle and aunt, if it wasn\u2019t for them and that character, not character faults, but the weaknesses. They\u2019re not interesting characters. So understand that, you guys. By positioning yourself as an infallible person, not only does it make you way less money and be way less interesting to people, it also is gonna make you very irrelevant very, very quickly.</p> <p>Have fun with yourself. Have fun with what you share with people. Let people know that you\u2019re messed up because you are, I am, we all are. That\u2019s the whole point of this human experience. We come down here and we come into these world and all of us have different upbringings, but what happens is some of us have a mom and a dad, some of us just have a mom or just a dad, we all come in different weird situations. And then we got through this life and we have all sorts of weird things, some things are messed up, some of us get screwed up early in our life. I\u2019ve had friends who by the time they are 5 years old, things happen to them that would mess you up for the rest of your life. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ve survived and how they\u2019ve thrived through those. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. But for all of us to come out and act like, positioning yourself as this person who doesn\u2019t ever fail. Man, it makes you un-relatable. The people I know who are doing the best today, and today is more important than ever before. Because it wasn\u2019t so important even 5 or 6 years ago. But with the advent of social media and all these things\u2026.I was telling someone the other day. When I\u2019m doing a webinar I see people Googling my name and Facebooking me, and when I share testimonials, people are private messaging my testimonials to see if I\u2019m legit. People are fact checking you as you go, and you try to be all perfect and annoying and stuff like that, or you can just tell the truth. Just be you, who cares? It drives me crazy. Why won\u2019t people just be themselves. You are good enough as you are. People will love you as you are. Just be yourself and just share the truth.</p> <p>Ben Settle, he was making fun of life coaches that teach people how to be authentic, that\u2019s a big theme right now.\u00a0 Teaching people how to be authentic. And he was making fun of them, \u201cWhy would you pay someone $10,000 to teach you how to be authentic. Just be yourself.\u201d And it\u2019s so true. But for some reason we\u2019re so screwed, we\u2019re so afraid of people seeing past our shell that we put up all these barriers. That\u2019s what\u2026\u2026it\u2019s causing the problem that you\u2019re trying to solve. I was watching two nights ago, I was watching The Profit, it was the episode where the cleaning lady, and the cleaning lady is putting on this false facade and that was her\u2026..she was trying to do that so people wouldn\u2019t judge her so she could be successful, but because she did that, she was not successful and therefore people were judging her. It\u2019s like the walls that we put up so we can get what we want are the things that are keeping us from getting what we want. It\u2019s ridiculous. So if we would just all\u2026..I was going to say grow up, but it\u2019s the opposite. Go back to being kids where you are vulnerable and you don\u2019t care about what people think. Go back to that time, that state and holy crap, guess what happens? The things you\u2019re trying to get to happen right now. It\u2019s really, really weird. The shells you\u2019re putting up, this posturing, this stature, whatever you want to call it, that is what\u2019s keeping you from your dreams.</p> <p>Don\u2019t do what Ben Settle was suggesting, don\u2019t go pay $10,000 to have someone teach you how to be authentic, just be authentic.\u00a0 Put yourself\u2026.it\u2019s scary. \u201cHey Russell, you totally screwed up again.\u201d That\u2019s scary to put out there, but guess what? I do, and guess what happens the next day? Nothing. I wake up and everything\u2019s still good. Some people think I\u2019m annoying and they walk away and I\u2019m grateful for that. And some people relate to me and they get benefit and value because of that and they walk towards me and that\u2019s the key, you guys. So there you go. Fix your positioning and posturing, be authentic. Whatever you want to say, quit putting up those walls. I dare you guys, tell a story, however you publish stuff, if it\u2019s through writing or blogging or posting, even if you don\u2019t have a way to publish it yet, go find somebody you love and you care about and just be vulnerable. Tell them the truth about how you feel. And if you\u2019re pissed, tell them you\u2019re pissed. If you\u2019re sad, tell them you\u2019re sad. If you\u2019re angry tell them you\u2019re angry. Just let the walls come down and just try it. It\u2019s so scary at first, but guess what\u2019s going to happen? Only good stuff. Alright, I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go have some fun, you guys. Appreciate you all, I hope you enjoyed this Marketing In Your Car and I\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "12:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_260.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1473796985, "title": "Episode #259 \u2013 The Aftermath Of The Hack-A-Thon", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I still can\u2019t believe what we were able to create in just 24 hours.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about how the 24 hour hack-a-thon went.

Welcome to the aftermath of the 24 hour hack-a-thon. Hey everyone, we did it! Last you heard from me we were about to embark upon a journey of 24 hours to build out 3 funnels and record an entire info product. I tell you what, it was crazy and it was fun and intense, and a whole bunch of things trapped into one. Most of all it was an amazing memory that I will share with those guys that we hung out with for the rest of our lives.</p> <p>It was super cool. It\u2019s funny how some things took longer, some things took shorter, and some things took way longer. We got there first, got everything set up, started the camera\u2019s rolling, and boom, started a countdown clock. \u201cOkay 24 hours starts right now.\u201d And then we started moving forward on actually the whole process. We spent the first hour talking about strategies for the 3 funnels. Give everyone assignements and then broke, we all went everywhere. I sat down and hand sketched out the Perfect Webinar for this new product we\u2019re created. Then I opened up this voice recorder and recorded a 20 minute sales video and then handed that off to Levi, he transcribed the whole thing into an actual sales letter. And then Vince Palko and his team started hand sketching out the whole videos. Then we headed to a different location to film stuff and on and on. And we went filming.</p> <p>Filming was supposed to be done by 3 but we didn\u2019t get back to the office until 6. Then at 6 we started working on building the funnels and recorded the episode videos and the down-sell videos and the other pages. And then designing the funnels and getting the videos. It was crazy. I remember we were working and it was like, \u201c12 hours left.\u201d And \u201c10 hours left.\u201d And \u201c8 hours left.\u201d And \u201c4 hours left.\u201d And then \u201c1 hour\u2026..\u201d You know it got down to the very last second and literally we were uploading the videos and the last video got uploaded with 3 or 4 minutes before 8 o\u2019clock. And we threw all the pages in the funnels and then I Snapchatted with 2 minutes to go saying we did it. And then my timer went off on my phone and it was crazy. And then we put up on the big screen and we showed the 3 funnels and the product and showed everything that was done.</p> <p>Now obviously there\u2019s still some things that need to be cleaned up a little bit. Some lipstick and rouge to kind of clean things up as a whole. But with that said, what we were able to accomplish in 24 hours is insane. It kind of showed me that\u2026.because I look at each of those funnels. They should each be in and of themselves a million dollar a year funnel. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of building one right. And I feel like each of those could. We basically spent 24 hours and in that time we launched 3 million dollar companies and that\u2019s crazy. It all came down to a couple of key tools that we had to understand.</p> <p>We had to understand the strategy of building good sales funnels. If you don\u2019t know that yet, go read my book Dotcom Secrets. That was number one, number two is how to write good copy. If you don\u2019t know how to do that yet, go get Funnel Scripts and study good copy writers. And number three is how to create a really good offer. And I\u2019m not sure who teaches that good. Todd Brown does a really good job teaches that, actually. In fact, he\u2019s going to be speaking at the next Funnel Hacking Life about offer creation which is something I\u2019m really excited to go deeper with.</p> <p>But it comes down to a couple of things. Creating offers, writing copy, strategy behind the funnels and then driving traffic. And if you can master one or two or three or four of those skills, and you don\u2019t even need to be good at all of them, and find people who are good at the other ones and partner with them, I honestly believe that you get the right offers it\u2019s not hard to launch a million dollar funnel. And you know, before we\u2019d say in a month or a year or a quarter, and now I believe that you can do that in a week, or a day. If you have the right energy and focus. So that should get you guys inspired. I remember one time hearing Gary Halverson that you\u2019re one sales letter away from being financially independent for the rest of your life. One sales letter can make you rich. And it\u2019s interesting to think about that. I\u2019ve had times in my life where I was broke, on the brink of financial ruin and I did a webinar and it saved me. And it\u2019s true, one good pitch, one good offer, one good sales letter can transform your life.</p> <p>So what that means is you gotta go out there and start swinging the bats a lot. I did an interview with Trey Lewellen a couple of weeks ago and he showed me one of his funnels that did 20 million dollars last year. As a company they did 30 million, crazy. It was funny, I interviewed Trey almost a year before that and was having a little bit of success, wasn\u2019t at all like that. Trey told me, \u201cI have a goal to launch a funnel every single week.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYep, that\u2019s my goal. Once a week I\u2019m launching a funnel.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, that\u2019s a good goal. I want that goal to be mine as well.\u201d And he did. He launched a funnel every single week, and within a couple of months, guess what happened? One of those funnels he rolled out, hit. And it hit huge, to the tune of 20 million+ dollars.</p> <p>So understand that this business is all about making and creating offers. Putting them out there and not being attached to the outcome, because sometimes people don\u2019t want them. And sometimes the market doesn\u2019t care and sometimes you hit one on the head. And in the interim, what\u2019s nice is your going to hit a lot of singles and doubles and make money along the way. But every once in a while you hit one that goes boom and breaks through the park. So that\u2019s kind of the game and hopefully Clickfunnels as a tool has made that process easier, so you don\u2019t have to spend 6 months or a year or longer to build a funnel and get it out there, now you can just do it . And you can do it in a day if your intense. You can do it in a week if you\u2019re serious. You can do it in a month if you have some desire. But you can do it and the tools are in your hands now, and hopefully this hack-a-thon has proven that for you and given you some inspiration and hope because I know it\u2019s possible.</p> <p>With that said, I\u2019m almost home and I\u2019m really tired. Tonight we got the Profit party, I think I told you before we rented out a theater and we\u2019re going to have 200 people here in Boise all coming to watch the Profit with us and it\u2019s going to be insane, I\u2019m so excited. And then after the Profit, for those who are in Boise who are going to be showing the first episode of Funnel Hacker TV, hopefully Brandon today will get it done. Crossing my fingers. And with that said, oh and then the last thing is we have a whole bunch of people around the country and around the world throwing Funnel Hacker/The Profit parties, which is so cool. Oh, and I\u2019m about to drive by our new office actually, right up here on the corner. We signed a new office and I got the keys yesterday too. So while we were in the hack-a-thon Brent came in and handed me my keys, so cool. So fun stuff is happening, it\u2019s all about you guys putting things out there, and creating offers and driving traffic, testing things, putting out and just keep doing that. And if you do that a lot and you just do it fast and you become good at it, you will hit singles and doubles and you\u2019ll strike out a bunch of times, but every once in a while you\u2019ll have one that hits big. So get good at the process. Get good at trying and doing it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s it for today, you guys. Appreciate you all, I\u2019m going to get some sleep, and hopefully you\u2019re watching the Profit tonight, depending when you get this. That\u2019s all I got, talk to you guys all soon.</p>", "duration": "08:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_259.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1473719637, "title": "Episode #258 \u2013 Jack Bauer Goes ClickFunnels", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Building out 3 funnels and a product in less than 24 hours, Jack Bauer style.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about some exciting things happening both today and tomorrow including his episode of The Profit, Funnel Hacker TV, and building 3 million dollar funnels in 24 hours.</p> <p>Here are some of the exciting highlights in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Russell explains why he is building 3 funnels in 24 hours.</li> <li>He talks about renting a movie theater to have a Profit Party which will turn into a Funnel Hacker TV party.</li> <li>And finally he talks about why it\u2019s so important to build a movement and have a cult-ure.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear about all the super exciting stuff Russell has coming up over the next few days.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey everybody, I\u2019m excited for today, it\u2019s going to be a nutso day and I\u2019m excited and I have to apologize. It\u2019s been a little while since I did a Marketing In Your Car, and that\u2019s on purpose kind of. I just got called up Stu Mclaren and\u00a0 he just snapchatted me and yelled. He said, \u201cDude, where\u2019s Marketing In Your Car? I\u2019m trying to drive somewhere and I can\u2019t do it without Marketing In Your Car.\u201d The reason why I haven\u2019t done one, after episode 257, which we just finished, I was going to get all new branding and audio and everything. So I\u2019ve been waiting to get that whole thing done and it\u2019s just taking forever and turning out lame, to be honest.</p> <p>It\u2019s an early morning this morning because something crazy is about to go down and I need you guys to know about it, in case something bad happens. As you may or may not know we have been feverishly working on Funnel Hacker TV, a bunch of new episodes. In fact, if you go to funnelhacker.tv you can see the intro now, it\u2019s live. People are going nuts for it, so it turned out really cool. When you watch that video I want you guys thinking about everything we\u2019ve been talking about for the last 257 episodes because it\u2019s been a lot of stuff, and notice how everything is kind of weaved into that. Someone commented on Facebook, \u201cRussell you did the two handed throwing a fireball thing, freezeball like subzero did during it.\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cYeah, I do everything. I practice what I preach.\u201d Notice the us versus them, notice the manifesto, notice how we\u2019re splitting our audience in half, notice how we\u2019re picking common enemies, notice all the stuff we\u2019ve been talking about for the last couple of years you guys. This is all for us kind of coming together into very concrete, actionable things. It\u2019s all about how we\u2019re building our cult-ure. Watch that video because you will see what we\u2019re trying to do.</p> <p>Again, I try to let all of you guys in behind the scenes what\u2019s actually happening, which is kind of cool I think. You guys get to hear me kind of brainstorm why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing. But then you can visually see it from the external side. So I hope you guys are watching close because a bunch of crazy stuff\u2019s about to happen.</p> <p>So today we\u2019re filming an episode of Funnel Hacker TV, but of course I couldn\u2019t just do another episode because that would be boring. I need to do something bigger and better and more exciting. So what I decided to do, is today instead of building one funnel or two, we should be at least three. And instead of having a product that we build the funnel around, we should create the product today too. So today we\u2019re building three funnels. One for an info product, two for supplements. We\u2019re also recording an entire info product product. But wait, it gets better because when we were planning this I thought, how could would it be if we did a Jack Bauer 24 theme, because it\u2019s still my favorite show ever, of all time. So we\u2019re doing this whole thing in 24 hours. So today at 8am, let\u2019s see it\u2019s Monday morning, we are starting a 24 hour countdown clock and then we will be done Tuesday at 8am. We\u2019ve got a whole bunch of people coming in. Vince Palko from Adtunes flying in, he is hand sketching out the sales videos. We\u2019ve got the dude\u2019s who own Weight Shake are flying in, we\u2019re building a funnel for them. We\u2019ve got Dave Woodward and Kerry Woodward who are coming in, she\u2019s the guru, the expert on the info product side of this. And we got Brandon coming and filming everything and then we\u2019ve got 3 or 4 film crews. Because we gotta film all these different things, then we\u2019ve gotta film them filming them because it\u2019s all about behind the scenes for the reality show. It\u2019s gonna great.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got actors coming in, we\u2019ve got 3 or 4 different locations that we\u2019re filming at, it\u2019s literally nuts from a coordination standpoint. In fact, if we pull this whole thing off, I will be so impressed. The biggest reason why I\u2019m doing this, why we do a lot of these crazy things, the reason why I do Funnel Friday\u2019s, the reason I do all this stuff is I want to make it more attainable for people. To see that this isn\u2019t a 6 month process to launch a funnel, which is what most of you guys are doing. This should be, and I know 24 hours is ridiculous for most people, but if I can get three funnels in 24 hours, and each of these funnels\u2026..I\u2019ll only build a funnel if I think it\u2019ll make at least a million bucks a year. So if I can build 3 million dollar funnels in 24 hours, you should be able to build one in a week. So that\u2019s kind of the premise behind why I\u2019m doing this craziness and why it\u2019s exciting. So I will report back to you guys when it\u2019s all done. Maybe tomorrow morning when I\u2019m driving home if I\u2019m not dead, I\u2019ll give you a recap of what happened and how it all went down. But I\u2019m excited; it\u2019s going to be so much fun.</p> <p>The finished products are ones I\u2019ve been looking for for a long time. And what\u2019s fun is the Expert Secrets book we have a big huge section about how to be a vehicle of change and we looked at all the different big cults or whatever you want to call them throughout time and how they were created and the commonalities between them. And every one of them had three core things, an attractive character or charismatic leader, a movement, and then a new opportunity. So everything we talk about in Expert Secrets is built around that. Because it\u2019s about, you\u2019re trying to cause a movement, be a vehicle of change, get people to change their life. So what\u2019s cool is this weekend for the fitness product, initially, I own this domain and I\u2019ve spent probably hundreds of thousands of dollars between getting the trademark, the domains, people trying this process in the past and having it fail multiple times.</p> <p>So anyway, the domain before was called body evolution and that was what we were going to do and this weekend we realized that\u2019s probably the wrong angle so we changed everything. We went back and forth, Dave Kerry and I about a dozen times figuring out different names and hooks and angles. And what\u2019s the movement and what\u2019s the new opportunity and all sorts of things and finally Sunday Morning it all came to a head and we figured it out. So the domain that we got is haveitallmom.com and haveitallmomsclub or haveitallmoms.club, but it\u2019s all about having it all and women can have it all and moms can have it all. You can be a mom and you can be a business owner, and you can have good health and you can do all these things, but you gotta change some stuff first. A lot of it begins with the fuel you put in your body and all these things. It\u2019s kind of like a weight loss program, but the problem, and this is me going back to the whole, I\u2019ve been reading this \u201cred ocean blue ocean thing\u201d and thinking a lot about that. It\u2019s like weight loss is red ocean, there\u2019s a billion people all fighting and there\u2019s blood everywhere in the water and we could go in there. Or what if we created our own blue ocean? So our blue ocean is becoming a mom who has it all and how do you do that? Initially you do it through weight loss, that\u2019s how you build the energy you need to have it all. So it\u2019s a weight loss program, but it\u2019s not positioned that way. So we\u2019re totally in the blue ocean just hanging out by ourselves, and if we execute it correctly today it\u2019s going to help us take over the world. So I\u2019m so excited.</p> <p>So that\u2019s all happening, which is cool. And then the other side, oh I\u2019m so excited. So tomorrow, Tuesday we are on the Profit. So Marcus Lemonis and I have no idea if I\u2019m going to actually be on the profit, I\u2019ll probably be on the cutting room floor. I don\u2019t even know exactly what\u2019s happening yet. But we\u2019re going to be on the Profit, and so we thought if we\u2019re going to be on the Profit, we need to throw a party. So initially we were going to throw a party at my house. But then one person became 2. 2 became 10. 10 became 30. 30 became 50 and I realized my wife is going to kill if I did a huge party with 50+ people at my house, so we called the local movie theater and we rented a movie theater that holds 200+ people and now we\u2019re throwing a real party and we\u2019ve got almost 200 people rsvp\u2019d to come to that tomorrow. So we\u2019re going to be watching the Profit together with a whole bunch of funnel hackers here in Boise and then the second side of it is episode number one of Funnel Hacker TV should be done today, so we\u2019re going to show that at the episode as well. And show them Funnel Hacker\u2026\u2026show them episode one to all those who are in Boise on the big screen which is going to be so insane. I\u2019m so excited.</p> <p>So that\u2019s happening tomorrow, which is cool. And then on top of that, I was thinking when Funnel Hacker TV does come out, I may or may not like to watch the Bachelor and Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise, the whole series, it\u2019s so embarrassing. But when I do, when we first got married, everyone thought it was cool. Now nobody will admit it\u2019s cool. We used to have Bachelor Parties and we\u2019d all get together with all our friends and eat food and have fun, and watch the show. Place some bets on who\u2019s going to get sent home each week and it was awesome. Now my friends all matured, I didn\u2019t yet, but all the rest are like, \u201cWe\u2019re too cool for this.\u201d And they watch big kid shows now. But we\u2019re still stuck on the teeny bopper reality show, my wife and I. So we watch it together every week and we love it. But what\u2019s interesting is that across the world everyone\u2019s throwing what they call Bachelor parties and they happen all over the world. Every Monday night everyone gets together and watches the Bachelor parties and it\u2019s really, really cool. So I\u2019m like, \u201cWell I want to do the same thing with our reality show.\u201d So I\u2019m trying to get, my guess is it\u2019ll take a little while to get this actually happening consistently, but I was like, I wanna run little Funnel Hacker parties all around the world where people get together and they watch Funnel Hacker TV together as little parties right. So each week we launch Funnel Hacker TV, everyone gets together, everyone watches together, it becomes this really fun thing, and the people who are hosting the parties have a chance to talk about funnels with each other. And you can invite your friends and family members over. People who don\u2019t know what you do for a living, because that\u2019s kind of a thing that happens with all of us. And Let them watch and be like, \u201cOh that\u2019s what you do. How exciting.\u201d And then it becomes this real, tangible, fun, exciting thing.</p> <p>So that\u2019s where we\u2019re trying to go to.\u00a0 So I thought let\u2019s start this with the Profit party. So we\u2019re doing these Profit viewing parties all around the country and around the world hopefully. The hard thing about the Profit is it doesn\u2019t play in every country. So we got people in Canada and Australia who can\u2019t even see it are trying to set up these parties anyway. One of those things that\u2019s kind of frustrating. But the nice thing about Funnel Hacker TV when it comes out, there\u2019s no limits. Because it will be on Facebook and on Youtube and stuff like that. I\u2019m definitely excited for that. That\u2019s kind of what\u2019s going down over here. But that\u2019s the process we\u2019re trying to start now, having these local meet ups. People watching this show together and hopefully that will become something that we\u2019re able to use long term to get people to start doing these funnel hacking hack-a-thons all around the country. All just steps we\u2019re trying to do in building our community, building our following, getting people to share our message and hopefully making our business not just static boring business. But something people look forward to and something that people that it becomes part of their life.</p> <p>You know I was thinking about this, and I\u2019ll probably end on this because we\u2019re almost to the office and I gotta start running because my 24 episode starts in 32 minutes. I remember the first time I ever went to a Send Out Cards event, which is a network marketing program, and I\u2019m going to this event, and basically I\u2019m going to offend somebody here so I apologize, but Send Out Cards is basically really bad software. I\u2019ll just call it that as it is. When it first came out it was really cool, but now it\u2019s like every card platform on earth has surpassed them. But I went to this thing and it\u2019s like, I remember David Frye, who is one of the top money earners in the company, he\u2019s like, \u201cRussell, this is software. This is a software platform and look at this. People are at this event.\u201d And there were 4 or 5 thousand people and they were crying and they were on stage telling their stories and it was like this movement and I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s a software program. Why are people on the stage crying that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d And since we built Clickfunnels I thought about that. I don\u2019t want this to be a software program, I want this to be a movement. So how do we do that?</p> <p>So all these things we\u2019re doing now are all part of that. Some may work and some may fall on their face. I don\u2019t know, but I just want to share it with you guys. Because whatever it is you\u2019re selling, if it\u2019s software, if it\u2019s info products, if it\u2019s supplements, the more you can turn it into this, the more you un-commonitize yourself and you become something unique and something special. So that\u2019s what I got. I\u2019m at the office and I gotta go bounce. See you guys later. I will share with you guys what happens 24 hours from now. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and we\u2019ll talk soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "13:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_258.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1472600853, "title": "Episode #257 \u2013 Does Your Message Even Matter?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The gift I got today, that I want to share with you so you can keep moving forward.</p> <p>On today\u2019s special 257th episode Russell talks about how money doesn\u2019t buy happiness, but how you can achieve happiness by helping and serving others, as well as by improving your inner self.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why working towards wealth shouldn\u2019t be your focus because in the end it doesn\u2019t matter.</li> <li>Why serving other people\u2019s needs will help you with your own needs and in turn help you achieve true happiness.</li> <li>And why focusing on your contribution and growth can help you actually become something and why that\u2019s more important than wealth.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why money doesn\u2019t equal happiness.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey Everyone this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to episode 257, a very special episode of Marketing in Your Car. Alright everybody, I\u2019m excited today and you may be thinking, Russell why is today so special? Well It\u2019s special for a few reasons. First off, this is episode 257, that just sounds cool. Second off, right now, a little later on today we are taking these first 250 episodes and we\u2019re putting them onto MP3 players that we will be giving away for free plus shipping, I think I talked about this a couple of months ago, but we\u2019re going to do it. This is the last episode that will be on the MP3 player.</p> <p>So for those of you guys that are listening on the MP3 player, you made it to the end, congratulations! For those who have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, give me about a week or two, we still gotta get them back from China, but when you go to marketinginyourcar.com, you\u2019ll be able to get a free MP3 player with the first 257 episodes preloaded, which will be kind of cool. And my brother, actually edited out the intro song on most of them so you don\u2019t have to hear the intro song 8 thousand times either, so that\u2019s kind of cool too. So that way you can go and you can geek out. You can binge listen to everything while you\u2019re everywhere and you\u2019ll have your own personal MP3 player with the first 257 episodes, so I\u2019m excited. That\u2019s number one.</p> <p>So then with that said, I gotta think about something cool to say, because this is going to be the last episode that those that are on the MP3 player got. I can\u2019t just end on a thought, it\u2019s gotta end on something cool. So then I had all sorts of stress and pressure. I\u2019m like, well crap. What am I going to talk about? Then it came to me, so I actually just drove back, this is my second drive to the office, I\u2019m driving back home and back to the office because I wanted to get my notepad. This morning I had one of my coaching sessions with Tara, and it was interesting. Tara is my woo woo coach, you guys probably heard me talk about her a couple of times, super cool. They\u2019re also in my Inner Circle and just some of my favorite people in the world. The coaching\u2019s been really cool because its kind been coaching things but kind of you don\u2019t know where it going to go and it goes different directions and every time there is something really valuable that comes out the other side of it. And this time it kind of answered a question that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a verbal question I have had. Or I\u2019m asking this question I\u2019m asking out loud consciously. But subconsciously I think that probably all of us have this thought as we\u2019re doing what we do in our lives and businesses.</p> <p>The thought is does any of this even matter? I am fully aware that someday I\u2019m going to be dead and it could be today, that car just drove past, boom, could hit me. I could be doing my podcast and driving and I get hit by a car and it\u2019s over. And I am fully aware of that. When I die, guess what I get to take with me. Nothing. It\u2019s done. My cool car, my cool house, none of my\u2026\u2026it\u2019s gone instantly. So I get that, I believe that, I understand that. So it\u2019s like, why do we even care?</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting when my Grandpa passed away, probably a year and a half, 2 years ago now. I thought it was so weird, after he died they brought all my uncles together, basically they handed out his possessions he had left in life. There was a gun and a couple of things and that was it and I\u2019m like, \u201cWow. My grandpa lived a full life. He was amazing.\u201d\u00a0 By the time you get to the end you give away all your stuff, you got rid of them. It\u2019s like, \u201cHere are the 4 or 5 things I have left.\u201d And you divvy them out and it\u2019s done. Man that\u2019s going to happen to me. The reality is none of this money stuff matters, even a little bit. Other than it helps make your life a little more comfortable here, but it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s ridiculous. My mission of helping entrepreneurs to share their message so they can make more money, and we talk about money a lot because that\u2019s how we keep score. But does it even matter? When all is said and done, am I just kind of spinning my wheels? I think I subconsciously have that thought, maybe I should just shut down shop and focus on other places I can contribute. Does this contribution actually help, help people make money? You know what I mean?</p> <p>So there\u2019s the question that I didn\u2019t consciously ask, but from today\u2019s coaching session kind of came out of it. And if you could see my notepad, I actually grabbed my notes. This is the first Marketing In Your Car I\u2019m actually teaching from a notepad, so that\u2019s how prepared\u2026\u2026.I have these little circles with arrows that go around in a bigger circle, I think there\u2019s 4 circles and the top circle I wrote, \u201cTriggers Fears\u201d and so what does that mean? What I probably do for a lot of you guys, I\u2019m guessing, hopefully I get you guys excited and help you see the vision of what can be and where you could go. But I\u2019m sure with that comes a lot of fears. Like, oh wow, he wants me to do a podcast, or he wants me to go spend money on ads. He wants me to do a webinar every single week. Every week he wants\u2026\u2026all these fears come up, right. And then I\u2019m trying to be a good role model, so I\u2019m doing these things that I\u2019m telling people to do and I\u2019m actively, consistently doing them over and over again trying to be, I hate saying this, sounds stupid, but being the model. Here\u2019s something\u2026.I gotta try and practice what I preach so people can see that and hopefully say, \u201cIf Russell can do it, I can do it.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s something Liz told me after she started having success, she said, \u201cIf Russell can do it, I can do it.\u201d And I hope people feel that way. I want to be this thing, but a lot of what I\u2019m telling people to do and teaching and coaching on there\u2019s fear associated with it, right? If there weren\u2019t fears, you would have already done it, but for some reason there\u2019s these fears. And most of the time, most of the coaching and consulting I do is stuff people know. Sometimes there\u2019s tactiful things that we bring to the table and they\u2019re different. But most of the time, you kind of know the path, but there\u2019s fears and concerns and false beliefs and things that keep you from that. So I\u2019m coming in and I\u2019m like a wrecking ball. Busting through these things and probably causing a lot of fears for you guys.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the first step in my little mission here. The second step is come back after you fall through with tools. So it\u2019s like, we got a new webinar movie, go! I\u2019m freaked out! Don\u2019t worry, here\u2019s the tools to actually make that possible. These are the tools and the training and the coaching and consistent repetition of this stuff. If you listen to my message, if you listen to all 257 episodes, you probably noticed there\u2019s a lot of patterns and a lot of repetition and a lot of things we come back to that are essential. So after we get the fears, after we set off the triggers that cause the fears, then my next step is I\u2019m delivering the tools and the things to make it possible. And then those people, unfortunately not everyone, but the people who step into those fears and accept them and then go after the tools to fight it, eventually when they follow that process they get to a spot where they get money or security in their life.</p> <p>So it\u2019s interesting because that\u2019s typically the driving force for change. You go through this process, you have these fears, you learn these tools and then during this process you start becoming and that\u2019s the word I want to stress. You start becoming something. You figure out what people need, you figure out how you can serve them at the highest level. You figure out your voice. You start learning it and developing as a human and as a person and you become something different, something more, hopefully. So when that happens, the way the world or the universe or whatever call it, rewards you for that sacrifice and that effort. And really it\u2019s the transformation from growth to contribution. In fact, I have this as the overarching theme for the next Funnel Hacking Live, is like that transition from growth to contribution. There\u2019s a point in our life where we\u2019re growing and learning and studying and it\u2019s all a growth phase for yourself. Because you can\u2019t\u2026..if you\u2019re not prepared you can\u2019t go out there and serve. So there\u2019s a growth phase we all have to go through.</p> <p>But if you keep growing forever, you keep learning and growing and you keep that to yourself, you can\u2019t keep progressing. The only way, there\u2019s a point where you can\u2019t progress in life through more personal development, or more growth, it\u2019s impossible. There comes a point where the only way you can actually grow in life is by transitioning from growth to contribution, and then your growth comes through the contribution. My company grows now\u2026.me as a person grow as I help and serve other people and contribute to them and as they have success, that\u2019s what brings me joy, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>There\u2019s the religious tangent here that I probably won\u2019t\u2019 go too deep into because I know every time I talk about religion I get a couple funny stares, but for the Mormon\u2019s who are out there listening. There\u2019s a scripture that we believe in Moses 1:39 it says, \u201cBehold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortal and eternal life of man.\u201d That\u2019s God\u2019s mission too. It\u2019s not to make him more glorious or better. He grows in glory by contribution, by helping us to achieve our full potential. So it\u2019s kind of this really cool thing.</p> <p>So back to this, so through that process of becoming who you\u2019re supposed to be through the personal development, the growth and going through the tools and all these things, at the end you become something and have the ability to start contributing and helping and serving other people. And when you start contributing, the first thing that starts coming back to you, because it\u2019s the way this world judges monetary value is money, you start making money. At first it\u2019s exciting and then it gets really exciting and then one day you wake up and you realize that it doesn\u2019t matter. A lot of people, they start this journey because they think that when I have money I\u2019ll be happy. How many of you guys have thought that? If I just had money, if I had security, then I\u2019d be happy. And the weirdest thing happens when you get money and financial security, you find how it does not bring happiness. So I hate to ruin the surprise for you guys. It doesn\u2019t. It brings temporary pleasure, kind of like eating ice cream. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh that was good, that was really good.\u201d And fifteen minutes later you are like, \u201dWhat was I thinking? That was not worth what I feel like now.\u201d That\u2019s how money is, its temporary pleasure.</p> <p>So we mistake that sometimes for happiness, but it doesn\u2019t. It leaves you empty just like that ice cream, you\u2019re empty. Maybe you\u2019re kind of full, but you feel empty inside and you\u2019re like, \u201cMan, I could have not eaten that and felt really good, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s kind of how money, you\u2019ll find out, money isn\u2019t the best\u2026\u2026\u2026it\u2019s not the best servant. It\u2019s like Ice cream.</p> <p>So they get money and after you get money you realize, \u201cWell, I\u2019m still not truly happy.\u201d Then, and this is the key, then you start focusing more on the contribution and you start trying to make the changes inward in yourself. Because you realize true happiness doesn\u2019t come through wealth, it comes through serving other people, it comes through the actual things I need to change about my life. It has to do with cutting out addictions, with serving people, all these weird religious things we learn about in church. I\u2019ll leave that one there. But it\u2019s interesting.</p> <p>But the problem is that most people never get to fixing themselves and the internal struggles and problems they have and really get out there and contribute because they are so stressed out about the financial problems. I remember growing up, and I don\u2019t remember where in school I learned this, I think its like the Mazlov hierarchy needs or something like that. That\u2019s like 8th grade coming back, so I could be completely off, but I think that\u2019s what it was. And in that there\u2019s the need for hunger, and until that need is met, you can\u2019t do anything else. When you get your hunger met, then you\u2019re like okay I need love. When love\u2019s met, then you need shelter, whatever those things are. There\u2019s all these hierarchy of needs, and the problem is\u2026.it\u2019s almost like this is. The real needs are internal problems we have with ourselves that we need to fix, change, grow and develop, but it\u2019s hard to get to that higher need. It\u2019s hard to really care about where you\u2019re living if you\u2019re hungry. As far as Mazlov\u2019s hierarchy.</p> <p>So I feel like, my mission, if we call it that. The reason why it doesn\u2019t matter is because I\u2019m trying to get people to a state where they get through these needs so they can get to a spot where they can focus on their own personal growth and the contribution to help other people. And so if we can get you financially secure and in a place where you\u2019re in a spot of abundance, or whatever you want to call it, now you\u2019ve got the ability to really focus on the inward things that you need to work on in yourself, first off. And second off, really start focusing more on the growth and contribution.</p> <p>So that was cool, like when I saw it today I sketched it out and I had this little thing in my notes with the circles of trigger and fears over tools, over security, over to inward change and then back to growth and contribution. For me, that validated the fact that what I\u2019m doing is important beyond just I\u2019m helping people make money. Because like I said, in the end that doesn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>So for you, I hope you kind of think about that for yourself. The people that you\u2019re serving, and I know that you guys are serving them all at different capacities. Some of you guys are helping save people\u2019s marriages. Some of you guys are helping people with their physical bodies, their health and nutrition. Some of you guys are helping by creating products and services. All of our businesses are here to serve people. That\u2019s why we develop them, that\u2019s why they\u2019re here. So I hope that just thinking through this for your own business, your own life it helps you to kind of think through that and figure out how can I serve people at a higher level? How can I focus on the things that I know are holding me back? I know what holds me back. I know what my pet issues are. The little things that I know, man if I could get rid of these 3 or 4 things I could serve more people, I could feel better about myself. I could be a better dad, a better father, a better husband. I know what those things are and I think you probably do too, deep down.</p> <p>So let\u2019s focus on building the business. You can get your footings underneath you. You can have that stability and you can focus on other things because I don\u2019t want you miss those. I don\u2019t want you to miss out on what life can be because you\u2019re stressing out so much about the financial side of it. The tools are there, the keys are there. We share, everyday on this podcast, we share through Facebook Live, through training, through podcasts, through blogging. We\u2019re giving and sharing as much as we can. We also do it through our training programs, through our coaching, through our software, through our mastermind groups and wherever you\u2019re able to plug in. Plug in and take what you can from that and apply it.</p> <p>Right now, we just recently opened up the Inner Circle, we had a couple spots open up. A bunch of people messaged me, \u201cI can\u2019t afford it, I\u2019m never going to be successful now because I can\u2019t get into your inner circle.\u201d I\u2019m like no, plug in where you\u2019re at. We have stuff at all levels. I\u2019m not holding things back. The reason why my book name is Dot Com Secrets is because I\u2019m the worst secret keeper on planet earth. People always ask me, \u201cRussell, can you keep a secret?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo!\u201d I\u2019m like the worst secret keeper ever. You tell me anything, I\u2019m sharing with the world. I wrote a book called Dot Com Secrets that told everything I ever knew. I am the worst secret keeper ever. But if you\u2019re okay with that, to share with me, I\u2019m going to try to help, and see if whatever you shared with me will help other people. I\u2019m horrible at secrets.</p> <p>I\u2019m not holding back on you guys. There\u2019s nothing that I\u2019m giving that I\u2019m like, \u201cNot going to tell them this piece, they gotta upgrade to get that.\u201d Every level that you plug into, I\u2019m giving you everything. I\u2019m giving you my all. So understand that. If you can\u2019t afford a coaching program yet, then go get the books. If you can\u2019t afford the books yet, get on the podcast, it\u2019s free. If you don\u2019t have a phone to listen to a podcast, go to the library and listen to it. Whatever you need to do, but plug in at whatever level you can and if I\u2019m doing my job right and I\u2019m doing my best, we can ascend you up to the next level. To where you can then afford the next thing to help get you to the next level and keep moving up. And it\u2019s not so much that we want or need more money, but it\u2019s level commitment that comes with that, that helps hold you accountable to actually implementing and following through. Some of these fears and these pains that when you\u2019ve got some money on the line it makes it a lot easier to break through and actually achieve those things that you want in life.</p> <p>So that\u2019s why those things are there. Plug in wherever you can, and we\u2019re going to continue to give and serve and hopefully get you to where you want to be so you can become who you want to be. And if I can do that for at least one of you guys in this podcast, this business, then everything we\u2019re doing is worth it. So I appreciate you guys listening in.

Hey everyone, so this\u2019ll be a shorter one because I\u2019m starting this halfway to the office, but I just had a thought, an inkling, an idea, something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with you. I keep thinking about it and I keep forgetting, but it just popped in my head, so I\u2019m dropping it real quick now. Because I think it\u2019s really, really important.</p> <p>So I was in Kenya with Stu McLaren and we\u2019re sitting there talking about our pasts. We\u2019ve been doing this for a long time, for me it\u2019s been 12 or 13 years now, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s weird because I feel like I\u2019m still just getting started.\u00a0 It\u2019s crazy, last night I had a bunch of my buddies over wrestling and we\u2019re talking about our wrestling era, which was \u2026.we got done 12 or 13 years ago. Which is insane, that means there\u2019s been 4 or 5 cycles of people that came through. Like Jordan Burroughs for example, one of the greatest wrestlers in the world was in high school when we were in college. Anyway, it was just funny how old we actually are getting, which is crazy to me.</p> <p>But Stu and I have both been doing this for 12+ years, and we were talking about a lot of our friends in the past who were the giants and the icons at the time. And they were the ones that we were studying from and learning from and all sorts of stuff. And we were talking about how all of them, for the most part, have disappeared. There\u2019s a couple that are still around in some fashion, but not like they should be. They had a leg up on all of us. But it\u2019s interesting, and I was like I wonder why that happens. Because I don\u2019t want that to happen to me, I want to be relevant in another 10 years from now. I\u2019m doing my best to try to keep things exciting and different.</p> <p>And one thing Stu said that I thought was really interesting and I think he\u2019s right. He said, \u201cIf you look at the commonality between the people who are still relevant today and those who aren\u2019t, the one commonality if you look at all of them is their ability, not their ability, but their willingness to learn from other people.\u201d Stu\u2019s like, \u201cRussell, I\u2019ve seen your library.\u201d I just posted a picture on Facebook of a third of my library, and people were going crazy because it\u2019s insane. I\u2019m studying courses and books and I\u2019m constantly learning from other people, because there\u2019s so many brilliant people out there, and I want to learn all the nuggets that everyone\u2019s got, because everyone\u2019s got different views and perspectives. So I\u2019m studying all these people all the time. Even though the fact that we\u2019re doing pretty dang well. But I\u2019m obsessed, I keep studying and learning and that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping us relevant and hot and on top of things, we\u2019re always focusing on that.</p> <p>And he said, \u201cThose other guys, if you look at a lot of them, they\u2019re I don\u2019t know if prideful is the best word, but they\u2019re people who obviously figured things out early and knew a lot, but none of those guys who are around anymore are studying.\u201d They\u2019re never going to even or reading books or buying courses. They feel like they\u2019re above that, and because of that they become irrelevant in the market. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true in most businesses. I look at actors and actresses and singers and songwriters. People that were the best in the world and then a year later, you don\u2019t hear from them ever again. And it\u2019s a big piece of that.</p> <p>I think sometimes we get so good at what we do that we get cocky or we stop trying to learn and grow, and as soon as you do that, it\u2019s so fast, it\u2019s so easy to become irrelevant in any market, it\u2019s crazy. So what I would say is this, if you are struggling or if you\u2019re doing well, it doesn\u2019t matter. You should be studying a lot from a lot of people, because you\u2019re not above it and if you think you\u2019re above it, that\u2019s when you\u2019re going to lose. That\u2019s when guys like me who are obsessed with this business, and obsessed with marketing, and obsessed with becoming better every single day, we\u2019re going to eat your lunch.</p> <p>So there you go. Go study something, go buy some courses, go download something on your ipod and just geek out and study because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep you sharp. I\u2019m at the office, about to start funnel Fridays. Talking about share funnels, so I gotta go, but I will talk to you guys soon. Have an amazing day, and go study and learn something today. Alright bye.</p> <p>Ps\u2026.My guess is that I\u2019m preaching to the choir because you guys are listening to this podcast, so you\u2019re probably geeking out right now. So I\u2019m probably preaching to the choir. But don\u2019t forget that when you hit the top, it makes it hard sometimes to keep digging in. So keep on keeping on. Alright talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "05:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_256.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1471986881, "title": "Episode #255 \u2013 State Control", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The key to getting people to have the same epiphany that you had.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about state control.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to, you know where we are, we are here today with Marketing In Your Car. Alright everyone, I hope you guys are doing good. I am on day number two of my routine. Not going to lie, I am feeling it. For some reason I couldn\u2019t fall asleep last night, probably because we turned on bachelor in Paradise and that was dumb. As soon as that started, it was like, there\u2019s 2 hours of my life that I\u2019m not going to get back. It\u2019s actually less than that because I can fast forward through the commercials, but it was still way too much time. So probably about 11 I passed out on the couch, wake up and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh crap, I\u2019m already an hour past bedtime, I gotta wake up at 5.\u201d So I jumped into bed and then for some reason I couldn\u2019t sleep until 12:30 and then I finally fell asleep until Norah woke up at like 2. Tough night.</p> <p>5 the alarm clock goes off, I jumped in the float tank and floated, which was really nice. Then I had my call with Tara, my energy session, which was amazing and cool and weird and I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s good, so I really enjoyed it. And now here we are, we\u2019re driving to the office. So I wanted to tell you guys today, I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I love just the art and science of what we do. This whole marketing game. So for me, it\u2019s like here\u2019s the scientific funnel structures that we know work, and within that framework then we have the art. How do we get it to break people\u2019s patterns and cause emotion and get people to connect and bring them back to where they\u2019re at?</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, one of the coolest things that I figured out as I have been writing the new Expert Secrets book, it\u2019s just cool. If nothing else, writing a book is cool because it causes you to deep dive, immersion, all the stuff we\u2019ve been talking about the last couple of weeks. All these cool things come out. And one of the things we were talking about in the book is the whole epiphany bridge concept. I showed you guys a bunch of times, and if you missed that go back to Marketinginyourcar.com and search for one of the episodes on epiphany bridges. But it\u2019s coming back to rewinding and trying, not to sell people, but to get people to buy into what it is you\u2019re selling.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the difference between selling and getting people to buy into what you\u2019re selling. It\u2019s like, trying to get them into buying into something. So I have to cause an emotion for them to be able to buy into that. So for me, a lot of times it\u2019s going back and telling the back story. So you figure out, you start this back story, and the back story is important because where you\u2019re at today, is where your audience wants to be, that\u2019s why they\u2019re listening to you. So your back story brings it back to the spot where you\u2019re starting in the same spot they\u2019re at. So that\u2019s the key, it\u2019s coming off of your pinnacle or whatever you want to call it, the mountain on high, where people are looking at your success and coming back down the mountain and standing where they\u2019re at and saying, \u201cHey, let me tell you about where I was in the same spot, because you want to get to the top of the mountain, that\u2019s where am right now. Let me share with you how I got there.\u201d So you step down off the mountain and you share this back story. You bring them through this process and then you\u2019re telling them about the epiphany you had. Whatever that process or the thing you learned or read or discovered or whatever. Somewhere you had this epiphany that caused you to move and that was kind of the process.</p> <p>There\u2019s a whole bunch in the other podcast about how the epiphany is getting people emotionally connected and things like that. But one of the interesting things, so we talked about in the book, a lot of people tell stories and just kind of tell the story. But if you want to become good at telling stories you have to move away from just the telling of the story. The facts and the details, like \u201cHey, I woke up this morning and I was really tired so I blah blah blah.\u201d And just tell the story, a lot of people tell stories like that. And getting into the feeling side of it, if you read good books you\u2019ll notice when you read the book the author doesn\u2019t just say, \u201cHey I walked into the room and then I went to the bathroom and then I left.\u201d The author walks in the room and he describes the room. \u201cI walked in the room and on the side I could see the paintings that were kind of dusty and they were off center so you could tell they hadn\u2019t been upkept, and the lights in here, one of them was kind of flickering and it gave this dim shimmer on the room. And there was kind of this music you could hear quietly in the background, almost like elevator music but even more quiet. I could smell this musty cigar smell that reminded me of my grandpa and reminded me about back in the day when he used to bounce me on his knees.\u201d So I\u2019m describing the scene to you, number one.</p> <p>Number two starts bringing you into the emotional things, like how you feel. \u201cAs I walked through that door, my hands started to sweat. And as I did that my mouth started getting dry and I had this weird feeling where I couldn\u2019t swallow. I tried to swallow but it got stuck on the swallow. And then that thing that was stuck in my throat and started to swell and I felt like I was going to choke on it, because I couldn\u2019t quite get it through. So I had to cough to get that pressure off my thing and all I could think about was how thirsty I was and I needed some water quick. So I looked over to the bartender and I saw\u2026blah, blah, blah.\u201d So that\u2019s the story and it starts bringing you into the actual feelings. So he starts describing how you feel and the emotions and the senses and you start kind of describing those things.</p> <p>In the book, and in the event we did last week or two weeks ago, whenever that was, we talked a lot about me telling stories. How to tell them, how to get deep into the emotional side and painting a picture. And I was thinking about it and how to write this section of the book, I was like, \u201cWhy is that so important?\u201d and all the sudden it hit me like a ton of bricks. If your job is to tell this epiphany story, this epiphany bridge and you\u2019re trying to give somebody the same epiphany that you had, obviously you tell the story and you hope that the moral of the story is the same thing they get, they the same \u201cWow. I should have a funnel. Wow, I should definitely change my career. Wow, I should do this way to lose weight.\u201d Or whatever that epiphany to have is. For them to get the same epiphany you had, you have to try to get them in the same state that you were in when you had that epiphany. That\u2019s the key, that\u2019s the big aha I had this week. It\u2019s all about state control.</p> <p>I should do a whole course on this, it\u2019s so cool when you start understanding it. I learned it originally from Tony Robbins. How to get in a state instantly. If you search Tony Robbins, search the Triad, it\u2019s a concept he talks about where it\u2019s basically there\u2019s 3 things you need to do to get in state any time. Your physiology, what your body is doing. Then there\u2019s pop quiz if I remember them. Physiology, focus and meaning. So what you\u2019re focusing on and the meaning you\u2019re attaching to things. And you can instantly get into any state as soon as you understand the pieces that go into state control. You can instantly go into a state. I want to be in a happy state. Boom, you can do it by changing your physiology, change what you think about, change your focus. Boom, boom, boom, really quickly you can get into a happy state, or a depressed state. State control is the key when you understand it. So when you understand it for yourself and how you can, not manipulate, but how you can control it and use it at certain times, the same things happening when you\u2019re telling your stories. You were in a certain state when you had that epiphany, so because of that, the change happened. Have you had a friend that tells you a story and they\u2019re like, \u201cThe most amazing thing happened ever! It changed my whole life.\u201d They tell you the thing. \u201cThis was the thing.\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s it? Dude, that\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. When I heard it, it changed everything.\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2026\u201d and the reason it\u2019s not a big deal to you is you\u2019re in a different state when you heard it. So the state you\u2019re in, it\u2019s not that impressionable. You\u2019re like, \u201cOh, yeah. Whatever.\u201d The power behind the epiphany that they had when they share it with you, because you are in a different state, you miss it. There\u2019s no emotion to it.</p> <p>So for one of our stories when we go back and tell our stories, when we\u2019re telling this epiphany bridge, the goal of the story is to get them into the same state that you were in. Because if they\u2019re in the same state you\u2019re in, you control that state and get them to that same state, then they\u2019re more likely to have the epiphany you are trying to get them to make. Does that make sense? I haven\u2019t verbally talked about this, I\u2019m kind of thinking through it live on this podcast to help you think through it. But that\u2019s the key, that\u2019s why it\u2019s good to start understanding the principles of good storytelling. And understanding how to describe the scene that you were in and describe the feelings that you felt, the emotions. Because you describe those things, even though that person is not there, you start telling this story. Like I told you guys the story of the room I walked into. That was all make believe on top of my head, but I\u2019m guessing you guys had a vision and you felt like you were in that spot. And I talked about how I felt when I walked in, my nervous system and the lump in my throat and how thirsty I was. For a minute you guys were taken to that spot. You have to be as I describe it.</p> <p>So for you as you\u2019re trying to tell your stories and give people an epiphany, think about that. It\u2019s not just you have to tell them the story to give them the same epiphany. You have to get them in the same state you were in, and you do that through how you tell the story. Through breaking down the environment and the emotions and all these kinds of things, because when you have those two things in the storytelling process, if you do it correctly you\u2019ll get that person closer and closer and closer to the state that you were in when you had the epiphany. When you share that piece of the story they\u2019re much more likely to have the same epiphany you had. So that\u2019s it you guys.</p> <p>It\u2019s all about state control, so exciting. So I would recommend, here\u2019s your homework assignment. Google Tony Robbins, State Triad, I don\u2019t even know, search Google, Youtube. Find some videos of tony teaching about that, because you need to understand how to do state control for yourself. How to control the state you\u2019re going into, which is powerful. But then second off, you start understanding, as I\u2019m telling my stories these are the things that I\u2019ve got to control in the story. I gotta control the physiology, so how do I do that? I explain my physiology. I want to control their focus, I gotta control the meaning, I gotta control all these different things. How do I do that? By sharing what I was thinking. By sharing my meanings I was attaching. By sharing all those kind of things. So state control. I\u2019m excited. I want to write a whole book on that now. Just kidding. No time for that. No more books. I swore I\u2019d never write a book again after this one, but it would be a cool topic. Maybe we\u2019ll do a training, a deeper one on it.</p> <p>But state control is pretty exciting. So there you go, you guys. Hope that kind of helps as you are doing your stories, writing your webinars, crafting your pitches, connecting with people. Think a little bit more about state control. Alright that\u2019s what I got. See you later, have an amazing day.</p> <p>Oh wait, you guys want one more last value bomb. We learned something cool today, yesterday actually. So Clickbank makes us, when we have a button, you have to have a text version of the button underneath it, so let\u2019s say the button says, \u201cClick here, order now.\u201d Underneath that you gotta have a blue underline link \u201cClick here to order now.\u201d Looks ugly and that was annoying. But Clickbank on their rules said you have to have that, so we had to do it on this thing. So for the Free Water Straw funnel we launched last Thursday, John threw on this heat mapping software, which he always does on the pages, it\u2019s kind of interesting. So he threw it on there to see what\u2019s happening. And what\u2019s interesting is if you look at the page where people are clicking, we\u2019ve got the video, the call to action button, copy, call to action, copy, call to action, anyway the last button, the thing that had the majority of the clicks on the page was on page 3 or page 4 in this funnel and it was the blue underline link underneath the button. Crazy, crazy. So guess what I\u2019m doing right now. I\u2019m going back to every button on every one of my pages and making a blue underline link underneath it. Because It\u2019ll increase your click through rate. All my emails going out will no longer ever have just a button. They will have a button with the blue underline text underneath it, so there you go, guys. There\u2019s a little value bomb for you today. Alright, that\u2019s what I got. Peace you guys, have an amazing day. Talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "13:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_255.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1471906361, "title": "Episode #254 \u2013 NZT Time", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The daily template I built out this week to help maximize world domination.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about making a template of a calendar that he\u2019s going to stick to this week. You will get to hear what his week will be like as he goes through his hour by hour plans.</p> <p>Here are some cool things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What activity is exciting enough to get Russell out of bed at 5 am.</li> <li>Find out how he is able to focus and move forward on projects for 6 hours everyday.</li> <li>And see how often he and his wife get to enjoy a date night.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how Russell is going to spend his week and why it would be beneficial for everyone to have a strict schedule.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, good morning, this is Russell and today\u2019s the first day of school so today is a back to school special of Marketing in Your Car. Hey everyone, I hope life and everything is amazing. I appreciate you guys so much and so glad that you are listening and hanging out with us. I am excited today. Our kids started back to school, which means we get back to a normal schedule. No more staying up til midnight watching movies, no more sleeping in, no more anything. So today I was up early at 5 and I have been pounding through things. It\u2019s now 8:44 and I\u2019ve lived an entire day. Now I\u2019m heading to the office, which is exciting, it\u2019s been really fun.</p> <p>But what I did, and this is what I want to talk to you about because this is important. Yesterday I was like, I\u2019m going to create a schedule and actually stick to it. And a lot of times we have our daily to-do\u2019s that we go through and we have our Google Calendar where everything is calendared out. But I wanted a framework that I could live my week around. So I was like, I don\u2019t know how to do that. I can\u2019t really do that in Google Calendar, I can\u2019t really do it on\u2026.I don\u2019t know. So I was like, I\u2019m going to just make a framework in Excel. Now, I hate Excel, so this is good for any of you guys who are wondering, you don\u2019t have to have any Excel skills to do what I did because I did it without being good at Excel. But I opened up Excel and left hand side, I started breaking down time. And the morning, my morning routine is a lot tighter, minute by minute of what I need to get done. The afternoon is bigger time and then night is bigger as well. So I broke it down.</p> <p>For when I wake up, I got 15 minute segments, so 5:00, 5:15, 5:30, 5:45. 6:00, 6:15 like that all the way until the morning. So I did that on the left hand side. And on the right hand side I went Monday through Friday, because Saturday and Sunday are just different days. But Monday through Friday I want to follow a strict, stringent schedule. So I kind of build out the calendar, and again this is not something that shifts day to day, week to week. This is the template, then everything else kind of plugs inside of it. So I did that and then had the template, and then start breaking it down. It took a while, it took me probably an hour and a half, two hours. Kind of kept shifting things around, moving around, trying to find the perfect schedule for the perfect day. You can tell this life radio right, because I\u2019m coughing in the middle. I apologize.</p> <p>So trying to do that, and if you guys listen to my podcast a little while ago about the Perfect Day formula from Greg Valentine stuff, and I kind of started building my perfect day, but it was hard to stick to it because I just kind of had it, but I didn\u2019t have a template of where things are plugged in. So anyway, after about an hour and a half yesterday, I had this template and everything fits. So my goal is this week, is to live the template perfectly and not deviate from it at all. I\u2019ll kind of give you guys an idea of what my template looks like. And everybody\u2019s is going to be different obviously, but this is what mine is.</p> <p>So Monday I start it at 5. From 5 til 6 I have funnel time. So I get up and work on my funnels, my projects, my books and things like that. I found that by leading the day with something that really gets me excited, where there\u2019s pure pleasure and no pain associated with it, it\u2019s easier to get up. When I have to wake up at 5 to go lift, there\u2019s pleasure associated with it, but there\u2019s also a lot of pain, so it was harder. So I\u2019m starting my day with what I would want to do the most. So I wake up, boom from 5 til 6 on Monday is funnel time, and then from 6 til 7 we have weight lifting time, so that\u2019s when I head out to my gym and then invite anyone else who wants to come. Today was kind of fun, Brent and John both came, and Dave came and Steven came, and Dave\u2019s son came. It was a big party today. So that\u2019s kind of what happened from 6 til 7. And I\u2019m trying to do this thing, I used to do it, where Monday I would do back and biceps, Wednesday chest and triceps and Friday would be legs, and the problem with that, I was talking to Alex Hormozi, one of our Inner Circle members and a stud. He talked about, he\u2019s like, \u201cIf you want to be good at anything in life, it\u2019s all about volume. You want to be good at marketing, volume. Just study like crazy and do a bunch of stuff. You want to get good at lifting, it\u2019s all volume. Right now you are lifting out each of your body parts once a week, you should do it three times a week.\u201d I was like, alright. So today we lifted everything. We did a circuit, a heavy circuit. We did legs, back, biceps, chest, triceps. Kind of pounded all of them, which was really, really fun. I actually got done in less than an hour, which is cool. Super intense, just lifted hard and heavy and as soon as that was done, at 7 til 7:30, we\u2019ve got a cryo session. So we jumped on over to the cryosauna, everyone wanted a freeze, froze, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>Then from 7:30 til 8:30, is my family time. That\u2019s about the time my kids are waking up. So I jump out and have breakfast with them, and then we got them ready, got school pictures and then they headed out the door. From 8:30 til 9 is Marketing in Your Car/driving to the office, which is what\u2019s happening right now. We\u2019re in the middle of this day, you guys are part of it. When I get to the office I\u2019ve got about 15 minutes to kind of plan out what\u2019s happening, and then I have what\u2019s called NZT time. So NZT time, if you guys have been watching Limitless, the movie or TV series, both are amazing. If you do, watch the movie first and then go watch the TV series. But in there, there\u2019s this magic new tropic called NZT, where you take it and all the sudden you are in the zone. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not a real thing called NZT that actually works like it, but there\u2019s a thing called Keto OS, similar. It\u2019s got caffeine in it, it\u2019s amazing. And normally I was taking that first thing in the morning, the problem is that by the time I get to the office it had all worn off, so what\u2019s happening now is I\u2019m bringing in my NZT, which is my Keto OS along with a bunch of supplements and stuff. So as soon as I get there, I\u2019m going to plan my day and it becomes NZT time. Basically I\u2019m going to drink the stuff, I get my caffeine boost, focus and it\u2019s my NZT time.</p> <p>So if you watch the TV show, Limitless, basically what happens is he comes in every morning, he takes NZT and he\u2019s got a 12 hour window where the NZT works and he\u2019s like a genius for 12 hours. So I\u2019m going to do the same thing, except for instead of 12 hours it\u2019s closer to 6 hours. Take my thing and then it\u2019ll \u2026.obviously it\u2019s not the same as NZT but it\u2019s like\u2026..there\u2019s something really cool with rituals and with doing things to get yourself into a state. So I\u2019m trying to create a state called my NZT state, which is like everything is focused. Boom, I take this drink and now I\u2019m in focus mode. I\u2019m out of reactive zone. I can\u2019t answer emails, can\u2019t check emails, can\u2019t do anything. Just gotta move forward on the projects. So it\u2019s, obviously there\u2019s a little caffeine boost, which always feels good. And I like drinking Keto OS because it tastes good and you get ketones in your body, a whole bunch of benefits. But it\u2019s more so the initiation of the state. If you\u2019ve been to a Tony Robbins event, you learn how to get yourself in a state instantly. You learn how to create triggers and things to get you back into that state. So this is going to be my trigger. That as well as the song, Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes, always gets me in a state. So I will drink that while I listen to that music and it will automatically get me in a NZT state, which is where I\u2019m going to be most productive and I will work like crazy through my NZT state, which will be about 6 hours. It will be probably somewhere between 10 and 4. That\u2019s 6 hours right. Yeah, 10 to 4 will be my NZT state, which is all proactive, moving forward time, which will be amazing.</p> <p>About 4 I kind of go out of that. That\u2019s when I check emails, Voxers, catch up on everything. Then at 5 I shift to family time. From 5 til 9 is family time, so me and the kids are partying, playing, my wife as well. Reading scriptures, having dinner, playing. And then at 9 the kids go to bed. From 9 til 10 I\u2019ve got scripture study time, which is going to be me in bed with some Biohacking device, so I\u2019ve got all sorts of weird, crazy crap that Anthony\u2019s got me hooked to. Different lights and lasers and things so I\u2019ll be sitting in bed from 9 til 10 hooked up to lights and lasers as I read my scriptures, get my spiritual time in, re-focus, re-center. Then at 10 at night, try to go to bed, which is hard for me, but it\u2019s the only way to get up at 5. So that is Monday.</p> <p>Tuesday will be similar; the only difference is I\u2019m not lifting on Tuesday. On Tuesday morning I wake up, I\u2019m actually going to start with a float in the float tank for an hour. My float tank time is my gratitude time. So I sit in the float tank and I think about everything I\u2019m grateful for, and not at a high level, but person by person by person. So my wife, my kids, each one of my kids. I think about each of them and be grateful for them, and then I go through my parents, my siblings, my staff, my team and I go person by person and think about what I\u2019m grateful about each of these people for, until I fall asleep, which is usually what happens. Because I don\u2019t really know how to meditate and it seems weird to me and I don\u2019t really like the idea of meditating, but I do love being in the float tank. So when I\u2019m in the float tank, that\u2019s what I do. I go person by person and think about them and what I\u2019m grateful for. And when you wake up after that, you just feel good. So I got float tank in the morning from 5 til 6:15.</p> <p>At 6:15 I got my energy session with Tara Williams, so I\u2019ll be doing that for an hour, til 7:15. At 7:15 boom, that\u2019s when kids are getting up and my morning routine from that point Tuesday is pretty much the same.</p> <p>Wednesday will be very similar to Monday. Thursday I don\u2019t have an energy session, so I\u2019m going to basically start the morning with funnel time for an hour, then do a float session. And then Friday is pretty much the same as Monday and Wednesday. The only difference is Friday at 4 I leave the office and I shift into date time. My wife and I have dates a couple times a month. Now we\u2019re going to make it where every Friday it happens, regardless.\u00a0 I\u2019m Mormon, so one thing we\u2019re going to do is try to once a month go to the temple during that time, and three times a month doing dates. Probably dates by ourselves, maybe inviting friends to dates. Basically every Friday night will be locked down to date time.</p> <p>There you go, there is my template for Monday through Friday. Oh, and one other thing. Thursday night from 9 til 11, I threw in wrestling time. So I\u2019m inviting some of my wrestling buddies over and I will wrestle for 2 hours every Thursday night, which is something that feeds me and fuels me and gets me excited. So thursday night is wrestling time.</p> <p>So there\u2019s my template, its printed out and literally set in ink. You can\u2019t change it when it\u2019s set in ink, right? So I got it printed out, I\u2019m carrying it with me and I\u2019m going to try this week to follow that template to a t, as perfect as I can. The reason I sacrificed some things, it means The Bachelor in Paradise, I will not be able to watch it tonight because it wasn\u2019t on the template. I\u2019ll shift those things to Saturday, they\u2019ll be Saturday activities. Everything else that\u2019s fun that doesn\u2019t fit in those, I will shift those things to the weekend. Weekends I\u2019ll be more free. Weekends are all about for us, getting projects done and then playing with the kids and really just having fun there. And Sunday is more of a church, family time. So that\u2019s kind of the game plan. So I\u2019ll be, at least this week, trying to be perfect in the template. So I recommend for you guys if you don\u2019t have a template yet, to go build one. Again, it\u2019s not going into your Google calendar and blocking out hour by hour, because those are for your minute by minute things, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening inside your NZT zone or whatever those things are for you. For me, this is a template that\u2019s printed out that I can look at and say, \u201cFrom this block this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019 m excited to try it out, and I\u2019ll let you know throughout this week how it goes. But that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Hope that helps a little bit. That is my schedule and that\u2019s all I got you guys.

I hoopoe you are doing amazing. Welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey everyone, I hope things are going amazing for everybody today. I am so exciting. We are coming in to start filming episode number 2 of Funnel Hacker TV. I cannot wait for you guys to see this. I cannot wait, you guys are going\u2026.I hope. I really hope actually. You may hate this show, but I think you\u2019re going to like it, I think you\u2019re going to love it. We\u2019ll film episode number 2 today, which is today. So episode number one we all went into Biohacking Secrets. We built out the book funnel for that. So if you go to biohackersguide.com you can get the free book and see the funnel and blah, blah, blah. So that\u2019s step number one.</p> <p>That was the first thing that we did. That\u2019s working awesome. So episode one is all about that and kind of telling Anthony\u2019s story and that kind of thing, which was cool. Episode 2 now we\u2019re doing a funnel with my Christian Ferrante (good luck spelling that), he\u2019s awesome. Someone\u2019s who\u2019s been working with us for a long, long time. He\u2019s just an awesome guy. So he\u2019s been building a survival product forever. I wanted to be in the survival space for a long, long time. Ever since all the people I know have started crushing it in survival. And I always wanted to do a survival straw that you drink. Have you seen those little straws that are like a filter so you can drink out of a toilet if you want to? So when the world comes to an end you are still good to go. So that\u2019s what I always wanted was a survival straw, so we\u2019re kind of partnering on this and doing a survival straw offer and it\u2019s going to be cool. But this episode, the first episode was very emotional. Anthony\u2019s an emotional guy and the story\u2019s awesome. So that was episode one, we want to lead with that.</p> <p>Episode number two now we want to kind of start defining some of the core things like what funnel hacking actually is. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be kind of cool about this one. We\u2019re actually going to go and this is going to be a funnel hack episode. We funnel hacked two survival funnels yesterday and Steven designed them on these big old poster boards so we\u2019re going to be showing those on the video and walking through the whole thing and really mapping out exactly what we\u2019re going build it and then we\u2019re going to go build it. It\u2019s going to be amazing. I already pre-bought ads that are going to be running tomorrow for this funnel we\u2019re going to be doing today, and a bunch of other cool things.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s going down. It\u2019s going to be a fun day. We have today and tomorrow to shoot, but the ads go live tomorrow morning. So we pretty much have to get it all done today. So cross your fingers. And I got to get home because we got people coming over tonight. So it\u2019s not like I can pull an all-nighter. We got to get this done during business hours today, which will be a ton of fun. So that is what we\u2019re scrambling for.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. So many fun things. I tell you what, I spent probably, I don\u2019t know, 10 or 12 hours yesterday working on the new Expert Secrets book. I gotta tell you, I am so, so, so, so, so, so excited. I would say, and I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve said it over myself, but after the event we had last weekend talking about Expert Secret stuff and going deep into it. I always get people like, \u201cThe event was amazing. Best thing I\u2019ve ever been to.\u201d Those things always come with any event you do. This was different. I had people who don\u2019t normally give compliments to me, to try to pat me on the back, come back and pull me aside and be like, \u201cDude, this is the best thing you have ever done, ever.\u201d Which is exciting. Multiple people\u2026\u2026\u2026So I\u2019m just dying. I want this book to be done. I\u2019m hustling more than I ever have because you guys, I spent the last 8 months writing the first version of the book, and it was good, but it didn\u2019t fire me up. Now all I want to do is have this book done. But it\u2019s going to be good. It will redefine everything you believe about selling and how to sell and how to build a following. I can\u2019t even tell you how cool it is.</p> <p>One of the really cool things, one of the things we talked about at the event is that there\u2019s two pieces. One\u2019s you becoming an expert and two is building a following. If you don\u2019t have a following, it\u2019s the whole, \u2018if a tree falls in the forest and no one\u2019s there to hear it, does it make a noise?\u2019 No, it doesn\u2019t. If you\u2019re an expert and there\u2019s no one there that listens to you then it doesn\u2019t really matter. You\u2019re just some crazy person on the corner yelling. So how do we build a following and what goes into that. So we broke that down a lot. What\u2019s cool is there\u2019s 3 core components. You see the book, you\u2019ll see all the hand sketches in the book and it\u2019ll make more sense. But it\u2019s basically a charismatic leader, a cause and a new opportunity. Those are three things that have to be present for there to be a mass movement. For there to be people to buy into your vision and things like that.</p> <p>You know, a charismatic leader/attractive character, we talk a lot about that. The new opportunity is the big aha you will have when you read the book. The reason why most people, if your offer is failing, means you\u2019re probably selling an improvement or repair offer, where you\u2019re trying to make things better as opposed to a new opportunity. And I make a pretty dang convincing argument that you have to have a new opportunity. And we look at pretty much every offer we ever had that succeeded were all tied to a new opportunity. None of the improvement offers have ever made any money. So there\u2019s another lesson for you, but that\u2019s a lesson for another day because we can go deep into that.</p> <p>The cool thing we figured out yesterday is the middle one is the cause. Creating a cause. When you create a cause, it\u2019s got to be something that is all based on the vision of the future because people are afraid of what the future could hold. They don\u2019t want to move, there\u2019s fear around that. But when they\u2019re faithful in the future it makes them want to move towards that compelling future, that vision that you\u2019re kind of painting and illustrating. So that was a big part of it.</p> <p>Then I was trying to explain that at the event. I was like, \u201cHow do we get everyone to get this and understand it?\u201d and I was struggling for them to get it and all the sudden I had this thought pop in my head to show the intro video for the reality show that we\u2019re filming episode two of today. Because in that I wrote the script and it was all about this call to action. I wanted this to be an us versus them, like we\u2019re separating us from traditional business. We\u2019re separating us from college. We\u2019re separating us from VC backed companies. I wanted a very clear, defined us versus them. So when you guys see the intro the first time, first off you are going to love it because it\u2019s pretty dang cool. Second off, you\u2019ll see how it\u2019s this thing that you\u2019re drawing a line and taking sides. You\u2019re with us or against us type of thing, it\u2019s pretty cool.</p> <p>I showed the video, and people when they saw it were like, \u201cI understand now what you mean by starting a cause or a movement.\u201d So yesterday I was working on the book and I was writing that section and getting stuck. I was like, how do you make this interesting? I don\u2019t want to just have the book be very strategic. \u201cOh you need to start a cause, it\u2019s got to be important.\u201d That\u2019s dumb. What\u2019s the tangible, practical things afterward? So I was thinking more and more through that and all the sudden I started thinking back like in the movie, Jerry Mcguire. In the very beginning Tom Cruises character, I guess his name is Jerry Mcguire in the movie. Anyway, he sits down and he writes out that manifesto of what he thinks the issue should be and he hands it out and that\u2019s the turning point where everyone is either with him or against him, and most people are against him, but he gets Renee Zellwegger or whatever her name is to follow him. That document is what stirred people to action and to want to move towards this cause, which is really cool.</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of the concept. So I started saying, I feel like every business, every cause needs to have that. That moment where they sit down and write out the Jerry Mcguire letter. This is their manifesto of what they believe and who they are and who they\u2019re not. Well how to do they write that. What\u2019s the tangibles? So then I went back to the video for Funnel Hacker TV and I listened to it 5 or 6 times and there was a very cool script that was in there and I sketched it out.\u00a0 Number one you introduce the attractive character, the charismatic leader. Number two he earned his movement. From there you move over to us versus them. You talk about what you stand for, who you are, who you\u2019re not. From there you talk about why your movement is better and then you talk about who this is not for and then you transition at the end to who you are and who are as movement.</p> <p>It was so cool, so I sketched out the whole thing. I drew it on a flag, so it turned out so cool. So now we\u2019ve got an actual script and a process for people to build out their manifesto or whatever you want to call it. The call to get people into your cause. That was a big aha yesterday that we got that and we got that into the book. It was so cool.</p> <p>So anyway, just something to think through today. We\u2019ll get deeper into the charismatic leader and the new opportunity, but today I want you thinking about your cause. What\u2019s your cause? Why should people buy into it? What are the alternatives they have that you need to kind of shun and push aside? Why is your cause the best? Those are the questions I want to you to ask yourself, first off. And then second off, I want you guys to sit down and actually write out, pretend like you\u2019re Jerry Mcguire and you\u2019re pissed at everything that\u2019s happening in the industry and write out your manifesto and create that and then that could be the rallying call for your people, for your cause. You will see that coming in full light here very soon as we release the first episode of our reality show. I think it\u2019s something you guys are going to love.</p> <p>So that\u2019s all I got you guys. I\u2019m at the office, time to go film. I\u2019m only 9 minutes\u2026.6 minutes late. So that\u2019s pretty good, not double digits today. Alright guys, talk to you all soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "11:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_253.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1471383629, "title": "Episode #252 \u2013 The One Thing", "author": "", "summary": "<p>If you can get them to believe this\u2026 the only option is they have to give you all their money.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about that one thing if you can get people to believe they have to have, they will give you all their money.

So glad to have you guys all here today. Heading in for an amazing day, I\u2019m excited. I honestly, last night, had dreams all night about stuff in the Expert Secrets Event. It\u2019s crazy. I wish that you guys all could have been there. In fact, it\u2019s insane that you weren\u2019t there. We\u2019ve been hanging out now for 252 episodes, or 251 episodes, if you haven\u2019t joined the Inner Circle and you weren\u2019t here last weekend, seriously? Come on? What are you waiting for? Have I ever let you down? Come on, you guys.</p> <p>Anyway, the event was amazing, but the process, oh the process. I\u2019m so excited about the process. I totally want to start doing high end events where people come in for 2 days or 3 days and we just take everyone through that process. I had multiple people afterwards tell me, \u201cMan, everyone that comes into your world should go through this. Anyone who joins Inner Circle should go through this process first.\u201d Because it helps to identify so much of what you\u2019re actually doing and selling and how you\u2019re positioning it. Oh, so many cool things.</p> <p>Anyway, today I\u2019m excited because I\u2019m going back through all the PowerPoint slides from the event, making tweaks and changes based on some of the stuff we discovered together as a group. Things that as I was teaching didn\u2019t come out quite clear, or I hit road blocks. Or things from my stories that weren\u2019t the right stories the first 2 or 3 times. Sometimes I tell a story\u2026..I was like, \u201cHuh, that story was completely inappropriate or weird or the wrong thing.\u201d So just kind of re-factoring everything in the process. And I\u2019m going to go through and record while it\u2019s still the top of my mind. Re-record all the sections and that will help as the audio commentary as we go through and we start writing this new version of the book, which I\u2019m so excited for. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s been going down over here, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m excited for today.</p> <p>I also have decade in a day so we also had a bunch of new Inner Circle members who came in. I think it\u2019s 4 of them that we\u2019ll be doing coaching sessions with this morning, which will be kind of cool. So for those who are wondering about the Inner Circle, it\u2019s typically always sold out, but every once in a while there is a spot or two that open up. People who don\u2019t renew or the people who don\u2019t love money, I think. So anyway, for the most part those are always booked out but we did have a couple of slots open up, I think we might have one or two more for people who are trying to decide if they\u2019re renewing or not. So if you\u2019re interested, go run and go to Russellbrunson.com because there might be a little, small window where you can get one of the last one or two spots left, if you\u2019re interested.</p> <p>With that said, I\u2019m going to move back onto Expert Secrets. So I\u2019m probably just going to, as I\u2019m geeking out on this for the next while, share some things. I\u2019ll share like last night when I couldn\u2019t sleep because it was so, so, so excited. It comes back to a concept I talked about a lot. And it was something that in the event, I had planned maybe 10 minutes to talk about this concept and it ended up turning out to be over 2 \u00bd hours of us going really, really, really, really deep into it. And it was\u2026..it opened up my eyes to really understand this whole thing. So let me step back.</p> <p>The concept that I\u2019m talking about right now is the one thing. We\u2019ve talked about this before. Any time you have to convince your prospects of more than one thing, your conversions will drop in half instantly. So you\u2019ve got to pick one belief that you have to get them to believe. So everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What\u2019s that belief? What should it be?\u201d And for a long time I was like, \u201cJust pick one thing.\u201d But the more we thought about it, we started realizing the one thing, first off\u2026\u2026.I wish you guys could read the whole book right now. I wish the book was done so I could read it right now. But it comes back to, to be successful first off, you can\u2019t be selling, you can\u2019t be trying to improve somebody. Nobody wants improvement. That is\u2026..ambitious people want improvement, and the masses, 99% of the world are not ambitious. People have desire, but they don\u2019t have ambition. So if you\u2019re selling to ambitious, \u201cHere\u2019s how to improve your golf swing. Here\u2019s how to make this thing better. Here\u2019s how to improve something.\u201d By default you will make less money.</p> <p>So a big part of the whole thing we talked about how to build a cult/ how to build a culture, I mean. It was all about one of the three steps of building a cult following is you have to have a new opportunity. That may be a whole other podcast for a whole other day, but assume that you\u2019ve got a new opportunity that you\u2019re selling. So they have this new opportunity, so you think about that opportunity. There is got to be one thing that people have to believe. If they believe that one thing then they have to accept your new opportunity. So you gotta think about it. What is that one thing that they have to believe in? If they believe that then they have no other alternate options except to give you money. And every business has this. Every new opportunity has this. So you gotta think through it.</p> <p>So some examples, I\u2019ll step out of business just to give some practical real world examples, so I\u2019m going to go to religion. Religion is probably the easiest place to really identify this. So let\u2019s say, you are considering Christianity as your new opportunity. With Christianity there\u2019s one belief you have to believe. It\u2019s like if the Bible is true then Jesus Christ is our Savior, direct correlation. If you read the Bible and you\u2019re like, \u201cI believe with all my heart that this is true.\u201d Then the only answer is that \u201cOkay, Jesus Christ is my Savior.\u201d That\u2019s it, there\u2019s no other if\u2019s, and\u2019s, or but\u2019s. Okay, I look at, I\u2019m a Mormon as all you guys know. Mormons are Christians and we believe in a book called the Book of Mormon. So if I read the Book of Mormon, if I believe that boo is true, that\u2019s the one thing. IF I believe that thing is true then everything that Mormons believe, therefore I believe, because it\u2019s the one thing. I now believe in Latter Day Prophets, I believe in Temple ordinances. Here\u2019s all the things that Mormons believe. If you believe the Book of Mormon is true then you have to believe all these other things.</p> <p>Same thing is probably true in every religion. If you believe the Koran is true then this all the stuff you have to believe. So religion is very\u2026.you look at religion they are all tied to a one thing. What\u2019s the one thing you believe? If you believe that then everything else is part of that belief patterns. So you gotta look at your business and your new opportunity you are providing people and there\u2019s always the same thing. Like when we were launching Clickfunnels, if I could get people to believe that the only way their business could succeed is they have to build sales funnels inside of Clickfunnels. If I can get them to believe that there\u2019s no other option. You have to give Russell all your money now, because he\u2019s the only person now that provides that thing. Come back to religious. If I believe that Christ is the Savior, or if the Bible is true, then I believe that Christ is my Savior and I have to follow him because the only way to get salvation is through him. That\u2019s what it comes down to.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost like we have to figure out how to make that same statement for our business. If I can convince them that the only way for their business to survive is to create funnels through Clickfunnels is the one belief I have to get into the habit. And if they honestly believe that in the core of their body, then they know that the only way to business salvation is through Clickfunnels, is through what I\u2019m offering. That\u2019s it. So until you\u2019ve identified that statement\u2026\u2026.that has to be step number one. Because then when you start building the webinar, the whole event was about the webinar, everything else in the webinar is built around that. What are all the false belief patterns based on that new opportunity? And what is that thing? And how do we knock down those belief patterns? Everything else gets tied to that, but it all stems from this concept called the one thing. And the one thing is tied to a new opportunity, but what is that sentence?</p> <p>So I said it, it was supposed to be a 10 minute, I explained the one thing in 10 minutes, and everyone wrote what their belief was and they had to get people to convince. And everyone kept sharing with us and then kept coming back with headlines and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! I\u2019m not looking for a headline here, you guys. We\u2019re looking for\u2026.\u201d We ended up developing this sentence and it was like, \u201cIf I can get them to believe \u2018blank\u2019..\u201d and in that blank you put in what new opportunity is. \u201cIf I can get them to believe that the only way to make money online is by having sales funnels built inside of Clickfunnels.\u201d There\u2019s my sentence. If I can get them to believe that, then they\u2019ll have to give me all their money because I am the salvation or success, or whatever you want to call it, could only come through that one path, that one vehicle, right. Because when you\u2019re presenting a new opportunity you\u2019re presenting, man, this will set us back to the previous section with building your culture. Is it, you have to have a new opportunity, so it\u2019s like the new opportunity is the vehicle. If I go to the car dealership, there\u2019s 50 cars there. I\u2019m trying to convince you that this car is the only car you can drive, the only car that makes any logical sense. If I can convince you of that, that this is the vehicle, you have to buy that car. That\u2019s the only vehicle you can go with.</p> <p>So for everyone, if you guys can step back and figure that out for your business, your thing. What is the one thing? The one thing that I can put in a sentence like this, \u2018If I can get them to believe that the only way they can be successful is through blah.\u2019 And it\u2019s your system, your thing, whatever it is. If you can get them to believe that, then that\u2019s it. All of their other concerns disappear. Pricing disappears. Everything else. Every other concern instantly disappears. That\u2019s what we call it in the training. We call it a big domino. It\u2019s a domino where if you know that down, it\u2019ll make all the other dominos\u2026..it\u2019ll either knock down all the other dominos or make them irrelevant. That\u2019s the key.</p> <p>Think about that a little bit you guys. When you can identify what that thing is, it becomes very, very powerful. And then the rest of the webinar is based on, \u2018what are the false beliefs based on that thing?\u2019 And we broke it down at the live event and based it on three things. Secret number one is always tied to the vehicle, secret number two is always tied to the internal struggle, secret number three is always tied to the external struggle. We\u2019ll share that stuff in another podcast, but for today that\u2019s what I want you guys to think about. What is your one thing that if your customers believe that and they believe that success or salvation or whatever you want to call it, is only available through that one thing, what\u2019s that one thing you have to get them to believe. Because that\u2019s it. If we can get them to believe that one thing it knocks over all the dominos or makes them irrelevant and they have to give you money, there\u2019s no other option. That\u2019s the key, you guys. Oh, it\u2019s the key. It\u2019s the biggest key on earth. I can\u2019t believe that it took 2 \u00bd hours in that meeting with everyone there going back and forth before all the sudden it was like the angels were singing. We\u2019re like, this is it. That\u2019s the key. And last night I couldn\u2019t sleep, I spent 8 hours tossing and turning thinking about the one thing. It may seem simple, but think about it, spend some time and effort. Because that is the key that will unlock infinite cells for you for the rest of your life. So that\u2019s it you guys. I\u2019m at the office and I\u2019m going to go start working on my PowerPoint.

Hey everyone, hope you\u2019re doing good. I am on the way to day 3 of the Expert Secrets event and it\u2019s kind of bittersweet, I\u2019m not going to lie.</p> <p>So first off, I told you guys some of the crazy journey that happened last week to get back in time for the event and it sucks because we were supposed to be home on Monday. And if we got home on Monday we would have had half a day on Monday, all day Tuesday, and half a day on Wednesday to hang out with the kids and get caught back up, but because we had missed flights and all that kind of stuff, we didn\u2019t get home until super late Tuesday night. So basically we had Wednesday, but on Wednesday I hadn\u2019t had time yet to prepare for the event. So Wednesday was basically me locked in a room busting out 3 days worth of PowerPoint slides and sketches and just getting everything prepped for the event. So I didn\u2019t have much kid time at all. And then boom, the next day we had two events that started. You know it\u2019s just been\u2026.so I feel bad. I haven\u2019t been a good dad for the last two weeks. And I had some time; I had a couple hours last night, which was really good actually. Then this morning it was Saturday morning and my poor kids are just like, \u201cYou have to go to work again, Dad?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>So first off, I wanna mention is that the hustle that everyone makes sound so amazing and awesome, it sucks and it\u2019s not amazing and it\u2019s not awesome. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I did not get in this business to hustle all the time. There are times when hustle\u2019s important, especially when you\u2019re trying to complete projects, but it seems like the big entrepreneurial message right now, and it\u2019s definitely stemmed from someone I respect. Gary Vaynerchuk is someone I respect, love his stuff. Learned a ton from him, but he\u2019s preaching and prophesying hustle, right. And so because of that entrepreneurs\u2026..it\u2019s becoming a badge of honor. In fact, I saw a funny meme thing that said, \u201c40 hour work week? Yeah I remember my first part-time job too.\u201d Or something like that. Anyway, it\u2019s hilarious.</p> <p>But the reality is we all got in this business because we were looking for some sort of freedom, right? That\u2019s it. And then the problem is we addicted to the process, because it is really fun, not going to lie. I get so many of my needs met through it, but we get addicted to the hustle and then that becomes the badge of honor, is the hustle. And you completely lose the freedom that were going after when you got started. When we were in Kenya last week, we were hanging out with Stu McLarin, and Stu made a video about hustle. He said initially he was going to dig at Gary V. but he didn\u2019t. Instead he just kind of talked about hustle, and how working your face off is not always the best route. It was awesome, and it kind of went viral for a little bit and he got a bunch of \u2026\u2026ya know, it was cool.</p> <p>So we talked a lot about that. There\u2019s a time to hustle, but it\u2019s between set hours of like 10 until 4 or whatever. This is my hustle time. Then when the hustle is done, you gotta turn it off and get into quality time mode because that is honestly way more important and it\u2019s the reason why we did this business. There\u2019s number one, so I am driving to the event, excited to hang out and hustle with these guys and share some cool things. But number two, I\u2019m honestly kind of bummed out because I just wish I could stay home today and just have a big pool party with the kids. So there you go, that\u2019s where I\u2019m \u2026..that\u2019s the entrepreneurial conundrum.</p> <p>And right now I\u2019m headed to the seminar room, my gas light is on, it\u2019s been on for 2 days. I have approximately 12 miles left before I run out of gas. I\u2019m not sure how many more miles it is to the event. But also, I have 10 minutes until the event starts, which means I do not have time to get gas but I might run out of gas before I get there. So there is the second entrepreneurial conundrum we have today. So what do you do? What would you do? Remember those math story problems in school? The train is moving 50 miles an hour you have 13 minutes til whatever. Do you have time to blah blah? You have to figure out the math equation. Anyway, I wish I was smart enough to figure out the math equation because it might be physically impossible for me to get to the event on time. Or, and maybe that my time gamble\u2026..I might have less than 12 miles to get to the event, therefore I will make it to the event and I\u2019ll be there in less than 10 minutes and I could be on time. Or it could be 15 miles to the event and I run out of gas and I\u2019m not going to be on time. Or I fill up with gas and I\u2019m not on time. Which choice do you take? I already know what choice I\u2019m taking. I\u2019m going for it. Worse case I break on the side of the road and call an Uber. So you guys will be part of that. We\u2019ll see what happens.</p> <p>Alright with that said, I want to talk about something else. Let\u2019s shift to something excited. One of the many amazing things that happened this week is this event\u2019s been awesome. IT\u2019s called Expert Secrets and it\u2019s me going over the outline of the new book. If you watch my Snapchats, about a month and half ago, I \u2026\u2026we were almost done with the book, so it\u2019s sad. I highlighted 200 pages of the book live on Snapchat and deleted them all and started over. People said, \u201cWhy in the world would you do that?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I had a really good book.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cMost people have really good book are excited about them.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know, my goal wasn\u2019t to write a really good book. My goal was to write an amazing book.\u201d So I started all over and spent the next 6 weeks going back through a lot of stuff, deep diving, dissecting every webinar we\u2019ve done that\u2019s been successful and trying to see the internal patterns and trying to figure out things. While we were in Kenya, a trip I probably immersed myself and smashed through, I don\u2019t know, probably\u2026..if I was to count the hours, 70 or 80 hours worth of courses and content specific to this concept that I\u2019m teaching in this book. I don\u2019t know about you, but there\u2019s something powerful and amazing about an immersion. And this is one of the reasons I\u2019m actually grateful for the huge layover, even though it kind of sucked. But it forced me to go through this immersion period. Whenever you immerse yourself in something, the coolest thing is that when you do that these weird connections start being made that aren\u2019t made by reading a chapter in a book a day, you know dabbling into something.</p> <p>When you immerse yourself and go crazy into it, all these connections start lighting up that you wouldn\u2019t normally see. And then hooking an event on the end of it, amplified that process. Because I was going through this thing, and I had a 10 hour flight from Amsterdam back to Minneapolis, and my wife passed out right before that flight started. I think it was a 9 or 10 hour flight. Anyway, I took some Ketones with caffeine in it, so I was awake. So for the whole 10 hours I was lit up on fire. And during that time I had my PowerPoint\u2019s out, I had my sketch book out, I had 2 books I was reading and then 3 different courses I went through and I slammed through in 8 to 10 hours all this stuff. And all these connections I had missed before\u2026\u2026oh and also going through about 12 or 13 different PowerPoint slides I presented in different webinars formats. I\u2019m pounding through all this information as fast a speed I could and all the sudden I started seeing all these patterns and connections and all these lines connected that I hadn\u2019t seen before. I was like, \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d For one example, in the Perfect Webinar there\u2019s 3 secrets, right? I\u2019ve always talked about that, and the 3 secrets are tied to 3 belief patterns. But what I realized on that flight all the sudden I saw a weird connection of those 3 secrets weren\u2019t random. I always thought they were random. Randomly picked 3 secrets, but they weren\u2019t. Every webinar that we had that was successful, there was the exact same pattern. Secret number one was very specific on one thing. Secret number two always had to do with something else. And secret number 3 always had to do with another thing. I had partially figured that out\u2026..Stu McLarin and I were in this little car in Kenya driving around. A five or six hour drive we were stuck on talking about stuff. And that popped up in conversation. I was like, \u201cStu I just realized something weird. \u2018this\u2019.\u201d And he was like, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty similar to how I do \u2018this\u2019.\u201d And I was like whoooom! With this connection. Now I can reverse engineer what I do better because I never even realized these 3 secrets were all tied to these very, very specific types of beliefs. Now that I know that, holy cow! It\u2019s so much easier to do that. So that was amazing.</p> <p>And then this thought came out of this immersion thing and so many other things. So it\u2019s like all these connections happened. And then at the event I\u2019m on stage teaching these things, for example there\u2019s this one part in the book that we talk about the big domino and the one thing and how to figure that out. And I explained that and I thought that was kind of common sense myself. But then we had this exercise where the group tried to do it and I can\u2019t believe how far\u2026\u2026everyone got stuck. And then the more I thought it through the more stuck I got. And we kept going through it and it ended up that 10 minute session, was supposed to be 10 minutes long, ended up going 2 \u00bd hours. By the time everything was done, we came out with this one sentence. It was like, If you can frame what you do in this one sentence, it becomes the one domino. If you can convince someone of that one thing, every other concern becomes obsolete or disappears. And it was like, when it was done, I had to take a break. My brain was fried. I just got this nugget, that when we come back now after the book, it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m telling all this stuff. Maybe wanting to get you excited. Help you realize you should always be at my events because if you\u2019re missing out on any of them you\u2019re insane. Maybe that\u2019s number one. Number two is to get you excited about the book because I am so excited for the book now. These insights, this went for me, what would have been a really good book to something that can and should and will be, I think, the best book ever written on planet earth. Why even write a book if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that, right? But now I honestly am excited to finish it. And then number three is just to talk about the power of immersion. There\u2019s something to that. To mass learning a whole bunch of stuff in a finite period of time where you start getting these weird connections that you cannot and will not get just by dabbling.</p> <p>So that\u2019s it, you guys. That is what I got. So I am at the event center. Good news, I did not run out of gas. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to get from here to a gas station, but that is an issue for another day, or maybe later on today. But I\u2019m going to go in there and we\u2019re going deep now and taking all these things and plugging them. Everything we worked on the last two days. The stories. The epiphany bridge story. The one thing\u2026\u2026the how to build a cult. In fact, figured it out. This is the crazy insight we had, we looked at how all mass movements have been built. So I was going through the book, The True Believer by Eric Hoffer, which is a book about how to start mass movements. And I\u2019m reading that book at the same time I\u2019m listening to Dan Kennedy\u2019s Influential Writing Workshop and Perry Belcher\u2019s Secret Sales System. And between those three things there was this weird thing where all three of them crossed over and I had this, I can\u2019t even explain how cool it was. All three of these things crossed over and in the middle there was this one nugget that was just like holy cow. All mass movements have this one thing that is tied to something that both Perry and Dan specifically pointed out, which is also the only way to create offers that convert. And it was just like angels from heaven started singing when I saw that crazy connection and so basically we built this super cool sketched out diagram showing three things that have to go into a mass movement. And the third one is\u2026..that one is essential for you to figure out your one thing, and if you don\u2019t have any way, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s like a puzzle where everything is coming together. I love it. Appreciate you guys for listening and hanging out. I am almost walking across a crosswalk now, so I gotta bounce. So I will see you guys all soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "13:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_251.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1470870656, "title": "Episode #250 \u2013 The Attention Trick I Learned In Amsterdam", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Follow these 9 steps to get more attention and cash!</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about his trip to Kenya and the nightmare of getting back home and being stuck in airports for 56 hours.

Hey guys and gals and all my friends out there. It\u2019s been a little while since we hung out and I apologize, but I\u2019ve been traveling like crazy and I\u2019m finally getting to a spot where I can report back and hang out. But if you watch my Snapchats then you\u2019ve been seeing all the craziness that\u2019s been happening.</p> <p>So last week, it\u2019s kind of a last minute, spur of the moment, we decided to go to Kenya with World Teachers Aid and it\u2019s usually a ten day trip but I have an event starting tomorrow, therefore I could not go for ten days. So we thought well, the trips broken down in two parts. The first part you go and see the kids in the villages and you help build the school and stuff and the second half is a safari. So we decided we won\u2019t go to the safari and we\u2019ll just focus on the first half. So that\u2019s what we did, which was really cool. So that was where we\u2019ve been. We weren\u2019t supposed to go. Dylan, one of the Clickfunnels co-founders was supposed to go, but he was working on the new editor and just ran out of time and didn\u2019t get his shots and stuff, so we headed in the last minute and kind of went there. So we\u2019ve been doing that.</p> <p>On the way there we decided, hey we have a couple days at the beginning that we have some free time, so we flew to Amsterdam for two days and hung out there, which was cool. I\u2019ve never been to Amsterdam before it was awesome. It\u2019s like super quiet. I was walking around the downtowns and there\u2019s no cars anywhere and mostly everyone is on bikes. I was telling Collette, \u201cListen. Do you know how quiet it is here?\u201d It\u2019s just crazy quiet and it was really neat. We loved it and had a great time. I did a boat tour through all the canals and saw the Anne Frank house and a bunch of other cool things, that was awesome.</p> <p>We went to Kenya and had a chance to hang out with these little kids and it was just like last time 4 years ago we went. It was a very emotional, powerful experience to see these kids and the transformations. One of the cool things is that the village that we spent all of our time at 4 years ago, we had a chance to go back there and see the progress and how things have evolved. There\u2019s this little girl that we\u2019ve been helping, her name is Jane. When we saw her 4 years ago, she\u2019s a little, I think she was 13 or 14 years old. We\u2019ve been sponsoring her and helping her get through high school and stuff, it\u2019s just amazing to see her progress. My wife and her really connected before, so my wife is bawling her eyes out seeing her. It was really a neat experience.</p> <p>Then after that we went to a new village, it was the most beautiful place. Cliffs that\u2026or this big huge\u2026it was up on a mountain looking over this huge valley and it was beautiful, but the kids didn\u2019t have a school yet, so they just were almost finished with the school and it was amazing. Such a cool experience. One thing that you may or may not know as a Clickfunnels member, every time you build a funnel that goes live a dollar goes toward World Teacher Aid and we\u2019re always working on that, trying to help support those guys and build more schools and support more children. It\u2019s just amazing to see the transformation from 4 years ago, til this week. Which was really cool.</p> <p>And then we jumped in a plane to head home, so we could hurry and get home. We were supposed to get home Monday because Aiden\u2019s birthday, my little 5 and now 6 year old, his birthday was on Monday. So we had everything booked and traveled so we could get home in time for his birthday. We were supposed to get in Boise at 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. So we were going to take him out to dinner and the next day take him to the water park. That was the plan, but unfortunately plans don\u2019t always go how they were supposed to.</p> <p>So we get into Kenya and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, the dude who is supposed to be flying this plane is late.\u201d So we were 4 hours late leaving from Kenya, which was horrible because our layover in Amsterdam was 2 hours. So we finally leave Kenya, we fly to Amsterdam. Get to Amsterdam and our plane is already gone, so they rebook us on one that\u2019s 7 hours later. So we\u2019re waiting forever and finally we get on that one and fly from Amsterdam to\u2026..where were we going to? Oh, Minneapolis. So we get to Minneapolis, and we basically missed Monday, which was kind of sad because we were gonna miss his birthday, but we\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ll still be there, but like at 2 in the morning. We\u2019ll take him to the water park on Tuesday, it\u2019ll be awesome.\u201d So we\u2019re sitting there and then the flight course in Minneapolis gets delayed 3 hours, then 5 hours and we\u2019re sitting there waiting and waiting and finally we\u2019re about to board and they say, \u201cOh, by the way all the pilots have been flying too long, therefore they cannot fly, therefore this flights been canceled. Oh by the way, there\u2019s no flights out tomorrow, so you gotta wait til Wednesday to leave.\u201d I was like, \u201cAre you freaking kidding me? I needed to get home to my kids birthday!\u201d And we were just missing our kids like crazy.</p> <p>It was kind of like Home Alone, I felt like. The mom had to race to get home to Kevin and every little thing possible, hiccup that could happen was happening. So anyway, I\u2019m sitting there; it\u2019s like 10:30, 11:00 at night and I message Melanie, my assistant, I\u2019m like, \u201cAll the flights tomorrow are apparently booked, we need to figure out how to get home and we need a hotel.\u201d The other thing they said was, \u201cAll flights are canceled plus there\u2019s no flights tomorrow and there\u2019s no hotels available.\u201d We\u2019re like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p> <p>So Melanie went on and was able to find a flight that didn\u2019t leave until the next day at 5, which got us home at 9:40 at night on Tuesday. So we missed our water park day, and then she booked us a hotel. So we jumped in an Uber, headed to the hotel, slept, hung out all day and I got a bunch of work done towards the event, which is starting tomorrow. Then we get in our plane finally. We leave Minneapolis, fly to Denver, and we\u2019re like, \u201cLast leg, we\u2019ll be home by 9:30.\u201d Get in our plane to head to Denver and guess what happened? Yes, you are right. Lightning storm. Therefore our flight was delayed again.</p> <p>Anyway, we ended up getting home at 10:30 at night, finally. And I think it was 56 total hours that we were in airports. So that was horrible. And we missed the little man\u2019s birthday. But today, this morning we went and celebrated his birthday and got some cool stuff. Now I\u2019m headed to the office because we have an event tomorrow and I got a lot of work to do before that.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening over. So anyway, there\u2019s the catch-up of where we\u2019ve been and now we can start moving forward again and keep hanging out. So the event tomorrow, I\u2019m excited. It\u2019s all of our Inner Circle members and our old Ignite Program. This is the last Ignite event ever, so we\u2019ve got a bunch of those guys coming as well. I think we\u2019ve got about 100 people coming, or so. And it went from kind of a concept to after spending 56 hours in the airport and geeking out and going through as much marketing stuff as I could consume during that time, it\u2019s gonna be an amazing event. I\u2019m crazy excited. I hand sketched out, I think another 40 new sketches, similar to the Dotcom Secrets book, all with new concepts and I\u2019m hoping and praying that Vlad, my designer can get them all looking good today so we can get handouts printed for tomorrow. Oh it\u2019s all running together. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll make it all. Anyway, worst case scenario I\u2019ll just re-sketch them live on a whiteboard for everybody.</p> <p>The event is going to be awesome and it\u2019s actually focusing on the new book, Expert Secrets. I\u2019m excited for Expert Secrets, we spent about 6 months writing it and when I was in Bear Lake last month, I basically deleted the whole book and started over from scratch and the new direction that this is going, I\u2019m really, really proud of. It\u2019s what this whole event is based on. I\u2019m kind of teaching it out loud so I can make sure all the pieces make logical sense in my mind before we turn it into a book, which is similar to what I did with the Dotcom Secrets book. We re-wrote it 3 times and then I did a live event for 3 days and then that helped me organize the thoughts in a better way. And I\u2019m teaching onstage and I\u2019m like, \u201cThat was good, but that one didn\u2019t make sense and I need to tweak this.\u201d Anyway, it was really cool.</p> <p>So I kind of did the same process with this one. So if you want to write a book, that\u2019s the secret, throw an event. It forces you to get everything done in time and then it lets you teach it out loud. I don\u2019t know about you but when I teach out loud, I just get different ideas and thoughts and I figure out what makes sense, what\u2019s slow and boring, what\u2019s exciting and what pieces people get and what pieces they don\u2019t. Anyway, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Hopefully this book will be done before the end of the year, because I\u2019m really excited for it, it\u2019s going to be amazing.</p> <p>With that said, I gotta draw some value for you guys before I get to the office. So when we were in Amsterdam, the second day my wife were walking around downtown and all the sudden we get to this, I think it was a parliament or something, some big huge building. And we\u2019re like, \u201cWow, that building is amazing.\u201d And all the sudden we hear, \u201cAhem, ahem, ahem.\u201d Like this coughing and we look over and there\u2019s this guy with a nice shirt on and a microphone and he\u2019s coughing. He keeps coughing louder and louder and keeps doing it and all these people start coming close and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d and he had a unicycle on the ground, a bunch of boxes, a bunch of things. He had this flame that was there, so we kind of get closer to him. And he keeps coughing, probably for 5 minutes and we\u2019re like, \u201cThis is weird.\u201d And we\u2019re about to leave and all the sudden he stops and says, \u201cEveryone, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m just trying to get all of your attention.\u201d And then he said something that I thought was really cool. He said\u2026.how did he say it? He said something like, what did he say? \u201cA show without attention is just an accident.\u201d I might have screwed that up, but it was basically that. I thought, that\u2019s kind of powerful. How many times do we do something, but no one\u2019s paying attention, therefore it\u2019s just an accident? Didn\u2019t even happen, right? So in our business are we getting attention first? You get attention first; you get people to pay attention. So that\u2019s the first thing.</p> <p>As I\u2019m watching him as he does that, get\u2019s attention and then he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to start the show.\u201d And he goes and draws this big, huge chalk square around him, a pretty big square. So all these people are out further from the square so he\u2019s like, \u201cOkay everyone, come up to the square, this is the edge. Come in.\u201d and he gets everyone to come closer. So he\u2019s getting everyone to move towards him. So first he gets attention, second he gets everyone to move their physical bodies towards him so they are closer. And everyone gets kind of close. Then we started watching and I was watching what he was doing and the show ended up being 45 minutes long. And when all was said and done, if you look at it, all the show was, was he juggled fire for 30 seconds. That was it, but it was 45 minutes of buildup and excitement and building rapport.</p> <p>So he did all sorts of things to build rapport. First he got everyone to pull in close, and he started\u2026\u2026and at first you could tell the crowd was cold, \u201cWhat\u2019s this guy doing? What\u2019s happening?\u201d and he could of just got on his unicycle and started juggling fire and it could have been over in like a minute, but if he did that he would have missed\u2026.the whole presentation is what made this thing work. He gets everyone together and starts talking and telling jokes and starts making fun of people in the audience to get them to laugh. He starts getting everybody talking about fire and to breathe together. Breathing is one of the fastest ways to build rapport. So if you can match breathing patterns. So he\u2019s getting everyone to breathe and pretending like they\u2019re blowing fire. Get everyone to breathe the same thing which instantly builds rapport for everybody. So he\u2019s getting everybody to build rapport to just all sorts of the really smart things to build rapport with this audience. From making fun of people to making fun of himself and getting people laughing and all these things to get rapport within this group.</p> <p>So then he starts, he\u2019s telling jokes and everything and then he\u2019s trying to train the audience on what he needs them to do. So he gets on the unicycle and he\u2019s got basically juggling things. He gets people throwing things to him. He\u2019s training the audience on what he wants them to do and how he wants them to react. He\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, when you throw this\u2026\u201d He had Collette, actually take one of these juggling batons and had her throw it to him. \u201cOkay now, when she throws it to me, everyone cheer like crazy.\u201d So he\u2019s training the audience on how he wants them to respond. Probably for another good 10 or 15 minutes. He\u2019s doing this whole thing, training his audience how he wants and needs them to respond.</p> <p>He does this whole thing and sets up this fire thing, builds up the anticipation. Now we\u2019re probably 30-35 minutes into it. And he says, \u201cThis is what\u2019s going to happen, you guys.\u201d And then he explains, \u201cIn a minute I\u2019m going to get on my unicycle and we\u2019re going to light fire and we\u2019re going to juggle this fire.\u201d So it\u2019s like, okay this is what we\u2019ve been building up towards and we\u2019re so excited. And then before he does he says, \u201cLook, now what\u2019s going to happen..\u201d and this is where he asks for money, and first thing he does is price justification, \u201cLook, I\u2019m a street performer and this is how I make my living. If you were to go to the bar right now and you were to buy a beer or whatever, it\u2019s going to be about 5 pounds and that\u2019s going to take maybe a minute to drink, or a minute and a half if you take your time. I\u2019ve been performing for almost 45 minutes so far, and I would assume this is worth at least the same as just a quick beer in actual entertainment value. So the minimum donation accepted is 5 pounds. The maximum is 100.\u201d</p> <p>So he starts going through and he does his price justification and he keeps explaining to the audience how to buy, which was so good. I wish I could have recorded this whole thing. So he teaches them how to buy, how to buy, how to buy. \u201cWhen this is done,\u201d he\u2019s coaching them through, \u201cWhen this is done, I\u2019m going to juggle my things, fires going to go. I\u2019m juggling fire, everyone\u2019s going to go crazy. I\u2019m going to put my hat out and everyone\u2019s going to come rush to me and give me a minimum of 5 pounds up to 35\u201d or whatever it is. So he explains and coaches and shows them how to pay him. He\u2019s coaching them this whole time and what he wants and now he\u2019s coaching them on how to pay him at the end, which is just brilliant.</p> <p>Then he finally does the thing. Gets on the unicycle, juggles fire. The whole show\u2019s maybe a minute long. Boom, gets down, everyone cheers and then people start flooding him in droves to bring him money. And everyone\u2019s throwing 5 dollars in it and again he coaches. Then some people that start walking away. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you going to be a freebie seeker?\u201d starts calling out people who just basically came and witnessed it and ran away. So he calls these people out, so they feel kind of dumb. Everyone else goes, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be called out. I can\u2019t leave this because this guy just performed for me the last 45 minutes.\u201d And they felt this obligation to pay. And initially I probably would have given him maybe 1 pound or whatever that is. I think its pounds there. Anyway, because I felt obligated at 5, I was like, \u201cokay I gotta give 5.\u201d So we came to give 5, we give 5. And I looked at this process, when all is said and done he probably made, a couple thousand pounds. It was impressive.</p> <p>And then everyone displaced and he started packing up his stuff and took off. And it was just cool. There were so many cool marketing lessons. One was getting attention. Number two was building a rapport. Number three was training your audience on what you want and need them to do. Number five was price justification. Number 6 was the actual show. Number 7 was the call to action. Get people to come back and pay. Number 8 would probably be calling out those who didn\u2019t take action. And then number 9 was wrapping up the show.</p> <p>Anyway, so many cool marketing lessons in one. I\u2019m totally geeking out watching this guy. My wife\u2019s like, \u201cThis guy is annoying.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHe\u2019s kept everyone\u2019s attention here for 45 minutes to do a 30 second to 1 minute long show and at the end he made a ton of money.\u201d Like I said, he could have just got up there and juggled fire and would have made 50 bucks. But instead he went through the whole thing and made 5 or 6 hundred dollars. Pretty impressive.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that gives you guys some value, some things you can think about with what you\u2019re doing. One of the biggest questions people have is, \u201cI can\u2019t get people to show up to my webinar.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you doing? This guy spent 45 minutes for a minute long trick. What are you doing to get people excited and fired up? What kind of video, what kind of\u2026.the more you\u2019ve got to be exciting. You\u2019ve got to create attention. You\u2019ve got to create desire to get people to do what you want them to do. That\u2019s how you get people to show up on webinars is doing all those kind of things.\u201d With that said, I\u2019m at the office. Get some work done real quick. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day.</p>", "duration": "15:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_250.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1470090621, "title": "Episode #249 \u2013 The Law Of Deterioration In Business", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to know when to stop.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell explains why you need to be able to consistently and profitably generate customers, or you are in the wrong business.</p> <p>Here are a few interesting things you\u2019ll hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>How to recognize if your business is a sinking ship you need to bail on.</li> <li>What else you need to know besides being able to consistently and profitably generate customers in order for your business to be successful.</li> <li>And why every business needs consistent work in order to avoid deterioration.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how you can tell if your business will grow or deteriorate.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, hey this is Russell Brunson, it is Saturday? I don\u2019t even know. I\u2019ve been camping and now we\u2019re flying to Kenya and we\u2019re all over the place. And I\u2019m driving my car and was just Voxing some people in the Inner Circle, catching up on stuff before I headed out. And I had a conversation with somebody that was probably not what they were hoping for, but it was I think what they need. I just wanted to share it here because I\u2019m positive that they\u2019re not the only person in need of this advice. Because it\u2019s hard advice, so I just wanted to share it with you guys. A lot of you won\u2019t be applicable, but some of you, it will be very, very applicable. So here we go.\u00a0 By the way, this is Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>So like I said, in the preview or the intro or whatever we call this thing nowadays. I\u2019ve got some probably backwards advice that\u2019s backwards from what you\u2019re hoping. I\u2019m walking in the office right now and the alarm is about to go off, unless someone forgot to set the alarm. Check it out, somebody\u2019s about to be fired, the alarm was not set. We\u2019re good to go, there\u2019s no beeping.</p> <p>So the person\u2019s advice, they\u2019ve been going through my stuff and they have been almost a year in the program and just not having the success that they wanted or desired. In fact, having almost no success and there\u2019s a couple of reasons. I\u2019ll kind of leave it, I won\u2019t give you an opinion on all the reasons but I do want to talk about what my feedback was.</p> <p>The first thing was that if the business you are in cannot consistently and profitably, and those are the key words, consistently and profitably generate customers, it\u2019s not a good business to be in. And I don\u2019t care how many times they say, \u201cI\u2019ve made money in the past. I\u2019ve got a bunch of clients who love me.\u201d Or whatever. If you can\u2019t consistently and profitably generate new clients, the business is not a good business and if you\u2019re not careful you\u2019re going to get caught where this person got caught. Where they have a business now that doesn\u2019t, that they can\u2019t profit from. They\u2019ve got customers and clients paying them some stuff, but it\u2019s just kind of stagnant. There\u2019s always this, I don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s called, there\u2019s the law. It\u2019s one of Einstein\u2019s law of deterioration, where everything deteriorates. Like Clickfunnels, we\u2019re pushing and pushing and it\u2019s growing and growing, but if I stopped it would start deteriorating. It\u2019s just the law of how the universe works. You get an apple and you set it out in the sun, what happens? It doesn\u2019t bloom up and become bigger, it deteriorates and starts going down into this mush thing.</p> <p>Businesses are the same way, everything deteriorates. So if you have a business that\u2019s there and you\u2019ve got some customers, it\u2019s going to start deteriorating and getting smaller no matter what you do unless you can consistently and profitably bring customers in. So my first question for you is are you in a business\u00a0 where you can consistently and profitably generate customers? If not, you\u2019re in a bad business. That\u2019s number one. Number two is you\u2019ve got to learn how to sell people stuff.\u00a0 That is the most important thing, I don\u2019t care what business you are in. The only thing that really matters is selling stuff. That\u2019s it. And it\u2019s interesting how people will try everything else to avoid selling. They\u2019ll try focusing on Facebook ads, and this and that and all sorts of stuff you don\u2019t have to actually sell, selling is the only thing that matters.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve read the book, Ready Fire Aim, and if you haven\u2019t, seriously I recommend this probably 100 times in this podcast, it\u2019s amazing. The book by Michael Masterson is all about to take a business and go from 0 to a million, a million to 10, 10 to 50 and 50 and above. And the skills challenge is opportunities that happens at each level. But the first part, if you only read the first section of the book going from 1 to a million dollars, that\u2019s the most valuable part of the whole book for most of the people listening onto this. And the whole thing talks about the entire goal going from 0 to a million dollars in sales, the only thing you are trying to do is figure out how to profitably sell the thing you\u2019re selling. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the most important thing you can be focusing on your business. It\u2019s not how to scale, the customer support, or all these things we get involved with. Or getting my office and my business cards and I need a sweet website, and all this crap that us as entrepreneurs think is important, because it\u2019s not. The only thing that matters is how can I profitably sell my product? What do my customers actually want? That\u2019s the whole section of that book is about is how to do that. Because as soon as you figure that out, that\u2019s the role of the entrepreneur, that\u2019s not something you can ask for or hire away, or set up a team around. All that crap. That is your role as the entrepreneur, you have to figure out, you have to cut your teeth and go out and sell something. Because until you sell something nothing happens. That\u2019s your job, to go out there and sell and figure out how in the world, first off, how do I pitch this thing that I created to get people to get excited enough to give me money for. That\u2019s what you gotta figure out, that\u2019s the most important thing that you\u2019re doing here in that business, when you\u2019re going from 0 to a million dollars.</p> <p>And after you mastered that and figured out, okay, boom. Like for Clickfunnels, we figured out the way to sell Clickfunnels is through webinars with this pitch. Boom. So we figured it out, we went from 0 to a million and then beyond almost overnight. And now as soon as you get from a million to ten, all these headaches start coming in. This happened to Clickfunnels, when we went from 0 to a million. As soon as the webinar pitched worked, like two weeks we were at a million bucks. It blew up fast. And then all of the sudden all the new nightmares came. That\u2019s when you go, management and people and support and all this other crap that happens, but that\u2019s phase two. After you figure out the selling system that will profitably sell your thing for forever. So we figured that out and boom all the sudden new strengths, problems and opportunities came out from your ten million. Now you passed that you\u2019re going from 10 to 50, now you\u2019re looking at the next phase of that thing. And that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re\u2026..we\u2019re kind of treading water right now in our company.</p> <p>But for most of you guys, that\u2019s the key. So for this person who is struggling, that\u2019s what they\u2019re stuck at. They\u2019re stuck at that 0 to a million and they haven\u2019t\u2019 figure out how to sell the product yet. So the next two things. First off, we talked about first. You\u2019ve got to be in a business where you can consistently and profitably generate customers. Number two you\u2019ve got to figure out how in the world to sell your thing. That means, maybe try a webinar. Maybe that doesn\u2019t work. Maybe try a membership site, maybe that doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019ve got to try 5, 6, 10, 15 things. Whatever it takes. Because one of them will work you just have to figure out which one it is. As soon as you figure out, boom this is the method of how I will sell to the people of this world is through a webinar, or is through phone sells, or is through Facebook ads, whatever that is. As soon as you figure out how to profitably sell that thing, boom now you\u2019ve got the key and now you start scaling your business.</p> <p>So those are the two things guys. Step one, profitably and consistently generate customers. Step two you\u2019ve got to figure out the selling system to sell your product to those people, also profitably, by the way. And that\u2019s it. Now, for this person the advice I gave, I promise was not the advice they wanted to hear, and I\u2019m probably going to hear back from them later today or tomorrow telling me that I\u2019m wrong or they\u2019re upset or whatever and I understand that because what I told them. I said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t figure out how to profitably and consistently generate customers, you are not a business. So one thing you can do is keep trying and trying and spend another two or three years in this thing, or you got to shut down shop. You need to stop. You need to, what does Mr. Wonderful say in Shark tank? You hate money\u2026.I can\u2019t remember what he says, this is where money goes to die. You\u2019ve got to stop. There\u2019s got to be\u2026.we\u2019re taught our hold life, don\u2019t become quitters, but there\u2019s a point in your life and things in your life, you have to quit.\u201d All the signs are telling you this is not working and so you need to stop and say, look this doesn\u2019t work.\u201d And shut down shop.</p> <p>That might mean shutting down your business, it might mean declaring bankruptcy, it might mean, I don\u2019t know what that means for you and its\u2019 going to be scary and fear associated with it, and a whole bunch of bad things you don\u2019t want to do, but it\u2019ll be worth it. Okay, I\u2019ve had what, three or four times in my business life where I have had to shut things down and start over. And every single time I\u2019ve had to go through so much pain, and it\u2019s so intense, I even think about it, I can feel it inside of my chest and my hands are sweating just thinking about the pain I had to go through during those times when my business didn\u2019t keep working. It was deteriorating and I was freaking out. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to profitably generate new customers and I had to stop. Sometimes I stopped early, which I was grateful for, because it causes a lot less pain, it causes a little of sharp pain, but it went away fast. Other times I freaking hung on to the ship while it was sinking, to the point where I almost got drug under two or three times. You\u2019d think I\u2019d learn by now.</p> <p>So my job is to come in and kind of help warn you guys. Say, \u201cLook, bad things could be happening if these things aren\u2019t happening in your business. If you have not figured out a way to profitably sell your product yet, you better try a whole bunch of ways quick because you have to figure out what is and you\u2019re not able to consistently and profitably generate customers, another big warning flag.\u201d So those things are all figure out-able, is that the right word? You can figure those things out, but you\u2019ve got to try. And if you\u2019re in a business and you\u2019re like, \u201cI can\u2019t generate a customer for under $30, $40. Then it\u2019s the wrong business to be in. It\u2019s time to start over. It\u2019s time to figure out\u2026the nice thing about entrepreneurs is we can create and do whatever we want. If your business isn\u2019t profitable right now, guess what? It doesn\u2019t hurt to start and start something new that could be profitable in like a week from now. The hardest thing is our willingness to do that.</p> <p>I had a friend, I feel bad for this guy. I\u2019d gotten in the business and this is again, over a decade ago. And I met him in a time, he\u2019d been in the business for 2 years, he\u2019d written this e-book and he was super proud of it. And when I first met him I was like, \u201cMan, this book is good. Does it work? Are you selling it?\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo.\u201d and I was like, \u201cWhy not?\u201d and he was like, \u201cI can\u2019t figure it out. I\u2019m trying all sorts of things.\u201d And he kept trying and trying. And then year one went to year two and three and four. I was about 5 years into my business and I remember having this conversation with him again and he was still trying to sell this book. I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, in the time that you\u2019ve been trying to sell this book, I\u2019ve sold probably 30 or 40 different products. Some of them worked, some of them bombed. Some of them were somewhere in between, but I\u2019m moving forward on things. Dude, you\u2019ve got to stop. No one wants this book. I know that you love it and you put in so much time. Everyone that\u2019s read it told you it was good, but people don\u2019t want it man. You\u2019ve got to stop and change or you\u2019re never going to progress.\u201d And I still remember what he told me. He said, \u201cRussell, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve spent so much time and energy on this product, I can\u2019t walk away from it now.\u201d That was the last conversation I had with him. It\u2019s probably been 7 or 8 years now and I don\u2019t know\u2026..I know he\u2019s not in the business, or I would know.</p> <p>So anyway, that\u2019s what I wanted to kind of give you feedback. I know it\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s not nice, but some of you guys need to hear. And if you have figured that out, you do have a business that is profitably generating customers consistently, you\u2019ve figured out your selling system, now it\u2019s time to start scaling it. As soon as you figure those pieces out, you should be able to grow fast. Like Clickfunnels, as soon as we figured it out, boom this is the webinar, this is the pitch, we went to a million dollars quick and then to ten quick. As soon as you figure those pieces out it should be scaleable. It should be really quick and fast and easy. Well, easy from the sales standpoint. Then all the sudden it transitions to the new headaches that show up when you pass a million dollars in sales, but that\u2019s what that book\u2019s for. So go read Ready Fire, Aim, and read chapter two when you\u2019re there. But don\u2019t read ahead. You don\u2019t need that. Just figure out, just focus on going from 0 to a million, that should be where most of our minds are at right now. When you cross that barrier, reopen the book, read chapter two and figure out the next step.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I got for you guys today. I\u2019m at the office, I gotta do some work.

Alright everybody, I hope you are having a sweet day. I just got up and I\u2019m heading to go film with Mike Dillard. How cool is that? So Mike is launching a new membership site in the marketing world and he wanted somebody to come teach on funnels. So guess who he asked? Anyway, I\u2019m excited. Mike\u2019s a good friend and it\u2019s going to be kind of cool, to have him out here and film. So I\u2019m racing over there now, I\u2019m a little late, not going to lie. I\u2019m right on the line, I could be there on time, or I could be there\u2026.definitely not early, but I could be on time. So that is the plan.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s been a little while since I talked to you guys. It\u2019s been crazy over here and I\u2019m having so much fun. I just wanted to reconnect with all of you guys and say hi, first off. More importantly what I wanted to do was\u2026.it\u2019s been interesting, for a lot of you guys, hopefully you know. You\u2019ve been watching the new Snapchat stuff I\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s been fun, I\u2019ve been documenting everything we\u2019re doing on Snapchat, which is interesting. I always look at Marketing In Your car as me documenting things, but it was like every 2 or 3 days I\u2019d get on and share stuff, but it\u2019s more like, \u201cHey in the last little bit, here\u2019s some things I\u2019m noticing.\u201d So it\u2019s like taking multiple days and like, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the number one lesson from that chunk of time.\u201d Whereas Snapchat is more like I\u2019m documenting every cool thing that\u2019s happening. I\u2019m talking about it either before or after so that day by day people can see what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s been fun.</p> <p>Two days ago, we were filming this crazy shoot. So we\u2019re up at 3 something in the morning. We went to downtown Boise and we rented this, there\u2019s this place called Free Galley, it\u2019s this big graffiti wall. It\u2019s this graffiti place in downtown Boise. So we rented this big section of the wall and we came in 3 in the morning and painted over it, and then Rob came and painted this amazing mural. Clickfunnels and funnels and all sorts of stuff. So we did that all morning long and then at night we came back at 11 or 12 in the night and filmed this whole thing for\u2026\u2026anyway, so we\u2019re making this new offer. The offer is called Funnel Graffiti and it\u2019s free plus shipping offer. And I could be like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s Funnel Graffiti, it\u2019s free plus shipping.\u201d But I\u2019m trying to again, this whole business it doesn\u2019t matter what market you\u2019re in, it\u2019s all about pattern interrupts, right? So for my job and your job honestly, is less about how we sell things, but more about how we\u2019re interrupting people\u2019s patterns.</p> <p>In fact, Vince Palko, if you guys know Vince, he owns Adtunes.com. He\u2019s the dude that invented the hand sketched out video. And he told me one time that he told this guy, \u201cWe\u2019re not in the hand sketched doodle business, we\u2019re in the pattern interrupt business. We\u2019re always pushing the envelope to figure out new ways to interrupt people\u2019s patterns to get their attention.\u201d And I think that\u2019s so true in all of our businesses. That\u2019s it. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m always bugging people, \u201cI need a template to get more, to sell my product.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201dOkay, I can gi9ve you a structure, but it still comes down to you being creative and figuring out ways to grab people\u2019s attention.\u201d Attention is the scarcest resource nowadays. We\u2019ve got to crazy to grab people\u2019s attention. I\u2019m doing a free plus shipping offer and we spent two days to create the thing, probably spent too much money to create this amazing thing so that we could get people to buy something that\u2019s free from us. Why would you do that Russell? Because it\u2019s all about attention and then building a brand and building a cult following and getting people excited and engaged in what you\u2019re doing, right?</p> <p>So you\u2019ll see it when it comes out. It\u2019s a big production we did to give away a free thing. But I\u2019m trying to break people\u2019s patterns and create something new and exciting and cool and make it fun for people to buy. A lot of people, I can\u2019t tell you how many times people message me, \u201cHey I\u2019m only getting 10% show up rate on my webinar, what do I need to do?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, you just need to be more interesting. If only 10% of people are showing up, it means they don\u2019t care what you\u2019re talking about. How can you infuse excitement and energy and passion and all these things to get people to want to actually schedule your webinar and make sure they show up?\u201d I can give you little tactics and techniques and tricks to increase show up rate, but when all is said and done it comes down to you and you being exciting enough that they\u2019re going to be inspired enough to not just register and hope the replay comes through and hopefully they\u2019ll catch it, but to, I can\u2019t freaking miss this, this is a big, big deal. And it comes down to you being passionate and sharing. I can\u2019t stress that enough.</p> <p>So it\u2019s been fun on this Snapchat journey. It\u2019s funny, every day at the end of the day, I take, usually it\u2019s about 3 to 5 minutes worth of Snapchats and we render them out as a video and post them on Youtube, so if you missed any of them you can go to our Youtube channel and see them. I think it\u2019s just youtube.com/funnelhackertv and then click on the playlist button and you can see all the behind the scenes Snapchat stuff. But it\u2019s behind the scenes of all the stuff we\u2019re doing. But the biggest thing I keep getting from all the people watching these is just like, \u201cHoly crap, Russell. You do a lot of things throughout the day.\u201d And I\u2019m always like, \u201cI guess I do. But I\u2019m working the same amount of hours as you guys. We all are given from God the same amount of hours in every day. There\u2019s 24 of them. And I tried to use them really efficiently, but I\u2019m still sleeping for 8 of them, I\u2019m hanging out with my wife and kids for 8 of them. So I got 8 hours to try to go and take over the world. The same hours we all have. We\u2019re all competing with the same time resources.\u201d And people are like, \u201cI don\u2019t have time.\u201d Seriously? It\u2019s been fun showing behind the scenes because people are like, \u201cHoly crap. In one day you guys\u2026\u201d we had one day the other day when during that day I think we launched two funnels in two different businesses. We got a sample product in for our supplement. We did a coaching call. We did, I did 30 minutes of Voxer with our 25K group. All these things jammed into the same 8 hour day, but I\u2019m just spending all 8 hours working. I\u2019m not\u2026.I don\u2019t know what people do all day long. I\u2019m not goofing off. I\u2019m getting stuff done every minute of those days and that\u2019s the only big difference.</p> <p>So I like the Snapchat stuff because it\u2019s showing people boom, boom, here\u2019s how I\u2019m jamming everything in and what we\u2019re doing and how I\u2019m shifting focus and where we\u2019re focusing energy. So anyway, I hope that if you\u2019re not following me on Snapchat that you do just so you can start seeing behind the scenes and you\u2019ll get a lot of the Marketing In Your Car\u2026... Marketing In Your Car is nice because I can go deeper on a topic. I\u2019ve got 10 seconds on Snapchat. But on Snapchat you are able to see behind the scenes on what worked and pressing into a day. And I think, if nothing else, I think that\u2019s a value for everyone to see. Just because I honestly think, and I don\u2019t want to be harsh or mean or whatever, but when I\u2019m working close with people and they\u2019re not having success, the biggest thing is they\u2019re not getting much out of their days. We\u2019ve had some people who have been working on the Perfect Webinar for 8, 9, 10 months and haven\u2019t launched yet. Are you kidding me? What are you doing all day? I gave you the script, I gave you the PowerPoint. You have it all, all you have to do is fill in your stories, it\u2019s really\u2026\u2026it really should not be that\u2026..I think that you\u2019re dinking around all day. I don\u2019t know what it is. We just need to get more out of the day. You need to wake up and grab today by the head and just\u2026.For us, I think we\u2019re freaking throwing it around because we own it. It\u2019s not the other way around. I don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s when we start shifting our mindset and our thoughts from \u201cOh I should do this today.\u201d No, I freaking must do this today. I don\u2019t get to go home and sleep or watch TV or go to lunch unless this crap is done. It\u2019s shifting our mindset to that and then just getting it done.</p> <p>And I understand that there\u2019s things that come up, but I promise you guys, there\u2019s not many people in the world that have more distractions than me. I\u2019ve got a beautiful wife, I\u2019ve got 5 kids, I\u2019ve got a company with 40 or 50 employees, all of whom are not just boring employees. Everyone on our team is highly passionate and with passion and excitement comes like needs. And I am very needy. All of us are. I feel like the higher level you get the more you need reinforcement of your skills. I\u2019ve got people on our teams that take time. I\u2019ve got multiple business, we\u2019ve got funnels creating, there\u2019s a lot happening. It\u2019s just\u2026\u2026So I understand people who are like, \u201cI don\u2019t have time. There\u2019s too many things pulling\u2026.\u201d I understand that more than most people understand. The difference is just\u2026..I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>So my biggest message for today is first off, go either follow me on Snapchat, or if Snapchat\u2019s too teenaged, high school embarrassing for you, which I understand, then go to Youtube and watch the replay of some of them. Just watch the day what we\u2019re compressing into a day and I think most people will see, we honestly, there\u2019s more stuff happening in a day in my world, than most people get done in a week or a year, or excuse me, a week or a month sometimes. So it\u2019s learning, how do I compress time? How do I speed things up? How do I become more efficient so I can get more done during the day? Because I\u2019m not a rocket scientist you guys. I am not a smart person. I sucked at school. I barely graduated, it was hard. Going through college and school, those things are way harder than \u201cHey, let\u2019s set a structure for our day. Hey let\u2019s set some really big goals. Let\u2019s not just goof off on Facebook all day. Let\u2019s freaking do things and think through them.\u201d If you\u2019re not like, why do we need to do this? And if it makes sense then run with it. If it doesn\u2019t then delete it, ignore it. Pull it out of your strategy. And only do things that are serving and growing your core strategy, your core focus. I think if you shift your focus to that, man, you\u2019ll be amazed what you can get done during an average day.</p> <p>So anyway, I don\u2019t mean to say that to try to put myself on pedestal at all. I am hoping to use this as a tool to motivate you guys and show you what is actually possible. Because again, you\u2019ve got the same 8 hours I do, I\u2019m not working\u2026..well some days I am, like one day we worked crazy hours. But for the most part, I\u2019m working 9 to 5. I\u2019m working the same hours that everybody else is working. I\u2019m just squeezing a little more juice out of the day. And I hope watching the day by day Snapchat will show you how to squeeze more juice out of it as well. And that\u2019s it you guys. I am almost to our filming location to go hang out with Dillard. Hopefully we\u2019ll create some magic. If you want to see what we\u2019re doing behind the scenes go check out Snapchat. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at and we are making some magic. All right guys, appreciate you all and I\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "11:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_248.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1468878305, "title": "Episode #247 \u2013 It\u2019s Time To Create", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Carpe Diem\u2026 seize the day!</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about driving home from a family vacation and thinking about how the window of life is a short one and how we need to seize the day by creating.

Alright, alright, I know what you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cRussell have you forgot about us over here in Marketing In Your Car Land?\u201d and the answer is no. I\u2019ve been going crazy on Snapchat, as some of you guys know. If you haven\u2019t started playing in Snapchat, come hang out with us. If you go to Snapfunnels.com there\u2019s some free coaching showing you how it works and how you can add me on Snapchat, but we\u2019re having tons of fun. I\u2019ve been documenting behind the scenes of all the crazy crap of what we\u2019re doing every single day. So if you haven\u2019t been watching, you should come over there too.</p> <p>But the one thing that I don\u2019t like about Snapchat, is I got 10 seconds at a time, and I feel like if I spend more than 2 or 3-10 seconds in a row talking about a concept it gets really boring. So if I ever want to go deep, this is where I come to go deep with you guys. Because I know you can handle it, I know you appreciate it, so that\u2019s the game plan.</p> <p>We just got back from a week long family vacation and the week prior to that we had 50+ staying at my house for another family reunion, so it\u2019s been two weeks of family and not a lot of chance to work. So I\u2019m heading into the office right now and I\u2019m really, really excited. But I wanted to talk to you guys about was a thought I had as I was driving home from Bear Lake, which is on the Utah/Idaho border, back here to Boise. So it\u2019s probably, I don\u2019t know, if you\u2019re driving by yourself maybe 5 hours, if you got kids that got to go to the bathroom every 15 minutes it\u2019s 8 hours. I don\u2019t know. Somewhere between 5 and 8 hours to get home. And our kids actually did really, really good this time. But as we were driving, you have a lot of time with your thoughts. My wife and I talk for the majority of the time, but after 8 hours or whatever, sometimes you run out of conversation. So I was just sitting there thinking and what I starting thinking about was kind of cool. I was thinking about how many people have ever lived on this earth. And it\u2019s a lot, right. I\u2019ve read different people with different opinions. I think right now if you look at how many people are on the earth, I think it\u2019s close to 7 billion. So that\u2019s a lot of people, right.</p> <p>But if you think about all the people who have lived since the beginning of time. Since Adam and Eve first set\u00a0 foot upon this planet. I think the number estimates I read were in the 80 or 90 billion people. That\u2019s a lot of people. 80 or 90 billion people have graced this planet, since the beginning of time, and everyone kind of had a shot. We all come on this earth and it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s almost like, I\u2019ve been thinking about it recently, it\u2019s almost like, not a mousetrap, but something like that. We enter this game, we enter this thing and I believe, maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I believe that we have a Heavenly Father who loves us, who brought us here and placed us here on this earth, and I think that everybody was given different challenges. Now by different I don\u2019t mean bigger or smaller, in fact I believe that when this whole earth life is over we have a chance to look back, I think that we will all be shocked at how similar our trials were in severity. I just think that, again I believe there\u2019s a grand architect to this world, to this life. So I believe that nobody\u2026.from the outside it will look like this person was born with a silver spoon in their mouth, or this person lives in Kenya and has a horrible life, everyone\u2019s got different things. But I think that we all entered the game and each of us are given different trials and things and I think that we\u2019ll be shocked when all is said and done at how similar everybody\u2019s trials were in severity.</p> <p>And again, sometimes you may think, oh this guy\u2019s rich, so he doesn\u2019t have any issues. But I guarantee that person who has a lot of money is dealing with all sorts of other issues and people that have no money are perfectly fine with other things. I think that it\u2019s going to be shockingly similar if and when we have a chance to all look back on it. So there\u2019s kind of my belief pattern. So through that lens I was looking at this, 90 billion people come to this earth and when we come here we each get different tools. We\u2019re all born the same. We all come out of the womb and we\u2019re butt naked, we\u2019re crying and we\u2019re all identical, but obviously we\u2019re in different situations. Different parents, different situations, different lifestyles, different religions, different parts of the world. So everything is different, but we all come into this world and we\u2019re given initially, a set of tools. And then we have this little window of time to see what we\u2019re going to do with and the windows not very big, it\u2019s really small. Think about the 90 billion people. All of them who are now dead came to this earth like, \u201cOh the world\u2019s in front of me.\u201d And then they\u2019re dead, they\u2019re gone. They don\u2019t even exist anymore. The only people that exist are the 7 billion or so that are still here today.</p> <p>And every day there are probably hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that disappear, their window ended. My window might end today, it could literally end in the middle of this podcast, for all we know, we don\u2019t know. We had a guy on our team just a week or so ago, who was driving home, a young guy and had an aneurism while he was driving and wrecked the car and died. Boom, gone. The window was closed. We all have this little short window, and I was thinking while I was driving home. I\u2019m in the middle of that window. I am right now, in the middle of that experience. It\u2019s my turn. This is my experience. And 70 or 80 or 90 billion people have already gone through that and it\u2019s come and gone and it\u2019s over for them. And I started thinking about that movie, Dead Poets Society, I remember that movie was super slow and boring, but there was one scene in there and I just loved it.</p> <p>It\u2019s when the new kids came in, Robin Williams is their teacher, and he takes them into the hallway and he shows them the picture on the wall and it\u2019s black and white and it\u2019s all these people. He said, \u201clook in their eyes. Do you see that in their eyes? That\u2019s hopes and dreams and desires and passions and things that they want to do and things that they want to accomplish change the world. And you see it in their eyes.\u201d I can\u2019t remember the words, but its like, \u201cThese guys are dust now. They\u2019re dead, they\u2019re gone. Their shot, their window is over.\u201d And then he\u2019s like, \u201cThey\u2019re worm food now.\u201d Or something like that, \u201cBut if you listen carefully you can hear them say something.\u201d And then he says, \u201cNow listen closely.\u201d And they all lean in and then Robin Williams in his voice goes, \u201cCarpe diem. Carpe diem. Seize the day.\u201d And that was the message from this group of people who have died, calling from the dust saying, \u201cLook, this is your shot, this is your window. You\u2019re in the middle of it right now.\u201d</p> <p>So you can go watch TV or go and slack off or whatever or you can seize the day. You can take this life and this opportunity, this window that we have and do something with it. And I was just thinking about that, I\u2019m like how cool it is, I\u2019m driving home and I\u2019m in the middle of it right now. It\u2019s going to be gone soon. Could be gone tomorrow, could be gone a year from now. I don\u2019t know when. It could be gone 100 years from now, but I was saying on my best guest-imates, you know right now, I\u2019m 30\u2026..I don\u2019t even know how old I am, 30 something, 36. So let\u2019s just say I live to be close to 100, I\u2019m a third of the way through this life. And the last third you are pretty much just hanging out. I assume, I don\u2019t know, maybe not. I\u2019m in the middle of it, this is it. So I was thinking. What do we want to do with this time? I feel like I have these hands, I\u2019m looking at my hands right now, and hopefully you guys are as well. I\u2019m looking at my hands and these hands that we have, these are tools of creation. We can create anything we want. You can literally create life, we can create families. My wife and I created 5 little amazing kids. I\u2019ve created a business, I\u2019ve created, you know I look at my yard, the things we do in our yard. We\u2019re creatures who need to create. That\u2019s what one of our instincts that God gives us is, we\u2019re given these hands and this thing to create.</p> <p>So I was thinking what am I creating right now? What am I creating that\u2019s not just for me? It\u2019s always like, I want to be happy. That\u2019s important, but a lot of times we can be happy at the expense of other people, right. It happens all the time, it\u2019s a sad thing and it\u2019s a selfish thing. So it\u2019s not how can I be happy? But it\u2019s how can I create stuff that makes other people happy? And by doing that I\u2019ll become happier, it\u2019s just how the laws of nature or whatever you want to call them, how they work. And I started thinking; we\u2019re in this time where we get to create.</p> <p>So my question for you is what do you want to create? You\u2019re in the same spot I am. And maybe I\u2019m a year or two ahead of you or maybe I\u2019m a year or two behind you, I don\u2019t know, but you\u2019re here on earth and you\u2019ve got hands and you\u2019ve got a mind, you\u2019ve got the same opportunities, the same ideas, you\u2019re exposed to the same things I am every single day. I\u2019m trying to create my own world, and I\u2019m trying to create things for other people, and I\u2019m trying to create something \u00a0that makes this world a better spot when I leave and I hope you are too. I hope you\u2019re thinking through that. What is it you want to create?\u00a0 Because everything\u2019s kind of make believe. I\u2019m going to the office today, and I can sit down and think, what do I want to create? And I can create whatever I want. Maybe people will like it, maybe they won\u2019t. I hope people will like the stuff but a lot of times they won\u2019t. But that\u2019s our opportunity and I think when you look at it from that lens, \u201cWe\u2019re here on earth. A loving heavenly father put us here. He\u2019s giving us all trials and challenges that are all different, but in severity they\u2019re probably all the same or very close.\u201d</p> <p>And you\u2019re somewhere in this journey and you could be a third of the way through it. You could be half way, you could be three fourths, but regardless, we\u2019re all going to go in today, we\u2019re all going to look at similar computers; we have the same assets and resources at our fingertips. You\u2019ve got Facebook, You\u2019ve got Google, I\u2019ve got the same things. And we\u2019re going to try to create stuff that helps serve other people. And I hope you take advantage of that. Because as I was driving home the other day, I was just so excited for that opportunity that I have and grateful for it. And I just wanted to kind of share that with you guys today because I thought it was important and I think it matters.</p> <p>It was funny because I got home that night and I tried to Snapchat that in 10 seconds, and I shared it really quickly and took me probably 40 seconds to do it, and now we\u2019re at 10 minutes in. I feel like I need at least 10 minutes to explain that and hopefully get that message through to you. Anyway, with that said, I want you thinking about that, thinking about two things. Number one is that now is the time to create. You are in a spot in your life where you have this window where you have the ability to create things for other people that will change their life in a little way and by doing that you will have left an impact on the world and that is where I think the true happiness you will feel comes from. Not from you making yourself feel good, but from you helping other people and that in return will make you feel true joy. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so cool.</p> <p>So there you go you guys. It is time to create. Carpe diem, seize the day. Don\u2019t wait any longer. Turn off the TV, get off of your butt. Quit goofing around, let\u2019s create something that helps somebody else and if you do that you\u2019ll be rewarded. Zig Ziglar used to say, you can get anything you want in this life, as long as you help other people get what they want.\u201d And I believe that is extremely true. Now is the time you guys. Carpe diem, seize the day. Alright, I am out of here. I\u2019ll talk to you all tomorrow. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "12:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_247.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1467929232, "title": "Episode #246 \u2013 The Magic Of Internet Marketing Math", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Let me walk you behind the scenes of the Biohacking Secrets sales funnel\u2019s numbers.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell walks you through the math of internet marketing and how you can test a products profitability.

Good morning, I hope I woke you up. Welcome to Marketing in Your Car. Alright everybody, I hope things are going amazing for you all today. I just wanted to jump on today, headed into the office, I\u2019m just about to\u2026I\u2019m so bad at preparing. I have a webinar in 40 minutes for the network marketing group we\u2019re taking through Clickfunnels. So I gotta get in and get that all prepped, and then I\u2019m doing a webinar for Clickfunnels today. And we got some Jiu Jitsu practice tonight. And talking to Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s people today. So a lot of stuff, I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>But what I wanted to talk to you guys about today, is something even more important. It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s my favorite part in the funnel building process. It\u2019s the part that stresses most people out. So typically we create a funnel, we do our best foot forward, and then we launch it to the world and wait to see what happens. And this is where most my Inner Circle people freak out. Like, \u201cOh Russell my funnel didn\u2019t work. This is a scam.\u201d No just kidding. They don\u2019t say that. A lot of people probably think of the Clickfunnels community or whatever, they launch something that doesn\u2019t make money over night. And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh this funnel thing doesn\u2019t work.\u201d So it\u2019s always kind of funny.</p> <p>So I want to walk you through what\u2019s been happening with the Biohacking Secrets funnel. Because we\u2019re going through that phase right now. We officially started launching it actually about a week ago. I think John\u2019s spending about a hundred dollars a day just driving ads and seeing where things take out. So this is the thing normal people, they drive ads for like\u2026.they do one of two things. One they drive ads for a day and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d And they freak out and they want to shut it down. Or number two, they drive ads for like 2 months and it doesn\u2019t work and then they come back, \u201cI spent 20 grand and I didn\u2019t make any money.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, why did you not stop?\u201d</p> <p>So this is how we do it. We drive some ads, 100 bucks a day or so for about a week, just to see. So we\u2019re spending $500-$1000 to kind of get some initial data and see what\u2019s happening. So from that, yesterday we had a call with Anthony, he had looked over the numbers. The numbers were basically this; we were spending on average about $20 on Facebook ads, giveaway a free book. Some sources were cheaper, some were more expensive, but as a whole about $20 per book. That was the average. And then our average cart value, so that\u2019s the first metric, which is the key. It\u2019s the cost to acquire a customer. So if you\u2019ve ever watched Shark Tank they always say, \u201cSo what\u2019s your cost to acquire a customer?\u201d And none of the entrepreneurs ever know, because the entrepreneurs are typically idiots. They don\u2019t pay attention. \u201cThe first number you have to know in your business is \u2018what is your cost to acquire a customer.\u201d So I get a baseline cost to acquire a customer from that initial first week test.\u00a0 So boom, that\u2019s my trick number one that I need to know.</p> <p>Then metric number two that I need to know, what is my average cart value? So from every person that buys a front end product, what\u2019s the average, how much money do they spend? So all you do is take all the money you\u2019ve collected from this campaign, divide it by the number of front end sales you have and that gives you your average cart value. Are you guys impressed? I\u2019m like a mathematician over here. Says Russell, who barely passed math in high school and college. That give\u2019s your average cart value. So our average cart value is $17. Alright so, wherein lies the issue my friends, if you\u2019re paying attention. We\u2019re spending $20 to acquire a customer that\u2019s worth at point of sale $17. Now obviously, long term customer value, lifetime customer, all that type of crap is good to know. Yeah, we may have lost $3 on every book we sold, but you know, people are always leaning on long term customer value, the lifetime value of a customer. The LTV, and those things are good to know, but for me when I\u2019m building a funnel I don\u2019t care about LTV because I want to funnel it so that it at least breaks even up front, otherwise it\u2019s not worth running for me. And that should be kind of the case for you as well. Yeah, lifetime value is cool, but don\u2019t make that a metric you drive your business on right now. Because it\u2019s just stupid, otherwise you\u2019re just gambling, hoping that next year you\u2019ll make more money. Which you will, but I want to be break even at point of sale, otherwise it\u2019s not worth it.</p> <p>Alright so right now, we\u2019re not at break even. We\u2019re losing $3, plus we also had the book printing, plus shipping, so another probably $10 on printing and shipping. So we\u2019re actually negative $13 on every book we sell right now. So we\u2019re not at break even. This is when we\u2019re all like, \u201cAhh, this sucks. I spent all this time and effort. I quit.\u201d But instead you look at it and say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s look at all the pieces.\u201d There\u2019s only 3 core drivers in this thing, maybe 4. So the first one is the ad cost, right now most of our sources, we were spending, like I said on average $20 to acquire a book customer. Usually from static Facebook ads. One thing I\u2019ve been doing in my business that\u2019s been working really good right now is Facebook Live. So I said, \u201cHey Anthony, do a Facebook Live that we can then drive traffic to the book through Facebook Live.\u201d So he did that and low and behold, first test was amazing. He dropped from $20 to acquire a customer down to the ads coming through Facebook Live, were $6. Huge, huge, huge difference. So we told Anthony, \u201cEvery single day now you are going to do a Facebook Live.\u201d And all of them are pushing to the book offer, and when they\u2019re done we\u2019re going to put $5-$10 in advertising behind it and the ones that take off, we\u2019ll then ramp up advertising and the ones that don\u2019t we won\u2019t.So that\u2019s the thing about Facebook Live. Some videos hit and some don\u2019t. So the key is doing one a day and put $10 behind each one, and the ones that get some traction and dump as much money as you can behind them. So that\u2019s number one. So that\u2019s lowering the cost to acquire a customer.</p> <p>Our number two metric was conversion rates on the landing page. Our conversion rates weren\u2019t bad, I was pretty happy with them so I wasn\u2019t stressing about that. But the order form bump conversion rates were lower than I wanted. Right now we\u2019re at 11%, we\u2019re taking the order form bump. So I looked at it and I think the copy and stuff I had was confusing, so what we did was simplify the copy, simplify the message and made that easier. So I don\u2019t know what the conversion on that yet, will be. We\u2019re going to run this for another week. But my goal is to get that from 11% to about 20%. If we get that to 20% that alone will get us to a break even funnel. Especially considering the cost to acquire is dropping due to Facebook Live. So that\u2019s a big thing.</p> <p>Then the second metric was our upsell rate. Our upsell rate sucked. It was real bad.So I looked at that and said, Okay, right now the upsell was selling for $197 and it\u2019s a weight loss, biohacking weight loss course. Okay, the conversions are horrible. What do we need to do? Well, I think the pitch was wrong. So I just re-recording a pitch myself and threw it in there on behalf of Anthony, we plug in some b-roll of Anthony and me, and we had took an outro from him. So we had to tweak the pitch which is much better. So that\u2019s number one, and then changed the pricing strategy from $197 up front, to basically made it where it\u2019s a free trial. You just say yes, and they\u2019ll just get it all right now, and then 7 days later you get billed $97. Or you can save $20 and get it for $77. So we changed the upsell pricing strategy to that as opposed to the straight $197. And it\u2019s funny because I think Anthony was worried. \u201cMan, if we drop the price, are we going to make so much money.\u201d And I was basically like, \u201cThink about it this way. At $197, if we\u2019re getting 1% conversion rate, 1 out of 100 are buying it, it\u2019s only adding $2 to your average cart value if you get a 1% conversion rate. When it\u2019s $97 we get a 10% conversion rate, meaning 1 out 10 people are buying it, it means\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s see what\u2019s the math on that. That means we\u2019re making\u2026.At $100 we\u2019re making $10, so that increases our average cart value by $10 per person. \u201cIf we drop the price in half we get a conversion of 10% that changes the whole metric. That adds $10 average cart value on every single person.\u201d I think the math\u2019s right. I might be wrong. Good chance I\u2019m wrong. But conceptually I hope that makes sense.</p> <p>So we made those little tweaks and now we\u2019re doing the next tests. So we\u2019ll test this next week and we\u2019ll look at the numbers again at the end of that and see where we\u2019re at. And hopefully between lowering cost to acquire, increasing the order form bump take rates and increasing the upsell take rates, we will be at break even or profitable. And the second we\u2019re at break even or profitable, now we\u2019ve got something that we can grow and we can scale and we can have a lot of fun with. So there you go. That is the magic of internet marketing math. I hope you guys enjoyed that. Have some fun with that with your next funnels and we\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "09:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_246.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1467758659, "title": "Episode #245 \u2013 Funnel Friday Update -The $117K Secret", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How showing us consume our own products is driving revenue.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about how doing Funnel Fridays has helped show people how to consume Funnel Scripts and has ended up helping tremendously with sales.

I hope you guys are doing amazing. Welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Alright my friends, I\u2019m on the way to the office for a quick one hour session. It was 4th of July yesterday, we had an amazing time blowing up more fireworks than most people should probably ever buy. Someone told me that that\u2019s the closest thing to lighting money on fire, but I tell you what, it was worth it. We had a great time, we survived. All of my 50+ family members, almost all of them left now. There\u2019s a moment when things just slowed down, so I\u2019m heading to the office to bust out a quick few projects real quick. Then I\u2019m back to playing with the fam.</p> <p>But as I was heading out I wanted to share with you guys something that\u2019s really, really cool. Amazingly cool. Something that I think all of you guys should, really should be doing in your business. It was something we kind of stumbled upon. Let me tell you the back story. So here\u2019s the epiphany bridge for those that pay attention. I always talk about my webinar model, where it\u2019s like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday promote the webinar. Thursday do the webinar. Friday, Saturday, Sunday follow up and keep that process, right? What about all the unconverted leads, people that don\u2019t buy, what should you do with them? So that\u2019s kind of what this concept stems from. People didn\u2019t buy the webinar for whatever reason. Sometimes they come around and buy later and things like that. But how do we get them so that they\u2019re buying all the time?</p> <p>So that was kind of the initial question and I heard John Lee Dumas talk about how he does these webinars on Friday, he just talks all day Friday. Talks for 2 or 3 hours and just pitches all those unconverted leads on this thing and makes a hundred grand every single time. And I was like, or you know, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it was 50 grand or 10 grand. I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what he was doing every Friday for a while and I was like, that\u2019s kind of cool. So we bought the domain funnelfridays.com and got a sweet logo made and I was like, \u201cEvery Friday I\u2019m going to do some Funnel Friday thing.\u201d And that was kind of the idea and then it sat there for like 8 months. Logo design and everything, it just didn\u2019t do anything.</p> <p>And then one day Jim Edwards called me on the phone and was like, \u201cHey we sold a lot of Funnel Scripts, we should keep selling Funnel Scripts, because right now nobody\u2019s buying it. What\u2019s the best way to sell more?\u201d and I was like, I don\u2019t know and we were kind of trying to think through things. And then I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about doing this thing Funnel Friday where I was just going to build funnels and let people watch me. Do you want to be on that show and then you can do the script part of it and just I don\u2019t know? It\u2019d be kind of fun.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYes, let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s set a date.\u201d Which was a good thing we did, because the day was like 6 weeks later, but we put it on a Friday. We were like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this Friday Funnels.\u201d Yeah Friday Funnels. I get the domain messed up. Anyway, 6 weeks later, finally I show up that day and it\u2019s like the day before and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh crap, we\u2019re doing this tomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhat should we do.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cLet\u2019s build a funnel. I\u2019m going to build it in Clickfunnels, you\u2019ll write the script in Funnel Scripts, you\u2019ll give it to me and we\u2019ll plug it all in, and we\u2019ll show people us building a funnel.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cHow long is it going to be?\u201d And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019d probably be cool if we made it like we had some kind of limits on it. So it wasn\u2019t just Russell building a funnel for 3 hours, because as cool as that would be for me and the two people that would like to watch me build funnels for 3 hours a day.</p> <p>Oh man, I think I just got walkie-talkie\u2019d by the construction lady with the sign. Hope there\u2019s not a cop on the back end of that. Anyway, sorry. There\u2019s construction, I\u2019m just driving too fast through it.</p> <p>So anyway, I was like, \u201cI think it\u2019d be better if we had constraints, because constraints make things interesting.\u201d When there\u2019s no constraints on it and you\u2019re just doing something, it\u2019s not as interesting. So I was like, \u201cLet\u2019s do a 30 minute timer and let\u2019s try to build a funnel. So that was kind of the concept. So we went the first time and we started building a funnel and I did it in 30 minutes. Anyway, I got one of the 6 pages in the funnel done and it was really, really hard. The next week we did another one and I got a little bit closer. And the third week, I think we\u2019ve done\u2026\u2026.I can\u2019t remember if it\u2019s 3 or 4 weeks now. I think we\u2019re on 4, I think this is our 4th week. We\u2019ve had people send packages of what they want us to build. And we\u2019ve done Facebook Live ahead of time and opening up packages and letting people vote on which product they wanted to see on Funnel Fridays. Just a whole bunch of fun things around that concept and every Friday we\u2019re like, \u201cHey we\u2019re building a funnel, come hang out with us live.\u201d And people would show up, and it\u2019s pretty cool.</p> <p>Now a couple of little tweaks. W\u2019re doing ours on Google Hangouts. If you go to the page you\u2019ll see it there and all the back shows are there as well. So it\u2019s happening on Google Hangout, and we drive our email list to promote to that. So there\u2019s traffic coming from that. And now that we\u2019re kind of building our YouTube subscribers, there\u2019s a little traffic coming from that. And the other things is Facebook Live and Periscope. For some reason, I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m grateful for it. Facebook Live is amazing right now. I did a Facebook Live yesterday and within 24 hours we had over a million people reached, it\u2019s crazy. I think that they\u2019re really rewarding people right now, because they want people on Facebook Live because they are trying to beat out Periscope and the other ones.</p> <p>Anyway, there\u2019s a little hint. Strike while the iron\u2019s hot, because that window won\u2019t be there forever. I remember with Google Hangouts for a while it was the same thing. You do a Google Hangout on any topic and you\u2019d be ranked on page one of Google the next day. So that window, that ship kind of sailed and disappeared, but that\u2019s how they were trying to get people to do hangouts back then. Same thing, they\u2019re trying to do with Facebook Live. So they promote things. So what we do is, I\u2019m doing it live on Google Hangouts, then Steven on my team, he\u2019s got Periscope and Facebook Live recording on my phone, so he\u2019s recording behind the scenes of us doing it. So we\u2019re recording that, a piece of it.</p> <p>What\u2019s crazy is that Facebook Live version goes crazy viral. Part of it\u2019s because we\u2019re on for about an hour. 30 minutes of me building, but there\u2019s build up time and post time and talking and having fun and banter. So it\u2019s about an hour. So because of that there\u2019s so much interaction that happens during that hour that Facebook boosts it high. Anyway, it\u2019s crazy. So we do it, basically, Google Hangouts is showing us using the product, Facebook Live and Periscope show behind the scenes of us doing it. And we kind of promote all those things like crazy. And when all is said and done, after Friday\u2019s show is done, we\u2019re getting half a million + people to see it on Friday, between the reach and emails and everything like that. It\u2019s just crazy.</p> <p>So we\u2019ve done it for 4 weeks now. Is that what I said? 4 weeks, 1,2,3,4. And I have no idea if it\u2019s sales were good or bad. We\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s fun and hopefully people will like it. Luckily every single week it\u2019s been more people showing up. So there\u2019s some cool stuff there. But after Friday\u2019s last show, Jim was like, because Jim and I are partners on Funnel Scripts, so he gets half the money on everything it makes. And he was just, he said something like, \u201cMan, I\u2019m glad I hitched myself to you and to the Clickfunnels bandwagon.\u201d Or whatever. And I was like, \u201cOh yeah. How are sales doing? I haven\u2019t even looked yet.\u201d And he said something like, \u201cMama\u2019s really happy.\u201d And I was like, \u201cReally? How are we doing? I have no idea. We haven\u2019t promoted it, been in a webinar. There\u2019s an auto webinar page there and we talk about it during these shows.\u201d So I went back to look at the stats, and that product alone had sold over $117,000 worth in the last 30 days. Primarily, I mean we drive a little bit of Facebook ads and stuff, but primarily from this live show. And it\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t even know how much Clickfunnels sells, or Funnel University or the things we talk about, but that one specific, $117,000 came from us not selling, just consuming the product and showing people how we consume the product. Is that crazy?</p> <p>So my big moral, I hope you guys are seeing this trend in the back side of my marketing, because we\u2019re doing it a lot. We\u2019re trying to show behind the scenes of everything. As you know we\u2019re doing a reality show, filming behind the scenes of behind the scenes. The more I\u2019m trying to get people engaged in the process of what we do and not just the end product of what we do, but engaging people in the process, the better it\u2019s been. How do we let them experience us consuming our products? Because we\u2019re the hyper users so far. I\u2019m consuming this product and I\u2019m obsessed with it and I\u2019m showing you how excited I am. And I\u2019m actually consuming it on a regular basis and they get to peer through the screen, look over my shoulder and watch that process. It gets them wanting to consume, it gets them wanting to use it. So instead, for us not selling anything, just showing people how we consume our own products, that one product alone $117,000. My guess between Clickfunnels and some other stuff we\u2019re probably a quarter of a million dollars or more and we haven\u2019t sold anything yet. We\u2019re just showing us consume things.</p> <p>So I want all you guys thinking about that. What is it in your business that you do? Most of your customers probably see the end result. The product that you are handing them or the software tool your handing them or whatever. They don\u2019t get to see the process. So how can you show them the process? How can you use something like a weekly show where you consume your products and show you actually using them? Anyway, it\u2019s doing some amazing things for us and that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited. I wanted to share that with you guys. So if you want to see the process we\u2019re doing, go to funnelfridays.com to kind of watch the process and be engaged with it. But then feel free to model it, funnel hack it, whatever you want to call it in your own market because it\u2019s working like crazy. Bring them in behind the scenes you guys.</p> <p>I started saying this a couple of months ago and I\u2019m going to keep saying it, the more we open up the back end of what we\u2019re doing, the more people will become engaged in the process. At the mastermind meeting I mentioned that this whole concept. We\u2019re talking about building our culture and how do we open things up and I talked about how when your customers are experiencing, are part of the process of your creations or the things you are making, the big takeaway is that now it\u2019s not like, \u201cOh this is Russell\u2019s company.\u201d They look at it differently like, \u201cThis is our company. This is part of what we are. This is our movement.\u201d It\u2019s making them engaged.</p> <p>I remember thinking about this. This is probably 8 or 9 years ago. One of my buddies, Anik Singal and I had both, I hope he hears this it\u2019ll be kind of funny, had an idea for a product and both of us, we called ours Affiliate Inferno and he called his Affiliate Manager something, and both of them are the same concept like, how to build an affiliate program to drive traffic. The greatest way to drive traffic in the world is building an affiliate program. So we both had this idea and I think we both knew we were going to create something but we didn\u2019t know when, and I remember, Stu McClarin was my partner on the project and we had had a call that day. Me and Stu picked a day. We\u2019re going to do our pre-launch here and our launch here and had everything mapped out. And that same day Anik Singal called me and was like, \u201cHey man, I\u2019m launching my thing, here\u2019s my day and my thing.\u201d And it was the exact same day as mine. I was like, \u201cOh dude, we honestly have the exact same dates for the exact same product and we\u2019re competing for the same affiliates.\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t move mine. It\u2019s in process.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t move mine either.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, this sucks.\u201d\u00a0 I was like, \u201cAlright, well good luck.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cGood luck to you too.\u201d</p> <p>And we were both competing for primarily similar products, but going after the same partners to help us promote it. So I didn\u2019t know what to do I was just like, this is going to suck. So what I did, I called a couple of my friends up. I didn\u2019t get\u2026..it\u2019d be fun to actually look back in the books now and see how much our launch did vs Anik\u2019s and just see who ended up getting more or less. I mean, I don\u2019t know. He had a lot of people on his side,\u00a0 I had a lot of people on my side. Everyone kind of took sides and did it. The one interesting thing, I remember I called a bunch of my friends. Mike Filsaime was one of them for example, I was like, \u201cHey Mike, this is what happened. What would you do?\u201d So Mike went and consulted me through what he would do if he was me in this situation, which was awesome. I got consulting from him and I was like, oh cool. But what was cool is because he was consulting me and he was the one coaching me through this process, when it came to who was he going to promote, he promoted me. I believe it was because he felt part of the process of my product and not Anik\u2019s.</p> <p>He had this piece of that role out, and because he felt ownership in that, he participated in it. So the lesson I\u2019m trying to share with you guys is if your customers feel ownership in the creative process you\u2019re going through as you create your products and services and you\u2019re doing things, they are going to be way more likely to purchase those things in the future. They are going to be more likely to view you and your company not as your company vs. their\u2026customer vs. whatever it\u2019s going to be their company with you, which is cool.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that gave you guys some value. It\u2019s some of the ninja cool stuff I\u2019m thinking about a lot recently and having a ton of success with it. I think it\u2019s exciting. So that\u2019s it. I\u2019m at the office; I\u2019m going to go get some stuff done. Have an amazing day you guys and I\u2019ll talk to you all again very soon, bye.</p>", "duration": "14:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_245.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1467232187, "title": "Episode #244 \u2013 One Visualization Trick That Almost Got Me To Spend $33,000 On An Old Book", "author": "", "summary": "<p>If you can use this one secret, you can sell anything.</p> <p>On today\u2019s special LA version of Marketing In Your Car, Russell and Dave Woodward talk about how Russell nearly spent $33,000 on a rare copy of The Book of Mormon and why he felt like he had to have it.</p> <p>Here are some fun things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Find out what kind of items Russell searches for on Ebay.</li> <li>Find out why he was willing to spend such a large amount of money on a book.</li> <li>And see what this experience taught him about marketing and how he\u2019s going to use it in his business.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out what kind of stuff Russell buys on Ebay and why he\u2019s willing to spend some serious cash on a book.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to a special California, LA edition of Marketing in Your Car. Alright guys, I\u2019m here with Dave Woodward tonight. How you doing?</p> <p>Dave: Hello.</p> <p>Russell: We just got done at Tai Lopez\u2019s house, filming a bunch of video promotions for the big promotion I\u2019m going to do for Clickfunnels next week. Last webinar promotion they did, they did 1.8 million dollars. So it was worth flying to LA to contact some of your dream 100 to get them to hopefully make you at least that, if not more. Actually our goal is more, we\u2019re going to try to do 2 million bucks, which would be amazing. Then tomorrow at 9:15 in the morning, we are going to go film with Marcus Lemonis, an episode of the Profit. How insane is that? People always ask me if we\u2019re on the show as a business. No, we\u2019re not on the show as a business. There\u2019s another business, we\u2019re coming in as the internet dudes, funnel dudes. It\u2019s going to be so crazy.</p> <p>Anyway, we wanted to do a late night impromptu Marketing In Your Car because I just had this crazy powerful marketing experience. I was telling Dave what happened and then we both at the same time we were like, \u201cThis needs to be a podcast.\u201d So on Ebay today\u2026..Most of you all should know at this point in life, or in the podcast, that I am a Mormon, if you\u2019re not, I drop it all the time. I\u2019m not shy, but proud as can be. So you should know that at this point. So in the Mormon faith there\u2019s a book called the Book of Mormon. Oh, that\u2019s kind of, pretty complex, right? So there\u2019s this book that is amazing and in 1830 was the first printing of it, and there were 5,000 copies printed. It was cool because it was printed, instead of like, if you look at it today, it looks like scripture, chapter and verse. But this was like a novel, like a book. There was no chapter or verse back then when it was first printed in the 5,000 copies. And probably today there\u2019s only, they speculate there\u2019s only 500 of them still in circulation, the rest have been destroyed or whatever. They\u2019re gone.</p> <p>A couple of years ago I saw one on Ebay that sold for $120,000 and I was like, \u201cAHHH! How cool is that?\u201d Anyway, I only go to Ebay once every 4 or 5 months, and when I do I go and search for every term on Earth that I\u2019m interested in and I end up spending way too much money. So I search for, should I tell you the terms that I search for? Is that interesting?</p> <p>Dave: Yes, it definitely is.</p> <p>Russell: Matt Furey, Farmer Burns, rare LDS, rare Mormon, rare marketing, Dan Kennedy rare, Tony Robbins rare\u2026.Anyway, these all\u2026.</p> <p>(crossover talk)</p> <p>Russell: Now you know what I\u2019m looking for. But I always, those things I always search for, Jay Abraham rare, Chet Holmes, looking for things I don\u2019t own. So I always look for things rare or unique. Anyway, so that\u2019s the stuff I\u2019m searching for, and then I always search for 1st edition Book of Mormon, because who knows? Last time I checked, earlier this week there were two. One of them was listed for $70,000 and one was listed for $33,000. I\u2019m like, \u201c$33,000, that\u2019s 90 grand discount from the other dude who bought one a couple of years ago when I saw it.\u201d So I\u2019m like \u201cHow cool would that be?\u201d Then I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay $33,000 for a book. That\u2019s completely ridiculous.\u201d But of course there\u2019s a little watch button, so I watch it. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m just going to watch and see how much some dude ends up paying for this book. So I\u2019m watching it, and I\u2019m looking at it and every day I go back and then Ebay texts you on your phone. Like, \u201cHey somebody else looked at it, you should go look again.\u201d So I\u2019m like, okay. And I go look again and all these things to get me engaged in the process. Finally one day a couple of days ago. I looked down and there was this spot to buy it now for $33,000 and I was like, \u201cOh my gosh! Someone\u2019s going to get this for $33 grand.\u201d And they had a button next to it that was like, you can make an offer. So I was like, I\u2019m going to make an offer. So I made an offer that is ridiculous when you think about, it\u2019s a book, right?</p> <p>Anyway, I was like, I could realistically justify this, so I put in an offer for a price, and then an hour later, he rejected it. I\u2019m like, \u201cDangit, how did he reject my price.\u201d That was a lot of money for an old book that\u2019s falling apart. I\u2019m like, dangit, so I\u2019ll just wait. Then I\u2019m about to come here to LA, so I look down and there\u2019s 4 hours before the auction ends and I\u2019m like, \u201cAhh. I don\u2019t really need it.\u201d And I\u2019m sitting there talking to Brent and Steve and a couple other guys in the office. I can\u2019t remember who it was, but we were talking like, \u201cCan you imagine how cool it would be to have that book and read it to your kids. Let them hold it and then actually read the entire thing to them through one of the original books. One that Joseph Smith probably handled.\u201d Whatever it was. And I was thinking about it, how cool it\u2019d be just for yourself to read that and be able to read one from back in the day. I put myself.. I was thinking how cool that\u2019d be.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cI have to have it now.\u201d I told Dave, \u201cI\u2019ve now experienced that moment and it was amazing. And my kids haven\u2019t had a chance to experience it yet and I want them to experience it so bad, because I experienced it and It was amazing even though it was in my head. But I imagined it and I want to have that experience with them now.\u201d Anyway, long story short, I didn\u2019t win the auction. No one did. It ended. Oh, I made a new offer. I made another offer that I was like, \u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to say no this time.\u201d Put that offer in and then he just ignored it. He didn\u2019t reject it, just ignored it. I was like, he\u2019s got to be playing a game. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to wait til\u2026.it\u2019s like a game of chicken. Two guys are driving cars at each other and one steers off at the last second. I\u2019m like, I have my bid in there, I guarantee he\u2019s going to wait til there\u2019s a minute left and then be like, accept.\u00a0 Because he wants my money, right?</p> <p>So I\u2019m waiting and waiting and then he doesn\u2019t accept. And it ends. The auction ends and I don\u2019t get the book. So now I\u2019m like, he\u2019s going to email me and be like, \u201cokay man, I\u2019ll take your offer.\u201d And he didn\u2019t for like 3 or 4 hours and I\u2019m like, dangit. So finally I caved and wrote him, \u201chey man, what\u2019s the lowest possible amount you\u2019d take for that book?\u201d So he may or may not write back. I don\u2019t know. But the lesson, the moral of the story is if you can create a selling thing, where your customer actually visualizes themselves consuming the thing that you have. That happened to me when Brent or Steve, I can\u2019t remember who it was, maybe it was a blend of this conversation. Talking, \u201cCan you imagine reading that book to your kids and holding an original copy and letting them touch it and turning the pages.\u201d And I did and when I had that vision in my head, I couldn\u2019t get it out, because I wanted that experience. Because I experienced it already and I wanted to share that experience with other people but I couldn\u2019t unless I consumed, unless I bought.</p> <p>So think about that. How can you create in all that you\u2019re selling, your webinars, your sales videos, your letters, your videos, everything you\u2019re doing. How do you create an experience where they visualize it so strong that they can\u2019t live without it? When you do that, that\u2019s how you close book sales for $33,000 a book, which is insane.</p> <p>Right now we\u2019re driving up to the Bulletproof Coffee shop, I\u2019m so excited. As you know now, I\u2019m a Mormon, I mentioned earlier. I don\u2019t drink coffee, but I\u2019m a huge fan of Bulletproof stuff and last time we filmed Dave asked for his book funnel here, we ate at this coffee shop. They have food to die for. So we\u2019re in LA, we just drove here and I\u2019m about to eat everything on the menu, except for the coffee.</p> <p>Dave: This actually goes back to having a cult following, because we drove half hour out of our way, just because it is that good, because we had one experience. Goes back to having an experience. We had the experience and we\u2019re like, I don\u2019t care where it\u2019s at, we\u2019re close enough we\u2019ll find a way to go re-experience what we\u2019d already experienced once before, because we craved it that much.</p> <p>(crossover talk)</p> <p>Russell: The crazy thing too is the first time we were here, we ordered one thing off the menu that was so good, that we ordered 3 more things for lunch, then we left and came back for dinner. We weren\u2019t even hungry, but we did it again. I ordered 3 or 4 things because I wanted to try everything because it was such a good experience. So many good marketing lessons in this whole 7 minutes and 43 seconds you\u2019ve been here with me so far.</p> <p>Dave: Create the experience.</p> <p>Russell: Create it, have them envision it. Have them experience it in their minds and then they will desire it in their lives. Alright guys, we\u2019re out of here. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and if anyone wants to send me some rare stuff from Ebay, now you know my keywords. Thanks guys. We\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "09:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_244.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1467066592, "title": "Episode #243 \u2013 Which Vehicle Are You Driving In?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>If you\u2019re not happy with your opportunity\u2026change the vehicle.</p> <p>In today\u2019s episode Russell talks about finding a vehicle that is able to take you where you want to go.

I am on my way to the Clickfunnels Certification Program, so I\u2019m excited. We\u2019ve got about 20 or so Clickfunnels people who are all going to be there. The way we have certification is setup, we kind of learned something the last time we had certification, the first one. We sold it, we had like 100 people come, they all came at once and it was really hard to facilitate and manage, the weirdest thing is, I think it was a 4 or 5 day event, we had everything planned, and I was excited because I was going to be like, this\u2026.and as soon as we got there we realized, one of the first question I asked was, \u201cWho here has never logged into Clickfunnels?\u201d and half the audience raised their hands. Are you kidding me? And then the other half was super advanced. We had this really weird thing where I had to be teaching beginner stuff, while keeping stuff interesting. Anyway, we had the event, it made it kind of hard, we had some ups and downs and I had 2 yahoo\u2019s that shouldn\u2019t have been in the room that made it more difficult on me. It\u2019s one of those fun things you get when you jump right into something. But as a whole it went really good. One of our biggest takeaways afterward was, we need to have people go through a pre-program before the show up, so that way everybody is on the same page.</p> <p>We\u2019ve had about 100 people who were eligible to come to today, only about 1/5th of them, 20 of them or so, have finished all the homework assignments up to today so they were able to actually come. It kind of makes me smile, dude, everybody, you all should have been here. We thought we\u2019d have closer to 50 people. But there is the human nature. And some people obviously couldn\u2019t make the dates of the event and stuff like that. That\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening. So I\u2019m heading in there today. What\u2019s cool is now we\u2019ve got Norah, who is amazing. A thousand times cooler than me, she is actually running the whole certification program now. I get to come in and talk this morning about some cool stuff and then she\u2019ll be running the rest of the event which will be pretty awesome.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019ve got a lot of cool\u00a0 things that I\u2019ve been mapping out this morning trying to figure out what could be the best thing I could give everybody and make it inspirational and motivational, but also the\u00a0 tactful things you need to go and implement and stuff. So the presentation called the Anatomy of the Successful Funnel Consultant, and it\u2019s pretty cool so I\u2019m going to share a couple of things that are on the top of my head as I\u2019m driving in. I can\u2019t go deep on everything because it\u2019ll take me 2 hours. Some of the fun things, one of the things that I\u2019m going to talk about, that I think is interesting is just the level of the opportunity that you\u2019re in. I\u2019ve done a podcast on this back in the day, for the hardcore fans who\u2019ve listened to everything, if not, you should go binge watch it all, and catch up. Anyway, it talked about level 10 opportunities, it\u2019s interesting a couple of my friends here that go to church with me, so we moved to a new area, which is a little more affluent, bigger homes,, bigger things, so it was kind of like, when you go to our church, the way Mormon church\u2019s work, we have things called Wards. Wards are all the people geographically close to you. So in our Ward, all the people who live close to us all go to the same ward. So it\u2019s interesting, you go there and everyone there is like a doctor, or dentist, or an entrepreneur, or a blogger, or a network marketer, or a builder, they\u2019re all business type, or people that\u2026higher income type people. They\u2019re just kind of cool.</p> <p>One of the doctors, I don\u2019t know, I love the doctors, one of them is usually funny. We went and hung out with him and his wife and they were talking about how, \u201cIn this ward, in this area, we\u2019re the, the doctors are like the welfare, because you have all the entrepreneurs who are making crazy money and the doctors seem like the poor ones.\u201d Which is kind of a funny thing. Then one of the other doctors I was talking to, he kept asking me, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you do? I went to school forever, I cut people open, I operate on them and do all these things and you\u2019re obviously making way more money. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d We got into this debate and he\u2019s like, \u201cHow are you that much smarter than me?\u201d and I was like, \u201cAre you kidding me? You think I\u2019m smarter than you? Dude, you\u2019re a freaking doctor, you cut people open. They could bleed out on your table, you\u2019re dissecting arteries and gluing them together and doing all sorts of\u2026.you are way smarter than I\u2019ve ever dreamt of being. It\u2019s not even a remote conversation. Put two of us in a room, ask anybody. You\u2019re way smarter than me. The only difference right now, the reason why I\u2019m able to make more money than you is not because I\u2019m smarter. I would argue that day and night, that you are way smarter than me. The only difference is the vehicle that I chose to apply my knowledge in has the ability to make more money. That\u2019s it. I probably spent as much time studying marketing and sales as you have doctor stuff, that\u2019s the official term, the only difference is the vehicle.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s what\u2019s so cool about this whole, I was thinking through this with these funnel consultants, is just you\u2019re going to have to put in time and effort and energy and work, it\u2019s not just a slam dunk, easy thing over night. It\u2019s not hard, like going to college. You got to go for 6 years and hope to figure something out. You can figure it out in a couple of months, but there\u2019s effort that goes into it, but the power in it, is the fact that the vehicle you\u2019ve chosen, has the ability to generate lots of money. People will pay $10, 15, 25 thousand more for a sales funnel. The vehicle you chose is the right vehicle. Now it\u2019s like, I get really good and focused on driving that vehicle and doing a good job with it. So for all you guys, and I know a lot of you guys listening in, aren\u2019t funnel consultants and things like that, what makes for me at least, makes me think about the vehicles we choose. Is the opportunity you\u2019re in right now with your business, is it the right vehicle. Is it the vehicle that has the ability to get you where you want to get in life. If not you should go get a different vehicle, because there\u2019s tons of them.</p> <p>There\u2019s so many opportunities. That\u2019s the biggest problem for me. There\u2019s all these vehicles people are handing me and I\u2019m like, \u201coh, I could drive that one, or I could drive that one. They\u2019re so cool. All of them are so cool.\u201d But when you find the right vehicle it can grow exponentially. In the podcast I did a little while ago, I was talking about one of my friends, named Bill Harrison, we were in Kenya together 3 or 4 years ago. He was talking about this concept, he said, I think the company that he owns right now, I don\u2019t know their numbers, but I think he said, \u201cWe do somewhere between 5 and 10 million bucks a year. \u201c If you know this guy, he\u2019s one of the few people who geeks out on marketing as much, if not more than me. I haven\u2019t been to his house, but one of my friends was at his house, and he\u2019s a single dude, he said the whole house is like, every room is book shelves from floor to ceiling. You walk in and see the chair and there\u2019s like a stack of 30 books on each side of the chair. This dude is hard core and he told me, \u201cI feel like I have a level 10 understanding of marketing in sales, but I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a level 3 opportunity. I can do whatever I want, but I can\u2019t scale past this size, because this is the size of the vehicle that I decided to choose. I\u2019ve had friends that don\u2019t know that much about marketing and sales, and they\u2019re not that good at business, but they walked into a level 10 opportunity and they\u2019ve sold companies for hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d</p> <p>So part of it is looking at, it doesn\u2019t matter how good you are at the thing if the thing is only this big. If the vehicle is not bigger than that, you are stuck at your limit and you can\u2019t get any bigger. My friend who\u2019s a doctor, it doesn\u2019t matter how many lives he\u2019s saved, he\u2019s kind of limited. The vehicle is what it is. He\u2019s going to make a lot of money, but that\u2019s the size of the vehicle. So we have to look at what vehicle are we putting ourselves into. That was a big conversation, when I talked to Bill about this; I was like, \u201cWow.\u201d I look at myself like, what\u2019s the opportunity I have. I\u2019m looking around and the best companies in the world are doing what I was doing at the time, we\u2019re making maybe $10 million a year. There\u2019s also the stress and liability and all sorts of things associated with that. I was like, I don\u2019t like this. I\u2019m looking at this vehicle and looking around. I don\u2019t really like this vehicle very much. I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life in it. So I had to consciously change my vehicle and I look at it now, and my vehicle is Clickfunnels and this funnel stuff that\u2019s associated with it, and that vehicle the sky\u2019s the limit, at least in my mind right now.</p> <p>This year we\u2019ll probably do between 3 and 5 times of our best year ever in the past, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s not that I got much smarter, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m working harder, it\u2019s that I stepped into a better vehicle. So it\u2019s something to consciously think through. What\u2019s the vehicle you guys have selected for your life, for your business? Because your vehicle can only go as fast as it\u2019s able to go. So if you take that and strategically pick the right vehicle first off, second off strategically become level 10 at your skill set, you have that double mix, then it gets crazy. Then you can start writing your own paychecks all day long for the rest of your life.</p> <p>That was kind of one cool thing I\u2019ll be talking about that I think is really, really cool. What else? What else do you guys want to know about? I\u2019ll give you the next point. This relates to everyone. I may have talked about this. I\u2019m doing so many little publishing content in a lot of places and I can\u2019t remember everything I say. So if I ever repeat myself, please forgive me. But if I ever repeat myself, it\u2019s because it\u2019s essential for you to hear it twice. There you go.</p> <p>One of the guys in the mastermind, Henry, who is a designer and a super stud and just someone who I love and respect, he talked at mastermind. He was talking, do you guys remember that cartoon, Voltron? It was like Voltron, and Thundercats, and later on Power Rangers. Similar concepts, right? Where there was like 5 superheroes, and they go and fight bad guys, but every once and a while the bad guy gets too strong so they have to morph together into this super thing to become Voltron, which is the head and arms and legs, it\u2019s these 5 people coming in to one super person, who they can now go and beat the bad guy.\u00a0 So what Henry said that was kind of interesting, \u201cWhen I first got started out here I was kind of a superhero, I was good at my thing, but my thing wasn\u2019t complete. It was part of a whole. I was going out there and I was doing good at my thing, but I was missing other parts. I\u2019m a really good designer, but I was missing strategy and traffic and execution and testing and these other pieces. What I had to do is I had to become Voltron. I had to assemble my team of people that have the superpowers that I don\u2019t. I started assembling that team. As soon as I had my Voltron team, I was able to take over the world.\u201d And I think his first year he did $600,000 after he assembled his team. So for all you guys, a big piece of that is, think about that, if it\u2019s Voltron or Power Rangers, it doesn\u2019t matter, pick one of them for the analogy. But the key is, it\u2019s time to start building that out. I need this person and this person. Start figuring that out.</p> <p>Because all of us want to be the owners and think we\u2019re geniuses and all that kind of stuff, but the reality is, okay however good you are, you\u2019re not good at everything. And even if you are good at something, there\u2019s probably people who are better or should be spending time in it. For me, I think about my level 10 opportunity, the only way I was able to step into that level 10 opportunity was by partnering with level 10 people who are also level 10 opportunity. They became my Voltron. I can be the best salesman, marketing dude in the world, but if I don\u2019t have a cool product to sale, what am I going to do?</p> <p>Same thing, I look at Dylan and Todd, who are the co-founders of Clickfunnels, Dylan who has been making amazing stuff from the beginning of time, but he needed a marketing and sales guy. Todd is building amazing things, but he needed that. So it\u2019s like, when we brought our powers together, we\u2019ve got Dylan doing the front end stuff, Todd doing the backend stuff, me doing the marketing and sales, and from there we\u2019ve brought in other people as well and built our own Voltron, inside of a level 10 opportunity. The sky\u2019s been the limit. There\u2019s some analogies for you that I hope help.</p> <p>One cool thing about an analogy, that we learned at Inner Circle from Darin Stevens, he talked about how metaphors and analogy\u2019s speak to the subconscious mind, which is kind of cool when you start thinking about it. The more that I learn about persuasion and speaking more, I understand the subconscious mind. And this is funny for me, because I don\u2019t care about politics, whoever wins\u2026..I don\u2019t know, my belief pattern is, if you\u2019re religious at all, there\u2019s some really good books that have been written by people who are inspired that tell us how things are going to end, and we know it\u2019s not going to end good. It\u2019ll eventually become really, really good, but we gotta go through some really, really bad first. So it\u2019s inevitable, I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s Hillary or Trump, to me it does not matter. We\u2019re going to go through a bunch of crap, and we know how the story ends, so it doesn\u2019t matter to me. So I\u2019m not a big person that cares about politics at all, outside of the fact that I love watching the sales and the techniques behind what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>So anyway, Trump just did this whole speech last week, totally just ripping on Hillary. It was like, the greatest speech of all time, in my humble opinion. Because he was\u2026\u2026it was just awesome. The way he speaks to the subconscious mind is awesome. He never\u2026\u2026he always is associating labels with people, all the time. It\u2019s never, \u201cThis is my opponent, Hillary Clinton.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cHillary the criminal, Hillary the scam artist.\u201d He\u2019s just so shady, but he uses these words with the name so our subconscious mind starts linking these two things together, which is so powerful and so crazy and so cool. It\u2019s just fun to watch. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to win or not, again I don\u2019t really care. It\u2019s entertaining to watch and watch his language patterns.</p> <p>We were talking at the inner circle meeting about, for persuasion, people want to be really good at speaking. You\u2019ve got to learn how to speak at a third grade level. If you look at good copy, the best copywriters, if you look at their sales letter, if you take a look at them, they\u2019re written at a third grade level. When you go above third grade, that\u2019s when it gets too complex, you lose sales. So it\u2019s all about simplicity and dumbing things down, which is kind of cool. Anyway, there\u2019s websites you can go and take a sales letter run through and it\u2019ll say what grade level it\u2019s written at. So people took Donald Trump\u2019s speech and ran it through, a bunch of speeches, and he\u2019s speaking at a third grade level. So he\u2019s speaking correctly, which is amazing. Anyway, a lot of cool stuff.</p> <p>With that said, I think the moral to the story as I\u00a0 get closer and closer to the hotel\u2026 Man, I got 20 minutes before it starts. I always plan incorrectly. I thought this road would move faster, but there\u2019s tons of traffic, so I hope I\u2019m not late to the event. One time we had an event here in Boise, I was driving and I got a ticket on the way and I ended up showing up 15 minutes late to my own event, which was super embarrassing, so I hope I make it there in time. Whoa, I almost just killed the car. Too many things happening at once.</p> <p>Alright, so what was I saying. So my moral of today\u2019s lesson, that I wanted you to kind of think through was, first off figuring out the vehicle that you want to pitch your tent in. What\u2019s the vehicle you\u2019re going to be using? Because if you pick the wrong vehicle, you\u2019re stuck. But if you pick a vehicle where, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a doctor, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. If you\u2019re happy in that vehicle, that\u2019s awesome. I was listening to Gary Vaynerchuk the other day, and he was talking about, \u201cI\u2019m not speaking to people who are content. If you\u2019re content playing video games and eating cheerios all day, good for you man. If that\u2019s the vehicle you picked and you\u2019re happy there, you should be happy, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d I wish I was better at being fulfilled. There\u2019s a Tony Robins talks about the science of achievement, and then the art of fulfillment. Science of achievement, science is very step by step, so any of us achieve anything in life can figure out the science. There are the steps to go and achieve this thing. Then the other side, is the art of fulfillment. So how do we become fulfilled? That\u2019s not a science, that\u2019s a way harder, more complicated thing, especially for entrepreneurs, to feel fulfilled because we\u2019re always wanting and seeking more, and trying to get more. So kind of like Gary Vaynerchuk, if you\u2019re fulfilled, good for you man. Don\u2019t listen to anything I\u2019m saying, because if you\u2019re fulfilled and happy, that\u2019s awesome. Good for you. But if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s probably the vehicle that you\u2019re in. You\u2019re sitting in, I can\u2019t even think of a bad car, what\u2019s a crappy car? You\u2019re sitting in a Volvo and you want to drive 100 miles an hour, it\u2019s probably not going to happen, that thing\u2019s going to break down. But if you\u2019re in a Volvo and you\u2019re like, \u201cDude, I just want to drive around my town.\u201d Done, if you\u2019re happy there, don\u2019t worry about changing the vehicle. But if you\u2019re not happy that what you got to work out, change the vehicle.</p> <p>Then the big part of the change the vehicle, often times, maybe you can\u2019t drive it by yourself. So you gotta start building out your Voltron team. So those are my two big takeaways, hopefully for today for you guys. Change the vehicle and build out your team of superstars. So that\u2019s what I got. Anyway, I\u2019m going to bounce. I appreciate you guys. Thanks for listening, this is an 18 minuter. You get long sessions when I\u2019m not driving to my office. We\u2019re moving to a new office that\u2019s like 3 minutes away from my house if I\u2019m walking, actually it\u2019s a little bit longer than that. But still, you guys may get really short Marketing In Your Cars. I\u2019m going to start walking so I can talk for 5 minutes, which would be awesome. Alright, with that said, appreciate you all, have an amazing day. I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "20:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_243.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1466716420, "title": "Episode #242 \u2013 Behind The Scenes Of My Three Hour Funnel", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What really happened to get SnapFunnels.com launched.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how he went from one Snapchat follower to over a thousand in under 24 hours.

I\u2019m excited to be with you here for longer than 10 seconds on a special edition of Marketing In Your Car. Hey everyone, so yes, yes. I\u2019ve been going a little Snapchat crazy for the last little bit, and I\u2019m excited to be on a platform where I can talk to you for a little longer than 10 seconds. Anyway, as you guys know, I got intro\u2019d to Snapchat a little while ago, a couple of days ago, and wanted to try it out. Did the first day and thought it was really fun. I thought it was actually a really good platform for me. Especially with next week we got some crazy stuff.</p> <p>Next week we\u2019re flying out Ty Lopez is doing a webinar for us, I\u2019m flying out and hanging out at the mansion for a day. Dude, just kind of get some people excited about that webinar, which will be cool. After that, we\u2019re going and Marcus Lemonis is having us on The Profit, crazy, crazy, crazy. So we are going to be filming a part, I\u2019m going to be in the episode building funnels for people. So we are going mainstream, funnels are becoming mainstream, which is cool. And a bunch of other cool things and I\u2019m like, \u201cHow do I show that to people? I can talk about it post-production in here, Marketing In Your Car, which is fun, I can go into more details and share the cool stuff, but how do I take you behind the scenes, snap by snap. So we\u2019re going to be snapchatting the crap out of that trip along with everything else we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s worth trying to figure out Snapchat, if nothing else, to see behind the scenes of next week, which is going to be amazing. So I think I found out if you go to snapchat.com/add/russellbrunson, I think it adds you directly, or faster or something. Alright so, this is kind of the behind the scenes. I thought Snapchat was cool, did the first snap, had one person watch it, and I was like this sucks, how do you get people? So I got to figure out a way to get people. I was like, what if I just create a page that educates them on why they should be following me and snapping and all that kind of stuff? So I create this page and it kind of goes through what to do and how to do it and all that kind of stuff, which is kind of cool. So then I started promoting that a little bit and we got a little bit of traction by people who already knew what Snapchat was and they jumped on and that was kind of cool. But then it just kind of died real fast. I was like, that was a lot of work, the juice was not worth the squeeze. Now I got 12 people watching my snaps, so that\u2019s not any cooler.</p> <p>And I was like, how do we grow this? As I\u2019m asking myself this question, I want you guys thinking about this for your business as well, so from a podcasting standpoint, from an affiliate program, from a blog, from a Facebook, whatever it is. For me, the question in my head was how do I grow Snapchat faster? And again, I think the process I\u2019m going to walk you guys through is the same process I would be going through if I was asking any of the other questions. How do I grow my affiliate program? How do I grow my podcast? How do I blah, blah, blah? So that\u2019s kind of the thought right? So what I did is I started going back, and this is, and we\u2019re jumping all over the place for the faithful followers of Marketing In Your Car, so if you jump back to the episode where I talked about an epiphany bridge. So I started thinking about what gave me my epiphany to want to actually care about Snapchat? And I was like, for me, it\u2019s cool. A couple of days ago I met Brandon and Kaylin, they showed Snapchat, I was like this is cool and they showed me how they get 20,000 people per snap to watch this thing. I\u2019m like, dang. They put in a year\u2019s worth of effort, but now they get 20,000 views every time they push a button, which is nuts. I don\u2019t know any other platform you can do that on. You can be on informercials and you can\u2019t get 20,000 people to watch at the click of a button. They get 30 a day that 20,000 people watch, it\u2019s pretty cool.</p> <p>So that was kind of my big epiphany. Like wow, if I could build it up that\u2019d be awesome. Then I was like, the only reason I\u2019m getting on Snapchat, is because now I understand the benefit, I\u2019m going to try Snapchat. So I want to see what other people are doing so I can understand how they\u2019re doing it, how they\u2019re engaging. I\u2019m going to follow cool people, so I started following people. Now, it\u2019s funny, I\u2019ll log into Snapchat 50 times a day, refreshing to see if people I\u2019m following posted anything. I\u2019m annoyed when they haven\u2019t. I\u2019m like, crap this is a cool platform because I want to be annoyed. When I\u2019m, this is probably more than you wanted to know, when I\u2019m going to the bathroom I want to see a bunch of snaps from the few people I\u2019m following. If they haven\u2019t posted something I\u2019m annoyed. Dude, wake up you guys. Do something funny. You need to entertain me now.</p> <p>So I was like, crap, this is kind of cool. I can just keep doing stuff and people during their bathroom breaks or whenever, I don\u2019t know when people Snapchat, they can catch up on all the weirdness that we\u2019re doing. I was like this is a cool platform. I need to take people through the same epiphany I had. So we set up snapfunnels.com, that\u2019s what my page was initially telling them how to follow me, but I was like, let\u2019s step back. What if I can get Brandon and Kaylin to give everyone the same epiphany they gave me? So that was my first thought, I was like, cool. This is literally yesterday morning. So then I Vox those guys. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey can I interview you for like 30 minutes talking about Snapchat?\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019re about to jump on a plane, we can\u2019t really do it, unless we do it at this time.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cSweet, let\u2019s do it. We\u2019ll do Google Hangout, We\u2019ll jump on and talk to guys for 30 minutes about Snapchat to give everybody the same epiphany I had. So that\u2019s step number one.</p> <p>Step number two is I\u2019m about to leave my house to come to the office and I\u2019m like, well how am I going to get people to actually want to register to watch this training? I gotta do something different, unique and fun. So what if I Snapchat me selling Snapchat and telling about the epiphany I had with snapchat and then introducing the people that gave me that epiphany. So I\u2019m weaving 20 different marketing things into one, I hope you guys are seeing this. So then I\u2019m\u00a0 like, what am I going to Snapchat? And I was like, with video\u2019s, what does really well is if you\u2019re taking someone on a journey. If you are just you in your office like, \u201cHi, my name is Russell, I\u2019m in my office. Let\u2019s talk about something.\u201d It\u2019s not nearly as powerful as you starting somewhere and taking somebody on a journey and a process with you. It\u2019s kind of like you are taking them on this whole epiphany with you. So I was like, I\u2019m about to go to the office, what if I take them on this journey? \u201cI\u2019m leaving my house, going to the office, talking to Brandon and Kaylin, you guys are kind of going on this journey with me, opt in and you\u2019re going to see the same conversation I\u2019m about to have.\u201d So that\u2019s what I did.</p> <p>I got out Snapchat and I started Snapchatting my whole journey. Me putting my backpack on, walking out the of my house. Getting in the garage deciding do I take the Corvette or do I take the bike? The bike\u2019s way funnier so I took the bike. Me, driving my bike while I\u2019m Snapchatting this message.\u00a0 And then I\u2019m out of wind and it keeps cutting me off because I only get 10 seconds. So instead of trying to be all polished I played off of that, let me complain like 5 times about how short these things are. So I\u2019m taking them on this journey to the office and then I go into the office, go to my desk, and I share what they are going to learn, and I show pictures of Kaylin with her ripped 6 pack abs to make people want to hear what she\u2019s gotta say. So I create this whole video of like 20 or 30 ten second Snapchats, and I\u2019m trying to make it fun and entertaining. I had my brother edit one upside down because I wanted a pattern interrupt because it was like 5 shots in a row of me riding my bike and it just got kind of boring, even though it\u2019s ten seconds at a time. I\u2019m like flip it upside down that way it\u2019s a pattern interrupt so they don\u2019t get bored during the 4 or 5 sessions of me riding on my bike.</p> <p>Anyway, we made this video, honestly on my ride to the office, had my brother edit it, flip that thing around, then we posted it on Youtube. Then I made Snapfunnels.com and posted that Snapchat video of me Snapchatting talking about Snapchat with an opt-in box. Next page then, I had just a really simple process, 1, 2, 3. Number one watch the training from Brandon and Kaylin, so as soon as we did the Googe Hangout, then I put the embed code on that page. Even though Google Hangout dropped 2 or 3 times, we didn\u2019t edit anything. Because I was like, I don\u2019t want to; I just want to go fast and hopefully show people you don\u2019t have to be so polished to make things cool. So we did that. Step two is like, \u201cHey go to this page now to follow me.\u201d So then it takes them to a page I created the day earlier that walks them through how to find me, how to follow me, how to watch my snaps or my story or whatever. I should learn the terminology. Then step three was like, \u201cHey you guys should share Snapfunnels with your audience because if you could educate them on how to do this, then they\u2019ll be more likely to follow you as well. So what I\u2019m going to do is if you share snapfunnels.com then we will give you a share funnel link for this funnel then you can use this funnel for your marketing.\u201d</p> <p>I used a script I\u2019ve been looking at for the last month of so that I thought was cool and I was wanting to use it. It\u2019s called Upviral. It gives a little widget you put on your page, like share this, then you share it, you earn points and things like that. It\u2019s pretty awesome, so we had people go and to get the share funnel link you had to share it on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, I think or something like that. So they share it, boom, boom, boom. After they share it all three places it unlocks and emails them the share funnel link \u00a0for that funnel and now they\u2019ve got that, which puts people into Clickfunnels if they\u2019re not already a Clickfunnels member, which is cool. So we did that whole campaign and by lunch time it was all done. Busted it out on Clickfunnels, got it done, post on Facebook and we started watching it grow. Instantly it started growing, which is cool because I had a meeting right after that, so I wasn\u2019t able to promote it or anything. I just posted on Facebook and people started sharing it and opting in, and sharing it and new people opt in, and it started virally growing on its own, it was crazy.</p> <p>Then last night, finally before I left, I emailed the Clickfunnels list saying, \u201cHey, here\u2019s the Snapchat funnel, go get it for free.\u201d So they could go do that, and then I emailed my list just talking about the title, which is how to ethically build a cult following in Snapchat. Anyway, it\u2019s been cool. It\u2019s been less than 24 hours since we had the idea. We had, I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers, over a thousand people have opted in. It\u2019s growing, people are watching my snaps, it\u2019s starting to grow really fast, it\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>So why did I share that with you? One is because I was kind of recapping in my head, which helps me to get it out, and realize what we did. And number two, that same process you guys could use for anything. Think back about why you started your affiliate program. Think about why you started your podcast, or started your blog. What was the epiphany you got? Create a training video giving people that epiphany and then create a funnel that gets them in the training video, which then gets them to subscribe to your blog, which then gets them blogging, because if they\u2019re blogging they\u2019d be more likely to read your blog. People who write blogs, read blogs. I don\u2019t write a blog, so I don\u2019t read a blog. I only Snapchat because now I Snapchat. So educate people on what you want them to do, or how to do that thing that you\u2019re now doing and then in the process teach them to consume your part of it. And then throw in a viral campaign to make it go viral and see what happens.</p> <p>So there you go. Oh, and also by the way, I could have named this Snapchat Cult Secrets, but I\u2019m the funnel guy right? I talked about this 3 or 4 episodes ago. Funnels has become our thing, so I called it snapfunnels. What does it have to do with funnels? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s Snapchat and there\u2019s funnels and things like that. Anyway, it\u2019s syncs with the branding. Anyway, I hope\u2026.that one little campaign took us three or four hours to put the whole thing together, it turned out amazing and it was all just pieces of the stuff we\u2019ve been sharing through the podcast. So I hope you guys are picking up the gold we\u2019re dropping, because it\u2019s powerful strategy for anyone to build their following. So use it, abuse it. I will be using it and abusing it more. My guess, I\u2019m hoping Dave Woodward who runs our affiliate and our business stuff, is listening to this. Dave, let\u2019s do this for the affiliate program stuff. I have a really cool epiphany story, I haven\u2019t launched our affiliate program, so boom, me and Dave are doing that. It\u2019s done and done and happening. So that\u2019s exciting. We should do it for our podcast, I mean a lot of different ways, maybe we\u2019ll do podcast funnels, actually I\u2019m totally doing that. It\u2019s coming soon to a funnel near you. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day. I\u2019m at the office, time to launch Biohacking secrets, it\u2019s going live today. And also Funnelswag.com is going live today. So we got two cool things happening. So I\u2019m going to go promote the crap out of both of them. So appreciate you all, have a great day and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "13:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_242.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1466465361, "title": "Episode #241 \u2013 A Few Things I\u2019m Doing Today To Help Build My Cult-ure", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today I get to practice what I preach.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about starting to use Snapchat and how you can follow him to get some behind the scenes of the behind the scenes stuff going on with Clickfunnels.

Hey guys and gals and friends and a bunch of people I care about. Today\u2019s been fun; I started my first day of my Snapchat journey. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it right or wrong, or if I\u2019m annoying. I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s been fun. So for those that aren\u2019t Snapchatters yet, time to download the Snapchat app and search my name, it\u2019s Russell Brunson. I think you can find me that way, I believe. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still figuring that part out. I would recommend doing it, because I\u2019m showing behind the scenes. Everyone\u2019s asking me what I do all day long, \u201cWhat\u2019s your morning routine?\u201d So I\u2019m showing it in quick little 10 second chunks. I think that\u2019s how you do it right.</p> <p>Basically the concept is throughout the day I go and as I\u2019m doing cool things, I show the cool things I\u2019m doing. So this morning I woke up, I was in the supplement closet, it showed me taking supplements, which ones. Then I had a morning coaching session with Tara and then I was working my Trello board, so I showed that. Then I went on a run and I showed that. I was about to start this Marketing In Your Car podcast and I showed that. So I\u2019m showing all these little pieces of it, so I think for you guys it\u2019s like once a day, if you log in, you\u2019ll see behind the scenes of behind the scenes.</p> <p>So as you probably, I\u2019ve been talking about lately, one of the big things, we\u2019re trying to do and I think what you guys should all be doing, but what we should all be trying to do is try to get our community more engaged in the process. So we\u2019re doing a lot of hangouts and live streams, showing behind the scenes of what\u2019s happening, which has been fun, but then Snapchat for me is kind of behind the scenes of the behind the scenes in quick little ten second snips. So you can basically catch up on a full day in like 2 minutes.\u00a0 Anyway, it\u2019s going to be fun, I\u2019m going to be posting some unique, cool, crazy, funny things and introducing you to some people that I won\u2019t be doing anywhere else. So if you\u2019re not on Snapchat yet, now is the time to go and to become part of that.</p> <p>Today I\u2019m excited because I\u2019ve been in Inner Circle all last week, and it\u2019s kind of one of those things when you have these projects and things you wanna do and everything\u2019s bottling up and you just want to move and go and do. So finally I have a chance today to move and go and do. I\u2019m excited. We are, this week launching Biohacking Secrets with Anthony which will be cool. But then the other thing, on our side, we have a whole bunch of new updates coming, with just our company. One of the cool things we\u2019re going to be doing that I\u2019m excited for is, and depending on when you hear this, it\u2019ll be live or almost live, we\u2019re changing the Clickfunnels Facebook Group. People don\u2019t like really bonding with the company, it\u2019s kind of bland, so we want to make it more of a movement. So we\u2019re going to change the name of it to Funnel Hackers/Clickfunnels official group or something like that. So that way we can all self \u2013identify with the group and who we are, and not just the software product, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>And then what\u2019s going to happen is when you first login, and the first time I really saw this I thought it was cool. There\u2019s a Facebook group called the Cult of Copy, it\u2019s a really good copywriting group with really good copywriters hanging out and talking all the time and when you go in that group, Colin, who runs the group, Colin Theriot, I think I can never say his last name right\u2026.but he\u2019s got a sticky when you first go in there that\u2019s like, \u201cHey welcome to the Cult of Copy, here\u2019s all the rules, here\u2019s how it works, here\u2019s the lingo, here\u2019s the core products you need to buy.\u201d Just a list of all the core things when you first join the group. So that\u2019s one of my goals this week, is to build out, maybe even today if I have time. Kind of like, \u201cHere\u2019s the mission statement of our group, here\u2019s the core products and services you need to be able to run your business.\u201d And the cool thing we set up, and it\u2019s not live as of right now, but hopefully by the time you hear this, it\u2019ll be live. If you go to funnelswag.com we have an official Funnel Hackers Kit where you get a Clickfunnels backpack, you get the Funnel Graffiti, you get the I Build Funnels t-shirt, Clickfunnels water bottle. Everything you need to be an official funnel hacker. So basically, I think it\u2019s $100, it basically covers our hard costs and shipping, we\u2019re not making any money on this, we just want to get everyone a Biohacking, not Biohacking, a Funnel Hacking Kit.</p> <p>So we\u2019ll mail this kit to you, and then from there you get put on a $20 a month continuity program. The $20 a month goes towards a new t-shirt each month. So what\u2019s happening, each month we\u2019re making super cool t-shirts. In fact, if you go to funnelswag.com you can see 5 or 6 of the shirts there. And basically, we\u2019re going to be doing limited edition shirts. So each month, whoever\u2019s a member of that, we will see who\u2019s bill went through that month and we will ship you out that month\u2019s shirt. And they\u2019re going to be one off printing. So that means if you get it, you get it. If you don\u2019t get it, you miss that shirt forever. So there\u2019s some urgency and scarcity built in, because I believe the only that sells anything in this world, besides good copy, and building a good following and personality, there\u2019s a lot of good things. But the number one thing to actually get people to pull their credit card out are urgency and scarcity, so we kind of want to do that. Again, I make zero dollars, in fact, I lose money, I think I lose money on almost all of these because we have so many international people. But I just want to do it so that you guys all have cool funnel swag from us every single month. We also might be slipping in some other cool gifts along the way with the t-shirts. I\u2019m not going announce those, they\u2019re unadvertised bonuses, but cool things you guys will want as a Clickfunnels member.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of what Funnel Swag is all about, is getting you guys all consuming our stuff, wearing our shirts, using our backpacks, water bottles, Mac stickers, oops, did I slip that? We\u2019re working on Mac stickers and a bunch of other cool things for you guys that\u2019ll be part of the Funnel Swag Monthly Kit. For sure, each month you\u2019ll get a t-shirt that will be limited edition and just super cool. Anyway, these are just a few of the things we\u2019re doing, and I hope that it serves as a model for you guys as you\u2019re building up your community and your following and your cult\u2026ture.</p> <p>That was one of the big things through all of the Inner Circle meetings, was that, as I kind of mentioned through some of these podcasts. So I\u2019m going to start implementing and applying these things and you guys will be able to see them and hopefully you\u2019ll run with them as well. I think I mentioned this before, I see my mission as building cool, creative things and you guys taking them and knocking them off for your community. So feel free to R and D, rip off and deploy these concepts in your market as well, for your people because I think they\u2019re kind of cool.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. I\u2019m really, really, really excited as you can probably tell, to get to work and to do all these kinds of things. Another cool update, we got last week the float tank in my Biohacking room, so Saturday I wasn\u2019t supposed to float for 3 or 4 days, you\u2019re supposed to let the salt do whatever, but I got excited so the second day I jumped in and floated, is that the right word? Flooted? Floated? So I floated and it was cool, I laid there for 20 minutes and I passed out and woke up 3 hours later. It was almost 1 in the morning and I was getting out and Collette came out like, \u201cI thought you were dead, I was afraid that you had drowned out here.\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to drown because there\u2019s a thousand pounds of salt in there to make you float to the top, so I don\u2019t think I could drown if I wanted to.\u201d But I appreciated the thought so, that was cool. And then yesterday was Father\u2019s Day, which was super cool. I don\u2019t know, my kids are the coolest, just seeing them. One of my boys, he drew a big picture of a minion and said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re one in a minion.\u201d It was so awesome. And then my other son drew a big picture of Yoda and it said, \u201cDad, Yoda best dad ever!\u201d It was so sweet. I thought that was the two coolest things in the world.\u00a0 Anyway, it was a good day. With that said, I am almost to the office. I\u2019m going to get to work. I\u2019m building up our community and I hope this gives you guys a couple ideas on things you can do as well. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys again soon.</p>", "duration": "09:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_241.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1466201567, "title": "Episode #240 \u2013 One Little Golden Nugget", "author": "", "summary": "<p>One cool trick I picked up from the mastermind.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about a little nugget of good information he received at the Inner Circle Mastermind group. He also tells a story of something cool he did twice at the mastermind.</p> <p>Here are some fun things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What part of the mastermind group made Russell have his \u201cah ha\u201d moment, and why he thinks nobody else caught it.</li> <li>How this simple golden nugget will change some of the ways he does things.</li> <li>And why he wrote one of the Inner Circle member\u2019s webinar pitch.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out what simple golden nugget Russell got out of the mastermind group.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everybody, well not everybody, just the important people that actually listen to this podcast, good morning. Welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey, hey everybody, we survived another 4 days jam-packed Inner Circle smack down, it was amazing. It was legitimately amazing. So instead of bragging about it, so those that aren\u2019t in feel guilty that they didn\u2019t make it in, I just wanted to say it was awesome and I appreciated everyone who came and played full out. It was really, a great 4 days.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m at the end of that and I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m worn out and my body is shot. And one thing that\u2019s funny, when I used to go to masterminds, when they\u2019re not your own, you can kind of pay attention or dose off, or whatever. But when it\u2019s your own, you gotta be present all the time. So unfortunately I had to use a little too much caffeine this week just to keep pure, perfect focus. So I\u2019m going to be detoxing my body for the next few days so I can get all the caffeine out of my system. Because even, it\u2019s weird during the middle of the night you\u2019ll wake up and you\u2019re like, \u201cI should be so tired and I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Anyway, it\u2019s weird. So I am detoxing from caffeine, so if I go through withdrawals, if I start crying on one of these meetings with you guys, that\u2019s why. Just joking.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m heading in right now, about to do the second episode of Friday Funnels, which is exciting. I hope you guys come and check it out. I hope you guys come participate in it. We had a lot of fun. I talked about last week, I hope that you guys, if you haven\u2019t done a Friday Funnel yet, or a Funnel Friday, or whatever it is for your business, something like that, it was really fun. We did 30 minutes, put a countdown clock and then tried to build a funnel as fast I could and everyone was watching and going crazy and it turned out really cool. It was a great\u2026.it was a lot of fun for the cult community and everything, so that was really, really cool.</p> <p>The interesting thing I wanted to talk to you about today, and this is one of the more simple nuggets that I kind of picked up from this weekend, but it was one of those simple nuggets that I needed. Because sometimes in my head I get things over complicated, I get excited and I try to build super complex things. I think that for most people, I\u2019m still, my funnels and my concepts and my process flows are still pretty simple. I\u2019ve seen some of your guys stuff, you send me over my maps and things and they\u2019re insane. I open them up and I just want to go back to bed because they\u2019re so stressful. So mine are pretty simple, but I still have some things happening. And a couple of things, one thing I shared in the mastermind was about, in Clickfunnels now, when you join Clickfunnels, there\u2019s a 21 day ignite your funnel process that we take people through. Basically each day you get a short 3 to 5 minute video and I give you one task to do over 21 days. There\u2019s a whole bunch of reasons and strategy behind it, and I\u2019m not going to go into it now, its outside the context of this podcast, but it help reduce our churn by almost double digits. It was insane. It got people consuming our software and a whole bunch of other really cool things.</p> <p>So I was like, man that would be cool if someone came into Clickfunnels and go through this big indoctrination process, they start using our software, consuming, we help build a relationship with them, it\u2019s just really powerful and a really cool strategy. So then one of the couples in the Inner Circle, Brandon and Kaylin, they\u2019re in the weight loss space. They\u2019ve been doing perfect webinar, they\u2019re crushing it, they\u2019ve been doing Periscope webinar, just like I talked about with you guys 50 episodes ago, they killed it on that twice now. They\u2019re just, they\u2019re doers, they\u2019re cool, I just really enjoy them and watching them. One thing that was cool that I saw that they were doing, they have their Facebook Live\u2019s where they\u2019re promoting a webinar on Facebook Live, they\u2019re promoting a product or something like that, but in between they\u2019re doing a lot of cool training stuff. And so she talks about a cool concept, and at the end of it she\u2019s like\u2026\u2026oh wow, I just drove by this truck that\u2019s jacked up on a\u2026..that was really weird. Sorry. A.D.D\u2026.</p> <p>Okay, so they do these things and they just push to the end, and I can\u2019t remember the\u2026.dangit, they\u2019re going to kill me for not knowing this, but they have a domain name, it\u2019s something like freefaststart.com, or faststartweightloss or something like that. And they\u2019re like, \u201cHey go get your free fast start guide. Go right now.\u201d And they always push people to this free thing, which is an opt-in. People opt-in and they go through their on-boarding indoctrination process through email. I think last month they got 50 thousand opt-in\u2019s through that little channel, which is crazy. I was like, right now I have all these other squeeze pages, I\u2019m driving people to all these places and all sorts of stuff, which is good, but what if I had just one squeeze page that I focused on instead of 20 and that was the goal to get people into that.\u00a0 So I think I bought freefunnelfaststart.com or something like that. I probably should check out the domain names before I promote them live. It\u2019s something like that; it\u2019s not live yet anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter. So that\u2019s kind of the thing and I\u2019m going to use that as a call to action in everything that\u2019s not selling an actual product. So it\u2019ll always be pushing everyone into that.</p> <p>And then my thought is treating that kind of like, doing an indoctrination process when someone joins Clickfunnels that I\u2019m doing to my list. I need to take them through an indoctrination process, which is similar to what we talked about with soap opera sequence, those type of things. But I was like, we\u2019ve got a big product range and in my mine, there\u2019s an order that people should consume our products, so I\u2019m going to use that and make this really fun, exciting. I don\u2019t know how many days it\u2019ll be, 20, 40, 50 days, but walking them through this concept. Some will be teaching, some will be referencing, \u201cHey go get the book.\u201d \u201cHey get on this webinar.\u201d Or something, and push them through our product line and product offerings, while teaching, educating along the way and using it like a funnel fast start. Here\u2019s the fast start. Come through this process. Now everyone who enters my world goes through this process, they get indoctrinated, they go through my soap opera sequence, they build the relationship with me as the attractive character, but the time they end the process, then they can come in our normal, Seinfeld sequences. They\u2019ve been indoctrinated; they\u2019ve kind of gone through this really cool process.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s not something new. We talked about it in the Dotcom Secrets book, taking you through a soap opera sequence, but I think that after doing it as a consumption sequence, after somebody joins Clickfunnels and they see the power of the 21 day, daily chunked out videos, I think I\u2019m going to use that in our actual email sequence and then make that become the core focus of where we try to drive all the traffic. So, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m excited. I\u2019ll be testing it out and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be bragging about it as we go through. But that\u2019s kind of the one little nugget, again it\u2019s one of those little tiny things they just mentioned in passing and I bet most people didn\u2019t even catch it in the group, but I was like, \u201cWhoa.\u201d You know that feeling when someone says something and it wasn\u2019t the big aha, but you have the big aha and everyone else is just quiet and you\u2019re seeing this thing, everything starts, all these connections start being made instantly. That\u2019s kind of what happened in my head. So I\u2019m trying to explain the connections here, I have no idea if I explained it right or if the connections will make your connections. But it was super cool.</p> <p>Anyway, there\u2019s just one little nugget, I hope that was useful for you guys. Alright now, last thing because I\u2019m about one minute away from the office. I was really nervous about this last Inner Circle group, because we had less people just because of circumstance, but a bunch of overseas people in that group that couldn\u2019t make it, things like that. But what was cool, because of that we had a little less time, or a little more time. So we gotta do some extra sessions, which was cool. So I did some training sessions and then twice we had people who were kind of working on webinars, they just weren\u2019t quite hitting it yet, so instead of just trying to coach them through and then move on to the next person, I was like, \u201cAlright.\u201d And I jumped out of my seat and walked up to the front. I sketched out their whole webinar and then I pitched the webinar for them live. I did it twice and it was cool. I think it was cool, I thought it was cool. But we basically just built the entire webinar for them and they gotta watch me pitch it and they recorded it and then had this tool that they could go pitch. So it was pretty cool.</p> <p>I\u2019m curious how many of you guys would pay me a crap-ton of money to just write your webinar pitch and then pitch it for you real quick and then you guys can just copy my pitch. That\u2019d be pretty cool actually. Alright I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to bounce and get back to work, and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "09:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_240.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1466115079, "title": "Episode #239 \u2013 To Snap Or Not To Snap", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My thoughts on building your culture every 10 seconds.</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about his current Inner Circle Mastermind Group and how one of the members convinced him to use Snapchat.

Hey everyone, I hope you are all doing amazing. I am heading into day number 4 of our Inner Circle Mastermind. Actually, technically it\u2019s day number 8. We did 2 groups last month and we had 2 groups this month. And then we will have gone through all 100 people in our Inner Circle, which is pretty cool. We\u2019ve had a really good time.</p> <p>I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m a little worn out. It\u2019s a lot of work when you have back to back mastermind groups, but it\u2019s how we roll. It\u2019s been fun though, the first group was a little bit bigger, we had a few more people in that one, which was cool. It was just fun, a lot of the people I have been working with through Voxer and stuff like that, remotely for a long time. Had a chance to sit down and actually hang out with them for 2 days. A couple of them, this will be day 4, they kind of hung out for the whole time, which has been so much fun.</p> <p>And it\u2019s interesting just watching\u2026.I feel like everybody in the room has a superpower. But everybody\u2019s superpower is different, so it\u2019s so cool when you get everyone in a room like and there\u2019s this overlap where it\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m really good at this, but I\u2019m really bad at these things.\u201d And there\u2019s always somebody in the room who\u2019s really good at the thing you\u2019re bad at, and it\u2019s just the coolest, I don\u2019t even know how to explain it. I guess it\u2019s probably where they get the name Mastermind Group from. I think the story behind that, if I remember right, it was\u2026.I can\u2019t remember if it was\u2026..it was in Think and Grow Rich, right? I haven\u2019t read that book for forever, I think decades. Dang, I\u2019m getting old. Anyway, in that book, I think it was Henry Ford, or was it Napoleon, I don\u2019t remember, but it was someone. Telling the story about how they were interviewing, I think it was Henry Ford, I could be completely wrong, don\u2019t quote me. But the concept of the story is right. Basically they were saying, I think someone was interviewing them or something and they were kind of mad, because he was this rich dude who wasn\u2019t that smart, and they\u2019re like, \u201cHe\u2019s not that good at anything.\u201d And after 4 or 5 times of quizzing him he was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Finally he\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what, what I have is a mastermind group of people that any question that you asked me, I can get the answer within 1 person, because of the mastermind group of people who I surrounded myself with.\u201d</p> <p>And I think that\u2019s where people started calling things mastermind and stuff like that, but it\u2019s true. In this group, at least for me, every one of my problems can and will be solved. Because while I\u2019m really good at a few things, everyone else is good at a lot of other things I\u2019m not, so we can leverage that and share the things that I\u2019m good at. And they can share the things they\u2019re good at and we can all win together. It\u2019s very amazing. I honestly, I feel so, and I\u2019ve said this probably every time I\u2019ve done a podcast during Inner Circle, I can\u2019t believe I get paid to facilitate this whole thing. It\u2019s nuts. I\u2019m learning the coolest things. In fact, finally somebody, Kaylin, she is one of my Inner Circle members, she runs\u2026..anyway, they\u2019re crushing it, they\u2019ve been here the last 3 days and they are coming back in tomorrow, or today I guess. My brain.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019ve been very hesitant to Snapchat because I think it\u2019s stupid, and she convinced me that it\u2019s not stupid, that it\u2019s actually awesome. So now I think it\u2019s awesome. So I\u2019m going to start Snapchatting here soon. And I\u2019ve got a whole process and a method behind it. One of the themes from last Inner Circle and this one that I\u2019ve been trying to talk to everyone about is how to build your own cult, I mean culture. Cult is the root word of culture. So how to build your own cult, how to build your own culture, how to build your own community, whatever you want to call it. So we\u2019re sharing all sorts of things like that, and one of the big things I was talking about was letting your cult in behind the scenes of what you\u2019re doing. I think that\u2019s part of why Marketing In Your Car has been adopted so well. Because everyday I\u2019m just talking about what we\u2019re doing and sharing stuff and just giving it all away and people like that. The Periscopes and Facebook Live and we\u2019re doing this new reality show thing we\u2019re filming. All these pieces, people just want to see behind the scenes of what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>It\u2019s like the reality show is cool. We\u2019re taking 2 weeks of time and chunking it down to 30 minute episode, so you\u2019re seeing pieces of it. Snapchat was cool because, I finally got it. It was like, a reality show behind the scenes every single day of all the little aspects of what\u2019s happening, in 10 second increments. So I\u2019m really excited to start focusing on that and growing that. So you\u2019ll see me, hopefully next week, start this out, but starting the process of really focusing on the building of a Snapchat following because I was want to bring people into the cult. Brent just passed me. I\u2019m driving to the Inner Circle meeting and Brent just drove by honking. If you listen back a few episodes, Brent was the same one who got into a wreck on his way to one of the Inner Circle meetings. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t follow him.</p> <p>Anyway, for everyone, if you haven\u2019t been sold on Snapchat yet, it\u2019s just a really cool way to get your really hyper-active fans the ability to see a glimpse of everything that\u2019s happening throughout your day. I was watching one or two where people snap 800 times a day, which I think is stupid, but I think if you do 10 a day and you\u2019re taking people through the progress. \u201cHey, picking which supplements I want.\u201d Boom. \u201cIn the car driving, about to start my podcast.\u201d Boom, \u201cAt the office, about to start working on this funnel.\u201d Boom, \u201cFunnel got done.\u201d Boom, \u201cHeading to a meeting.\u201d\u00a0 Just showing little 10 second clips of the process of your day and sharing those with people.</p> <p>Again, it\u2019s like the behind the scenes. It\u2019s building the culture. One of the things I keep stressing with everyone here in the mastermind is just if your customers perceive you as \u201cOh, there\u2019s this guy and there\u2019s his company.\u201d Then that\u2019s not the right thing. What we need to be focusing on is getting our people to say, \u201cthis is our company.\u201d I want our customers to feel like Clickfunnels is their company. Like they are part of this. They are part of this movement. They\u2019re part of this cult. They\u2019re part of this culture. Whatever you want to call, we want them to feel like they\u2019re part of it. I want them to feel like Clickfunnels is their business. This is their platform. This is their home where they build their company. I don\u2019t want this to be Russell\u2019s company. I want this to be our company. That\u2019s the big thought.</p> <p>So the more you can let people in behind the scenes, the more they feel part of what you\u2019re doing and not looking at what you\u2019re doing, if that makes sense. Anyway, I think that\u2019s kind of my big thing I wanted to share with you guys today, because I think it\u2019s interesting and exciting and cool. It\u2019s just figuring out more ways to shift it from, this is Russell\u2019s company, to this is our company. And I want all of our customers feel like it\u2019s theirs. And I\u2019d love for you guys to discuss this. In fact, come over to our Clickfunnels group and let\u2019s talk about it. Come hang out and say, \u201cHey I listened to Russell\u2019s episode, and these are things I\u2019m trying to do to build my cult, or culture.\u201d Or whatever you want to call it. But things you\u2019re letting in people behind the scenes, how you\u2019re doing it. You\u2019re talking to people about other things to build that building and language patterns. You\u2019re going to see some cool stuff next week in the Clickfunnels group. We\u2019re working more on changing it from the Clickfunnels group, first off, to the Funnel Hacker group. People identify themselves in our culture as funnel hackers and they are and you are part of a community. It\u2019s not just, \u201cOh I use Clickfunnels.\u201d No it\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m a funnel hacker. This is my identity. This is who I am, I build funnels.\u201d If you look at the t-shirts we\u2019ve launched, they\u2019re all focused on that, identity based. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to build. So anyway, hope that gets the wheels in your head spinning, because that\u2019s what my wheels have been spinning on and it\u2019s really fun and I really enjoy it. Alright, well I\u2019m pulling in the parking lot for the mastermind. So I\u2019m out of here. Appreciate you all and we will talk soon.</p>", "duration": "09:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_239.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1465856716, "title": "Episode #238 \u2013 Just Be Competent", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I\u2019d prefer you to be amazing, but can you at least be competent?</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell rants about some incompetent people he\u2019s come across while trying to improve his yard.

Alright, so I was not planning on doing a podcast today, but I am so shocked at people\u2019s incompetence. I just wanted to share something with you guys. I\u2019m going to give you the moral first, and the story later. So the moral of the story is this: Just be competent. That\u2019s it. It shouldn\u2019t be that hard, just be competent. Be competent in your job. You do it all day, every single day. You don\u2019t have to be amazing, you don\u2019t have to be phenomenal, I hope you try to be, but at least just be competent, it\u2019s not that hard.</p> <p>Oh man, It should be a lesson for all people everywhere. Alright so the back story. So today is Saturday, my kids wanted to camp, actually this is kind of funny, because this story is actually someone else being incompetent on top of it. So my kids wanted to go camping last night, so we had a camp fire outside our house, which was cool and we set up the tent and slept outside, and it was a really good time. And as I woke up this morning and looked out over the field next to my house and it has grown huge and I thought, you know what, today I\u2019m going to go rent a mower like I did last year and just mow these weeds down. Because that sounds like a fun thing to do on a Saturday. So I call up Tate\u2019s rental I\u2019m like, \u201cHey guys this is the deal. I want to rent the same mower I rented last time.\u201d Actually at first I said, \u201cI need to rent a weed mower.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cAlright do you want a blah blah, or a blah blah?\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cDo you want this or this?\u201d I don\u2019t know the difference. I was like, \u201cI have a huge field. I have tall weeds that I need to mow down. What do you recommend?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201coh you need this kind.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I rented last year, is that the same? I want the same thing as last year.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYep, done.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, cool. Do I need to reserve it?\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s like yeah, you need to reserve it because people check these things out all the time.\u201d So I was like, \u201cOkay, cool. Reserve me.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen are you going to be here?\u201d I said, \u201cThirty minutes.\u201d \u201cCool, see ya in thirty minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Jumped in the car, drive on down and get to Tates. I walk in, go to the front desk dude. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey man, I\u2019m here to pick up my mower thing.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I told him my name. He\u2019s like, \u201cUh, the mower\u2019s not back yet.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThe mower\u2019s not back.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBack from where?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cFrom the person who already has it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI reserved it, therefore it should be here for me.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWell there\u2019s no mower here?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m here and I came to pick it up and I reserved it, do you have another mower? And he\u2019s like, \u201cNope, there\u2019s no other one\u2019s here.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cIf you come back in 2 hours the guy should have the mower back.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, I don\u2019t need it in 2 hours, I need it today, that\u2019s why I called ahead, that\u2019s why I reserved it, that\u2019s why I came down, because I need it today, I need it right now. That\u2019s why I reserved it, that\u2019s why I drove all the way across town to come get it from you.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, sorry man. If you come back in 2 hours.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cSo there\u2019s no other thing I can rent from here that can chop down weeds. I got huge weeds and I need to chop them down.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNope, nothing else.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, the guy on the phone told me there were a bunch of them here and I need to come down before some people got them.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, nothing here man.\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019m starting to get Russell angry, which is like, I wanted to start throwing fists and stuff. And then the guy from across the table\u2019s like, \u201cHey why don\u2019t you just give him one of the other one\u2019s? Those guys haven\u2019t picked up theirs yet.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you kidding me? So there\u2019s a whole bunch of them out there and I\u2019m the first one here, I had one reserved and you\u2019re reserving it for somebody else that hasn\u2019t even showed up yet? And because of that you\u2019re telling me they aren\u2019t even here.\u201d Oh man, I was like\u2026\u2026So the guy\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, I guess I could do that.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you freaking kidding me? So they were there, somebody else reserved them, but you were holding them for someone else who had reserved them, even though I had reserved one, for somebody else is coming in the future, because apparently you thought that person was more important than me for whatever reason.\u201d Anyway, all this was going through my head as I\u2019m sitting there angrily staring at this guy and I was like, just be competent. This is your job. I saw you last year when I was here. You should know how these things work. You don\u2019t have to be good at your job, just be competent. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for you to do.</p> <p>And then I go out there to do the thing and they haul the thing over to me and it\u2019s not the same one, it\u2019s half the size as the other one. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, this is half the size.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201dThe one you got last year is broken.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t someone tell me that an hour ago when I called you on the phone trying to get that specific one?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d And he brings it out and is kind of standing there. And I\u2019m like, \u201cSo do you have a trailer for it?\u201d\u00a0 and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you need a trailer?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah! I\u2019m not going to carry this thing on my hands. Normally they come with a trailer, the one I rented last year came with a trailer.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s because it was bigger.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, well\u2026..\u201d I\u2019m just like, this is what you guys do for a living. Wouldn\u2019t the guy at the front desk have been like, \u201cHey do you need a trailer? Because most people do.\u201d Instead of just assuming I did.\u00a0 There you go you guys. Just be competent, it\u2019s not that hard. This is what you do for a living. Just think through it. Look at it from the customer\u2019s perspective.</p> <p>Another good example of incompetency as it relates to my field. We were trying to get rid of the Goat-heads in this field, there\u2019s millions of Goat-heads, some of you guys call them prickers, different names for those little things that you step on and they jam into your feet and it hurts really bad. So right now, if my kids will walk in the field, if you take one step in the field you fill your foot up with like 15 of these Goat-heads in your feet. It\u2019s horrible. So I\u2019m trying to get rid of the Goat-head problem. So I hired this dude to come and to scrape the top 2 inches of dirt off, put it in a dump truck and take it away and therefore Goat-heads will be gone and I can then poison the crap out of the ground and make sure nothing ever grows back, right. So we call the dude, I\u2019m like, \u201cHey this is what I want.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo you need to rototill them under.\u201d And I was like, \u201cDude the Goat-heads that are stabbing our feet are seeds, therefore if I roto them under they will be planting seeds and more will grow.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how it works. Even if it\u2019s not how it works, I don\u2019t care, I want the Goat-heads gone and I want you to scrape the top 2 inches of soil off my property, dump them in a dump truck and take them away from here so they disappear forever. That\u2019s all I want. I don\u2019t care about\u2026..this is me as a customer. I want to pay you anything you want to make this thing happen.\u201d</p> <p>And so the guy comes out and he\u2019s like, \u201cWell the weeds are too long.\u201d Actually he didn\u2019t come out first, I knew the weeds were too long, so we hired goats. I think I did a podcast on this. We brought these goats in, they came for a week, they ate all the food down, it was awesome. The kids had a good time; the field is now down to nothing, the perfect time to come in and scrape the field off. So we call the dude, have him come scrape and he says, \u201cWell I need to come see the field first.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, cool.\u201d So he comes and he looks at said field, looks around, surveys it and comes back with a quote saying, \u201cBased on the size and everything in this field, this is the quote.\u201d I said, \u201cCool, come out and scrape this and dump it. \u201c and he says, \u201cOkay I\u2019ll be out next week.\u201d</p> <p>The next week comes, he decides not to show up, for whatever reason. His own excuse. So he doesn\u2019t show up. So now we\u2019re a week past goats being here and the fields are growing faster, so I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, you gotta hurry because the freaking weeds are growing back. Come and scrape this, before I have to hire goats again to come scrape this thing down.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOkay I\u2019m coming.\u201d So then he comes out the next week with his tractors to do what I\u2019d paid him to do. And then he calls Melanie on the phone, the first thing he does\u2026Melanie\u2019s my assistant. Calls Melanie on the phone, the first thing he does is start complaining about the weeds are too long, I can\u2019t take anything away. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou have to come and mow these weeds down and I can come and actually pull them away.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre iyou kidding me? Are you incompetent? Are you seriously this incompetent? Two weeks ago you were here, the weeds were gone. That\u2019s the first thing. They\u2019re tall now because you didn\u2019t show up when we hired you to show up, so it\u2019s kind of your issue now, not mine.\u201d Then he comes back and says, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the field was this big. It\u2019s going to be a lot more money.\u201d I said, \u201cHow did you not realize the field was this big? You came two weeks ago and measured it. Based on your measurements you gave me a quote. How incompetent can you possibly be? It doesn\u2019t make any logical sense to me. You came and measured it with your own measuring stuff, it wasn\u2019t me giving you a quote of what I thought it was, it was you coming and looking at it and giving me a quote based on what you saw.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, it was just two or three things and finally I was like, \u201cThis guy is incompetent. Let\u2019s fire him.\u201d And we fired him. It\u2019s just like, I don\u2019t want people\u2026..I mean I like for people to be good at their job, I like people to be great at their job. But I need them to at least be competent at their job. That\u2019s it. And this goes for; my guess is if you\u2019re listening to this, you\u2019re probably competent. But I guarantee there\u2019s people on our team who aren\u2019t. For example, at our Funnel Hacking Live Event, I found out some of the employees on my team are incompetent and it drives me crazy. We had one who\u2026.there was a\u2026.the person\u2019s job was to check people in, and if they didn\u2019t have a nametag just see if they had a nametag or whatever and print a nametag. The only role the person on my team was to do was just that. So there\u2019s someone who came in, who had a mistake so we had to make their name badge. So instead of being like, \u201cHey, this is my job. I\u2019m here anyway. I got nothing else to do and I\u2019m sitting here behind a chair, playing my iPad and my only role is if someone comes up to do this.\u201d And it was like complaining, and rude to the customer, all sorts of things like that. And then the next day, someone forgot their nametag at their hotel room, which is 45 minutes away. He came in like, \u201cHey I need a nametag.\u201d So instead of being like, \u201cOh, cool. Yes, I remember you. Let me help serve you.\u201d It was like this huge problem and why they were so upset and pissed off and saying, \u201cYou have to go back to the hotel and get it before you can walk through the door.\u201d And all these things.</p> <p>So I\u2019m hearing about this from somebody else. Someone on my team is treating one of our customers this way and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy are you incompetent. Your only job is to serve our people and not be a horrible person to them. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t even have to be good at it, you just have to do it. Just smile, even a half smile, doesn\u2019t have to be a whole smile, just a half smile and help people. That\u2019s it. Do you not see me on stage killing myself to give a good experience to everybody? And when you come in and just do a stupid thing like that, it looks\u2026\u2026.ugh.\u201d Just be competent. There\u2019s the moral of today\u2019s lesson. Just be competent. And if you got employees in your team, you\u2019re fearful might not be competent. Maybe they\u2019re good, maybe they\u2019re not be great, let them listen to this and say, \u201cHey just be competent. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d And after you\u2019re competent, then become good at your job, and after you\u2019re good, then focus on becoming great. And after you\u2019re great, when you\u2019re great, when you\u2019re a A Player people will pay you whatever you want. So there you go. Quit being incompetent. that\u2019s what I got. I\u2019m going to go mow my lawn because that\u2019s what I want to do today. It\u2019s going to be fun. And hopefully I\u2019ll find someone competent to help me get these Goat-heads out of my yard so my kids can play out there in bare feet. So that\u2019s the goal. Still haven\u2019t found the competent players to help me make it possible, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. Alright guys, that\u2019s all I got for you today. Have an amazing time. Have a great weekend and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "12:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_238.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1465593462, "title": "Episode #237 \u2013 Funnel Fridays: A Cool New Way To Sell All Your Stuff", "author": "", "summary": "<p>If this works, this might be my new favorite way to sell.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about Funnel Fridays, a new idea he had and is starting today where he\u2019ll do funnels live for everyone to see.

Hey everybody, today is a special day, it\u2019s a very special day for a lot of reasons. One, it\u2019s Friday, number two is it\u2019s the last day of the hack-a-thon, and number three the most important, is today is the first day ever of Funnel Fridays or Friday Funnels, I can\u2019t remember what we called it. It\u2019s either Funnel Fridays or Friday Funnels. I think it\u2019s Friday Funnels, no Funnel Friday. Oh crap.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019ll learn it more as we keep doing it. But I think I\u2019ve figured out a cool new way to sell stuff that\u2019s going to be really, really, really, really cool. I hope all you guys knock me off because I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the coolest thing ever. If you look at our typical sales process, we\u2019re driving ads, we\u2019re doing stuff and people were coming into the beginning of a funnel, they go through the process and they either buy it or they don\u2019t. And then there\u2019s upsells and their moving from funnel to funnel to funnel and eventually they kind of drop out the back and then they\u2019re people, they get your emails and their doing stuff, but they\u2019re not actively engaged into any kind of sequence. So I\u2019m like, how do you\u2026.what do we do for all those people? Because I\u2019m sure they have money they want to give to us. How do I make them re-inspired to give us money? So that was where this thought came from.</p> <p>If you listen to my whole perfect webinar concept it\u2019s all about doing these webinars weekly and on and on and keep going forward, and doing the same webinar every single week and filling them up with people and keeping that consistently moving forward. And I still believe in it, I still think it\u2019s the model of the future. But after people go through that, when do you ever sell that thing again? Because the reality is a lot of people want to buy stuff, they just didn\u2019t at that time, but they might 3 months later, 6 months later it might reignite them.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s funny back in the day, and I should probably more with my business now, but we had a webinar called Dotcom Secrets Local and we would do our webinar to our own list every three months, and I was like everyone has seen this, I pounded it like crazy three months ago. And we do it and we make the same amount of money as we did three months prior. And we\u2019d do it four times a year, same webinar to our same list and every single time it worked. I was thinking, last year Mike Filsaime did the Clickfunnels webinar 3 times to the same list in one year and every single time he did over a hundred grand in commissions, so two hundred grand total sales. Jason Fladlien just did our webinar twice in the last 4 months. So it\u2019s like, our list will keep buying a lot more than we think, but I think we get bored of it, or we don\u2019t whatever. So we have these limited beliefs. So there\u2019s one thing and the second thing, maybe that\u2019s the third thing now, I can\u2019t remember. The third thing is that I was listening to Pat Flynn a little while ago, maybe a year ago, maybe two years. He was talking about how every Friday he was doing a webinar and people would get on and he would just talk about podcasting and the whole time call to action. Like home shopping network style, he pushed people back to go buy, and pushing them back to go buy, and pushing them back to go buy.</p> <p>So I kept having this idea for a while, this is cool, what if I set up something where every Friday I did something cool, that made people want to come hang out with me and talk, and then in that thing I could home shopping network style sell people. Never blatant like, \u201cHey go buy my crap.\u201d But it could be like, \u201cHere\u2019s me using Clickfunnels.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cI wish I had Clickfunnels.\u201d And then I\u2019m like, \u201cHere\u2019s me using Funnel Scripts.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cFunnel Scripts is awesome.\u201d \u201cOh here\u2019s me using Funnel University.\u201d And they\u2019re like \u201cOh!\u201d and they see inside of me using all of our products and see that, \u201cWow, Russell\u2019s not only\u201d\u2026.what do they say on hair club for men? \u201cNot only the president, but I\u2019m also a member.\u201d They see that I drink my own kool-aid, and see us doing stuff, and it becomes this fun, exciting viral thing that grows and then through that process we get people to buy our stuff every single week and share it with their friends and it becomes viral and all those other fun things associated.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the thought. Today\u2019s day one. And it\u2019s either Funnelfridays.com, or fridayfunnels.com, I can\u2019t remember, but I\u2019ll learn that better and get back to you on it. But basically what I\u2019m doing is there\u2019s a page and at the top of the page is a Google Hangout, I\u2019m doing the Google Hangout live and what we\u2019re going to do, I\u2019m going to build a funnel each week in 30 minutes. I told everybody to ship me their product so a whole bunch of people are over-nighting their products, so this morning I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s going to be a bunch of different boxes in the office when I show up so that I can pick one. So we\u2019re going to pick one and then we\u2019re going to live build out a funnel. I\u2019m going to have a 30 minute countdown clock on the screen, countdown from 30 to 0. And I\u2019ve got to get the funnel done before the clock hits 0. It\u2019s going to be and Jim Edwards is coming on because he\u2019s going to write the scripts in Funnel Scripts. I\u2019m going to be busting out the funnel inside of Clickfunnels. We\u2019re uploading images inside of Funnel University and just\u2026..people are going to see my work floor and how I build funnels, so it\u2019ll be cool.</p> <p>And then down below it\u2019ll be like, \u201cHey get your funnel stuff. Number one, here\u2019s Funnel Hacks, you get a discount, you get Clickfunnels for free for 6 months. Number two, buy Funnel Scripts here. Number three, get Funnel University here.\u201d So it\u2019s pushing them to all of our core offers. It\u2019s kind of funny, back, this is rewind time, it\u2019s pre-podcast, maybe it\u2019s right when the podcast started, I don\u2019t remember. But we were launching this company called Rippln and this is how we grew. We did daily hangouts, which was a nightmare, but we did daily hangouts like this and we\u2019d tell everybody, \u201cHey, we\u2019re coming back tomorrow, bring your teams back.\u201d And every single day people were bringing their teams back, and bringing their teams back and they kept organically growing like that. Now it\u2019s kind of the same thing, we\u2019re going to do this Funnel Fridays each Friday and then we\u2019ll let affiliates promote them. And the coolest thing about doing a hangout is, you do the hangout live but it\u2019s not like if someone misses it live they miss it. Because they can come back to the page anytime after and the things already embedded in there and they can watch it now, all week long the one you just did.</p> <p>So affiliates can promote it all week long and keep getting, it\u2019ll show the most recent episode and then when the new one comes, it just floats out for the new one, so it\u2019s a really cool process. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And then the other thing we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re having crazy success right now with Facebook Live or Facebook Mentions, whatever you call it. So I think we\u2019re going to have a Facebook Mentions or Facebook Live for this Friday Funnel from behind the scenes while I\u2019m doing it, which will hopefully get people more excited because we\u2019ll get Facebook Crew all coming over as well. That\u2019s kind of the game plan. So it\u2019s going to be pretty awesome. Anyway, the good thing is its happening soon. The bad news is its happening in 45 minutes, and I\u2019m late. I was supposed to get to the office an hour and a half ago, I slept in. Now I\u2019ve got 45 minutes to promote it, set it up, figure out what funnel I\u2019m going to build, blah blah blah, and all that other fun stuff. So that\u2019s what\u2019s kind of happening now. I\u2019m really nervous, but really, really excited. Worst case scenario, I totally screw up live in front of everybody. Best case, we inspire some people, get them excited about using our products, they get to see how I build stuff which might inspire them to build more stuff and get them consuming our product. It\u2019s all about operation consumption over here.\u00a0 That\u2019s my goal, is to each Friday consume our product live in front of our audience so they learn how to consume it. \u00a0And I think that\u2019ll be a big difference for us. So that\u2019s what I got you guys. I hope that gives you some ideas for your business, for your products. I think it\u2019s something that any of us and all of us should be doing. But I will set the model, I\u2019ll show it to you guys in the next few weeks, and then I hope you guys copy me, knock it off, use it. Because it\u2019s going to work. Alright, that\u2019s what I got for today. Thanks everybody, I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "08:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_237.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1465423229, "title": "Episode #236 \u2013 Some Interesting Observations During Our Hack-A-Thon", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This hack-a-thon has been different than all the rest.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about some things that he and his team are working on at the hack-a-thon, including building a foundation with the development team to get things moving forward faster, and the decision to rebuild Backpack.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>How Russell\u2019s tendency to over commit is making this week crazy.</li> <li>Why Russell\u2019s team decided to work on Backpack rather than Actionetics.</li> <li>And why the Inner Circle mastermind group will no longer have to rent hotels to get together.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how the hack-a-thon is going and to hear about the exciting new things happening.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hello, hello, hello everybody. This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey everyone, I hope you guys are doing awesome. I am heading into day number 3 of the hack-a-thon, well of the official hack-a-thon it\u2019s day 6 or something of when everybody started coming. It\u2019s been a little nuts. It\u2019s been really, really good.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if you guys ever do this, but sometimes I have tendency to over commit to a whole bunch of things at once. For example, right now we\u2019ve got Anthony and Brandon at my home filming stuff about a product for Biohacking Secrets. We\u2019ve got a cleaning lady in the house, cleaning. We\u2019ve got people out fixing our pump, because the well broke again. We\u2019ve got people working on the poolhouse. We\u2019ve got my wife and two of her friends working out with a trainer. We\u2019ve got our accountant, who\u2019s related to Collette, my wife, who slept over last night, on top of Dave. Plus we took 30 people to this really amazing restaurant called Barbacoa last night. All the people, all the programmers in marketing are here. It\u2019s been nuts trying to juggle and do everything, but it\u2019s been really good.</p> <p>It\u2019s been interesting, normally when we do our hack-a-thon, we come in and talk for 15 minutes and everyone locks down, well I don\u2019t code, I wish I did. But we code, and I write copy or do pit funnels or whatever, and we just go, go, go like crazy. And this has been a little different. Not different in a bad way, just different. And it\u2019s funny because the person in me is like, I just want to go, go, go, go and this has been interesting, it\u2019s been a lot about bringing in our developers from around the country, bringing in our marketing team and trying to build better relationships with everybody so that everybody can work faster. It\u2019s one of those thing, take 2 steps back so you can take 3 steps forward type of thing. It\u2019s funny, because me and Dave and a couple guys on the team are very, move things forward every second of every day focused, it kind of is driving us loony toons, and crazy, but I see the value in it as well, in fact, the first two days these guys, the programming team, they spent 2 days together and it wasn\u2019t us coding and solving problems and fixing bugs and adding new features and stuff like I assumed and thought it would be, it was a lot more helping the entire dev team really understand why Clickfunnels matters. Why it\u2019s important. Why our customers want what they want. So it was hours and hours and hours of discussion explaining to them this whole world and what internet marketing is, and affiliate marketing and why we want tracking ideas and why we want subID 1 and subID 2 and why we need our stats right. And why this part of the stats don\u2019t make sense and helping them to understand it, which again isn\u2019t moving things forward, but building a foundation so we can move forward a lot faster.</p> <p>So It\u2019s just been one of those things that\u2019s been necessary but that drives people like me bonkers, who just want to move forward. But I think it\u2019s been good and will be interesting to see what happens over the next three months. Because we\u2019re spending this week to build this foundation and get a good understanding, set the goals and road marks and the game plan to move forward before they go home, they basically got a 3 month sprint to get these certain things done. And then month 4 we\u2019ll meet again, so once a quarter we\u2019ll get back together and kind of do this same thing. Hopefully the future ones will be less talking and more coding, just because everybody getting on a better foundation.</p> <p>And then every 4 months everyone flies back in, set new goals, set new foundations, set new ground work, and then everyone goes back and boom kind of doing that in and out thing every quarter, which is kind of the game plan. We\u2019ll know more over the next sprint of 3 or 4 months, what we get done. So one of the major things we\u2019re working on for the Clickfunnels hyper users like me, we\u2019re kind of rebuilding Backpack. Not rebuilding it but a lot of it was we were trying to figure out how to make Backpack the best shopping cart affiliate platform in the world. I think when we built it initially, we knew we needed it, so we built it and it was out there and it works, but it\u2019s not the best. So we had 2 thoughts, one is we kill it or number two we make it the best. So we spent one day just basically going through every shopping cart and affiliate platform out there, we\u2019ve got a lot of accounts and we went through all of them and categorized the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s. And this one\u2019s awesome because it did this and this, and this one sucks because it doesn\u2019t do this, and this one\u2019s great\u2026\u2026looking at all this stuff, which was really fun actually, seeing how everyone does different things. And then from there breaking it down to like, what do we want ours to do? How do we want ours to function? How do we want ours structured? So we took, I feel like we took the best pieces from a bunch of different spots.</p> <p>And then another cool thing, this is new to me and our world, one of the guys in our team is UI, User Interface and User Experience guy and he does the design, the coding part of the user experience, but more so, he tries to really understand. So we went and found 10 or 15 hyper users of Backpack, so he called them on the phone and talked to all of them. Found out what they like and what they don\u2019t like, and what they wish it did, and what they\u2019re\u2026\u2026and all these things. Then he did the same thing with me, which was kind of cool because we saw these really weird commonalities among the hyper users. We all want it to do certain things it doesn\u2019t do. And they were all the same things and there\u2019s this really cool crossover blend. That was really cool too.</p> <p>Anyway, I don\u2019t know if that helps any of you guys, but hopefully it does. Hopefully it makes you think through the process and things that you\u2019re doing and give you some context or some ideas.\u00a0 So yeah, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s been happening. So I\u2019m excited for the new Backpack. The plan initially with this hack-a-thon, is we were going to focus on Actionetics, that was going to be the big driving point, but when we had Todd, Dylan, Ryan and me, and Dave and the guys here, and we were looking at what we thought we needed to work on in the next 3 months it shifted from Actionetics to Backpack. So it\u2019s been interesting. So Backpack will be our focus for the next, hopefully the next 3 to 4 months, and then at the end of summer, a little after summer, is when we do our next hack-a-thon, we\u2019ll get back together and we\u2019ll shift focus, hopefully as long as we finished our initiatives, to Actionetics.</p> <p>One of the other interesting things we\u2019ve done, it\u2019s just funny how all these lessons apply in so many areas of your life. It\u2019s like, right now the way our dev team has worked, everyone is spread across the platform working on different things. It\u2019s like, okay this guy is integrations, this guy is doing bug fixes, this guys is bug fixes in Backpack, and this guy is bug fixes in Actionetics, and this guy is building a feature in the Marketplace. Everyone\u2019s kind of all over the place and because of that it seems like nothing ever gets done, because everything\u2019s incrementally inching forward. And I think that most of us entrepreneurs have the same problem. We\u2019re doing 12 companies at once and because of that none of them are making any money. What our focus is for the next 3 months is for everyone to focus on Backpack, which is going to be a really interesting experiment where basically everyone is focusing on one thing. That way when we do our daily standing meetings and things like that, everyone\u2019s dealing with the same problems and everything is inter-related and we\u2019re hoping there\u2019ll be a lot more value for everyone because of that.</p> <p>Anyway, just a couple of things we\u2019re learning through this process that hopefully will benefit you guys as well. Anyway, that\u2019s about all I got for today. I have been up early this morning, we did some Wim Hof Method, which doesn\u2019t make any sense to you yet, but when Biohacking Secrets comes out that\u2019ll make more sense. It\u2019s crazy, I actually did the process and held my breath for 3 minutes, which doesn\u2019t make any logical sense to me outside of the fact that we did it. It\u2019s crazy, the first time I did it, I think it was 1:30, the second was 2:45, and the last one I did was 3 minutes, crazy, cool, ninja things that are happening. Anyway, if you guys want to geek out on that, when Biohackingsecrets.com comes out you\u2019ll be able to kind of dig deeper and see all these weird things we\u2019re testing on ourselves and how that actually relates back to performance in anything. It can be sports, could be business as entrepreneurs, as a leader, as a speaker, whatever it is that you do and you want to do better.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s what I got you guys. I\u2019m almost to the hack-a-thon office. I don\u2019t know if I told you, we rented an office for the hack-a-thon because we had too many people to fit in our other office. Which actually worked out really good, because in our other office the air conditioner broke. And this whole week it\u2019s been like over 100 degrees here in Boise, which is really hot for this time of year. So my main office, it\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s insane right now. So I had to go back yesterday to do a webinar, we had a big webinar with Jason Fladlien. I get back there and it\u2019s like 120 degrees in the office and I\u2019ve got on long pants, so I go and we did the webinar, which I did my webinar, and then Jason goes and he\u2019s one of the best webinar pitchmen in the world, so he gets excited and he want to plug in what he does. So my typical 2 hour long webinar totally ended up going for 3 \u00bd hours we were on that thing. So we got done and I was light headed and sweating, and my legs were soaked from my pants. It was pretty crazy, but we survived it. So I think the air con guy was supposed to have everything fixed today hopefully. So we\u2019ll be able to be back into a normal office here in the next little bit.</p> <p>And the other cool thing, so many cool things are happening, way too many things at once. Next week we have Inner Circle, so that made me think about this, our Inner Circle\u2019s next week. One thing about the Inner Circle is that, usually we do them in hotels here in Boise, but we\u2019re tired of renting hotels, so we\u2019re like we should get our own. So basically we just bought a new office that we\u2019re turning it into, it\u2019s about an 8,000 square foot office, so half of it, we\u2019re going to chop off and turn into a mastermind room where we can fit about, well we\u2019re not going to have masterminds this big, but we can fit 80 to 100 people in our office, and the other half will be our new office, which would be amazing. So we\u2019re building our own Inner Circle Mastermind room, which we\u2019ll also use for our Certification event.</p> <p>Speaking of certification, we are launching a new certification today. I bet you guys think I have the worst ADD ever, for juggling so many things, but they\u2019re all coming out really, really good, which is exciting. So before I tell you anything else you guys think I\u2019m having worse ADD, I\u2019m going to get back to work and get these projects pushed out the door. I\u2019m also going to jump off because I\u2019m completely lost, I can\u2019t find the new office, so I think if I turn off the Marketing In Your Car and start focusing I should be able to find it, in theory. We\u2019ll see. Anyway, I appreciate you all, thanks for listening and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "12:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_236.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1465250897, "title": "Episode #235 \u2013 No More Being A Jack-Of-All-Trades", "author": "", "summary": "<p>It\u2019s time to focus on your \u201cone thing\u201d.</p> <p>On this special late night episode Russell talks about how he learned to stop being a jack of all trades and focus everything around one thing.

Alright everyone, so I\u2019m heading back to the office, we are day two of our hack-a-thon, which is so much fun. So we had the last, we had about a 4 hour smack-down today deciding the future of Clickfunnels and it got heated, it got a little bit\u2026.a little tension, but it was all good because it\u2019s just interesting. I love my partners and love the people in the company, everyone has, we\u2019re all definitely people who are great at what they do, so we have strong opinions, but when all was said and done, a couple of things I think are very true. One is we all respect each other, like insanely, a ton. And number two is that we care about the customers, and that\u2019s really where the conversation keeps going to, is what is best for our customers, which is awesome. Way better than, what does the board of directors want, which is once again why I will never do the whole VC thing, on top of all the other jokes. But it was really good and we have some really cool directional things that we\u2019re doing that, some things make me nervous but they\u2019re going to be huge. Game changing type things. So I\u2019ll share more as we keep going on, but I just wanted to kind of share that.</p> <p>And then I wanted to talk to you guys about something that I think is really important, that\u2019s on my mind. It\u2019s interesting, I looked at the last 12 years of me being in this business, and first year I was just hustling and tried to make a little bit of money and I did and that was awesome. And then I tried to make a little more and I remember I was just hustling. We\u2019d do a promotion and make $15- $20K and then I wouldn\u2019t do anything for 3 or 4 months. Then we\u2019d try something else and we\u2019d make a little more, here and there. And I remember one day one of my friends who\u2019s in the business was like, \u201cDid you pass six figures yet?\u201d I was like, \u201c No.\u201d because in my mind six figures a year is insane, that\u2019s not even possible. Then I was like, wait. I started doing the math, I was like \u201cOh my gosh. I did, I passed six figures this year. That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. That seems outside of logic.\u201d It wasn\u2019t something I believed was happening. So then I got excited, now I got a goal. I want to make a million dollars in a year.</p> <p>So we went towards that goal, and went towards that goal. It\u2019s funny because I think it took me 3 or 4 years to cross a million dollar mark, and there\u2019s some mental barrier. I missed it by a few ten thousand dollars 2 or 3 years in a row. I just remember I was like, why can I not break the million dollar mark in a year? It just seemed so impossible for some reason and I couldn\u2019t figure it out. And then after I finally did break the million dollar mark, then that mental barrier was gone and I shot to the next level and we got to the point where I think my best year we did 8.9 million in the calendar year, and I think we did 10 if we looked at it from a start day. A 365 start day from the peaks. But in the calendar year, from January 1st to December 31st, on tax is 8.9 million was the biggest year I had. After that is when the company crashed, if you listen back through all my old marketing in your car\u2019s you\u2019ll hear all those stories. That\u2019s not for today.</p> <p>Then we restarted, and we started growing and we stuck at 3 million dollars a year, for 5 years in a row, stuck, stuck, stuck. We tried focusing, which got us to 3 million, we were like let\u2019s diversify, let\u2019s launch 10 companies. We launched 10 companies and we still made 3 million. Then, it was just thing after thing after thing.\u00a0 And then we started having a little more success when some of our other offers started going bigger. Neurocell did well and a couple of other offers started doing well. Anyway, it was just\u2026\u2026but it still, then I think we were hovering around 6 million or so. I was like, \u201cHow do we get back to 10 million without having a hundred employees? How is that possible?\u201d And I remember going to marketing events and people would be like, \u201cOkay, this is the whatever guy. This is the whatever person.\u201d And everyone would have their thing, and be like, \u201cRussell, what\u2019s your thing?\u201d and I was like,, \u201cWe\u2019re all things marketing. We do copywriting and we do funnels, and we do traffic.\u201d We just kind of did everything. And I always thought that was a strategic advantage. \u201cYou can go to this guy to learn whatever, but we\u2019re going to teach you the whole thing.\u201d And that was always our whole thing. We want to teach everything.</p> <p>Just by nature, we were good at everything, so we wanted to show everything and teach everything in this market and that\u2019s what we did. And the problem is we just kept getting stuck and stagnant. And I never could figure out why. And then the whole Clickfunnels thing came and it wasn\u2019t something we even invented the conversation. People had been talking about funnels, we\u2019d been talking about funnels for 8 or 9 years. And I remember at the time, Ryan Deiss Traffic and Conversions Summit was all about funnels, seems like it was a hot topic right when we were building this tool. It really was a perfect storm when we launched it and all these things and it took off. And I wrote my book, and my book wasn\u2019t ever really about funnels. Like if I was to re-title it now I probably would change the title, at least the subtitle, to be more about this is a funnel book. But it didn\u2019t it was just me teaching my process, but it all came down to funnels. When you look at the whole process, it was all funnels. And people read that book and because that came so close to Clickfunnels people associated it as this is the guide book or the handbook for funnels and this is the software, and that means Russell, therefore, is the funnel guy.</p> <p>But at first I didn\u2019t like that because I was like, there\u2019s a lot of people teaching funnels, I\u2019m not the funnel guy, I\u2019m the guy who does everything. And it\u2019s interesting, but that\u2019s kind of like I had this weird pride thing that I wanted to bigger than funnels, or I wanted to be whatever, but people kept kind of pigeon holing it, you\u2019re the funnel guy, you\u2019re the funnel guy. And finally after a while I started embracing it and shifting things and now all of our products are being tied to that. Funnel Scripts, here\u2019s the scripts to your funnels. We had High Ticket Secrets, which is your high ticket funnel, and we had all these\u00a0 other things that we have rolled out before and since. And then we started tying things to Clickfunnels. We have our Quick Start Program, which is helping people set up. We\u2019ve got our funnel certification program, even my Inner Circle, interesting enough, transitioned to a funnel inner circle. Someone even mentioned it, last meeting. The reason why we\u2019re in this room is because Russell\u2019s the best in the world at funnels. I was like, how interesting is that? And I really think that the big\u2026.I mean obviously there\u2019s a lot of things that happened, but one of the biggest thing for us that took us from where we\u2019re at now to this year, I don\u2019t want to share numbers or anything, but it\u2019s going to be, I mean 3 or 4 maybe even 5 times more than my biggest year of all time. It\u2019s just kind of crazy.</p> <p>And I really feel like it\u2019s because we picked our thing. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on. Everything we\u2019re doing is around this one concept of funnels and we\u2019re trying to become the best in the world at funnels. Our coaching\u2019s around funnels, our products around funnels. Our front end offers are around webinar funnels and book funnels. Everything is tied to this conversation that we are trying to become the best in the world at, and I think that that\u2019s one of the keys. As much as I hated to go that way and I didn\u2019t want to, and I fought it for so long. Because I\u2019m good at a lot of things, I wanted to be all these things, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the key. The key is figuring out what are you the best in the world at? What is your thing? And then everything you create is tied to that one thing. You know, Ryan Deiss just posted, I think Digital Marketers, he\u2019s says it\u2019s been 5 years now and I was reading this post. It was really cool, I really enjoyed it. But he was talking about how every year their business model changes. They were this, they were this, and they were this. You know, one year they were funnels, the next they were consultants, the next year they were whatever, and this year they\u2019re doing certifications and it\u2019s kind of like, their business keeps changing and I know they\u2019re doing well, but my guess is that if they would pick a track and stick with it, and they\u2019re trying to obviously, one of them is going to become the thing for them, but if you were to ask people 3 years ago who does funnels in the industry everyone would have said Ryan Deiss, but they shifted away from that. They shifted their focus to the next thing. It was the machine in email marketing and then it was\u2026..and now it\u2019s certifications. So I\u2019m hoping they find their spot, I think certifications; I think what they\u2019re doing with certifications is unique and cool and nobody else is doing it. We\u2019re definitely not going that direction. I think that there\u2019s this area that they\u2019re going to carve out and just kind of own. I hope that\u2019s the plan. I hope. I love to see what they can do if they execute hard on that for 3 or 4 years and just focus there.</p> <p>I look at us we\u2019re focusing now on this one thing and I start looking at a whole bunch of things are going through my mind right now. How do I build a community? Surround a topic? Our community, we\u2019re funnel hackers. We funnel hack. We can have live events, hack-a-thons, the funnel hacking live event. It\u2019s funnels and \u2026. And it\u2019s suddenly all these things and if you want to build a cult or a culture, it comes down to becoming the best in the world at one thing and then tying everything you\u2019re doing around that concept.</p> <p>Kind of a fun idea behind that. One of my close buddies, Chad Woolner, he\u2019s a chiropractor and he\u2019s been kind of trying to figure out his spot in the world outside of his practice. What does he want to do? How does he want to serve people outside of that? A little while ago he decided he wanted to help serve chiropractors and help other one\u2019s get to the point that he\u2019s gotten, really free themselves from the startup of a practice and those kind of things. So he started a podcast, he\u2019s doing all these things, and they\u2019re all good and he\u2019s teaching everything from how to do this to this, all these things which are broad and good. And we were at a camping trip the other day, and I was sitting there and I was like, \u201cWould I go on Paychat to learn how to grow my Chiropractic business?\u201d and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would.\u201d Not that he doesn\u2019t know his thing, because he does, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the best in the world at all those things that he\u2019s teaching, all those things. What could Chad be the best in the world at. And I was thinking, and this isn\u2019t the answer for everyone, but for him I was like, \u201cDude, you\u2019re probably the only Chiropractor on Earth that knows anything about funnels. You build funnels, you build your own funnels, online funnels, offline funnels. I would venture to assume that you are the best in the world at Chiropractic funnels right now. That should be your thing man. You should shift all your branding and everything around that one thing and make that your focus. If that was your focus and I was a chiropractor I would come to you in a heartbeat. I wouldn\u2019t come to you to learn how to build a chiropractic business, because you don\u2019t have the biggest Chiropractor business, so I wouldn\u2019t come to you for that. I would go to whoever did. But you\u2019re the best in the world at chiropractic funnels. I would come to you for that. If you were to come to an event, let\u2019s say there\u2019s a big event in your industry you could say \u2018hey, I\u2019m the Chiropractic Funnel Dude.\u2019 They would allow you to speak because you are that person.\u201d</p> <p>And I was looking at the other Chiropractic guru\u2019s and there\u2019s a social media one, there\u2019s different ones and each of them would have their little spot in the ecosystem. I\u2019ve always, again like I said, I always was kind of resistant to that and fought that, but now I really think that\u2019s the key. Anyway, I just wanted to leave that while I\u2019m driving back to the office to kind of think on. What is your thing? I know you\u2019re good at everything, because you\u2019re amazing. So of all those things, where, when someone says, \u201cOh, so and so, they\u2019re the funnel dude. They\u2019re the social media dude. They\u2019re the eat fat and butter dude. Or put butter in your coffee dude.\u201d Or whatever your market is. What makes you unique? What makes you different?</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of funny, I was looking at our old products, we had micro-continuity, which was cool, but it was just another random thing where now I can be like, \u201chey micro-continuity funnels.\u201d And suddenly takes a concept and wraps it in a way that is unique to me and now it gives context and now people care. Anyway, just some thoughts. Hopefully that helps some of you guys and I hope you take some time to kind of carve out where in the world you fit into your ecosystem. And don\u2019t fight it because you feel like you\u2019re better than it. Own it. And I think that\u2019s how you go deep with people and your audience. That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see the biggest transformation. So there you go you guys. I hope you enjoyed that. That\u2019s all I got. I appreciate you all, thanks for listening. Thanks for being part of this crazy community we\u2019re trying to build, and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.

I hope you guys are all doing amazing. I am heading into the office now as normal. I probably should just quit saying that because you guys are all riding with me every day and you all know that\u2019s kind of the game plan.</p> <p>But I wanted to share with you guys a cool insight I had two days ago. I need to preface it, because in my mastermind groups every year we get a group amazing women who join who self identify themselves, so I wouldn\u2019t say this if they didn\u2019t say it, but since they do I can tease and I can play off of it. But, they come in and usually everybody introduces themselves, \u201cHey I\u2019m so and so and I\u2019m in the woo woo niche.\u201d Woo woo typically means all of the mindset and spiritual healing and all these things that are grouped in, in the woo woo, right. So that\u2019s kind of our joke in the Inner Circle like, \u201cYou\u2019re one of the woo woo teachers.\u201d It\u2019s kind of funny. So with that said, I do believe in a lot of those kind of things and I think there\u2019s a lot of value and stuff and a lot of cool things that come from that.</p> <p>Anyway, one of our members\u2026.some of you guys may have heard of them or met them, but if not, they\u2019re amazing. Their names are Justin and Tara Williams and they run a couple of podcasts. One in the real estate market which I\u2026\u2026if you want to flip houses, these guys are amazing, they flip like 100 houses a year, but that\u2019s not the kind of business I want to be in, but if you do go check it out. I don\u2019t even know the name of the podcast there is. They also do one called 8 minute millionaire, which is one of my favorite podcasts. It\u2019s really, really fun. And then Tara just launched a new podcast called, I\u2019m going to mess up the name; it\u2019s like the Energy Healing Podcast. She launched it and I kind of saw them launching it, but I didn\u2019t know much about it, and then at the group she got up and kind of presenting and explaining what they\u2019re doing. And we were teasing them, \u201cOh no, you\u2019re in the woo woo market now. You guys went from hardcore house flipping to becoming a millionaire to woo woo in a year, which is kind of funny.\u201d</p> <p>But it was awesome and she showed the process and the model that they\u2019re doing. It was really, really cool. In fact, maybe I\u2019ll talk about it another day, but if you want to see a really interesting, simple, clean model, I\u2019m really kind of watching them close, because I think it\u2019s cool, but if you go to tarawilliams.com and make sure you spell it right. I\u2019ll make sure... my sister-in-law transcribes these; I\u2019ll make sure she goes to the right site, so it\u2019s right in the transcript. If you go to tarawilliams.com, it\u2019s a very simple page telling you a story, you opt in, they get you to listen to the podcast. The podcast pushes back to an energy healing calm, and then eventually I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll go to hiring coaching and a bunch of stuff like that. But it\u2019s simple, the podcast is the traffic generator, and then you look at the podcast, she did a really cool job of when you come in and taking you through an indoctrination. First thing she introduces the podcast, second podcast episode tells her story and then after that it goes through a 21 day jump start. 21 days of hope to help you become indoctrinated and understanding energy healing. Why she does it, how she does it, all these things, which increases your desire to want to go get the coaching call, and things like that.</p> <p>Anyway, needless to say, I\u2019m going through the process. While she\u2019s at the Mastermind, she reads my energy, totally the woo woo realm of things, so if you guys don\u2019t believe in that kind of stuff, I totally understand it, but I was like\u2026\u2026it was strangely amazing and interesting and yeah. So we actually, during the mastermind I had them come over and talk to my wife and I more about what they do, and did a session with us then, and then I drank the kool-aid and signed up and paid them a bunch of money to do some of my own sessions. So my very first call was on Monday, which was Memorial Day. So I woke up early in the morning and did that and it was interesting. I would say I\u2019ve done a lot of coaching, a lot of coaching, probably more than most people on earth over the last ten years, but I would say that it was the most specific personal development, life coaching, whatever you want to call it, session that I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve had a lot of good things that are\u2026.but the problem is they are more generic; the way she does things is very focused on me. Anyway, I will leave it at that because there\u2019s a bunch of stuff that is outside the scope of this podcast. I wanted to share that first off because I think the model is really, really interesting. Second off, during my session I learned something really interesting about myself, that I think would be good for you guys too.\u00a0 So therein lies what we\u2019re going to be talking about for the next 5 minutes till I get to the office.</p> <p>So during my session we were talking about just things and how I work. She was asking me, \u201cThere\u2019s some kind of wrestling analogy here that you need to figure out and explain to me.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d So I\u2019m kind of thinking through it and I don\u2019t remember exactly what she said for this to kind of come up or anything but, I remember the moral of the story and it was talking about wrestling, and any of you guys that have ever been to wrestling match, this is kind of how it works. When you\u2019re in high school they\u2019re 6 minute matches, when you\u2019re in college they\u2019re 7 minute matches, it\u2019s basically 2 minutes for each period, there\u2019s 3 periods. First period both of you start on your feet, then after 2 minutes, or in college the first period is 3 minutes, then there\u2019s a quick break. The break literally is maybe 10 seconds, it\u2019s long enough for the ref to flip a coin, see who gets their choice, whoever wins the choice can say they want to go top, bottom, neutral or defer. Top means that you get to start on top of the guy, bottom means you get to start on the bottom, where you\u2019re on the mat and the other guys on top of you. Neutral means you get on your feet again and defer means you let the other guy choose and you choose the 3rd period. So that\u2019s kind of what is top, bottom, neutral or defer.</p> <p>So that goes really quick, you pick \u201cI want bottom.\u201d And then right before you walk back to the center of the mat and kneel down you look back at your coach for a second, maybe 2 or 3 seconds, a really short period of time, just long enough for your coach to be like, \u201cDude, Russell, he\u2019s leading his right leg, look for that. You\u2019re missing it but he\u2019s leading his right leg.\u201d Or \u201cHey Russell, keep your elbows in. You\u2019re overextending your arms.\u201d Or whatever that little piece is. And my coach is able to see what I\u2019m not. Because I\u2019m right there, my face is in the middle of this thing. We\u2019re beating the crap out of each other, there\u2019s heads and all sorts of things are happening. And I\u2019m aware of as much as my subconscious mind is picking up from all my training and my practice and everything, but there\u2019s things from the outside I\u2019m not able to see just because I\u2019m so close to the thing. So I look back for a second and the coach is like, \u201cHey, your elbows are flying, keep your elbows in.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh crap, I didn\u2019t even realize. I\u2019m getting out of position.\u201d Or \u201cHey look for the under-hook on this guy, he\u2019s reaching.\u201d Or \u201cHey, look he\u2019s stepping.\u201d Or whatever it is, they give me a second, maybe 2 seconds of really fast coaching from an outside perspective. You go to the middle, boom you start again. You go for the next 2 minutes,\u00a0 the period ends, you come back, reset, you\u2019re standing there and look over to the coach and the coach is like, \u201cBoom, here\u2019s this outside nugget that you\u2019re missing.\u201d And then the match is over.</p> <p>And what\u2019s interesting, if you look at those little things, it\u2019s tiny periods of time. Seconds, maybe 5 seconds max. But you\u2019re getting this perspective from outside, from something that\u2026\u2026.I think about this a lot. For me, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say this in all situations, but you got Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods is better than his coach. Typically if you\u2019re in competition, you\u2019re better than your coach, you\u2019re coach may have been better back in the day, but they\u2019re not actively competing. So you\u2019re the best, you\u2019re technically better than your coach in that period of time, but the coach still has a different perspective that you don\u2019t have. He\u2019s able to look from the outside and be like, \u201cWow, Russell is doing a lot of good things right, but this is where he\u2019s getting in trouble. This is the piece\u2026\u201d or whatever those things are. And it\u2019s that outside perspective you get for a second. And one of the big takeaway\u2019s from my session with Tara was understanding for me in my business, I\u2019m in the heat of it. I\u2019m going a million miles a minute and doing all sorts of stuff just like I\u2019m in a wrestling match, and the thing I was missing was I wasn\u2019t taking that time to look back at a coach, look back at whatever. And it could be a coach, it could be a spiritual thing, through prayer, which I think is probably more of where I need to be focusing at. It could be, you know whatever, but it\u2019s taking a second and looking back to get the outside perspective so when you go back to battle you have that ability to execute better.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of where I wanted to share with you. For each of you guys it\u2019s going to be different. I think for me, and it\u2019s one of my things I\u2019m trying to work on for the next month or so and really figure out, is where are those times for me? I\u2019m not a big fan yet of meditation, but I know people who are obsessed with it and seems like in my world, everyone is getting more and more obsessed with meditation and I just don\u2019t feel like I have the time for that right now. Some of you guys know I just bought a flow tank, so the flow tank is going to be at my house next week, it\u2019s being delivered. When you do a flow tank session, it\u2019s like an hour sitting in this tank floating in salt water, you just kind of sit there for an hour, so it\u2019s going to be my forced meditation time. I don\u2019t even know how to meditate. So I\u2019m probably going to, when I\u2019m locked in there push play on some meditation thing that forces me to meditate. But it\u2019s going to be my time to force me to stop and look back at my coach. So meditation could be a thing, it could be hiring a coach.</p> <p>I look at one of our Inner Circle members who\u2019s been killing it, just finished a new webinar and sent it to me today and was like, \u201cI\u2019m so excited.\u201d And I felt bad because I\u2019m so excited about the webinar, but there\u2019s 3 final mistakes almost everyone makes in a webinar and she made all three of them and I was like ahhh. And I feel, I almost feel bad being that coach that\u2019s like, \u201cHey, this is the three places I see that you\u2019re already making the mistakes,\u201d because I know how much time they\u2019ve put into the presentation and all these things, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. That outside perspective. \u201cI\u2019m in the battle, I\u2019m creating, I\u2019m doing all this stuff and it looks perfect to me and I look back at the coach and the coach is like, \u201cIt\u2019s looking good, but you\u2019re overextending, your elbows are out.\u201d Or \u201cYou\u2019re stepping too hard with your left leg and that\u2019s why he keeps taking you down.\u201d Or whatever that thing might be.</p> <p>So hiring a coach or mentor, I\u2019ve been a big believer, and it\u2019s funny because I haven\u2019t for the last year and a half just because\u00a0 Clickfunnels got a little crazy. But prior to that in my life, I always had a coach, someone I was paying for coaching, and it wasn\u2019t always like a business coach. It was a health coach, or a life coach, relationship coach. And right now I\u2019ve got my new energy coach, so it can be all sorts of different things, but always having some coach that you\u2019re paying so you have someone to look back to and be like, \u201cHey I need an outside perspective. What am I doing right? What am I doing wrong?\u201d So again it could be meditation for you, could be prayer, could be hiring a coach, could be all those things combined. Kind of my big takeaway for this week is that while I am good in the heat of battle, I\u2019m doing well, better than I\u2019ve ever done, I need to take those moments to look back and get the outside perspective from somebody or something else that I might be missing right now. Because no matter how good I think I might be, I\u2019m missing things. So that\u2019s what the outside perspectives for.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s what I wanted to share with you guys today. It\u2019s cool, I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m excited to see where my journey goes with Tara as a coach for a little while. And just see the different things I get from that. So I\u2019ll share the cool stuff with you guys. But that was the big takeaway for me. So think about that you guys. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re all amazing at what you do, but look back at the coach to get the outside perspective. That\u2019s what I got. I\u2019m almost to the office today you guys. I got calls. Ugh. I hate days when I have calls from noon to 4. It\u2019s killing me. I just want to build funnels.</p> <p>Anyway, so I\u2019m going to film from 9 until noon. So I\u2019m going to go bust out four things really quick, then get on calls all day and that\u2019ll be my day. And then tomorrow, we\u2019ve got all Dylan, Todd and Ryan, my Clickfunnels co-founders/partners are flying in for 3 or 4 days and next we\u2019ve got the whole team flying in. So tomorrow will be a fun day of getting crap done, planning for world domination. Taking a step back so we can move 50 steps forward and it\u2019s going to be good. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be broadcasting live from some of our secret sessions, so hopefully you guys are tuned into Periscope and Facebook Mentions and all the other places we\u2019re posting cool stuff because we\u2019ll be sharing inside, behind the scenes of what\u2019s happening. Alright guys. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day, and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "14:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_234.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1464735857, "title": "Episode #233 \u2013 My New True Believer Funnel", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to get people to profitably join your podcast, follow you on social media, and so much more.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about an idea he has for the Marketing In Your Car podcast and how to get more subscribers.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Hear about some interesting things Russell has coming up this week.</li> <li>Find out what awesome idea Russell had to get more subscribers to the podcast and why you should funnel hack the idea.</li> <li>And find out how you could possibly get a hold of the first 250 Marketing In Your Car podcasts on one device in the near future.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear the details of Russell\u2019s exciting new idea.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everybody, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Alright everybody, I hope that the weekend was amazing for those who are listening live. Those who\u2026.I guess it\u2019s never really live, those who are listening in kind of real time, for those who are listening some other time, hope you had an amazing whatever today was for you. And I have got some crazy, cool things happening this week. I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got\u2026..we\u2019re launching the Keto Funnels for the Pruvit company which is going to be cool. It\u2019s not live today but it should be live by the time most of you guys hear this, within a day or two. So if you wanna see a little bit behind the scenes\u00a0 of what we\u2019re doing go to ketofunnels.com, that should be live, like I said, in a day or two. We\u2019re going to be rolling those out, funnels for a network marketing company, so it\u2019s kind of a big experiment. We\u2019re going to be testing out, if it works good here, we\u2019ll probably do it with other companies. Anyway, it\u2019s kind of a little sample test to see if we can build out funnels for companies and make it so that a company person basically comes in, drops in their Pruvit ID and unlocks all these secret funnels, so it\u2019ll be kind of cool to see how the first test goes. I think it\u2019ll do well, we\u2019ve built 2 pretty amazing funnels for that company and I think that people are going to love them and do a lot of good stuff with them. So that\u2019s kind of plan number one that\u2019s happening this week.</p> <p>Also Bio-hacking Secrets should be going live. We would be going live this week, but we have to record one more product, so Anthony\u2019s flying back out for that early next week. We\u2019ve got the hack-a-thon starting. So we\u2019ve got, this weekend basically Clickfunnels partners and co-founders are all flying in, and next we\u2019ve got pretty much half the dev team, maybe more, maybe the whole dev team, a whole bunch of the dev team, a whole bunch of the marketing team. So for a week we\u2019ll be doing a whole bunch of crazy, cool stuff, while we\u2019re filming episodes for Funnel Hacker TV. There\u2019s a lot happening, which is fun, also at times, overwhelming, not going to lie. But it\u2019s good.</p> <p>I got a couple of big projects I\u2019m trying to get out the door and then I can start focusing on some of the fun things that are going on with Funnel Hacker TV. But today I wanted to share with you guys an idea that hopefully will be a big idea for some of you guys. Because I think I cracked the code on something. If you think about how most people grow, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about it, I know Snapchat is the new cool thing, and podcasts is cool, and blogs are cool and all these things are cool, right? The problem with most content things is that the way you get traction is first off, you\u2019ve got to do it consistently for forever which kind of sucks. For most of us it takes a long time before you have success. I was doing this podcast for probably 3 years before anyone listened to it. But I didn\u2019t care because it was fun and it was an easy format. But it was hard because, luckily I was monetizing my life in other ways, but this is your marketing strategy, it sucks. If your marketing strategy is, let\u2019s go blog, let\u2019s go podcast, let\u2019s go Snapchat, things like that, it\u2019s tough. So I\u2019m always looking, how do we beat the system? How do we make it so that we can get customers and people to subscribe profitably? Where we make money every time somebody joins our podcast or gets on Snapchat or whatever that thing might be.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve been thinking about that. How do I do that? What\u2019s the best way? I have an idea and I\u2019m going to be executing on it, and I hope a couple of you guys copying me, because if you do that\u2019d be awesome. My guess is that most of you won\u2019t but hopefully one or two of you will because that\u2019ll make it worth sharing the idea. What I\u2019ve been looking out is, I\u2019ve been doing\u2026..We\u2019re getting close to episode 250 in the Marketing In Your Car Podcast, which is crazy. Don\u2019t you guys think? We\u2019ve been hanging out 250 days, we\u2019ve been sharing this message together. So that\u2019s kind of cool. My problem is when we go pay, \u201cHey go subscribe to Russell\u2019s podcast.\u201d It\u2019s expensive, and it\u2019s hard to track, it\u2019s less effective, it\u2019s not the best thing in the world right? I know it was almost impossible to track as when we were trying to guess , we were spending $100 to get someone to subscribe to your podcast. it was obviously free things in your list of a bunch of other things to do, but for me to buy ads to get people to build my following, crazy expensive, not worth it, not even worth the time and energy. That\u2019s why putting out good content is good, people share.</p> <p>A lot of you guys have found out about this podcast because people shared it with you or whatever. So those are the good things having good content, but I don\u2019t want to rely on good content to get my message out there. Because no matter how good your content is, at first it\u2019s not spreading. So how do we do it? So I had this idea. Building a funnel specific to getting people to subscribe to my different channels and things like that. What I was thinking about doing, and a couple of ideas and tips kind of came\u00a0 along with this thought process, but one of them I was looking at all the podcasts I\u2019ve done in the past and there\u2019s 5 or 6 that are focused on webinars that are really, really good. Things that I wish everybody could listen to. So I\u2019m like, what if I take those 5 things and I\u2019m like, \u201cHey opt-in for the 5 top webinar strategy\u2019s\u201d or whatever, they opt in and boom, I just give them the links to those 5 podcasts. So that\u2019s one way I can start paying to get people to opt-in and have some kind of metric, but it still doesn\u2019t make me really money up front. So I\u2019m like how do we do this?</p> <p>So my big thought, my big aha, I\u2019m excited for this, is I\u2019m going to be taking 250, well as soon as we get 250 episodes, we\u2019re getting close. I\u2019m going to make\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve been sourcing it in China. In China we\u2019re getting these really cool pre-loaded MP3 players, and I\u2019m going to pre-load the first 250 episodes of Marketing In Your car on that thing. So I\u2019m going to go and actually pull out the audio intros and exits, just so you don\u2019t have to hear the same song 250 times, for those of you guys that binge listen. But I want to encourage people to binge listen. So what better way than to do that than to give them devices with all those things pre-loaded on it. It ends up costing me $5 or $10 in China to get one of these MP3 players. It\u2019ll be wrapped in my logos and all that kind of stuff, and I\u2019m going to do a free plus shipping on it.\u00a0 Free plus shipping you\u2019re going to get 250 of my top podcast episodes. So that\u2019ll be basically the offer, and we\u2019ll have some kind of order form bump and some kind of upsell, right? Whatever that is.</p> <p>So now, I can go on Facebook and get my email list and other people\u2019s lists, and all the traditional marketing channels to give away this MP3 player, which people who download my MP3 player with 250 free episodes of my podcast, what do we know about those people? They\u2019re probably either interested in my podcast, or they will become because now I\u2019m giving it away to them to binge listen to them really, really easily. So they will come through that funnel and after that funnel, now this is my, in my mind it\u2019s my funnel to connect people to all of my social outlets. So day one would be a thing like, \u201cHey, thanks so much for listening, the MP3 player is on its way, but I want you to subscribe right now so that you can get all future episodes. Because episode 251 and beyond are not on this MP3 player, so you have to click here to subscribe. So, boom, we\u2019re getting people subscribed to itunes that day.</p> <p>So now I\u2019m causing consumption and then I\u2019m getting people to subscribe. And then day number two is going to be something like, \u201cHey guys, this is Russell. You know what Snapchat is? Here\u2019s 5 cool snapschats I sent out in the past, I want you guys on this list, because if you\u2019re not getting my Snapchats you\u2019re missing out on some cool crap that\u2019s coming directly to you through the Snapchatty-thingy.\u201d I actually haven\u2019t started using Snapchat yet, in fact I don\u2019t know how it works, but I know it\u2019s the big next thing, so I\u2019m like, how do you get people to subscribe? Well it\u2019s hard, you have to train them.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to get a freaking pay for ads until somebody to go download Snapchat, search for my name, click on my button, that\u2019s the most inefficient way on earth to grow a following, it\u2019s horrible. But for people who have said, \u201cRussell I\u2019m going to pay you for 250 of your episodes.\u201d those people are a little more engaged and now I have a full day focused on, \u201cHey guys, today\u2019s a Snapchat day. Anyone who has a Snapchat you\u2019re going to get blah blah for free. Go and do it.\u201d And we bribe them and motivate them to get them to subscribe to Snapchat. The next one can be like, \u201cHey guys, this is how\u201d\u2026.I don\u2019t know, LinkedIn or Pinterest, or Instagram, or whatever, I\u2019m going to use that communication funnel after somebody gets this free plus shipping thing to connect them into all of my social channels and that\u2019s going to be the funnel. So that way in theory if we execute it right, usually it costs us about $10 to get a free plus shipping buyer, and if we can make $20 or so from that initial funnel, that\u2019ll cover our shipping costs and basically now we\u2019re breaking even, and now I\u2019ve got people\u2019s attention, to now get them into our other channels for free, and in a really cool way that\u2019s not them clicking on an ad in Facebook, but actually watching a video of me educating you, coaching you how to do it, telling them what to look for, to how it all works. And that\u2019s kind of the thoughts. So that\u2019s my thought you guys. So I\u2019m going to be\u00a0 building out really cool, I don\u2019t even know what we call it, a funnel with the sole purpose of profitably acquiring subscribers to my blog, podcast, Snapchat, all those other things.</p> <p>We should probably come up with a cool name for it. What do you guys think? What would be a cool name to use for it? Call it the\u2026..oh what if we call it, have you guys ever read the article called the Thousand True Believers, or A Thousand True Fans, is that what it\u2019s called. Oh and there\u2019s a book called the True Believer which is a book about how to start your own cult, not that I\u2019m studying how to start my own cult, but if I was, I would definitely be reading the True Believer. What if we call this the True Believer Funnel. The True Believer Creator Funnel. That\u2019s too many words. Let\u2019s call it the True Believer Funnel, this will be just between us people. You guys on the Marketing In Your Car and that\u2019s it, nobody else gets this one right now. So this is the True Believer Funnel. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to start focusing on, where we can profitably acquire people into our cult, sure. That\u2019ll be the game plan.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s my thought. Hopefully that helps some of you guys, gives you some cool ideas. Again, you don\u2019t have to be as elaborate as me, with 250 episodes on, you can go pick 5 episodes and sell it for $7 or you could do like I\u2019m doing. Burn them on a CD. Initially we burned it on a CD we just never sold that one. But as a MP3 player it\u2019ll be super cool, it\u2019ll grow and grow the way we\u2019re looking for, plus I can put on all my other follow up sequences and a million other things. Anyway, that\u2019s totally the game plan you guys. So feel free to Funnel Hack it, rip it off. But you will see me executing it very quickly. We\u2019re getting MP3 players designed right now. My brother\u2019s cleaning up all the audio from past Marketing in Your Car\u2019s making it easier to listen to, and I got to get to episode 250. When those things are finished, we will have an MP3 player with 250 episodes pre-loaded on it, for your listening enjoyment.</p> <p>That\u2019s the plan you guys. Alright, I am outta here. I got a busy day and I\u2019ve got field day today with my kids at 1, so I\u2019ve got 3, about 4 hours to bust through all my projects, then I am out. Which I am kind of excited for, the day\u2019s I only have 3 or 4 hours to get stuff done, I typically get more stuff done than the days that I have 10 hours. It\u2019s forcing me to get everything done in a compressed amount of time to get to my kids field day today. Cause this is the last week of school for them, so it\u2019s going to be really, really fun. I am in charge of the tug o war, so I\u2019m going to be\u2026.just picture this, me vs 10 little kids in a tug o war. It\u2019s going to be so fun. I\u2019m excited. Alright you guys, have a great day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "13:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_233.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1464298537, "title": "Episode #232 \u2013 The Procrastination Killing, Sub-Zero Fireball", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The most ninja thing I learned at this week\u2019s mastermind group.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell gives a quick history of how his Inner Circle came to be.

I launched the Inner Circle, probably 3 years ago and I had a mastermind group in the past but the first time it was 7 or 8 years ago. I launched a mastermind group; I think I sold 2 people into it. I was like, \u201cCrap, if they show up there\u2019s only going to be 2 people and it\u2019s going be dumb.\u201d So I invited a bunch of my friends and stuff and tried to make a full group. It was always okay, but I don\u2019t know. It just wasn\u2019t\u2019 amazing. So we ran it for 2 or 3 years and finally I was like, let\u2019s stop running it. So we turned it off and didn\u2019t run it for a long time.</p> <p>Fast forward to a couple of years ago we decided to launch coaching again. It\u2019s funny how your mindset shifts. We had sold coaching at 5 so this time I was like we\u2019re going to sell it at 8. So we sold it at 8.\u00a0 And then I was like, now we\u2019re going to do it at 10 and we bumped it to 10. Then I was like we\u2019re going to do it at 12 and we bumped it to 12. But it wasn\u2019t really a mastermind group, it was more this other thing.</p> <p>Then I met this guy who had sold a $25K mastermind group. He said he was signing up 2 people a week. I was like, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even possible. It seemed like too far, too foreign to even be a possibility. But I was like, let\u2019s just add that as a thing and maybe we\u2019ll sell one or two. So we did and then right away we sold one. I was like, \u201cCrap, now we gotta fulfill on it and we gotta sell more.\u201d So we started slowly selling it. I think at our first mastermind group we had 8 people at it. And that was kind of cool. I was like, alright. And then by the second one we had about 20 people at it. And I was like, \u201cDang this is getting big.\u201d I remember Bill Glazier\u2019s mastermind group I grew up in, he only allowed 18 people in the group. So with 20 we had a full group and we were giving everyone an hour in their sessions. And then it kept growing and growing. Soon we got to the point where we had 35 people in the group. I was like, Dang. So we shrunk it down to where everyone had 30 minutes. It actually ended up being better because people spent a lot less time talking about nothing and a lot more time focused. So I was like, \u201cOkay, cool. We\u2019ll keep it at 35, keep it there.\u201d</p> <p>And then the next meeting we had 45. So we shifted to 3 days and it hit 3 days and it was too much, everyone was fried. I was like, \u201cWhat do we do.\u201d Finally I was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to break this into 2 groups. We\u2019ll have 2 groups of 20ish.\u201d So we broke into 2 groups, by the time the 2 groups showed up, they both had 30 people in it. We were at 60 people in the group. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh crap.\u201d So we had 2 groups. 1 one day, and 1 the other day. We had a crossover day, so we had dinner together and it was really fun. We\u2019re like, cool we\u2019ll keep 2 groups and we\u2019ll be fine. Then the next time we had 2 groups and both groups had about 40 in it. And I was like, \u201cWe can\u2019t facilitate 40 in a group, it loses the experience.\u201d</p> <p>Excuse me, my throat is dry from a lot of talking. Anyway, I was looking at it, we\u2019re almost 80 people. I can\u2019t believe we have 80 people at our $25K a year program. It didn\u2019t make any sense to me. And this comes back to one of the big things we had over the last 3 days so far. When is enough, enough? So I said, \u201cYou know what,\u201d and actually I had years ago, Dan Kennedy asked me, \u201cWhat\u2019s your number?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your number? When are you going to be happy?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, a billion.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cAll you entrepreneurs, especially the young ones, you just want money, so you just work and work and work. You don\u2019t have a number so you just keep working til forever. You gotta have a number otherwise you are going to burn yourself out. And you will find out that this business you created because you wanted freedom and a lifestyle will rob you of that.\u201d And I was like, \u201cCrap.\u201d</p> <p>So a few months ago, I was looking at Inner Circle and I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s my number?\u201d At that time I also said, \u201cFrom now on we shut down our lower end program.\u201d Which was a $10-12K a year. I said \u201cYou know what, we\u2019ll just close that down.\u201d Which was crazy because it was almost a $2 million dollar a year business and I just turned it off. It\u2019s not worth the effort anymore. So I turned it off, which was really scary.\u00a0 Then the only option became $25K which is why so many kept joining it. So a couple of months ago I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s my number?\u201d We\u2019re at 80, I\u2019m going to have 100. And when there\u2019s 100 we\u2019re going to shut it down.\u201d And so I said that was the number and within two weeks we got to 100, which was crazy.</p> <p>So that became my number. I said, \u201cLook, that\u2019ll be it. A $2.5 million a year business for me coaching and that\u2019s it. We\u2019re not scaling, we\u2019re not growing. It is what it is.\u201d And I said, \u201cWith 100 people, how do we do this?\u201d And I looked at some of the other groups out there. One of my friends groups, they run a similar thing and they grew the same thing, about 100 people. They have 100 people all come to one meeting. So I went to that meeting and I didn\u2019t like it. I felt like I didn\u2019t get anything out of it at all. So I was like, I don\u2019t want to make mine big like that. The format that I get the most value out of is the one with 20 to 25 people in the group and everyone got to share. So I said how about this, we\u2019re going to break it into 4 groups of 25 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. And we will lock it out. So that\u2019s what we did, we capped it out at 100 people, 4 groups of 25. And that is now the Inner Circle.</p> <p>So we had 25 people here Monday and Tuesday. 25 people here Wednesday and Thursday. And then next month we got 2 more groups that will come through and that\u2019ll all 100 people. So that\u2019s kind of how we shifted our Inner Circle and it\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s nice because these groups don\u2019t have 30 or 40 people, we\u2019ve got 25, so it gives us where we have more time and less stress. It\u2019s really cool, just perfect right now. The only thing that\u2019s lame is it\u2019s hard because all these people want to join the Inner Circle and they can\u2019t, which is a good problem to have.</p> <p>So I told these guys, \u201cLook, this is how it works. Your seat is here and you\u2019re locked in forever. The only way someone else can get in is if one of you guys leave.\u201d So we have these guys from Ukraine, and one of them, Vlad was like, \u201cI just thought of a good business opportunity for me.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the business opportunity?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cNo more seats are available. I will sell my seat for $50K. I will come as the partner and they will come as the person. I will get just as much value at this thing as everybody else.\u201d I was like, \u201cI guess that\u2019s brilliant.\u201d It made me kind of smile. It\u2019s really fun.</p> <p>We\u2019re having a great time, and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening. So the first\u2026..I wish I could drive with my notebook out, because there have been so many transformational shifts even for myself and I think for everybody else in the group. It\u2019s just been really, really cool. I\u2019m trying to think how deep should I go? And I\u2019m kind of late too because I\u2019ve been dragging my feet a little bit. Not going to lie, I\u2019m a little bit tired. So a couple of the\u2026.let\u2019s see. How much do you guys want to know? I should just do a session where we sit down and I share the top 20 things we got from mastermind. One of the cool ones, I\u2019m curious if any of you are\u2026..it\u2019s hard to explain this without being able to visually show it. How many of your prospects struggle with procrastination when you\u2019re trying to get them to buy from you? So there\u2019s my question for you. I want you to think about it. I\u2019m guessing that most of them do right? It\u2019s the reason why urgency and scarcity are such big driving points.</p> <p>If you look, I\u2019ve done a couple of podcasts on this topic. It\u2019s a big thing. Urgency and scarcity is what gets people to buy. In fact, Justin and Tara Williams are in our group, they\u2019re awesome. He was telling me, \u201cWe pretty much figured out that the only thing that gets people to buy is urgency and scarcity. So once a month we launch something and then take it away so we can have urgency and scarcity.\u201d It\u2019s pretty awesome.\u00a0 But I was like, \u201cWhy does it take urgency and scarcity?\u201d It\u2019s because of procrastination, they procrastinate.</p> <p>So Darrin Stevens, who\u2019s a ninja, a real world ninja. He\u2019s not actually a fighting ninja, but marketing, sales, MLP, hypnosis ninja dude. The guy\u2019s amazing. But what he\u2019s amazing at is so interesting. He runs events and they\u2019ll make $2.5 million over a weekend at an event, which sounds amazing. But when you look at it, his events will have 70 people in the room, which makes it freaking amazing. He\u2019ll close 80%, 90% of the room with a $30K offer. And the events are free for people to come to it. It\u2019s not a buyer event. People come, put the 80 people in the room and he pulls out $2.5 million, it\u2019s insane. I don\u2019t know how he does it. But he was talking about it and showing us a lot of things they do, all about rapport building. It takes them 3 days at an event to get enough rapport to be able to close people at $30K. So they talked a lot about how you build report.</p> <p>His wife Jackie talked about universals and truisms. Universals are things that are universally true like for example, come into the room and trying to get people to say yes subconsciously, over and over. Similar to trial closes I teach, but it\u2019s this subconscious thing. Universals like, \u201cHow many of you guys in the room are business owners?\u201d 90% of the room raises their hands. \u201cHow many of you guys here, work for business owners.\u201d So now everyone\u2019s said yes, because that got everyone. They\u2019re universal. \u201cHow many of you guys in the room are men? How many of you guys are women?\u201d Boom, you just got everyone to say yes, because everyone is a man or woman. Little things that seem dumb, but they\u2019re training the subconscious mind to say yes. That\u2019s universals and truisms are things that are like, \u201cHey it\u2019s a beautiful sunny day out here in Boise, Idaho.\u201d And people are like, \u201cYes, it is a beautiful sunny day here in Idaho.\u201d It\u2019s something that\u2019s true in the moment. So it\u2019s like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re so happy that all of you made it here today.\u201d Did all of them make it there today, yes they did. So that\u2019s a truism.</p> <p>Anyway, they\u2019re using all these universals and truisms to build rapport. They\u2019re using breathing techniques, they\u2019re using all these things to try to build rapport with these people, which is cool. And then this one was the ninja one for me. He talked about procrastination. He\u2019s like, \u201cPeople procrastinate. The reason why\u2026\u201d He draws a picture of a pirate ship on the board and said, \u201cHere\u2019s a pirate ship, who runs the pirate ship? It\u2019s the captain, right? Who actually takes care of the ship? It\u2019s the crew. You\u2019ve got the captain and the crew. Who\u2019s in charge? Obviously the captain\u2019s in charge. The captain is like your subconscious mind. It\u2019s moving things but then the crew is your subconscious mind that\u2019s actually doing all the stuff to make it all happen. What happens when the crew does not like what the captain is doing? It causes a mutiny. That\u2019s what happens.\u00a0 Consciously you\u2019re selling somebody something that subconsciously it\u2019s something out of alignment, so your subconscious has this mutiny which causes procrastination. So how do you get people to not procrastinate?\u201d</p> <p>He did this technique and I wish I could show it to you, but he did it all with his hand. What he does is he starts speaking to the different parts of the subconscious mind. So you have the right hand, I\u2019ll hold up my hand, \u201cOn one hand you guys are really excited and motivated and you really want to be par t of this, but on the other hand,\u201d he holds up the left hand, \u201cOn the other hand you\u2019re freaking out. You\u2019re unsure, you\u2019re insecure, you\u2019ve struggled in the past. Blah blah blah.\u201d So he\u2019s holding up both hands like the right brain and the left brain or whatever. Like two different conversations.</p> <p>Oh crap, I just cut somebody off. Sorry dude. I\u2019m such a bad driver. This is why you shouldn\u2019t be podcasting and driving. It\u2019s as bad or worse than drinking and driving. Good thing we\u2019re in Boise, Idaho which means this guy probably doesn\u2019t have a gun, if we were in California I would be scared for my life, not going to lie.</p> <p>Anyway, so now he\u2019s got two hands up. He\u2019s got one hand he\u2019s got you really want to do this, the other hands like, you\u2019re confused and nervous, and those are the two parts. Conscious and subconscious, the two things that cause someone to procrastinate. It\u2019s these two internal conflicts. So he does this left hand, right hand, and says, \u201cThese two things can come together.\u201d And he brings his hands together. So subconsciously he\u2019s brought the conscious and subconscious mind together and pushes it out. Similar to, have you guys ever played Mortal Kombat? Sub-Zero shoots out the blue fire ball? It\u2019s kind of like that. Right hand, left hand brings them together, clasps his fingers together and then pushes it out like a fireball to the audience. So he\u2019s taking the two parts of the brain, brings them together and then pushes them out to the people. It does that over and over again throughout the event. Every time they\u2019re talking about something, he\u2019s looking like, \u201cWhat are the two conflicting parts of the mind that are keeping this from saying yes?\u201d</p> <p>So it\u2019s like, On the one hand, you probably think it\u2019d be awesome to have Clickfunnels. You\u2019re excited, you think this\u2019ll be easy. But on the other hand you\u2019re thinking I don\u2019t have time, I\u2019m not a techie person, but if we can bring these two things together and then he pushes them out, and help you guys to see the value of this. Then it becomes a no-brainer. Boom, he\u2019s just taking this internal conflict that causes procrastination, he\u2019s brought those two pieces together and pushed them back on the audience and now those conflicts are gone. How ninja is that? How freaking amazing and cool is that?</p> <p>It\u2019s been funny because for the last 3 days now everybody\u2019s been doing fireballs at each other during their presentations and stuff, it\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 For me, this is ninja. I\u2019m totally using it on my stage presentations from now on when I speak and everything else. But where else can I use this? So I\u2019m trying to figure out how to do it with my slides. I\u2019m going to add in my slides something like, add a picture of me with my right hand out, a picture with my left hand out, a picture of me putting them together, and a picture of me pushing it out. And I\u2019ll push through these slides as I teach the concept. On the one hand you\u2019re probably excited, on the other hand you\u2019re probably stressing out, but if we put these things together it\u2019ll help you! Boom. Then you will be successful, and you will join and life will become good.</p> <p>Anyway, that was a cool one. I hope it makes sense when I\u2019m explaining it. But watch the marketing I do in the future, you will see me using this in Periscopes, in videos, in hangouts, in webinars. Because it\u2019s the most ninja, amazing, cool thing I\u2019ve learned in a long, long time. So I\u2019m going crazy, I\u2019m excited. That was just one tiny, itsy bitsy, teeny little nugget we got in the Inner Circle, and it\u2019s been 3 days of a waterfall of things like that.</p> <p>Anyway, I am almost to the hotel now, I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m going to go in there and do some subconscious procrastination killing, Sub-Zero fireballs at people, and I think you guys should too. That\u2019s what I got for today you guys. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day. If you want to get on the waiting list to be in the Inner Circle and one of these guys are crazy enough to not re-up, that\u2019s the only way to get in right now. Just go to Russellbrunson.com, apply there and that\u2019s it. Alright guys, I will talk to you all again very, very soon. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "17:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_232.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1464039565, "title": "Episode #231 \u2013 The Epiphany Bridge", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This is the key to selling almost anything to anyone.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about epiphany\u2019s and how to use them to sell to your audience.

Alright ladies, gentlemen, friends, foes, anyone who\u2019s listening to me right now. Hopefully there\u2019s no foes, but I guarantee there\u2019s people who hate me who are listening though. So those of you guys who are out there hating me and listening to me. Thank you anyway first for subscribing, I appreciate you just as much as the people who love me.</p> <p>Anyway, we\u2019re heading into another week of Inner Circle meetings, so I\u2019m excited. Those who are in the Inner Circle, we basically capped out the group at 100, so if you didn\u2019t make it in, then that was your fault. I\u2019ve been talking about it for 3 years. So it is capped out and sold out. We basically broke it down into 4 groups of 25. So the first group and the second group happen Monday, Tuesday, and then Wednesday, Thursday. And next month will be the next two groups. So if you\u2019re interested in being in, in the future, the only way to get in is if someone else drops out. So those people who hate money will be the ones to drop out. Those who love money and like to get more money will continue to stay in for forever. So that\u2019s kind of how it works. Just cross your fingers and hope somebody hates money and then you\u2019ll have a chance to actually get in. And the way to get in at that time is go to russellbrunson.com and apply, we\u2019ll put you on the waiting list, for if and when that ever opens up again.</p> <p>So that is the pitch for something that\u2019s already sold out. So there you go. For those of you guys who just want to hang out and talk to me while I\u2019m driving, I\u2019ve got an idea for you guys today. I\u2019m going to share this in the meeting, but I thought it was really important and it\u2019s kind of been one of the big epiphany\u2019s I\u2019ve had over the last two weeks or so, as I\u2019ve been thinking through things and looking at stuff that works and why it works. I\u2019m a big believer in\u2026.a lot of times we do stuff unconsciously, we\u2019re unconsciously competent, we do cool things, but we don\u2019t know why they work. So I like going back looking at why did that work. It worked for some reason, and if I understand why that worked maybe I can use it in other places where I can more effectively craft it and engineer it so it\u2019ll do better. So that\u2019s kind of my thoughts.</p> <p>The thing that I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot, I\u2019m not going to call it copywriting, because it\u2019s not that, but it\u2019s related to copywriting. It\u2019s the copywriting sister or something. It\u2019s the way better looking sister too. It\u2019s important. I spoke last week or two weeks ago at a network marketing event, and I didn\u2019t have any notes prepared. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to speak about, I just didn\u2019t know I was going to get up in front of about 100 people, I think about 100 people or so, from the Prove It! Community and talk about what I thought was important. And I was thinking about network marketer. I was literally, they were announcing me, I was like, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to talk about, what should I talk about and I was praying for inspiration. And all the sudden what popped in my head was this concept of a bridge.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve talked about bridge pages before and other things, but I was thinking of this concept of a bridge. I was thinking about how most people, and I\u2019m going to talk about network marketing, but I don\u2019t want that to turn off the non network marketers, because this is true for every business, but network marketing especially.</p> <p>So most of us, we get into a business, whatever business, whatever we\u2019re selling, or whatever the thing we\u2019re in, we\u2019ve gotten there. We didn\u2019t just immediately jump in. What happened is that something happened in our life and it\u2019s somewhere along the line we had this epiphany like, wow I need this thing, this product, this service. Or the reason why you created whatever product you sell, you have this epiphany, so I want you to kind of\u2026..that word epiphany put that in your pocket, we\u2019re going to come back to that in a minute. But you had this epiphany and then because of that you got into whatever it is that you\u2019re selling today. Whatever business it is, there was some epiphany that happened to you that got you into this thing. And then you got into this thing and you became obsessed with it. You started studying it and learning it, you learn all the jargon and the keywords and all these kind of things that came from that. And you became very educated, so now you know all these things about this topic, and now you go and try to sell to other people and your using all these terms and this rational that stuff that logically you learned about the product or services.</p> <p>But you forget that typically you didn\u2019t come into whatever it is you\u2019re selling logically, you came into it emotionally. You had this emotional epiphany that got you into that thing. But then you learned all this logic because you get excited about the topic and then you go try to sell people logic later. And therein lies the issue. One of my friends named Kim Clavier, she\u2019s an old time network marketer, 12, 15 years ago I read one of her books called \u201cIf My Product\u2019s So Great How Come Nobody\u2019s Buying it?\u201d Which is a great title. And in that she talked about this concept of what marketers do and she was talking about network marketers, but this concept is called techno-babble, where they come in and start spewing these terms and phrases and all these things down someone\u2019s throat that they learned, and it totally turns people off. But that\u2019s what we do because we\u2019re so proud. \u201cOh, we\u2019re the number one blah blah, we\u2019ve got the industry leading blah blah, it\u2019s ground breaking.\u201d All this crap that we spew out, all the logical stuff that we learned that strengthened our belief in the product is what we start spewing out at people. And the problem is they never had that initial epiphany. Therefore, all this logic you\u2019re spewing on them, just offends them, totally offends them. It\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s frustrating. Dude, don\u2019t try to pitch me on this crap.</p> <p>So what I was thinking about as I was walking on stage after they introduced me, was this concept of our goal as marketers is we have to give our audience the same epiphany that we had. Because that\u2019s what sells somebody is the epiphany. So if tell someone, \u201cHey I woke up.\u201d Let\u2019s say for me it was ketosis , I always tell people \u201cYour body needs ketosis, it\u2019ll help you lose weight.\u201d all these things and they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat are you talking about.\u201d They don\u2019t know what those words mean. So if I come back and I say, \u201chey what was the epiphany that helped me understand ketosis?\u201d for me I had a friend one time, who was in ketosis and I was totally making fun of him at dinner one time because he was eating chicken and broccoli and not having any dessert. I was like, \u201cDude, you\u2019re a moron.\u201d And he explained ketosis to me, kind of like a campfire. So those of you who are in a Prove It! Company, if you\u2019ve ever seen the campfire explainer video, that\u2019s how I came up with that video. The concept of that video, that\u2019s what bridged this epiphany gap for me, and that is why I am a believer in the product and the service so much, because I had that epiphany, oh this is why it works.</p> <p>So I made that explainer video, all I did was I tried to take people from where I was at and give them the same epiphany I\u00a0 had. That\u2019s the bridge I created to get them over here to my company. So stepping now, is for us as marketers, we have to cut out all the techno-mumbo jumbo crap that we\u2019re so used to saying to try to sell people stuff. Because that\u2019s not what sells them. What sells them is the original epiphany that you had that got you to sell whatever it is that you\u2019re selling. You have to remember what that epiphany was and then the story that gives them the same epiphany you had is the key. So it\u2019s not\u00a0 you telling them your epiphany, because that doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s you telling them a story that gives them the same epiphany that you had. Because when they have that epiphany, that\u2019s the key. Then the selling isn\u2019t hard, it\u2019s easy.</p> <p>So I want you guys thinking about that. Take a step back in time to wherever it is that you were when you had the epiphany that got you into whatever product you\u2019re selling and think about that and figure out what that story was and then figure out how to tell the story. It could be through video, it could be through a sales letter, it could be through a webinar, it could be however, but you\u2019re going to share how you had that epiphany. And when they understand how you had that epiphany, excuse me, when they have that epiphany then they\u2019re in. Then you can support it with all the logic and all the techno-mumbo jumbo that you guys are so proud of, but don\u2019t lead with that, because that will turn them all away. Whereas if you lead with the epiphany and they have that epiphany, they will come seeking the logical explanations, to strengthen that for them. That\u2019s the secret, that\u2019s the key.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m excited. I hope that helps you guys. If you look at how I crafted that story by the way, I had had an epiphany two weeks ago and I was trying to give you that same epiphany. So did it work? I could have just told you that the key is you need to have an epiphany and then you need to have a bridge story to connect that epiphany. If I would have told you that, some of you guys would have been like, alright epiphany, sweet Russell. But because I told that story and the process, I told you guys how I had the epiphany, hopefully some of you guys had it as well. So I practice what I preach. I used on you what I\u2019m telling you to use on your people as well.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that helps. It\u2019s like a dream inside of a dream inside of a dream. Did we just have inception here? Anyway, alright guys, I am in downtown Boise, and the traffic\u2019s crazy. Pretty sure I\u2019m going to wreck, because I\u2019m driving with one hand, shifting with one hand and on the phone with the other hand, so I better go before I die. I appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "10:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_231.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1463692944, "title": "Episode #230 \u2013 I Honestly Thought I Didn\u2019t Have To Pay Taxes\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>PLEASE don\u2019t be as stupid as me.

Alright everybody, I hope things are going amazing. I\u2019ve had an interesting last couple of days. I\u2019m heading home right now to go work on the pinewood derby, which has been another part of my crazy couple of days. But it\u2019s all been good.</p> <p>Monday and Tuesday we had Anthony Diclementi came out Boise, Idaho and we were working on episode number one of Funnel Hacker TV, which the first funnel/business we are building and launching is for Biohackingsecrets.com, coming soon to a funnel near you. It\u2019s kind of exciting. It\u2019s been fun, we\u2019re filming the process and story and everything like that. Also, while we were here, working on biohacking me, with some of the stuff I\u2019m looking for.</p> <p>Trying to get my energy to last longer throughout the day so when I get home at night, all my good energy isn\u2019t wasted on work and I have a ton of energy left over for my kids and wife and everything like that. So that\u2019s been really fun. And then we\u2019re also working on helping me lose a little extra weight, so that I will be a little bit sexier by my\u2026when is it, by summertime. So for those of you reading the transcript, I said that with a lot of sarcasm, that\u2019s not really what I believe, but those listening can hear my voice.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s been really fun. We did all sorts of crazy things. We were doing these breathing exercises in the mornings where you\u2026anyway, it\u2019s kind of cool. We do this huge hardcore, oxygenation thing where you\u2019re breathing fast and heavy to the point of getting light headed until you\u2019re about to pass out, and then you hold your breath. I held my breath for 2 minutes and 40 seconds. Is that insane? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. But if you guys want to do that kind of stuff, it\u2019s in the book and it\u2019s coming out soon. It\u2019s pretty exciting. We held our breath for 2 minutes and 40 seconds. And then when I was done I felt like a million bucks. It was crazy. So I did it yesterday and today, and I\u2019m kind of addicted to that. Not going to lie. So that was cool, and then a whole bunch of ninja, weird things that you will see in episode number one, which is kind of cool. So that\u2019s kind of some of the stuff I\u2019m working on. And I hope you guys are all having fun without me.</p> <p>What I wanted to talk to you guys about today is something that came to me\u2026.My car is like a million degrees. I\u2019m sweating bad. So this is something that happened to me as a young entrepreneur and recently happened to a really close friend. So I want to warn and help all of you guys just in case it happens to you.</p> <p>As a new online marketer I learned how to sell stuff, and people bought stuff and it was awesome. And then I took that money people bought things with and I took it and spent it on other cool stuff I wanted. And it worked really good, it was this perfect circle that worked for 2 years. Until one day, I was at my family reunion, and I was telling my dad, \u201cDad, I\u2019m making money.\u201d Because he was asking, \u201cWhen are you going to get a job.\u201d All those kind of things. \u201cDad, I\u2019m actually making money online now. \u201c and I was showing him. And I was kind of showing him some of the stuff I was doing, the money I was making. \u201cThis campaign I made ten grand, this one over here I made 22 grand.\u201d These little things, and he was excited. He was like, \u201cCool. How are you paying taxes?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo dad, the cool thing about this is it\u2019s the internet. There\u2019s no taxes. You don\u2019t have to pay taxes.\u201d Showing how naive I was. He looked to me, \u201cRussell, you have to pay taxes.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo if you sell online you don\u2019t.\u201d I realized later that might be true with sales tax in some states, but it\u2019s not true with income tax. I had lesson number one. Lesson number two was, \u201cWho\u2019s doing your books.\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means. I read a lot of books, is that what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo. Someone\u2019s gotta be making sure that you\u2019re making money, not losing money. All these things.\u201d I was like, \u201c I don\u2019t even know. This is all foreign to me dad.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cLet me help you because I don\u2019t want you to go to jail.\u201d</p> <p>So he came and flew to Boise once a month for probably 3 or 4 months. And he tried to catch up my books, so he\u2019s going through my Paypal account and going through my check register. If he asked me, my check register was horrible. I literally had a whole bunch of checks, and I\u2019d write the check and give it somebody and I would write the date and the dollar amount in my register and that was it. I wouldn\u2019t write who it was to or what it was for, or anything. I don\u2019t even think I wrote the day, I just wrote the dollar amount on the stub thing. So he\u2019s like, \u201cI got a whole bunch of check numbers with dollar amounts but I have no idea what they are for.\u201d\u00a0 We had a whole Paypal account with thousands of transactions that we didn\u2019t what they were for or anything.</p> <p>It was 2 or 3 years worth of that stuff, so he came up once a month for two days at a time, trying to catch me up and get me to the point where I wasn\u2019t going to be in big trouble if the government came and asked me what I was doing. We figured out how much money I actually owed the government, and we paid that. Then from that point forward, we were at a clean slate and we could actually move forward. That has been hugely important and successful in any kind of businesses. So that\u2019s something that was really needed for me.</p> <p>A little while after my dad came to one of my events and kind of told that story to our audience, and he talked about also business structuring. I wasn\u2019t structured at all, so I was paying all these extra taxes, FICA and Medicare and a whole bunch of other things. And I had no protection, so if someone would have sued me because of ZipBrander or one of my initial, my early products. How to make a potato gun. If they would have sued me, I would have been in big trouble, whereas now we have protected ourselves. In fact, we\u2019re working on a webinar right now with him called Creditors and Predators, it\u2019s like how to structure your business to protect yourself from people who want your money. It can be the government, it can be lawyers, it could be a lot of things. And so that\u2019s kind of the thing we\u2019re working on.</p> <p>But he came and talked about that with our group, and he offered to help set up people\u2019s businesses, as well as do bookkeeping and stuff like that. So he built up a little small team of people to do bookkeeping. And he kind of does it now for internet entrepreneurs like me and like you. It\u2019s not a huge business but he\u2019s got\u2026.in fact, he at that one event spoke and signed up 8 or 9 people at that event, and then since then it\u2019s all been word of mouth. A lot of you guys I know are using him just because of word of mouth, but he\u2019s never once promoted or advertised since then. It\u2019s been like probably 7 years. And it\u2019s just been word of mouth among marketers like us.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s kind of the back story. So what happened, fast forward now a little while later, one of my close friends who does some work for me. I was like, \u201cHey man, I need help with this thing.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019m stressing out about taxes.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy are you stressing about taxes?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cI haven\u2019t paid them in two years, trying to figure this out. I\u2019m going to go to jail. I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay man, I\u2019ve been through this I know exactly what you\u2019re going through. Here\u2019s my dad\u2019s email, email him and you\u2019ll be saved.\u201d And then he did, and within two or three weeks my dad\u2019s team caught him up and got him to today. Got him covered for back taxes and now moving forward has been a clean slate. And my buddy is like, \u201cDude, the stress is at zero. I love your dad, thank you so much for that.\u201d And it made me think, I\u2019m betting a ton of you guys that are using Clickfunnels, that are on my podcast, that are just reading our stuff are probably in that situation.</p> <p>Either one of two things. One is that you are behind on your books, or you\u2019ve never kept books, or you\u2019ve been selling stuff and hoping it never catches up to you. If that is you and you\u2019re in that spot right now, I\u2019m here to give you a life line. The second type of person is someone who maybe you started on a business you created, an LLC or something and you threw it up and hoping everything is right, but you have no idea if your structured right, you have no idea if your taxes are right, you have no idea with whatever. Which was also me. Or you\u2019re structured but you\u2019re not doing any entity layering, so you don\u2019t have one company that holds your assets, and one that\u2019s working in public, so if someone sued you, they can\u2019t take away your websites and things like that. If you\u2019re in either of those situations where you\u2019d like to make your structuring better, more solid to protect yourself from creditors or predators, or you need to get caught up on taxes, or you\u2019re paying too much for a bookkeeper that sucks. Any of those reasons are good reasons to contact my dad. He is insanely cheap. I keep telling him that he needs to raise his prices. He specializes in rich internet marketers yet he\u2019s charging super discounted booking fees. Cheaper than you can get from a typical bookkeeper, which again I\u2026\u2026</p> <p>Anyway, you can never profit in your home town. I\u2019m like, \u201cDad, first step one, you need to double your prices, and that should be the entry. Plus you need to charge people 10 grand to set up the entity.\u201d All sorts of stuff. He also, he told me this too and this is insane. So for those of you guys, if he does the bookkeeping for you, a lot of times they do your taxes at the end of the year for free. It\u2019s just insanely cheap and inexpensive, at least for today. It will not be for forever, because I am working on a webinar with him, which I mentioned earlier called Creditors and Predators. And he wants me to do the webinar which I\u2019m excited for except for the fact that, if I\u2019m going to do that two things have to happen. First off is\u00a0 Zuckerburg has gotta get paid, and second off, I gotta get paid. Therefore I am more than doubling, probably 3x-ing the price so that Zuckerburg can get paid for Facebook ads, and I can get paid for me helping him to pitch his services. So that\u2019s coming in the very near future.</p> <p>And most of you guys will be on that webinar, and you will be amazed at what you are missing in your business, you will realize that your entity structure is wrong. You realize you\u2019re over paying for bookkeeping. You realize that your back in back taxes, you\u2019re paying too much in taxes, a bunch of things like that. And when you are sold in that webinar it will be too late, because at that point the prices will be normal. But for those of you guys who are Marketing in Your Car listeners, you\u2019ve got a window here. My dad just finished tax season, and his people just finished everybody and he\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got room for a few more people. Not a lot, maybe 5 or 10 people max to come in and we can get them all caught up and set up between now and when the webinar goes live.\u201d So if that is you guys, and you are looking for any of those things, entity structuring, protections, lowering taxes, someone doing your bookkeeping, somebody to catch you up, somebody to look at your entrepreneurial business when you realize you\u2019re selling stuff and that\u2019s all that you\u2019re doing and you want some help, I highly recommend my dad.</p> <p>He saved me, he saved tons of other of my friends and colleagues in this business and he\u2019s here to save you as well. So this is my gift to you guys for being Marketing In Your Car listeners. I get zero dollars and zero cents for recommending this, outside of the fact that when I go home for Thanksgiving dinner, my dad feeds me Thanksgiving dinner and that\u2019s pretty sweet. So that\u2019s payback for that and the fact that he pretty much supported me my whole life. So I get nothing out of this, it\u2019s something that\u2019s a service for you and it\u2019s something that I think a lot of you guys are benefiting. I would say if you\u2019re anywhere from the start up phase, to probably two or three million dollars in revenue, maybe up to 5 million, that sweet spot is about where most of the clients they\u2019re working with now are, so that\u2019s a good fit. You get above that, it might be smart to get somebody in house to run everything, that\u2019s what we had to do as well. We had to get a full time CFO to manage everything for us because it\u2019s gotten a little bit crazy over here.</p> <p>But that is what I wanted to share with you guys today, so if you\u2019re interested in that, just email my dad, his secret email address is ross@bookease.com. Yeah, if you go to the website, the websites not even done, it\u2019s an old website because he was going to get setup, then he started getting referrals like crazy so he never finished it. So if you go to the site you will see an unfinished website. In fact, I need to make that a Clickfunnel page, so I will make that, add that to my to-do list for my dad.</p> <p>Anyway that\u2019s kind of what happening. So if you need help, you can go to my dad, tell him I sent you. Say, \u201cI heard it on the podcast, I\u2019m in.\u201d and he will get you setup and figured out. That\u2019s about it you guys. Other than that, don\u2019t do what I did and think that you don\u2019t have to pay taxes, because I really honestly thought that, which is kind of funny now. So that\u2019s it you guys, I\u2019m about headed home. Headed to the pinewood derby weigh ins. They weigh them the night before, which is kind of funny and then they lock down all the cars. So then the next night they have the weigh in\u2019s that way nobody can go and through on a whole bunch of weight over night. It\u2019s kind of funny. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. It\u2019s going to be really fun. So that\u2019s what I got for you guys. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "13:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_230.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1463437051, "title": "Episode #229 \u2013 Marketing In Your Tesla!", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Come hang out with me while I\u2019m driving with my hands off the wheel.</p> <p>On this special episode Russell drives a Tesla while talking to Michael Rutherford about how he became the top earner at Prove It!

Alright everyone, I\u2019m in San Diego right now. I\u2019m driving by Sea World. I\u2019m in a Tesla driving, I\u2019m going 70 miles an hour and my hands are not on the wheel, my feet are not on the ground. I\u2019m floating, it\u2019s the craziest thing in the world. So I thought what better time to do Marketing In Your Car than right now. Because I don\u2019t even need to be looking\u2026.I\u2019m going 72 right now, I\u2019m looking backwards, no hands on the wheel, I\u2019m looking at the camera\u2019s around me. This is freaking nuts; I don\u2019t know how this is legal. You\u2019d think that when Elon Musk was like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a car that you don\u2019t have to look at the road..\u201d Oh it\u2019s slowing me down.</p> <p>Speaker 2: The car in front of you is slowing down, so it slows down automatically.</p> <p>Russell: Oh weird. So the car in front of me slowed down so it automatically slowed me down. You think that the government would be like, \u201cElon no, people are going to get in wrecks.\u201d And instead he was like, \u201cWe\u2019er going to do it anyway.\u201d And now I\u2019m driving it. I\u2019m not even driving the car, I\u2019m sitting in the passenger seat and this is insane. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now as we speak. We\u2019re actually filming an episode of the reality TV show. We\u2019re at the Prove It event right now. I spoke at it earlier today, we\u2019ve been documenting this whole journey which has been really fun. So when Funnel Hacker TV comes out make sure you watch the episode on Prove It funnels. Do I need to grab the wheel?</p> <p>Speaker 2: Just touch it so it knows you\u2019re alive. Alright you\u2019re good.</p> <p>Russell: Cool. Anyway, so today we went and talked to the leadership team and got them all fired up about the new Ketone funnels coming out. We got 2 funnels coming out for them. And then right now we\u2019re driving the Tesla to the Tesla dealership, because I\u2019m getting a Tesla through Prove It, which is\u00a0 kind of cool. So if you guys haven\u2019t won a Clickfunnels car yet, you can come to Prove It and get a Tesla car. You can get 2 cars, one for every other day of the week, that way you\u2019d never have to drive the same car twice in a row.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s pretty insane. If you guys haven\u2019t driven in a Tesla yet, this is really weird. I seriously feel like I\u2019m about to die, I\u2019m on the edge of my seat. So I\u2019m sitting here with Michael Rutherford, who is the\u2026.are you the number one money earner? I know you don\u2019t want to brag about it, but are you?</p> <p>Michael: Yeah.</p> <p>Russell: Number one money earner at Prove It right now and tell them something cool.</p> <p>Michael: Okay so the\u2026.about Prove It or just in general? Or about the car?</p> <p>Russell: This is marketing guys, they want to know about marketing. How did you become the number one money earner in Prove It, I\u2019m curious?</p> <p>Michael: Lit myself on fire, utilized the product to its highest capability and I told every living being that would listen to me for even the smallest amount of time, and I did it with a high level of passion, belief and expectation and I didn\u2019t care what they thought and I just kept going. And the really cool thing is results follow passion. If you have passion take action and results will come and it\u2019s like a pinwheel. When you get a little result, you\u2019ll take more action which creates more belief, which you\u2019ll take more action, give you more belief, get more results and it just keeps going and going. And then the next thing you know, a car that costs 6 figures that drives itself shows up in your driveway and you get to drive it for free because you gave people the option to buy a product that would change their life. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do, doesn\u2019t matter what you sell, what you share, or what you teach, what you coach. Doesn\u2019t matter what you do, do it with a high level of passion and don\u2019t stop. Just do it more than anybody else and you\u2019ll be number one, if that\u2019s your goal. Maybe your goal is just to find passion, so take action and passion will find you. That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really been fun. So it\u2019s crazy cool to hold the camera with Russell while he\u2019s driving, or while the Tesla\u2019s driving us.</p> <p>Russell: He\u2019s filming me, I\u2019m recording him.</p> <p>Michael: We got another camera in the back seat and the car\u2019s driving us.</p> <p>Russell: I wonder if Brandon\u2019s getting nervous back there. He\u2019s holding the camera watching us not watching the road. It\u2019s just crazy.</p> <p>Michael: Hey guys, life is crazy if you dare to take big action. And it\u2019ll reward you every time.</p> <p>Russell: How long you had your Tesla for?</p> <p>Michael: I\u2019ve had my Tesla for 3 weeks and it\u2019s currently being completely Prove It customized at a place here in San Diego called SD Wraps.</p> <p>Russell: Is that where we\u2019re going right now?</p> <p>Michael: We\u2019re going to the Tesla dealership and depending on time, there\u2019s a place called SD Wraps that\u2019s got Lamborghini\u2019s, Bentley\u2019s, Tesla\u2019s. The coolest cars all being wrapped and customized by them. So yeah, it\u2019s pretty wild.</p> <p>Russell: That\u2019s awesome. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. So there you go you guys. There\u2019s some words of wisdom. Now you can say you guys have all been in a Tesla with me. Because you\u2019ve been sitting in a Tesla with me for the last 4 minutes 29 seconds in Marketing In Your Car time. That\u2019s what I got for you guys today. Tonight I\u2019m speaking at the No Excuses event. We\u2019re going to be presenting the MLM version of the Funnel Hacks presentation that I spent the last week building out. Oh, it\u2019s telling me to hold the steering wheel again. Are we going to the right spot or do I need to ... We\u2019re going the right way.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m going to be testing out that presentation and the offer tonight. To the network marketing industry and we\u2019re going to be sharing how funnels work in the offline world. I don\u2019t know if you know that, I\u2019m showing them tonight the Home Party Funnel, the Hotel Meeting Funnel, and the\u2026I haven\u2019t thought of a cool name for the third one, but I\u2019m showing this is how hotel meetings happen, this is the online equivalent. This is how home parties happen, this is the equivalent. So it\u2019s going to be awesome. I\u2019m excited. There you go guys. I\u2019m going to check out and make sure I don\u2019t die. But I want you guys winning a car, either through Clickfunnels, Dream Car Contest. You can go to whatsyourdreamcar.com, or come join me in Prove It and win a Tesla through here.

I know, I know. I swore I\u2019d never do these things again, I swore I was gonna wake up at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but It\u2019s becoming crunch time. A whole bunch of things are happening and I\u2019m running out of hours in the day to get them all done. I\u2019m speaking this weekend at a network marketing event. Actually 2 network marketing events. One of them is for Prove it, I\u2019m going to be getting these guys all excited for the Prove It funnels we\u2019ve been creating for them, so I\u2019m trying to get those done. There was a big yawn.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019ve got some work to do to get those done still. We\u2019ve got one of them that\u2026.two of them we\u2019ll be showing off at the event, hopefully one we\u2019ll be launching on what day is it? The next Tuesday. That\u2019s kind of the game plan there. Then I\u2019m speaking at the No Excuses event, and I was going to just do my Funnel Hacks webinar that we\u2019ve been doing forever, but I really felt like I wanted to do one that\u2019s more focused on how people can use Clickfunnels for network marketing. Because everyone always asks me, \u201chey, show me a network marketing funnel.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, technically all funnels are network marketing funnels. The power of network marketing funnels are share funnels. That\u2019s the magic behind it.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to show them how the whole process works. So yeah, that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m re-writing the whole webinar. And it took forever the first day. I think I might have messaged you guys about that. It took me quite a few hours to just figure out the headline. That was hard. And then the 3 secrets, I had to re-write a whole bunch\u2026.a ton of time, 2 or 3 hours worth and then finally got it. Then I started building the actual framework of the webinar, and trying to make the stories and interesting parts. I realized there were a couple of things that would be really cool if they were sketched out. The dude that does all the sketches in my books, his name is Vlad. So Vlad had to sketch, I do a really ugly sketch, then I send it to him and then he turns it into an awesome sketch. So I was getting all those done tonight, because he doesn\u2019t work for me full time anymore. So usually I give them to him and hopefully by the next morning he\u2019s got them. I messaged him earlier today like, \u201cPlease, can you jump on tonight?\u201d So I just finished sketching those out and handed those off to him, and then I just got a message from him 2 minutes ago saying he was on them right now. By the time I wake up I should have all the sketches done.</p> <p>Then I just gotta start plugging all the webinar together. I have to create a couple of demos because it\u2019s always scary to do demo\u2019s at a hotel event because half the time the internet goes down. So I gotta create demos tomorrow. Also Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s webinar is coming up. I gotta write all the email sequences, prior to actually writing custom ones for them. Because next week\u2019s the webinar for their list.\u00a0 I think the last webinar they did, I had 10 or 15 thousand people registered. So we\u2019re trying to make sure we capitalize on it right and do it correctly. So we\u2019re kind for writing a bunch of stuff for them and make it a custom funnel. I think they\u2019re going to start promoting it on Monday, and then the webinar is happening on Thursday through the weekend. So anyway, just a lot of pieces happening between now and then. So that\u2019s why\u2026.hence the late night, and not an early morning tomorrow, probably.</p> <p>So anyway, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening over here. I just wanted to jump on and say hi to you guys. Excuse me. I should not be this tired, but I am. What else cool could I share with you guys? How about this? So a couple of cool things, I\u2019m not even sure before, but they\u2019ve been really impactful. You know we always talk about funnels, that\u2019s obviously a big topic of conversation with me and you guys. So you look at, where\u2019s traffic coming from, what\u2019s up-sell one and up-sell two, down-sell, where\u2019s it go, what\u2019s the next funnel? Look at that progress. But now we\u2019re trying to look deeper and deeper in each step of the funnel and how we can make things better. I told you how I had a call a while ago with some VC guys, and the numbers they were looking heavily were a cost to acquired customer, average lifetime value customer and churn. So churn is something we\u2019re looking at a lot. So what we\u2019ve been doing is adding in stick sequences into everything. So if you join Clickfunnels, and everyone should have got it by now, so you should have probably seen this, but we put everyone through a 21 day ignite your funnel on-boarding sequence. So every day for 21 days you get an email talking about the on-boarding process. So that was a big thing that had a huge increase, decrease in churn, increase in stick.</p> <p>So Funnel University we just rolled out, I think I had a 9 or 10 day email sequence that\u2019s all about stick strategy. How do we get people to stick in Funnel University? For me it\u2019s all about letting them know what they actually get. Because a lot of times people sign up to get the free thing and they don\u2019t know what they are able to consume, so really showing inside the members area and showing them what\u2019s inside the software. Showing people things deeper. So those are a bunch of cool things that we\u2019re doing. So I would recommend for you guys, look at that. Look at post buy sequences. What are you doing to get those people to like you more? And to consume what you have? Consumption is the key. If we can get people to consume its awesome.</p> <p>And then one last thing that I wanted to share with you guys because I\u2019m really excited. IF you go to Google and search for cross fit college humor. The first video that pops up, click and play that video. It\u2019s my favorite video ever. I think it\u2019s the only Youtube video I watched like ten times. It\u2019s these guys at Cross fit, they keep messing up saying Cross fit\u2019s a cult, I mean it\u2019s a way of life. And it\u2019s so funny. Anyway, there\u2019s two or three episodes of these guys doing the Cross-fit/Cult thing. I always joke when we were building Clickfunnels, we wanted to build our own community. So I always joke, I think I\u2019ve said a couple of times on the thing, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build our own cult, I mean community.\u201d And that comes from that episode, it\u2019s always the standing joke. Anyway, we just started a design on this new t-shirt. It\u2019s so awesome. It says, \u201cFunnel hacking, it\u2019s a cult\u201d and then \u201cCult\u201d is crossed out and it says, \u201cWay of life\u201d so \u201cFunnel hacking, it\u2019s a way of life.\u201d But cult is crossed out. And then on the back it says #itsacult. Anyway, congratulations, you\u2019re part of the funnel hacking cult. No, but it all comes from that video. So now you guys know the inside joke. When those shirts come out you\u2019ll be like, \u201cI know where Russell came up with that and why he thinks it\u2019s so hilarious.\u201d Hopefully it doesn\u2019t offend anyone; I just think it\u2019s funny.</p> <p>There you go. Alright I\u2019m home. I\u2019m going to bed. Oh crap, except for the garage door opener is not in my car. I\u2019ve got two cars and one garage door opener so I always shift them back and forth, and I\u2019m in the wrong car. That means I get to get out of my car and actually go in and unlock it, actually I\u2019m going to go, because the wrestling room lights are on, so I\u2019m going to walk back here. Hopefully you guys don\u2019t mind hanging out with me. I don\u2019t know what else to talk to about right now. Everyone else in the whole world is asleep. So the other cool thing that\u2019s happening is next week, Monday and Tuesday Anthony DiClementi, we\u2019re launching a company together called Bio-hacking Secrets, and he\u2019s actually flying out here and we\u2019re going to be filming him. He\u2019s part of one of the first episodes of the Funnel Hacker TV. So that\u2019s going to be really cool. We\u2019re going to be filming him and me; we\u2019re going to work out here in the wrestling room. I\u2019m going to take him through a wrestling work out and show him it doesn\u2019t matter how good a shape he\u2019s in, but when a wrestler takes the oxygen away from your brain, you can\u2019t survive. Cause there\u2019s always him beating the crap out of me for the next two days, so I got a shot for a little bit, and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re going to be doing. Oh man, its dark back here.</p> <p>And then\u2026\u2026yeah anyway. Just a lot of fun things happening over the next two weeks. So he\u2019ll be here Monday, Tuesday filming. And then Wednesday is the Robert Kiyosaki webinar. And after that\u2019s done, I\u2019M going to take a nap, because it\u2019s been an insane 10 days. It\u2019ll be cool.</p> <p>Oh and then another thing that happened today. Sorry, you guys are getting all the stuff because I have no one else to tell all these things, so you\u2019re getting it all. Marcus Lemonis text me today and said, \u201cHey, What\u2019s your email address? I need to get you to come out and record a show with me.\u201d So we just emailed his producers and they\u2019re trying to figure out a date in the next 3 weeks for me to fly out and go film or be in one of the episodes of the Profit. How crazy is that? It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m excited. Alright guys I\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019m really tired and I\u2019m totally rambling, but hopefully some of those ramblings are fun for you guys, because they\u2019re fun for me. Have a great night and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "10:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_228.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1462916963, "title": "Episode #227 \u2013 Your Opinion Does NOT Matter\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>You have to get your customers to vote with their credit card.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about why your opinion doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to marketing.

Alright everybody, I hope you are all doing amazing. I had two days in a row of 5am wake ups. So this is good, I\u2019m getting into the cycle, into the late night, or early night going to bed, late night, or early morning\u2026..yeah early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy wealthy and wise. Is that true? Well, I hope so. I\u2019m testing it out right now. It\u2019s been going good so far. This morning I was working on the Funnel University stick sequence and one of the emails talks about this article I wrote one time called Your Opinion Doesn\u2019t Matter, or it might have been Guess What? Your Opinion Doesn\u2019t Matter. I think I said it more like that.</p> <p>Anyway, I pulled up the article and I reread it and it made me laugh and smile and I wanted to share it with you guys because it\u2019s important. And the fact is your opinion really does not matter when it comes to marketing. In that article I talked about how one morning, this is back when we were in the middle of the Rippln Launch and I had done this video and one of my buddies texted me at 5 in the morning, he was like, \u201cHey man, you\u2019re on Tech Crunch.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat? I\u2019m on Tech Crunch? This is awesome.\u201d And then his next text was, \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh crap.\u201d So I went to Tech Crunch and there was an article. And the title of the article was titled: What Not To Do In Your Startup Launch Video or something like that. And I start reading this thing and he goes line by line through the copy for the sales video I created, and he just ripped it apart. He hated it, venomously. Is that the right word? He was so mean about every single thing and just ripped it line after line. And at first I was like, my heart sunk, I was sick to my stomach.</p> <p>And then I stopped for a minute and started thinking, well all these things were his opinions about why he hated this video and why it was not a good video for a tech startup and all these things, but then I started looking at the numbers and what we had achieved with that little cheesy video that he hated so much. And I can\u2019t remember, at the time I think it generated 300 or 400 thousand opt-in members. And we were average 30 thousand opt-ins a day from this one video. And I was like, it may be that he didn\u2019t like it, but it didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t work. It was working perfectly. And I started thinking back, about all the split testing stuff that we used to do. The way Todd and I used to do our split testing, I would go and create the best version I possibly could and he would make up these tests, and half the tests I was so embarrassed by. I was like, \u201cDon\u2019t do that, it looks bad.\u201d Things I didn\u2019t like. And I was like, \u201cNo there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to beat my control. The thing I created is perfect. This is my opinion.\u201d And 9 times out of 10 Todd would beat my control. Almost every time.</p> <p>I realized really quickly, my opinion doesn\u2019t matter. I have my opinion but it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters Is how people vote. And it\u2019s funny because a lot of times we think, I\u2019ve seen\u2026.drives me crazy, businesses that run survey groups, have people fill out surveys, all these kinds of things to try to get feedback on their product. What they\u2019re going to buy or not buy and all these things. And there\u2019s a time and a place for those things. But the reality is that none of that matters either. The only thing that actually matters is will customers vote with their credit card. That\u2019s it. If they will not pull their credit card out of their wallet and vote with their credit card it doesn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>They can say, \u201cOh yeah, I would definitely buy that product.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m definitely more like this.\u201d Or whatever. They\u2019ll tell you whatever. Whatever it is you\u2019re looking at, but the only thing that matters is not your opinion, it\u2019s not even your customer\u2019s opinion. The only thing that actually matters is them voting with their credit card. That\u2019s how they vote. They can\u2019t vote by saying, \u201cYes I would do that. Oh yeah, I\u2019d buy that.\u201d Only way that they can vote is by actually pulling their credit card out, that\u2019s the only vote that matters, that is if you look at\u2026.that\u2019s how it should be with the presidency. You should vote, but you should vote with your credit card. And the more money you\u2019re willing to spend voting on a candidate, the more votes you get. Because then it actually matters. The only thing that actually matters is how they vote with their credit card. That\u2019s the only truth, everything else is opinion and opinions don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, as a marketing educator, it drives me crazy watching other marketing educators, and a lot of them say blanket statements that they feel are true, that I know aren\u2019t true. And I\u2019m not going to tell all the specifics, because the person\u2019s really cool. But I\u2019m in a Mastermind Group, and they wanted me to give a talk, a short talk. So I was giving this short talk, ahead of time they had this public speaking coach, who wanted to get on the phone with me and walk through my talk with me. So I got on and was kind of interested in what he had to say, and what was interesting was that he kept sharing all these opinions about the stuff I was doing wrong and how I should have done it instead and all these things. And while I have a lot of respect for the guy and his opinions, I know that his opinions were wrong. Not because I\u2019m arrogant or I\u2019m boastful or anything like that, I might be but that\u2019s not the reason I knew they were wrong.</p> <p>I knew they were wrong because I had split tested these messages. I had split tested the verbiage and how I used it. I knew which one out converted. He used to tell me, \u201cNo you have to go this way.\u201d And I was like ugh. I was respectful and I was like, okay. And I did it that way for him and for the group, but I knew it was wrong. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, that his opinion was wrong because we had split tested. And I wanted to step back and be like, \u201cBut you know, I have run hundreds of thousands, if not millions of visitors through a path, that uses the message, you\u2019re trying to get me to use, vs the one I\u2019m using here and I know that this one wins. Every single time. I don\u2019t even have to guess any more. It\u2019s not worth testing anymore because I know based on millions of people voting or not voting with their credit card, that I\u2019m right. And it\u2019s just killing me because\u2026\u2026but I respected him and the situation so I followed that even though I knew it was wrong.</p> <p>And I just want all you guys to understand, our opinions really don\u2019t matter. I get people in the Inner Circle all the time, \u201cRussell, can you look at this page and give me your opinion?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to give you my opinion. My opinion could dramatically screw things up. As we\u2019re building I will give you my opinion because this is the direction I would go, based on everything I know, this is the best chance of success, so create that first and then I\u2019m not going to give you a review because my opinion doesn\u2019t matter. The only opinion that matters, is the opinion of the buyers in your specific market. So create it the best you can, and then you go and you buy ads, and you get people to come, and then they vote with their credit card, and that\u2019s how we know if we got a winner. If people vote with their credit card. If they don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care how pretty it is, how many awards it wins, or how nice it sounds. The only thing that matters, when all is said and done, is will people vote with their credit card. And that\u2019s the key.\u201d</p> <p>So the sooner you are okay humbling yourselves, I\u2019m the same way, I have to continue to humble myself and I do every time Todd destroys me in a split test, every time something I create doesn\u2019t work, or every time we test things and we figure out things that do work, I get humbled every single time. I realize that man, I\u2019m not as great as I think I am. My opinion does not matter. The only opinion that matters is that of my customers who are pulling their credit cards out and voting.</p> <p>So watch that closely. Watch what is causing them to vote with their credit card and watch what\u2019s not. And that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to learn and that\u2019s what you should base your judgment and opinions on. Not on what you like or don\u2019t like, because what you like doesn\u2019t matter. The guy at Tech Crunch did not like my copy, yet it was probably the highest converting message I had ever written. And because he thought it was wrong, does not make it wrong. People were voting, and that\u2019s the only thing that really matters. So there\u2019s your marketing lesson for today. I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go get some work done and try to get some customers to vote with their credit cards. So that\u2019s the plan. Anyway, I appreciate you all. Have a great day and we\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "09:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_227.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1462574674, "title": "Episode #226 \u2013 How To Confuse The VC\u2019s", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Why it\u2019s hard to be a Mom (as a Dad), and my interesting call with the VC\u2019s today.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about a meeting he had with some VC\u2019s during which he confused them by already being profitable.

Hey everyone, yes I\u2019m taking mom duty on today. I\u2019ve got Norah in the back seat, we\u2019re going to pick up Aiden from school. I happen to be one minute late already. It\u2019s hard to be a mom, no one ever told me this, but it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>Anyway, so that\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. The reason why I\u2019m a little bit late, is we just got off a call with some VC people, which is kind of cool. First off, they\u2019re super cool people, I really enjoy them and everything. But it was interesting conversation. You guys want to hear behind the scenes of some of the funny stuff? In fact, I\u2019m going to title this podcast, how to confuse the VC\u2019s. Because it\u2019s interesting, they have been trying to talk to us for a while and we basically said, \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for money, sorry.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWe know you\u2019re not, but we still wanna talk.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not interested.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cPlease? We\u2019ll fly out to Boise.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cNo.\u201d Anyway, so finally got the call set up. But it\u2019s just funny. I feel like we\u2019re in a good position\u2026.Can you guys hear Norah back there, guys?</p> <p>Anyway, I feel like we\u2019re in a good position. I told my team, \u201cI feel like we\u2019re the hot girl that doesn\u2019t really want it, so everybody wants her so much more.\u201d Anyway, we\u2019re not interested in taking it, but we thought it might be fun to talk to them. Maybe, who knows? Whatever. But we had a conversation, and it was cool. Like I said, super cool guys, enjoyed that whole thing. But it was interesting, if you look at what they\u2019re looking for, there\u2019s 3 core metrics that the VC\u2019s want. They want what\u2019s the cost to acquire a customer? What\u2019s the lifetime value of that customer? And what\u2019s your churn? Those are the 3 core metrics that they asked about that we kind of knew going into it.\u00a0 And what\u2019s cool is that because of all the funnel stuff that we do, and hopefully you guys are doing, it totally confuses the VC\u2019s.</p> <p>They have one way of doing things. What\u2019s your cost to acquire a customer? And we\u2019re like, \u201cAll of our customer\u2019s are free.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t make sense. How much does it cost?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, if we buy ads from Facebook straight leads to a trial, it\u2019s like $150 a member.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really good.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really good but we don\u2019t do it.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it? You should be spending that money all day long.\u201d \u201cBecause we\u2019re a start up boot strap. The money we\u2019re spending is out of my own pocket, and we\u2019re good enough at funnels, that if I\u2019m not profitable at breakeven point of sale, I don\u2019t want to do it. I don\u2019t want to go in the whole too much. If I had a hundred million dollars in VC\u2019s, sure we\u2019ll go waste money on dumb marketing, but we are smart enough to be profitable up front. This is how it works, we\u2019ve got front-end offers, or my free book offers, or The Perfect Webinar script or things like that. What happens, is we buy ads on Facebook, cost us $10-$15 to acquire a customer there, but we make $30-$45 in the funnel, therefore we make $25-$30 from every single customer that comes into our world. And we have a huge follow-up sequence in place that we promote that then gives us all of customers for free. In fact, we make money ahead of time, before they ever become a customer, and then our email sequence gets them into our program for free.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019re like, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d I don\u2019t think they believed us. I was like, \u201cNo, this is how it works. We do have a customer acquisition cost on different channels, like affiliates we pay out 40% up to 45%, we give away cars and stuff.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat? You give away cars? Why would you do that?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBecause that\u2019s awesome. That\u2019s how it works. It\u2019s all about recruiting sales teams. Then people come in now we\u2019re selling on-board, we\u2019re selling certifications, things like that. So we\u2019re crazy profitable.\u201d They don\u2019t understand it because they come from worlds that aren\u2019t profitable typically. So we\u2019re showing them our numbers and then we show them the numbers and he\u2019s like, \u201cWow. I don\u2019t think you guys understand what you guys have right here.\u201d I was like, \u201cYes, we do. This is why we\u2019re not looking to take money. Everything\u2019s fine. We\u2019re really good at funnels.\u201d Then the next question was, lifetime value of a customer, right. That one was an easier metric, but we\u2019ve only been in business for a year and a half so it\u2019s hard because our customers have to start using us, if they don\u2019t leave us very high. So we showed what the lifetime value of a customer was, but it\u2019s not accurate because the numbers are growing so fast. Alright I\u2019m at the school, I gotta pick up Aiden, I\u2019ll finish up this podcast when I get back.</p> <p>Alright, I got Aiden and he\u2019s talking about some movie called Norah.com?</p> <p>Aiden: No it was called Coconutcron.com</p> <p>Russell: Coconutcron.com. Anyway, to finish off my thought\u2026.oh wait, what?</p> <p>Aiden: Also, do you want me to tell you a story?</p> <p>Russell: Yes, tell us a story.</p> <p>Aiden: Okay, so at first starts with Norah.com and its\u2026.wait, I actually kind of forgot it Dad.</p> <p>Russell: Alright, so that\u2019s Norah.com. Alright, let me talk\u2026</p> <p>Aiden: That\u2019s only half of it.</p> <p>Russell: I\u2019m going to talk for a minute and if you wanna tell them the rest of the story tell me okay.</p> <p>Alright so the last have of the story is Churn. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your churn?\u201d we\u2019re like, \u201cIf you look at the last 3 or 4 months, it\u2019s decreased dramatically.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201chow much?\u201d and we\u2019re like, \u201cwell I think it before it was at 16% and we added in this one step in the funnel and it dropped it to 12% and then we added in this 21 day ignite your funnel, communication funnel, our on-boarding funnel after they come on, and we dropped down to 9%.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cYou dropped it that much in a short period of time?\u201d and we\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what we do. We test things, we test all the steps and process and try to decrease churn and we\u2019re always looking to get it better and better and better.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, it was just so funny because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re used to these kinds of things. They\u2019re used to having a bunch of money and spending tons to acquire a customer. I was listening to a thing the other day and it talked about Hubspot. They said that Hubspot cost them $10,000 to acquire a customer. Excuse me, maybe it was $1,000 to acquire a customer. Something crazy like that. I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d It\u2019s so much easier when you understand what you guys understand, what we understand with all these front end funnels. That\u2019s the magic. And then the webinar funnels are profitable, dramatically profitable up front. It doesn\u2019t make sense to them.</p> <p>Aiden: Dad?</p> <p>Russell: What bud?</p> <p>Aiden: I remember it.</p> <p>Russell: Alright Aiden remembers it, hold on, he\u2019s back.</p> <p>Aiden: Okay, then the person says, That\u2019s Norah. That\u2019s Zap. \u00a0So that\u2019s Norah, and that\u2019s Zap? No! That\u2019s Norah, and that\u2019s Zap. So that\u2019s the rooms zap. And then the baby\u2019s Norah? No! This is Norah, this is Zap.</p> <p>Russell: You guys all getting that? So, this is Norah and this is Zap.</p> <p>Aiden: This is Norah, and this is Zap? Yes!</p> <p>Russell: Nice. So there\u2026.I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, it\u2019s something\u2026\u2026Is it a movie you saw?</p> <p>Aiden: The end. Yeah.</p> <p>Russell: Oh the end. So that\u2019s a movie\u2026Did you watch that today or is that something you made up?</p> <p>Aiden: \u2026..but I still like make it .I didn\u2019t watch it today, but I just have to do it on the movie. Like on a camera, then everybody will watch it and they\u2019ll like it.</p> <p>Russell: That makes more sense. So Aiden right now is wearing some cool Harry Potter glasses.</p> <p>Aiden: Because I\u2019m a big fan and my eyes are really hurty.</p> <p>Russell: Because he\u2019s a big fan and his eyes are really hurty. So we went and took him to an eye appointment and his eyes were amazing. So we ordered some\u2026but he wanted Harry Potter glasses really, really bad, huh bud? So we went on Amazon and ordered some, but the wrong ones came. What were they? Did you like the first one\u2019s that came?</p> <p>Aiden: No.</p> <p>Russell: No, he did not like the first ones. So we ordered some new ones, and they came and looked awesome. They are about half the size of his head, but he wears them everywhere. Wore them to school today huh?</p> <p>Aiden: They also like them. They\u2019re really \u2026\u2026..</p> <p>Russell: And his friend said, \u201cYou look weird with them.\u201d But he still loves them.</p> <p>Anyway, so that\u2019s what I got for you today. I gotta bounce and play with my kids. Just wanted to share that, I thought it was interesting. So that\u2019s how you confuse a VC, have really profitable up front funnels, lower your churn through on-boarding funnels. Increase your lifetime value by having an amazing product and they\u2019re going to be like, \u201cWhat&gt;? That doesn\u2019t make sense. Why is it so good?\u201d And hopefully you\u2019ll get people coming to you as well. Anyway, I hope that helps you guys. That\u2019s all I got. I\u2019m out of here. Appreciate you all. Talk to you guys again soon. Oh what? One more thing. Say it again.</p> <p>Aiden: Bye.</p> <p>Russell: Aiden says bye. Bye everybody.</p>", "duration": "09:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_226.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1462402901, "title": "Episode #225 \u2013 Should I Start My Own Reality Show?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Step one in our planning for the new FunnelHacker.tv.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about an idea he has for a new show about Russell and his team doing funnels for businesses.

Alright, so I did one this morning, a podcast, which was 3 minutes long because I was preparing for our meeting, and I was talking really fast, but hopefully some of you guys got some cool value out of that. But I have something I wanna talk to you guys about, but I\u2019ve been all bottled up because I\u2019ve had 9o\u2019clock meetings, when usually I\u2019m in the car right before 9. Anyway, I\u2019ve just had less time to talk and hang out. So I\u2019m going right now to the store to grab some stuff for my wife, so this gives me a cool opportunity to share some cool stuff for you guys. Hope you don\u2019t mind.</p> <p>So I am crazy excited right now about something that we\u2019re doing that I think is going to be amazing. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of nervous to tell you guys, not even everyone on my team, not even my partners know this yet. Todd will probably find out about this from this podcast. And maybe Dylan, I don\u2019t know if he listens or not. Kind of what we\u2019re thinking. How has marketing been done up to this point? It\u2019s all about creating cool funnels, driving traffic and that conceptual thing. Or doing Periscopes or hang outs, or cool things. All I\u2019m trying to figure out\u2026.I\u2019m trying to be the next level, the bleeding edge, the next cool thing. I was trying to really figure out how do we\u2026.I feel like we built a really cool brand and a community and all this kind of stuff. How do we expand that? How do we take that to the next level and make it bigger and better?</p> <p>So that was the question. Last week my wife and I were out visiting our nanny, who just had a baby so we went and saw her and saw the baby and everything. So we were driving around and talking before we went to Jack in the Box. Was it Jack in the Box? Anyway, some horrible fast food restaurant, that tastes way too good, and definitely not on any of the diets on earth, but nevertheless we went there with the kids. And as we\u2019re driving we\u2019re talking about HGTV\u2019s Flip That House, and we\u2019re talking about just some things like that and as we\u2019re driving all the sudden this inspiration I feel it just hit me from above thinking\u2026saying, the cool thing about those shows is that they pick a house, rehab a house, you watch the whole process and in that process they\u2019re telling the back story and all these things. They have this sub-story of things happening. Each week there\u2019s a house that they\u2019re finding, they\u2019re rehabbing it, flipping it or whatever and making it awesome. That was our favorite one, with Chip and Joanne Gains, but all the house shows are similar.</p> <p>I was thinking about it, we\u2019re working on a lot of side projects. Things I\u2019m kind of doing on the side. Funnels I\u2019m building for companies that we\u2019ve traded equity for, stuff like that. And I was like, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we made our own reality tv show and showed behind the scenes, so people could actually see\u00a0 what happens? And I started thinking of different funnels I\u2019m working on and one of them is Bio-hacking Secrets with my friend Anthony Diclementi. We\u2019ve already recorded so much cool footage of him with his Cryosauna with laser lights, and all these crazy\u2026.the visuals are already amazing, because we\u2019ve been filming the whole process and we\u2019re about to launch it. I\u2019m like, you\u2019re building all this stuff behind the scenes and no one gets to see it and it doesn\u2019t really help the Clickfunnels community other than some of them hear about it later. But I\u2019m like, what if that became a thing and each week we pick a funnel that we\u2019re building anyway and we build it out live and everyone gets to see the story? And it\u2019s not just like a boring thing us in the office like, \u201cBlah blah blah.\u201d Make it fun and exciting and have story lines and a whole bunch of things like that. So that\u2019s kind of the idea.</p> <p>So we\u2019ve mapped out the first 12 episodes, 12 funnels and some of them are projects like Bio-hacking secrets, the prove it funnels we\u2019re working on, a couple things like that and some of them\u2026.For example, tomorrow I\u2019m actually being interviewed, or he\u2019s interviewing me or something I guess, I don\u2019t even know. Robert Kiyosaki are getting on appear.in meeting and we\u2019re recording it, gonna pre-record this intro for the webinar. Because me and him are doing a big webinar next month. And he can\u2019t show up on them live because he\u2019s going to be out of the country, so we\u2019re filming the intro together and then we\u2019ll show the intro and I\u2019ll do the webinar live to his whole list. And his list is crazy huge, so we could in theory, I don\u2019t know do half a million or million dollar webinar, and wouldn\u2019t that be a cool episode to film that whole thing? Film me tomorrow as I\u2019m driving to the office, freaking out excited and there film behind the scenes of me interviewing Kiyosaki and us being on this thing together. And film the webinar actually happening and showing all the nervousness before and showing people registering and showing up and stats and numbers, and doing the webinar and showing the pitch, the close, the percentages. Just showing the whole thing. Wouldn\u2019t that be awesome?</p> <p>Or with Bio-hacking Secrets, we\u2019re about to launch. It\u2019s a free book funnel, plus a tele-seminar funnel, plus a webinar high ticket funnel. All of that Is 90% done. So we\u2019re going to fly Anthony out and film the story of us launching this thing, and how we buy the ads and how we get the right things and testing the campaign and seeing what\u2019s converting and what\u2019s not converting. Doing all the stuff we do anyway, but showing you guys behind the scenes of it, in a really cool, fun exciting thing. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? So that\u2019s kind of the first half. Again, I\u2019m trying to think, how do we make this fun and engaging and exciting. Recently one of our fellow funnel hackers started working for me, and he\u2019s in the office, sits right behind my desk. His name is Steven Larsen, some of you guys may know him, so he\u2019s been actually\u2026I\u2019ve been focusing a little more on strategy since he\u2019s been here and he\u2019s been focusing on building out and we\u2019ve been kind of going back and forth until something looks really good. So I thought on the show, instead of me talking about it and building it and being really annoying person who thinks he\u2019s really important, instead wouldn\u2019t it be cool if its like, I\u2019m coaching, which I\u2019m doing anyway, but I\u2019m coaching Steven through building these funnels and doing the whole process. And he gets to ask questions and be in on the strategy meetings and all these kinds of things. And that way you guys get a unique view where it\u2019s not just what in my head what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s me explaining it to him what\u2019s happening. So he\u2019s kind of in proxy for the rest of the audience, learning along as this thing is happening, as we\u2019re building it out and seeing behind the scenes as we do the pages and the funnels.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m so exciting. So we started filming some of them today. We\u2019ve been working on the Prove It funnels. We filmed behind the scenes of us doing the whole strategy session, pre-launch stuff. Next week I\u2019m flying out to actually speak at a network marketing event and a Prove It event. So we\u2019re going to film me in the air flying there, telling the story and those kind of things. And then my next book\u2019s coming out, so we\u2019re going to film that story. And we\u2019re going to show behind the scenes of that book funnel. I\u2019ll show you behind the scenes of the Tony Robbins book funnel. Dave Ashworth book funnel and all the other ones we\u2019ve done and just kind of episode by episode build out different things and show you behind the scenes of what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it, and why we\u2019re doing it. And the actual numbers, and the actual stats and having complete transparency.</p> <p>And the other cool thing we thought, if we have an episode that goes live, on the site we\u2019ll have the episode there, you could see each month by month, we could do income reports similar to what John Lee Dumas on Entrepreneur on Fire. Show each month, Bio-hacking Secrets launch. Month one we did this, month two, month three. Show the running stats of what each of these little business, each of these funnels is actually generating for us. And just try to be complete transparency. You guys can look at what we\u2019re doing and then funnel hack it for your own businesses.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the idea. I\u2019m excited, I hope you\u2019re excited. We\u2019ve been so crazy. We have some crazy ones. One of them we\u2019re flying down to Columbia to go drop ship roses. One of them\u2026..anyway, we\u2019ve got some crazy, crazy stuff that you guys are going to love, and you\u2019re going to have the chance to see behind the scenes of everything. So that\u2019s the first part. The second part, I\u2019m not sure if I should even talk about this yet, but we\u2019re trying to figure out how to make, and this idea came to me, I actually did a Periscope tonight, asking our Periscope followers, \u201cWhat do you guys think about this?\u201d Trying to get them engaged with the idea and get some other feedback, what they\u2019d want to hear and see in the episodes.</p> <p>One thing I kind of talked about was, I don\u2019t know if you guys watch the show the Bachelor or the Bachelorette. You shouldn\u2019t, but if you do you know what I\u2019m talking about where they every night that it\u2019s on, people all around America have these big bachelor parties where they get their friends and family, everyone gets together and they watch the episode together live and they talk about it for the next week waiting for the next one. I was like, what if we build these really cool things like mini hack-a-thons or something where each week when the episode is live; people could run a hack-a-thon in their local area and invite their friends and family members have everyone come over and watch this thing, and watch it streaming, and see the actual ups-ell unfold and see how cool it is. Wouldn\u2019t that be awesome. We were thinking about even having it kind of like a pre level certification. Our certified partners could run bigger versions of these, but having this as like a pre thing where you pay a little bit to get in, and you get in we send you a box, and the box has got like 10 Funnel Hacker t-shirts and it\u2019s got a special gift that\u2019s only for people who are hosting funnel hacking parties. And it\u2019s got\u2026..we\u2019re talking about, Steven had an idea of making a lead pages dart board and having that there. A whole bunch of awesome stuff.</p> <p>But that would be the thing and that would get people all around the country each week as we release these episodes, we release them at the same time, getting everyone on board, getting everyone to watch together, and commenting and sharing and talking. Make it a really cool, interactive community type building thing where we\u2019re all experiencing this together at the same time. That\u2019s my thoughts. So with that said, I would love to hear your guys\u2019 feedback. Hit me up on Facebook or whatever and say \u201cYay\u201d or \u201cNay\u201d or \u201cThis is stupid\u201d or \u201cthis is awesome\u201d or \u201cI would love to watch that and share it with everybody I know\u201d. Because we\u2019re trying to make this a cool thing. It\u2019s gonna be called Funnel Hacker TV. Some of you guys have seen we had two episodes of Funnel Hacker TV in the past, but we\u2019re going to try and make this into a real thing. I think it\u2019s gonna be amazing. So I\u2019m crazy excited.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got, we started filming the first ones today. We\u2019ve got a couple more tomorrow. The fun thing I\u2019m learning is, and I\u2019ve always been pretty good at project management, because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve normally been doing. But now we\u2019re project managing 13 funnels at once because we\u2019re filming different parts and different things with each one. And trying to make sure we have each of the sections for each of the things. It\u2019s gonna be amazing. I just wanted to share it with you guys. Please keep it a secret. Don\u2019t tell anybody else. Hopefully it gets you guys excited and gets you thinking about cool things you can do in your own community to get people more engaged and more excited and I think this is going to be it for us. It\u2019s going to take the marketing to the next level. And just the community and this whole brand we\u2019re trying to build and take it more mainstream and make it more fun and just make it not a software program. We don\u2019t want this to be that. We want this to be a cult, I mean a community. So that\u2019s the game plan. I appreciate you guys. I\u2019m walking in the store to grab my wife\u2019s stuff. I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon. Have a great night, appreciate you all, and that\u2019s about it. Talk to you guys soon.

Alright everyone, so some of my new friends in the Inner Circle were teasing me about our introduction man, what he says, \u201cand now your host Russell Brunson\u201d, so now that I hear that it makes me laugh, so I hope you guys are laughing too.</p> <p>Some of you might be wondering, why haven\u2019t you done a podcast for a while, and then the second question would be Russell, why are you talking so fast right now? And the reasons are the same. Both of those reason\u2019s are the same. It\u2019s because we started this new thing in our company that\u2019s really cool. It happens every day at 9am, which is in three minutes from right now. So I\u2019ve got three minutes before I am officially late. So as the CEO, I can\u2019t even call myself the CEO without laughing, it seems like such a real business term. Anyway, as the CEO of my corporation, I gotta be there, or else that\u2019s just not cool to not be there. So I\u2019ve got three minutes to explain this concept to you guys and jump on the call.</p> <p>So this is what it is. What we\u2019ve been doing in our company, the dev team started doing it a month or two ago and then recently we\u2019ve kind of pulled in me and some of the other guys, because I think it\u2019s really effective. So we do these really quick stand up meetings and we do it every single morning at 9am. And it typically takes less than 15 minutes and we\u2019ve got 15 or 20 people that attend that meeting. So it goes pretty quick for how many people are involved. The way it works we use gotomeeting, and when we log into gotomeeting there\u2019s a list of all attendees in alphabetical order, so it starts with the first person on the list at exactly 9 o\u2019clock, which 2 minutes from right now. So the first person gets on and says, \u201cHey, this is Russell. Yesterday I did blah blah. Today I\u2019m focusing on blah blah. And these are the roadblocks I have.\u201d The next person goes, \u201cHey, this is Russell. Yesterday I focused on this, it went awesome. We crushed it. Today I\u2019m focusing on this. I have a two potential roadblocks, I can\u2019t figure out this or this. Can I get so and so to talk to me afterwards?\u201d Boom, next person, next person, next person. And we go through and what it does is a couple of cool things. First off, it holds everyone accountable for what they did yesterday, to make sure people actually showed up and did your jobs, so that\u2019s a cool thing.</p> <p>If you\u2019re having issues in your company wondering, \u201cWhat do these people do all day?\u201d And I know that\u2019s a real thing because I have thought that in the past with other companies we have built. I remember firing 60 people in one day and coming in the next day waiting for a million balls to drop, and nothing dropped and I was like, \u201cWhat did all these people do?\u201d Anyway, that lets you know what they\u2019re doing each day. And what\u2019s cool about it is you can be like, \u201cWhy are you wasting time on that, that\u2019s the stupidest thing in the world. You should be focusing on this.\u201d And you can quickly redirect people to the correct behaviors, so that\u2019s number one. Number two you find out what they are focusing on today, which once again half the time our dev team or other people on the team are focusing on something that you don\u2019t really care about as the CEO. You could be focusing on something, for example: We\u2019re launching Funnel University and everyone\u2019s only focusing on something that means nothing to anybody and it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s cool but that\u2019s our number one priority, you should be shifting to this.\u201d And third thing is all of us get stuck. We have blockers in our business that hold us back from the thing we\u2019re trying to accomplish and a lot of times other people on our team don\u2019t know what those blockers are and that\u2019s what\u2019s actually keeping you from the success you want and need. And so we find out what the blockers are while you got everyone on the team there, so now you know, \u201cHey I gotta help Todd with these two things because he can\u2019t progress with his job until those two things are done.\u201d It\u2019s pretty cool.</p> <p>So I\u2019d recommend\u2026.because I hate meetings. We haven\u2019t done meetings in years because meetings are so boring and so long and everyone wants to talk about stuff that doesn\u2019t actually matter. We do a meeting and I count\u2026I remember sitting in a meeting and counting how much I paid each person per hour and doing the math and being like, \u201c That meeting cost me $2300.\u201d Or whatever it was. And being so angry because not only does it cost $2300 but the opportunity cost of us getting our crap done was even bigger. So this is awesome because it\u2019s like 15 and if you a small team you could get done in 5 minutes.</p> <p>So I highly, highly, highly recommend it. And that\u2019s about it, I\u2019m late for the meeting so I gotta bounce. I hope that was helpful for you guys. Start doing standing meetings, that\u2019s the process, there\u2019s the format. So far it has become magic for us, I hope it works for you as well. And that\u2019s what I got for you today. Talk to you soon, bye.</p>", "duration": "05:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_224.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1461883074, "title": "Episode #223 \u2013 How Direct Response Can Improve Your Daily Life", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to become a better father, husband, and person.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell recaps his new morning routine and where it\u2019s been successful and what the hard part is.

Hey everyone, I hope you are doing amazing. I am excited and happy as always, it\u2019s not always but as often as possible. A lot of people have been messaging me asking me about how the early mornings have been going. First off, thank you now I know you\u2019re listening. I had a couple people message me at 5 Mountain Time because they knew I would be awake, like, \u201cHey are you awake, are you in funnel time?\u201d I love it.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve got a confession to make, I\u2019ve not been perfect this week. Monday and Tuesday I did it. It was easy, it was fun. Wednesday I did not wake up, and Thursday which is today, I woke up. This is what I\u2019ve found, a couple things. First off, the hardest part is not waking up early, the hardest part is going to bed on time. Is that crazy? You would think that that would be way easier because, I\u2019m gonna go to bed, I\u2019m tired anyway. But that is the hardest part.</p> <p>So what happened, another interesting thing is, waking up in the morning, typically when I wake up early I\u2019m going out to lift, so because of that your body kind of has this reaction where it freaks out and your brain has 3 or 4 things fighting against it, so there\u2019s a lot of resistance, whereas waking up to get on the computer to do funnel time, I didn\u2019t have any resistance, it\u2019s kind of interesting, that part was really easy, but going to bed was hard. Initially I was going to try to go to bed at 9, but I realized my kids go to be at 9 or 9:30, so that didn\u2019t work. So I tried to get to bed by 10, that\u2019s my goal. First night did it, second night did it, the third night the kids went insane, which happens way more often than I\u2019d like to admit. So they were crazy and then it was, what time was it? It was probably 10, probably about 10 when they went to bed when I was coming down trying to get things ready and checking things and cleaning up, all that kind of stuff. Pretty soon it was 10:45, I was oh man, it\u2019s almost 11 and I was walking to the room, and I walked by my wife who was in the other room, and she just turned on Dancing With The Stars, and I was like, I\u2019m just going to come in and watch one dance, one dance. Next thing I knew it was midnight and I\u2019m like you know what, I\u2019m not waking up tomorrow, so that was hard.</p> <p>And then last night, because I love, I can\u2019t tell you how much I love it though. I get so much done, I feel like no matter what else happens the rest of the day, it\u2019s just a bonus. So I really like it, so I tried last night to get to bed. And my kids finally fell asleep. I was able to leave their room at about 9:30. I finally got to bed about 10:30, so it wasn\u2019t too bad, and then I passed out and was up at 5. So I did it today, feeling good. So hopefully I can keep things moving through.</p> <p>Anyway, what I wanted to talk to you guys about today has been on my mind. Usually when we do something, we just lump it as a success or failure. Our brain has two camps, this worked or it didn\u2019t work. And I\u2019ve learned with direct marketing that\u2019s not how it works. In direct response marketing the cool thing is we\u2019re able to see and track what happens at every point along the funnel, along the process. How much did we spend per click? How many clicks did we get? How many people saw our ads? What was the cost per view, per click? Then on the landing page, how much did we spend per opt-in? What conversion rates were? Landing page, sales page, emails, open rate, click through rate, up-sell rate, average cart buy all the little pieces. I didn\u2019t get this for the first 7 or 8 years of my business until I started working close with Todd Dickerson on our team, who\u2019s the genius who does all the split testing and those kind of things. And he got really good at looking at those numbers and figuring them out and showing us the stats. I realized, wow when you actually know all that stuff, two things. First off you know how much money you can spend to acquire customers. Second off you know what\u2019s broken. It\u2019s really easy to look at and be like, whoa, that\u2019s not converting well. That should be higher, let\u2019s tweak that and change it and start fixing all the things along the way. And hopefully if you guys have been following me for any amount of time, you\u2019ve learned that we\u2019ve talked a lot about that. The book Dotcom secrets, was a lot about that. So you learn the process is true there.</p> <p>I also want to stress how it\u2019s not just in marketing, it\u2019s in all things. I was looking at this whole morning thing, by day three I was like, this sucks, doesn\u2019t work. But then I was like, well it\u2019s not that it didn\u2019t work. Let me look at the process, what are the pieces that did and what are the pieces that didn\u2019t. I\u2019m looking at it, I\u2019m looking at the bedtime is the hardest piece. That\u2019s where my conversion rate sucks, I gotta figure out how to make that better. At the waking up part, hasn\u2019t been hard so far, where some people that might be the hard part for you. Looking at the different things and trying to figure out where the bottle necks are and the low conversion rates are.\u00a0 And then what to do to tweak that and make it better and more exciting and all those types of things.</p> <p>So my next game that I\u2019m going to play with my brain, is figuring out how I can get to bed and asleep by 10. What are the things I need to do? How do I motivate myself? What are the, you know I\u2019m not sure what that is yet, but that\u2019ll be my fun thing to figure out. How to increase my conversions on what time I go to bed for the next little while. So that\u2019s kind of a one off example. But think about all aspects of your life. What are other things that are important to you? With your husband or your wife, or your spouse or your girlfriend or whatever? Look at the process. Was my day awesome? Yes or no? If it wasn\u2019t, why, what happened? Here it was good, I did this part and it was really good. I did this part and it was good, but then boom, I screwed up here and then the whole thing went south. I said this stupid thing and the whole thing went south.</p> <p>Start looking at that and being aware of it. Instead of being like, that day sucked, or that let\u2019s say that you\u2019re hanging out with your kids, you\u2019ve got three hours playing with your kids, at first it\u2019s really fun, but you get tired or bored or whatever the thing was. And you\u2019re like, that wasn\u2019t as good as I thought. Why? What was the reasoning? I look at me and it\u2019s like, I\u2019m always trying to figure out how do I optimize the experience with my kids each day? Because I work so hard, that I want to make sure that when I\u2019m not working and I\u2019m with them that my focus is there, my energy is there and I\u2019m able to give them what I want. So I look at , some days are just awesome, sometimes I\u2019m like, man I am a good dad. Other day\u2019s I\u2019m like, Man I am a horrible dad. Why?</p> <p>For me, I look at it, when I am a good dad, it\u2019s when I\u2019m out jumping on the trampoline with them, I\u2019m running with them, I\u2019m doing stuff, I\u2019m creating, when I\u2019m engaged with them. The times when it\u2019s horrible is the times when I\u2019m looking at my phone, I\u2019m checking things. I\u2019m not engaged, whatever it is. OR I\u2019m tired, my energy levels are low. They want to jump on the tramp and I\u2019m like, I\u2019m so tired and I\u2019m find excuses and ways to not be an awesome dad. So looking at that, I\u2019m like, why was this day awesome, why was this day different? This day what was the process I did? I had good energy. Did I take different supplements? Did I sleep more? Did I eat different? Was that before I ate or after I ate? What was all the little things along the way that made that experience amazing?</p> <p>My kids, I found out, and I\u2019ve really\u2026.this is one big reason when people ask why I\u2019m trying to eat healthy and why I\u2019m doing all these things, and it\u2019s less for trying to look sexy, because you know, come on. Just kidding. I\u2019m such a dork. The real reason honestly is I feel like during the day, I\u2019m giving 100%. I focus I have energy and I\u2019m doing awesome and by the end of the day I\u2019m worn out, I\u2019m tired and my brains tired and my body\u2019s tired. And I feel like, am I giving the best of my time to my work as opposed to my kids and my wife. That\u2019s not right. How do I keep my energy levels high for the last 3 hours, or keep them the same level they are for the first 8? Because I feel guilty if I\u2019m giving 100% the first 8 and then I\u2019m only giving 60&amp;% the last 3. So for me, it\u2019s a big piece of that. I\u2019ve been figuring out, what do I do? How do I eat differently? How do I get in a different state so that when I get home I can actually be aware and awake and have the energy I need to be an awesome dad and not a lazy dad.</p> <p>There\u2019s a quote, and Stu Mclarin actually posted it on his Facebook wall today. It\u2019s from a guy named David O. Mckay. For the Mormons out there, we all know who he is. For those who are not Mormons, he is someone who us Mormons consider a Mormon Prophet, that lived I don\u2019t know how long ago, 50 or 60 years ago. He\u2019s no longer alive, but he had a quote that was really important, and it kind of ties into today\u2019s message. His quote was that \u201cNo success can compensate for failure in the home\u201d. For me, I think about that a lot. If all my energy is going to my work, and I don\u2019t have that because I\u2019m spending so much energy and focus there, I can\u2019t fulfill my home duties, then I\u2019m a failure. That\u2019s something I think about. So I\u2019m trying to think about how to increase energy levels.</p> <p>There\u2019s a couple examples. There\u2019s a sales funnel how we do it. In a new morning routine, how we do it. This is how we do it on a time with your family, but it works in any part of your life. So instead of just looking at aspects and being like, this was awesome or this was lame. Start looking at the process and see what things to optimize and tweak to make it better. And the more conscience and aware you are of those things the more you can affect them and make them better. That\u2019s the message for today. What should we call this one? Let\u2019s see, just so you guys know, when I finish this podcast I send my brother the title and he titles it. But I want your guys\u2019 help on this. What should we title this one? We could title it, how direct response effects your\u2026how direct response can improve your daily life. That\u2019s kind of cool right?</p> <p>Alright, Scott, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to call it. How direct response can improve your daily life and the sub headline will be how to become a better father, husband, and person. That sounds good. Alright guys. That\u2019s what I got for you today. Start looking at your process in life, start optimizing and if you do, you will be happier, you will be better, and you will enjoy your time here on this amazing earth a lot better. So that\u2019s what I got. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you again tomorrow.

For me it\u2019s like, I got a lot of crap I gotta get done for work, family, church, there\u2019s so many things. So it\u2019s like, if I get an extra 3 or 4 hours a day or 4 or 5 days a week or whatever, that\u2019s amazing, but how do you do that? So I\u2019ve tried all sorts of stuff. It\u2019s been interesting, in the past I always try to wake up at 6 to go lift weights, with that, it\u2019s interesting, it works sometimes, but it\u2019s easy for my brain to say no. I usually do probably 2 or 3 days a week, when I get up early and actually lift at 6. It\u2019s not consistent and kind of hard, and I lift and hang out with my kids, then go to the office, the office day happens and there\u2019s people and stuff. Then I come home and play with my kids again. It\u2019s always good and I get a lot of stuff done, but how do I get more?</p> <p>Last week I was in Joe Polishes 25K group, and oh man I\u2019m going to tell you guys a story. I wonder if I should tell you another story. I was going to do a podcast since then, I totally forgot. This is called an ADD moment, then we\u2019ll head back. So remind me when I get stuck, where to head back.</p> <p>We\u2019re heading back to the book, but before then\u2026this is amazing. So the last day at the 25K group we were stting in the meetings and all the sudden my phone rang 3 times from Marcus Lemonis The Profit, and I was like, \u201cOh man, I\u2019m stuck in this meeting, I can\u2019t answer right now.\u201d And then he texts me, \u201cCall me right now.\u201d And I text him like, \u201cI\u2019m stuck in a meeting, I really can\u2019t. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I can.\u201d So at the break I called him, no one answered. I called again, no one answered. I\u2019m like, \u201cDangit. I missed the little window.\u201d And part of me is kind of freaking out, what in the world is happening where he would call me three times in a minute, there\u2019s got to be something happening. So then that night, he texts me and he\u2019s like, \u201cCan you talk now?\u201d And I was about to jump in an Uber, but I was like, I just dialed right back immediately. So I called him and first thing he says is \u201cHello.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cHey Marcus, this is Russell.\u201d He goes. \u201cYou\u2019re being\u2026.I\u2019m\u201d What did he say? \u201cI\u2019m on location and we\u2019re recording right now, you\u2019re on camera is that okay?\u201d Isn\u2019t that crazy?</p> <p>So I\u2019m like, \u201dYes, that\u2019s totally cool.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOkay Russell, this is the deal. I\u2019m at a meeting with these guys, they own a watch company and I\u2019m thinking about doing a deal with them. But I was talking to them about the business model and they mentioned funnels and I asked them what they knew about funnels and they were like, \u2018There\u2019s this guy named Russell Brunson.\u2019\u201d And he was like, \u201cWait, you know Russell?\u201d and\u00a0 they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been to his events, we use Clickfunnels.\u201d And Marcus is like, \u201cHold on.\u201d And right then he called me 3 times in a row trying to get hold of me and obviously I didn\u2019t answer the phone, I blew it. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m sitting with them right now and I\u2019m trying to make a deal, but I\u2019m curious if I do make a deal with them, would you be willing to come on the show and actually build their sales funnel for them?\u201d And I\u2019m just like, I wish you could see me. I\u2019m trying to be all super cool guy on the phone, so my voice is trying, I\u2019m trying not to start squealing like a little girl, have my voice crack or something, but I\u2019m jumping up and down on the spot and going nuts. All the people about to jump in the Uber with me are probably wondering. Did Russell win the lottery or something? What\u2019s happening? I\u2019m jumping up and down and going crazy.</p> <p>So I\u2019m like, \u201cI would be honored. I would love to come help you guys build your funnels.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cOkay cool. That\u2019s what I needed to know. Thanks man.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAlright, thanks.\u201d And that was it. Isn\u2019t that crazy. Oh so crazy. So I\u2019m going crazy and then I text Marcus later, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the company, give me more info about it.\u201d He texts me back and tells me what the company name was and he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to cut you in on equity on this deal.\u201d And that was it. I haven\u2019t heard from his since, it\u2019s been like 3 days. I\u2019 m going crazy. But is that insane? Crazy. Anyway, I just wanted to share with you guys. I was going to that night, but I must have forgot. So there you guys go. There\u2019s my ADD tangent. Now I need to come back to the story at hand.</p> <p>Okay, so back to where we\u2019re at. So at the event they gave me, Joe Polish handed out these boxes. These big orange boxes. I\u2019d gotten one before, I had one in the mail. I didn\u2019t know what it was. The outside says The Perfect Day. You open it up and there\u2019s a book and a journal and a bunch of stuff. And it\u2019s this product created by Craig Valentine. I\u2019d gotten it before, but I never read it. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh cool.\u201d Anyway, I took the box and when I was heading home that night, I pulled the book out and I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ll read this on the plane, so I jump on the plane, start reading the book. And in this book, he\u2019s talking about how to create the perfect day and he\u2019s showing a bunch of things, and the book was awesome. But the thing that was the most powerful for me, was he showed what his schedule was. Craig\u2019s schedule is, he gets up at 4 o\u2019clock every morning. From 4 to 6:30 he writes. At 6:30 he has breakfast, he does meditation or something and then I don\u2019t know, at whatever the next time is, an hour later, he gets back and writes for another 2 \u00bd hours. Then he has his stand up meeting with his company at 10:30. So by 10:30 in the morning, he has had 5 hours of focused energy time writing and doing what he needs to get done. And then the rest of his day is answering emails, meeting with people, all the crap that normally we do in an office. He goes to bed at 8 every single night.</p> <p>At first I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, he is insane. 4 in the morning, I will never in a billion, infinity, million years do that ever. It\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d And I was like, because I don\u2019t go to bed until 2 in the morning, so if I got up at 4\u00a0 that\u2019s\u00a0 2 hours of sleep and I would die. But if I went to bed at midnight, how would it work? Midnight to 4, 4 hours is not enough. So I\u2019m like what if I went to bed at 10, 10 to 4 that\u2019s only 6 hours, that\u2019s about how much sleep I get now. But what if I extended that. What if I woke up at 5 and go to bed at 10 o\u2019clock and wake up at 5. I try to do his process. And my day is different. I\u2019ve got a million kids. I don\u2019t have the luxury of breakfast and meditation before I start writing again. I\u2019ve got breakfast and diapers and screaming, you know getting kids ready and it\u2019s insane. But I was like, what if I woke up at 5 and from 5 til 7, 2 hours every morning, I got up and that\u2019s my funnel time. I always tell people that if I could do anything in the business all day, all I\u2019d do is sit there and build funnels. But I rarely have that time, just to sit there and build funnels. So I\u2019m like, what if I made it so the 5am to 7am every morning is my funnel time. I don\u2019t check emails, I don\u2019t check Facebook or anything. All I\u2019m allowed to do is open up Clickfunnels build funnels and write copy and all the pieces I need to do to push funnels forward.</p> <p>So I was kind of excited so Sunday night I got all ready and my goal was to get to bed by 9, but I forgot that my kids go to bed at 9, which usually bleeds into 9:30 or 9:45. So that didn\u2019t work, so it was like 9:45b finally the kids are in bed and I told my wife, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed, my goal is to go to sleep at 10\u201d You know she\u2019s been married to me for a long time and knows I typically don\u2019t go to bed until 1 or 2. I was like, I\u2019m going to try this. So I went to bed at 10 and it took me a little while to go to sleep because I wasn\u2019t used to that. But luckily I was tired, it\u2019d been a long day. So I fell asleep at 10, woke up at 5, got up and went in there and I started working building funnels for 2 hours. It was amazing. It wasn\u2019t like when I wake up to go work out, there\u2019s a lot of resistance. I have to get up, get clothes on, go out. There\u2019s a lot of things that have to happen. Whereas for me to get up and go sit on the computer and build funnels, there\u2019s zero resistance and it was really easy and I did it. And then I ate really healthy throughout the day and did supplementation stuff to keep my energy levels high throughout the whoile day, but I felt amazing. Then last night I went to be at about 10:30, I was trying to get to bed by 10, but I just had things that came up. So about 10:30 I went to bed, set an alarm for 4:45 basically, that way I can snooze it once. 4:45 my alarm\u2019s going off, I totally slept through it. My wife starts kicking me like, \u201cWhy is your alarm going off at 4:45?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d So I went and turned it off, and jumped out of bed and because it wasn\u2019t like, I gotta go put on my workout clothes, all the things your body freaks out about, it was just walking to the other room and start building funnels. I\u2019m excited about it. I\u00a0 just walked into the other room, jumped on and from 5 to 7 today I just built funnels.</p> <p>And I tell you what, in my 2, 2-hour morning so far, I\u2019ve gotten as much work done as I typically do in an 8 hour day. So I\u2019m going to the office, we have a webinar today, so I\u2019m going to be selling on a webinar, I\u2019ve got meeting and all this other stuff. And I\u2019m not going to be stressing out, because usually I\u2019m stressing out on days that I have webinars and meetings because I\u2019m like, I need to move my things forward and I can\u2019t. Where now, I\u2019ve already moved things forward by the time my kids are awake, now the rest of the day is just a bonus. Anyway, I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>So that was my first chunk was trying an earlier morning thing, now I\u2019m going to start reorganizing the rest of my life and my schedule to kind of tweak some other things to kind of get it in. Especially since, I don\u2019t know if I mentioned this, I probably have, I\u2019m sure I have. We\u2019re building a bio-hacking room, so I got a flow tank and a cryosauna coming and a couple other things so I\u2019m trying to map out my ideal day, where it\u2019s 5 til 7 I do this, and then 7 til 9 I\u2019m with my kids and then 9 o\u2019clock, I do cryosauna and freeze and then 9:15 I go and lift weights til 10. At 10 o\u2019clock I do flow tank for a few hours. 11 o\u2019clock I come in. I don\u2019t know, something like that, I\u2019m trying to figure out exactly what the daily routine will be. But I started it with waking up basically an hour to 2 hours earlier with focus on 2 hours of funnel time and I tell you what, it\u2019s been amazing.</p> <p>So what I\u2019m recommending for you guys to do, is wake up an hour to 2 hours earlier and do some funnel time, or writing time or whatever it is that you need to be doing more of in your business and your life. Spend that time there. And it\u2019s interesting.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m two days in, loving it and having a great time. I hope that you guys try it as well. I\u2019m going to try to convince everyone I know to do this as well. I would rather, knowing how I\u2019m feeling right now, I would rather wake up two hours earlier, and leave the office two hours earlier, because you\u2019ll get 10 times more stuff done. Which is crazy to think because it\u2019s the same time, it\u2019s just sifting it all a little bit. So there you go.</p> <p>I guess one problem if I convince all my team to wake up earlier, then we\u2019ll all be awake and it\u2019s just like we\u2019re all at the office again which will just ruin us. So maybe I shouldn\u2019t let them know about this big secret we got. Anyway, that\u2019s what I got. I\u2019m at the office, I\u2019ve got a call with a lawyer, never fun but my lawyer\u2019s awesome, so that\u2019s one good thing. First lawyer I ever met I liked. Then I got a meeting with my accountant, which accountants are as bad if not worse than lawyers. But we got a new accountant that I actually like, so it\u2019s going to be a good day. Then we got a webinar, some selling. It\u2019s going to be a good day and I\u2019m excited and the sun\u2019s beautiful. A lot of good stuff happening. So appreciate you all. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys all again, hopefully tomorrow. Alright guys. Talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "12:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_222.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1461279183, "title": "Episode #221 \u2013 My Day At Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s And Dean Graziosi\u2019s Offices", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A behind the scenes look at what I was really feeling inside.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about being in Phoenix Arizona and meeting with some icons of the industry.

Hey everyone, I am actually in my hotel room shaving right now and I\u2019m about to go to Joe Polishes 25K group and I thought, you know what\u2026.I wanted to share with you guys what happened yesterday. So you have to hear me shave, I have a horrible echo in this room. It\u2019s going to sound horrible and I\u2019m super late. I have to be there in 12 minutes, and instead I\u2019m shaving and yeah, that\u2019s how I roll. I\u2019m never on time for anything. I am the biggest procrastinator ever.</p> <p>I\u2019m giving a talk today and I finally finished my talk and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh crap, I got 12 minutes to get there, time to start getting ready.\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m shaving right now and then on top of that I thought let\u2019s just do a quick podcast to share the crazy day I had yesterday. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Welcome inside my world.</p> <p>So yesterday was insane. We came to Joe Polishes 25K group today, which is in Phoenix, Arizona. And recently we got Robert Kiyosaki to write the forward for my new book, which is for me, the coolest, craziest thing ever. We became friends with one of the guys inside of their office that works there and turns out that they\u2019re in Phoenix. I\u2019m like, \u201cWe're going to be in Phoenix tomorrow. Can we come see you guys?\u201d and he was like, \u201cSure.\u201d So we came and it so crazy cool. We walked in the office and meet the guys and they guys I guess have been going through a bunch of our stuff. They listened to this podcast and bought some of our books and products. We walked into one of the offices and they had, I could see Perfect Webinar Script on the desk and some other stuff. It was cool. They had been totally going through our stuff.</p> <p>They started to use Clickfunnels 3 or 4 weeks ago. They\u2019re like, \u201cWe built 5 funnels, we have a launch happening next week. We\u2019re loving it. We\u2019re cancelling Infusionsoft.\u201d All sorts of amazingness is happening. It was awesome. So that was cool. And then we had a tour of the whole office. We went into his radio station. The little studio with the microphone and everything and we recorded\u2026.I did a Periscope from there, so if you want to see that go to marketingquickiesshow.com you should be able to see the Periscope from inside the Rich Dad office, which is so much fun.</p> <p>We interviewed them and they told this story about how their whole business came about. I didn\u2019t realize this, but I guess Kiyosaki built the game first. Sorry it\u2019s hard to shave and talk. He built the game first and then he loved the game but nobody was really buying it so they wanted to sell the game, so he wrote the book as an instruction manual to sell the game. And then the book, I think he published it independently. It was selling well, but not awesome. But it was selling good enough that it got on Oprah\u2019s radar. Oprah went and had him on and boom it exploded and he became what he is now, which is cool. And he used that to sell the game and then from there they did a bunch of other stuff, so that was awesome.</p> <p>Kiyosaki, Robert was not there, so we didn\u2019t get a chance to meet him, but we heard a lot of stories about him, which were very interesting. And we were trying to get him to speak at Funnel Hacking Live next year, which would be awesome. So that is one of my goals. And then a couple of other things. We talked to those guys, they have agreed to promote the Funnel Hacks webinar. So we\u2019re going to do the webinar to the whole Rich Dad audience and get these guys building funnels, which would be exciting. Help serve them. And then we\u2019re also kind of helping them with a webinar that they\u2019re creating. So I\u2019m excited about that. So we\u2019re going to be helping them create a perfect webinar, and create an offer, and put out a $1000 version of their Rich Dad Poor Dad stuff and make them a bunch of money. So that is the game plan. See how much money we can make Rich Dad and make him even richer and hopefully he\u2019ll think I\u2019m cool. Because that\u2019s why we do what we do. Anyway, I\u2019m excited and that was awesome.</p> <p>So then we jumped in an Uber and 4 minutes away we went Dean Graziosi\u2019s office, which is Dean is like the other biggest real estate dude in the world, and infomercial Guru and everything. So we went there and got to see his whole studio where they film their shows. We saw that they have Cryosauna in their office, which is super cool because I ordered my Cryosauna yesterday for my house, so we saw that.\u00a0 We sat around for two hours and I wish, oh I wish we would have recorded it. It was crazy. We sat there for 2 hours, it was a direct response history lesson. The first guy I ever learned from was Don Lapre back when I was 12 years old. And Dean was business partners with Don Larpre and talked about infomercials they did together. The whole story and the ups and downs they had together, it was crazy.</p> <p>It was like direct response history. Going back to the foundation of this whole\u2026..it was the\u2026\u2026all these things and these stories, I was totally geeking out. You have no idea how exciting it was for me. So I sat there and listened to stories and we talked about things and looked what they were doing and tried to help them a little bit. Looked at what we were doing with Clickfunnels and how we were trying to grow that. And the cool thing about Kiyosaki\u2019s office, they\u2019re using Clickfunnels, at Dean\u2019s office they\u2019re using Clickfunnels. It\u2019s just so cool to see people you\u2019ve looked up to your whole life, I used to watch Dean\u2019s infomercials, this is how dorky I am. And then I would get them transcribed and I would read them and try to understand how he did his pitch. And now to see him and his team using Clickfunnels and being obsessed with it and excited is the coolest thing in the world for me.</p> <p>So that was really fun. And then, towards the end we started talking about my new book coming out, Expert Secrets and I was like \u201cOh we were at Kiyosaki\u2019s office. He wrote the forward for it.\u201c and he was like, \u201c Oh what\u2019s the plan with the book?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, to take over the world basically.\u201d And I was like, \u201c You know what would be cool\u201d and it was funny because he doesn\u2019t know and I didn\u2019t even tell him this, maybe he\u2019ll find this out someday but, at the very first 25K meeting with Joe Polishes group I was at, I was sitting at the dinner table and Dean was across from me, and I was sitting there. And I had told everyone that day actually, that I was never going to write a book again, and I looked across and I saw Dean, it was nothing he said or anything, but I was looking at him and I was like, I need to write a book, and it needs to be called Expert Secrets and Dean needs to do an infomercial for me. And then I went from there back to my hotel room and I called Julie, who is the person who helps me write my books, \u201cJulie, book #2 is on the queue. Let me send you some money, let\u2019s get this thing started.\u201d Sent her some money and the book began that day. That was a meeting ago. Now it\u2019s been 6 months since that meeting, the books almost done. It\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>So I had this meeting with Dean and I was kind of like, trying to be all cool, even though I\u2019m super nerding out on the whole thing. Anyway, I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, what I really want to do with this book, the goal with it is to take it main stream. The Dotcom Secrets book was all about getting our community and people who were marketers to understand these core concepts. Expert Secrets is about taking this to the masses. How do we get everyone to understand that they have a talent and a hobby and unique abilities that can change the world? And then Clickfunnels is the tool that allows you to do that. How do we get that out to everyone? And obviously infomercials would be the coolest.\u201d So I told him, \u201cMy real motive is I really want to do an infomercial for this book and I want you to help me.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cDone. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\u00a0 And I was like, \u201cWhat? Are you kidding me? You're going to help me with an infomercial? How cool is that?\u201d So we\u2019re going to try to do an infomercial with Dean selling the Expert Secrets book, which is insane.</p> <p>And he knows if it\u2019ll work or not, but just the fact that we\u2019re gonna try is so exciting. Anyway, so if you guys see me and I\u2019ve got a grin on my face that\u2019s as big as\u2026..it\u2019s huge, and I\u2019m so excited. That\u2019s it. When we left, Dave Woodward is with me, when we left we\u2019re pinching ourselves. I can\u2019t believe what we experienced in the last four hours. We just hung out at Kiyosaki\u2019s office, and Deans office. The most amazing day ever. It can\u2019t get any better than this. We should just go to bed and just end this because it\u2019s such a perfect day and it was awesome. Anyway, that was my day yesterday, and now I\u2019m up in the morning.

Hey everyone, I hope you are doing awesome today. I am actually in the car right now heading to go pick up my daughter from soccer practice, which is pretty exciting. She is amazing at soccer and so much fun to watch. So I\u2019m going to go grab her and head home for some dinner.</p> <p>I had something going through my head the last 3 or 4 days, actually it\u2019s been almost a week now. And I wanted to share with you, I\u2019ve been super busy and didn\u2019t have time to do a podcast specifically about this, I thought I\u2019ve got 5 minutes on my drive over to soccer practice, I\u2019m going to share it with you guys really quick. It\u2019s not a long one, but I think it\u2019s an important one.</p> <p>The title of this presentation is, be careful who you are complaining to. The reason why is because a lot of times we\u2019re complaining about stuff, it seems like a big deal, but you put it in perspective of other people and other people\u2019s lives, or even other people\u2019s situations after that second, and they\u2019re not that big of deal. And they kind of make you feel like an idiot when you realize sometimes.</p> <p>Probably the most dramatic example of this, if you rewind 10 years ago, my wife as you probably have heard, had twin boys. If you\u2019ve ever had twins, it\u2019s kind of a crazy, amazing, but crazy experience. So we basically, my wife\u2019s put on bed rest, she\u2019s been taking all these drugs making sure the babies don\u2019t come. And six weeks early all the sudden the water breaks. Boom babies are coming. Race to the hospital, all the craziness that ensues with that. We get there and it\u2019s not like a normal baby delivery. Those who have had one baby, which I\u2019ve had 3 times since, so I know how it works. It\u2019s a doctor and a nurse hanging out in a room and a baby comes out. It\u2019s pretty easy. When you have twins it\u2019s insane. They think that you\u2019re probably going to die, especially since this is our first kids, we\u2019re freaking out anyway. They\u2019re in the operating room. This huge operating room. There\u2019s two NICU teams, there\u2019s about 50 other people, okay I\u2019m exaggerating a little, but there\u2019s probably 20 some odd people in this room. Instead of being a nice quiet dark room, you normally give birth in, it\u2019s lit up, there\u2019s lights everywhere. It\u2019s insane.</p> <p>So my wife goes through this experience. Baby one comes out. Boom, everything is great, baby two comes out breech, which is a horrible experience. But she gives birth to both of them and then we go and see the kids and they\u2019re in the NICU, which is an emotional thing. You see the babies come out and they rip them off and race them down to the NICU and I had a chance after both babies came out, to run to NICU to see all this craziness happening. Collette\u2019s doing whatever women do after they give, I\u2019m not really sure, but it kind of freaks me out to think about it. So they\u2019re doing all that kind of stuff and she gets to come in later and it\u2019s this emotional experience. She\u2019s crying and sees the babies with all these cords and wires and it\u2019s emotional. And all these things are happening and she finally gets to eat and drink.</p> <p>And then we realize we have nothing for the babies to wear. So Collette gets cleaned up and we jump in the car and drive across the street to Fred Meyer to grab something for her to eat and for the babies. You know, a couple little things. So in the last 24 hours, my wife has given birth to not one, but two babies, she hasn\u2019t eaten, hasn\u2019t slept, hasn\u2019t drank. It\u2019s just been craziness. And I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like. But as me, as the husband who\u2019s just kind participating and watching this whole process, I\u2019m like, this is horrible. I\u2019m so grateful that it\u2019s not me. And I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m onery and I\u2019m sore and all these emotions and I didn\u2019t even do anything, I just sat there.</p> <p>So we get to the store and buying our things, and we\u2019re checking out and there\u2019s this teenage girl and she\u2019s so annoyed to be there, and does not want to be talking to us. And we\u2019re trying to be happy, but we\u2019re obviously worn out, and I was like, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201cOkay.\u201d You know like teenagers do. We\u2019re like, \u201coh yeah, what\u2019s going on?\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cOh what\u2019s going on?\u201d and I think it\u2019s like 11 A.M. at this time, it\u2019s been like 30 hours since we had woken up because my wife was about to have a baby. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh I had to get up early this morning. I had to be here by 11. So I had to get up at 9. I\u2019m so tired, I didn\u2019t go to bed last night until like 1\u201d and we\u2019re like, \u201cOh so you only had 8 hours of sleep last night. And you\u2019re so tired.\u201d And we\u2019re sitting there smiling like, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re complaining about how tired you are. You had 8 hours of sleep last night. You\u2019re a teenager, you have zero stress in the world. And you\u2019re complaining.</p> <p>And it was kind of funny to us at the time. So I thought it was kind of funny. Last week I hung out with these guys. If you listened to the podcast last week, Monday night I was at the office til 3 or 4 in the morning. Tuesday it was the same thing. I think I got 3 hours of sleep that night and then Wednesday I had a full day and then I went out to go meet some people and I\u2019m talking to one of the guys and he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh really, what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cI got off work at 6 and then the kids and dinner and all this stress or whatever, I\u2019m just really, really tired. \u201c I just kind of smiled like, \u201cOh man, that sounds horrible. You\u2019ve got to be tired. I mean you woke up, went to the office and then you came home and then you were off the clock and then you saw your kids and you were done. And that was it right? I have been at the office til past 3 A.M. the last two mornings in a row, and after I\u2019m done with you guys today, I\u2019m going back to the office.\u201d And it just made me smile because I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re complaining about being tired and it\u2019s just funny, because you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re complaining to.\u201dSomeone who has had 1/10th the sleep that you had and it just makes me kind of smile.</p> <p>So what I wanted to share with you guys today is just be careful who you\u2019re complaining to, because chances are people around all of us, have it worse off than we do. I was telling my kids last night. I was like, \u201cIf you think about 200 years ago, people lived in log cabins, they didn\u2019t have toilets that flushed. They didn\u2019t have phones or computers. 200 years ago, and everything prior to 200 years ago. 300 years, 400, 1000, 5000. Back as far as you want to go to the beginning of time. People had a really crappy time. If you complain about anything in this day and age, that\u2019s kind of sad at this point. Do you have a roof over your head? Does your toilet flush? Okay, you\u2019re doing fine then. Quit complaining.</p> <p>So not only should we all just quit complaining as a whole, but when you are complaining, just be careful who you are complaining to. Because chances are, the person around you had just as tough a day, if not worse and you\u2019re just going to look dumb if you\u2019re complaining to them about what happened. Anyway, that\u2019s what I got for today. I hope that helps somebody and it helps to keep us all\u2026.to quit complaining. To be grateful for the roof over our head, and flushing toilets and all the amazing stuff we\u2019re blessed with because we were born today\u2019s date in time. So that\u2019s what I got for you guys today. Appreciate you all. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.

They also explain the concept of sticky cookies and why they are better than first cookie wins.</p> <p>Here are 3 fun things you\u2019ll hear on today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>The interesting, and kind of backwards way they are thinking of launching Funnel University.</li> <li>Why affiliates will benefit from the use of sticky cookies rather than first cookie wins when it comes to promoting Funnel University.</li> <li>Why Russell is currently selling toilet paper with Clickfunnels.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how this new launch idea would work and decide if you think it will sell really well or completely flop.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Russell: Hey everyone, this is Russell, welcome to a really strange, different version of Marketing In Your Car. Alright, so I\u2019m in the car right now with Dave.</p> <p>Dave: Hey guys!</p> <p>Russell: We are heading into the office today is Funnel University Launch Day, no matter what. You guys have heard me complain, this has been\u2026.I\u2019m a big believer in the whole lead or gold thing, this time we killed 3 people, there\u2019s lead in some people because we missed the deadlines. But today it\u2019s happening no matter what.</p> <p>So we\u2019re driving and had an idea and we\u2019re brainstorming about it and we just wanted to share with you guys, because who knows, something good might come. So typically in a product launch, we promote the product to everyone. So we\u2019re thinking, what if we do a complete sneak attack and instead of promoting the product, we promote the opportunity to sell the product to our entire lists. So we email all the Clickfunnels members and basically just say, \u201cHey step number one we\u2019re rolling out, this new product is coming out, first step you need to go get it because you gotta become an ambassador of this so go get it because it\u2019s amazing. Then the second step is, you need to be an affiliate, so click here to get your affiliate account and lets go spam Facebook, or let\u2019s go market efficiently to Facebook and other places.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the complete backwards sneak attack that will either work or it will completely bomb. I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>Dave: It also ties into to what you were talking about yesterday in Marketing In Your Car, as far as the importance of having affiliates. So now everyone who\u2019s a Clickfunnels user you\u2019re automatically an affiliate, so now you can basically show every single person real quick how to make your very first few bucks online, if you\u2019re not already doing it. If you\u2019ve already got a list or if you don\u2019t have a list, I can now go out and promote something for Clickfunnels\u2026..by the way we also have sticky cookies, but that\u2019s for a different topic. So you have the opportunity of making money right away by giving away a gift.</p> <p>Russell: Here\u2019s a gift worth $700 or $800, we\u2019re giving away for free, anyone you give it away to, you get commission. So let\u2019s talk about the sticky cookie thing. This is a cool thing we just built. We\u2019re the first one to test it, but I think it\u2019s Clickfunnels wide.</p> <p>Dave: It is.</p> <p>Russell: So the way sticky cookies work, if you\u2019re using backpack, let\u2019s say you promote Funnel University and somebody signs up but then 6 months later I convince them to get a Clickfunnels account, you get commissions on that. Or 6 months later you convince them to get my book, you get commissions on that. It\u2019s sticky to the person. There\u2019s a fine line between sticky cookies, and first cookie wins, because I\u2019m not a big believer in first cookie wins. So here\u2019s the lifelong affiliate debate. One is like\u2026.first cookie wins means, if you click on my link first that cookie lasts forever, so if that person ever buys, you get the commission, which is good for fast movers. But people come in later it sucks because then someone comes in 6 months later and convinces somebody to buy and gives them a big bonus and then they don\u2019t get commissions because the first dude 6 months ago got the first cookie.</p> <p>So sticky cookies is not that because we don\u2019t want to make it so people don\u2019t want to promote.</p> <p>Dave: As a product owner it really messes things up because then the only people who ever promote are your very first affiliates.</p> <p>Russell: Yeah, there\u2019s no incentive for people to come in later. So sticky cookies works, where it\u2019s sticky so\u00a0 let\u2019s say you get somebody to opt-in for the Clickfunnels trial and they don\u2019t buy, or they opt-in at their house and then they go to work the next day and that\u2019s when they decided to buy. Or let\u2019s say they opt-in for Funnel University they don\u2019t buy it, but then they buy Clickfunnels 3 weeks later because the follow-up sequence sold them and they buy that from a different computer. Sticky cookies will follow that person around, so if they buy 3 months later, it will still give you the commission for that person, even if they\u2019re on a different browser, or computer, different product. Any product in our product line, if they buy you get commissions. The only way you would lose that person is if a new affiliate re-cookied them, it would override the sticky cookie. But the sticky cookie\u2019s there for as long as it follows them.</p> <p>The way it works is it\u2019s not just cookie based. Let\u2019s say you get somebody to opt-in, it adds your affiliate ID in the database, it knows if they buy anything from us in the future, even if there\u2019s no cookie present, when they fill in the order form it\u2019ll look to see who was the last affiliate who referred them to anything and give that person the commission. So that\u2019s the concept of sticky cookies, which is a cool thing, as far as backpack, it\u2019s this really cool advanced thing that nobody else is doing. So you should be using backpack for your affiliate platforms.</p> <p>The cool thing is you promote Funnel University, all of the other crap we sell in the future\u2026.I mean all the amazing products we sell in the future. Sorry I don\u2019t know why\u2026\u2026we should probably edit that out. No.</p> <p>Dave: No it\u2019s actually the reason crap is coming up so much is because we\u2019re thinking about selling toilet paper through a funnel. That\u2019s why crap keeps coming up.</p> <p>Russell: Oh man, there\u2019s so many back stories to this week. Well two things of crap, one is Marcus Lemonis\u2019 funnel, we\u2019re selling toilet paper. It\u2019s a crap funnel. All the products in the funnel are related to crap. And then Dave and I are also on a juice fast this week, which has added to the amount of crap we\u2019ve been experiencing.</p> <p>Dave:\u00a0 TMI</p> <p>Russell: So back to the strategy. So now that you guys got the backstory, we\u2019ve got another 5 minutes before we\u2019re at the office, Dave and I are kind of brainstorming this. So if we do it, the big thing with we mail the affiliates in, we\u2019ve gotta basically tell them that, you give away this gift and you can get paid 40% commission.</p> <p>Dave: And it\u2019s recurring.</p> <p>Russell: And it\u2019s recurring, yeah. And the product\u2019s amazing. They get a print newsletter, they get software, which is super sticky. I showed you the software this week, it\u2019s amazing. So what\u2019s the downside? Because this is either going to work really good or it\u2019s a gonna completely bomb. The downside is people buying through their own affiliate link probably. They\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh I\u2019m going to buy it through my own affiliate link.\u201d which is annoying. Do we care or do we not worry about it?</p> <p>Dave: Today we don\u2019t care. The other thing is there\u2019s going to be a lot of urgency and scarcity to it, which helps everyone understand the importance of getting out and doing it right away. Because otherwise, there\u2019s no reason for them to promote it. This is a product that\u2019s not going to be available to be promoted long term.</p> <p>Russell: It\u2019d be basically two weeks and then we\u2019re shutting down the cart. So you\u2019ve got two weeks to buy this thing or else you lost your opportunity, and two weeks to promote it.</p> <p>Dave: Which is again, a topic for another Marketing In Your Car as far as membership sites and scarcity. But right now, the whole idea is to send out to the affiliates and basically to do a Blab or Periscope or something where people get excited about it and they can go ahead and have the opportunity of offering a free product to everybody and if they buy that product, they then will also be cookied with our sticky cookies long term so if they then upgrade to Clickfunnels, which is the whole reason we\u2019ve got Funnel University, then they\u2019ll have the opportunity of getting commission on that as well.</p> <p>Russell: It\u2019s amazing. So what we\u2019re inventing here is the backwards product launch, where we\u2019re launching the affiliate program and we\u2019re hoping it incentivizes them to buy the product and promote the product. So each sale doesn\u2019t turn into one sale, it turns into 5 or 10 or 20 sales, depending. That\u2019s be interesting stats to check afterwards. How many sales per average user. Because if you buy and post on Facebook, \u201cHey Russell Brunson is giving away this $1000 marketing gift, I just bought it. Here\u2019s my receipt, you should buy it too.\u201d Everyone should be able to get 5 or 6 people from it. What if that\u2019s the way the email reads like, Everyone go buy the product, that way you can show, \u201cHey I just bought this product, this is how cool it is. It\u2019s going to be coming this week.\u201d And then post that on Facebook or you email it, and tell everyone they need to get it two. So that\u2019s step two, and then step\u2026..yeah.</p> <p>Dave:\u00a0 And It will go to the\u2026.You can link that directly on Facebook to the landing page, which would have a video.</p> <p>Russell: This is so cool. I think we need to make a landing page that\u2019s just a fast sale landing page too. Because the sales page we have there\u2019s an hour long really cool, amazing video we made teaching some cool stuff using the Perfect Webinar Script. And then we pitch it really hard. It\u2019s a free plus shipping offer so I don\u2019t think it needs to be sold that hard. So I might clone the page right now and just make a simplified version of it that the affiliates can have so they can promote to the longer form education video or the quick sale or the squeeze page. Because the squeeze page has an amazing follow-up sequence as well.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking. so we\u2019re just brainstorming and we thought let\u2019s just invite everyone else in on this behind the scenes to hear what we\u2019re thinking because this is either going to be a huge success or a complete flop. I think we\u2019re going to do it, but we still gotta just confirm we are. So now you guys know what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. We will find out today if that\u2019s the right strategy and we\u2019ll let you know in the next week if it works or if it completely bombs. If it bombs we\u2019ll definitely shift mid-launch to \u201cDon\u2019t promote this thing, just go buy it.\u201d Alright guys, that\u2019s what we got for you. Have an amazing day and we\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.

I almost just got in a wreck, but because I survived I thought I\u2019d jump on here real quick and hang out with you guys today on Marketing In Your Car. Hey everyone, good morning. I\u2019m feeling horrible right now. We\u2019ve got a lot of fun stuff happening. I don\u2019t know if I mentioned on the podcast or somewhere, but we\u2019re building out some sales funnels for Marcus Lemonis, so I had Wynter Jones, one of my favorite people and an amazing designer, I had him fly out to Boise this week to work on it. So we\u2019ve been working funnel hacking out hours, so every night we get home at 1 or 2 in the morning. Today it\u2019s Wednesday, so it\u2019s been two nights in a row of super late nights.</p> <p>This morning I have Frenectomy surgery. I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called. This little thing in my mouth that I have to get snipped and I really am not looking forward to it, in fact I\u2019ve been postponing it now for a year and a half.\u00a0 And today is the day of reckoning. I\u2019ve got no choice, I\u2019ve gotta do it. I think I had 4 hours of sleep last night, now I\u2019m headed to the dentist, to go get my mouth chopped up. I was half asleep driving, and all the sudden traffic stopped and I was still going so I had to skid on my breaks, and then I thought hey if I survived that, I should definitely jump on with my friends and talk about something cool. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. I hope you guys are having a good time.</p> <p>We are working really hard on launching the new Clickfunnels affiliate center, which I\u2019m really excited about. I remember when I first got started in this business, and I don\u2019t know about you guys, but when I got started I was observing everybody doing stuff and talking about stuff and I was watching everybody making money and I didn\u2019t know how to do it. I was so sold on the fact that it was happening and I was just amazed by what everyone was doing. I had been creating some little products; I was selling stuff here and there and doing all sorts of things. And I remember back in the day there was a forum, it used to be awesome, it\u2019s super lame now, but it\u2019s called the Warrior Forum. Back then all the best marketers in the world would hang out there all day and talk marketing strategy which is cool. You go there now and it\u2019s this horrible place with a bunch of people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about complaining about things, so it\u2019s no longer awesome. But there was a day and time when it was awesome.</p> <p>So I\u2019m hanging out in the warrior forum and there\u2019s all these people talking and sharing and giving and it was so cool. I remember this one post this dude wrote, the question was, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite way, what\u2019s the best way to get traffic?\u201d and I was trying to learn how to do traffic at the time, this is pre-Facebook so that wasn\u2019t even an option. It was just Google and SEO and all the different things, so I saw that question and I was like, oh man, this is going to be awesome. I\u2019m going to hear all these legends and these giants and these marketers discuss the best way to get traffic and I\u2019ll just figure out what the best one is and build on that. That was my thought when I saw the post.</p> <p>I start reading it and one guy\u2019s like, \u201cGoogle PPC is the best because blah.\u201d The next guy was like, \u201cSEO the best because blah.\u201d Then someone\u2019s like, this was back in the day and there was this thing called cloaking, \u201cCloaking is the best.\u201d \u201cSafelist.\u201d I\u2019m trying to think of what back then was cool, there\u2019s all sorts of stuff. Anyway, everyone\u2019s posting their ideas and trying to justify why what they did was the best. So I\u2019m going through all these things and then all the sudden there was this dude, his name was Allen Sais. He was the guy who owned the Warrior Forum, and he didn\u2019t post a lot, but when he did, he would silently walk in, drop a bomb of gold and walk back out. That\u2019s totally what happened with this. All these people giving their explanation of these things, and he came in and dropped on sentence. All he said was, \u201cI rely on my own network of affiliates.\u201d Boom. Mic drop. Bomb exploded.</p> <p>And I read that and I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d At first it didn\u2019t make sense to me. I read it and I read it again and kept reading it. And I knew that Allen was probably one of the better marketers, one of the more rich guys in that forum, and I was thinking of that and I was like, \u201cThere\u2019s something to this. I gotta figure this out.\u201d My brain was thinking, \u201cI could learn PPC like that guy said, but what if I had 5 or 6 affiliates who are really good at PPC and they just did that. And I give them a percentage of the money, but they just did it and I don\u2019t have to learn that. Maybe I\u2019m not as good as one guy, but if I had 5 people doing it, or 10 people, who knows? What about SEO, I could do SEO or what if I find people who are already amazing at SEO and they become affiliates of mine.\u201d Now instead of me doing SEO I\u2019ve got 10, 20, 30 people doing SEO for me. What if instead of building a list, I found other people who have lists? And I realized that there was this power and this leverage of having affiliates, because I can build lists of a million people, which is awesome. But if I had 30 people each with lists of a million people, it\u2019s so much more powerful. I could even rank number one on Google for my number one keyword, but what if I had 20 people all ranked. And I started thinking that, and that\u2019s gotta be my focus, is less on me becoming a\u00a0 ninja at any one traffic source, and more of me building a really good affiliate program and attracting people that already have those things. People who are already doing those things and are already amazing at those things. That was kind of the thought process.</p> <p>So back then, man this back 10-12 years ago, I launched my first affiliate program. And that became my focus. We trained affiliates and had an affiliate center and we had all sorts of things and that was my focus and because of that, my companies grew dramatically. During that time I became good at these other things, I learned how to drive traffic, I learned how to do stuff so I was able to do that. But we made 90% of our income from affiliates, and I think it\u2019s really powerful.</p> <p>With Clickfunnels when we launched it, we drove a lot of our traffic, but we had a lot of affiliates and that\u2019s how we grew so quickly, is leveraging my network with affiliates I\u2019ve been building up over the last ten years. But even with that, we\u2019ve never had a good affiliate center. We\u2019ve never done a lot of the core things we used to do back in the day to build and promote our affiliate program. We just haven\u2019t ever done that. So that\u2019s one of the big focuses, while Wynter\u2019s been designing Marcus\u2019 funnels, me and Dave Woodward, who runs the Clickfunnels affiliate program, have been focusing on building out an affiliate center and having new offers and just creating a bunch of cool things that will get people the ability to win cars from us and to make money, and all the other cool things we\u2019re doing inside our affiliate program. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on and I think today, unless we had a couple little hiccups along the way, so unless something crazy happens, we\u2019ll be launching the Clickfunnels affiliate program. We\u2019re also going to be launching Funnel University. Which I think I mentioned 3 or 4 times in the last month or two that we were going to launch Funnel University, but we just had some external things that I don\u2019t even want to talk about, because it makes me so mad why we haven\u2019t been able to launch it.</p> <p>Today should be the day unless there\u2019s something crazy that comes up, we had one last hiccup happen last night at 2 in the morning, so we were trying to get that cleaned up, and then we should be ready to rock and roll. So those of you guys who have been paying attention and watching, we should have Funnel University live today, which is exciting. You should all buy it because it\u2019s going to be amazing. I\u2019m really proud of it. The content is second to none. So that\u2019s really cool. So the content\u2019s amazing and then\u2026..my brain\u2019s blanking out. Oh the software. There\u2019s 3 software tools and they\u2019re just insane. We\u2019ve got a survey generator, a video image uploader, and a Webinar Chat app which are awesome tools. Anyway, there\u2019s so much cool stuff.</p> <p>The sales funnel we\u2019re using to sell, I\u2019m really proud. We put a lot of time and energy and thought in that one, so it\u2019ll be fun to finally let the world see that, which is cool. What else, what else? And then the Affiliate Center. The new Clickfunnels affiliate center is going live too. Anyway, I\u2019m excited. If you\u2019re spying on me you should be able to see some of those things. The biggest message I wanted to share with you guys today is just that that\u2019s where my focus is at. Is building our network of affiliates and I hope that that resonates with you guys. It comes back to all the stuff we talked about, dream 100, creating cool affiliate programs, and then there\u2019s so much stuff that goes into it, but it is the key. So I hope all you guys focus on that in your businesses. I hope that little piece gives you guys the same aha that I had all those years ago when I heard Allen Sais say it the very first time. That\u2019s it for today you guys. I\u2019m at the dentist, I\u2019m about to walk in there and get my mouth chopped open. I\u2019m freaking out, but hopefully it will be good. Talk to you guys soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "10:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_218.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1460415151, "title": "Episode #217 \u2013 What Happened To TV Is Now Happening To Facebook", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Which marketing channel is the best to focus on today?</p> <p>On this episode, Russell talks about how TV changed over the years and made advertising more difficult.

Welcome to another amazing day. Hey everybody, it\u2019s amazing today. It\u2019s like 80 degrees, which it shouldn\u2019t be. I think it said on the news that normally it\u2019s like 60 today, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s 80. It\u2019s beautiful and it\u2019s amazing and I love it. You know you can\u2019t help but be happy when it\u2019s nice out here.</p> <p>Okay, last night I had wrestling practice. I have not wrestled for a couple of weeks. We beat the crap out of each other and today my face is feeling it, my neck is feeling it, my back is feeling it, my arms, my sides, my ribs, my fingers. I am jacked and I love it. I miss this feeling. This is so much better than running on a treadmill. It was awesome. So last nice after practice we were talking about some stuff and I mentioned something that I thought was kind of cool so I wanted to share with you guys.</p> <p>So I wanted to talk about old media, kind of what happened and then new media and what is happening now, because it\u2019s really interesting. Rewind back I don\u2019t know, twenty years ago maybe. No, I guess, dang I\u2019m getting old. I guess twenty wasn\u2019t that long ago, maybe thirty years ago. Whenever TV was different, before cable. There used to be three channels, there was ABC, CBS, and NBC I believe and maybe Fox, I don\u2019t know when Fox came around, but initially it was three channels.</p> <p>So if you wanted to get to everybody in the world, there\u2019s only one of three spots you could advertise on. And those who capitalized on it made a lot of money really fast. In fact, the first time I meant Tony Robbins, this is the kind of story he told me. He said, \u201cWhen I got started thirty years ago there were only three channels, so we just targeted those three channels, it was easy and we made a ton of money. What happened is that a few years later, they started adding more channels\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s when Fox News came about, and PBS and I don\u2019t know, some of the other ones. And then it turned into cable. Cable had a couple of channels and then it turned into a couple more, and then today there\u2019s hundreds channels on cable. Still there\u2019s never actually anything good on TV, which is kind of amazing.</p> <p>But there\u2019s hundreds and hundreds of channels. And Tony said that his business during the recession took a huge hit and it was mostly because it was harder to get distribution directly to people. It became more expensive, it became harder, it became more spread out because no longer are people watching three channels, they are watching 103, and to buy ads on 103 different networks became really expensive. So because of that they were struggling they started exploring different avenues and that\u2019s how we kind of met him, a bunch of us internet marketing dudes. We initially met him during that part of the journey where he was like, \u201cMan, our distribution channels are so segmented and so fragmented now we can effectively get to our end audience.\u201d And it changed the whole dynamic of their business. They had to shift and evolve and get better.</p> <p>That was this whole process of going from 1 or 2 centralized spots where everybody\u2019s eyeballs are at, to hundreds of spots and how it changed the business world. Now I was talking about how similar that is today. And one cool thing that\u2019s interesting, the one thing that got easier when channels split is that because all these channels start popping up, things became very niche specific. There\u2019s the camping channel, there\u2019s the home channel, you know HGTV where they\u2019re building homes and fixing and rehabbing and stuff. There\u2019s all these different channels and they\u2019re very niche-y. So if you had a niche business related to one of those channels it became easier, because you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t have to advertise on NBC in front of a billion people and hope that a few people that actually care about my camping product are going to see it.\u201d Now you can go to just the camping channel and everyone who is interested in camping is on that one channel. So for niche markets it became a lot easier, because now you\u2019ve got your captive audience all in one spot and you can focus and target on that one channel. So that was kind of the big benefit that came from this huge breakup of TV.</p> <p>Man the sun is so bright, my body wants to sneeze like crazy. So if I start sneezing, having a sneezing attack, that\u2019s why.</p> <p>Alright, so that\u2019s the offline world. What happened, things were harder for people and also things were easier. When I looked at online it was kind of similar. A few years ago Mark Zuckerberg had a really sweet idea for a thing called Facebook, built it out, first it was free for a long time, then he started adding ad platforms. At first it became the place. It was the only place you would go, you could jump on Facebook, buy some ads and become rich. It was that easy because everybody was in one centralized spot. Just like back in the day with ABC, NBC and CBS, one spot, so Facebook was easy. It just worked. Then what happened is that after Facebook, a few years later, all the sudden people started splitting attention, because now these other social networks started popping up. You get Twitter, you get Pinterest, you start getting all the video platforms, you get Periscope and other things like that and then you split again. You\u2019ve got Snapchat, you\u2019ve got I can\u2019t think of them all, but it went from one spot where people were spending their time and energy now it\u2019s this huge fragmented thing.</p> <p>Now people are picking their favorite platform and they\u2019re leaving Facebook. Not everybody\u2019s eyeballs are on Facebook 80 hours a day like it used to be. Now it\u2019s like, \u201cI spend my time on Snapchat, that\u2019s where you gotta find me.\u201d And then other people, \u201cI\u2019m on Pinterest.\u201d And other people are on different spots. So what\u2019s happened is that us as marketers used to be like \u201cLet\u2019s get really good at Facebook ads.\u201d Now you gotta get good at Facebook and Pinterest and Snapchat and Twitter and YouTube and\u2026.where everybody\u2019s eyeballs are going.</p> <p>So there\u2019s kind of positives and negatives of that. Very similar to the positives and negatives of the TV world. But before I explain those things, I am at my little man\u2019s parent-teacher conference. I\u2019m pulling in the parking lot, so what I\u2019m going to do, I\u2019m going to pause this right now, I\u2019m going to go find out how smart my little son is, get his report cards and then I will be back for the rest of my drive back to the office to discuss this in a little more details. I\u2019ll be back in a little bit guys. Talk to you soon.</p> <p>Alright everybody, I am back. In case you are wondering, Aiden passed his kindergarten, or I guess his preschool parent-teacher conferences. He\u2019s a genius, he cuts straight lines, he draws great pictures, he can count to ten all by himself. He\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 Its fun they have pictures from when the year started and then now and you can kind of see the difference of how far he\u2019s progressed on the Alphabet, numbers, pictures, coloring, cutting, drawing pictures of himself. Anyway, it was awesome. So there you go, my son\u2019s a genius, which is cool.</p> <p>So where did we leave off? I think I left off talking about how online media is starting to be fragmented just like the offline world was, it was happened way faster by the way. We had three channels on TV for decades. You know Facebook had a year, two year run before Twitter and these others start popping up everywhere and splitting the attention. So the attention\u2019s going to all other sorts of places. So with that comes a couple of things. First off it gets harder. How is someone like me or you, who\u2019s like, we\u2019re small entrepreneurs, we\u2019ve got a little team and we are trying to effectively market on thirty different platforms. It\u2019s hard. At least with the TV age it was like, it\u2019s thirty platforms, but basically you call your ad guy and say, \u201cHey run my ad over here, over here, and over here.\u201d But with what we got to do, every platform is different. Some are keyword focused some are interest focused, some are\u2026.the way you run the ad, the way you design the ad are all different. You can\u2019t run the same commercial on thirty channels. You gotta write image ads for here, video ads for here, 15 second videos here, but longer videos over here.</p> <p>And then each platform has multiple ways to advertise too. You\u2019ve got pre-roll videos, post-roll, tech\u2026.it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s this huge segmentation splitting of attention and for us to effectively be in all of them, it\u2019s almost impossible. What do you do? It\u2019s a good question. What should you do? A couple of things that I would notice, first off is notice the fact about in the TV world that it got easier when you focused more on a niche. If you were selling camping gear, you could go to the camping channel. You\u2019re target demographic was there, which is cool.\u00a0 So it\u2019s easier. So same thing as here, you gotta realize that even though there\u2019s thirty different platforms, your audience isn\u2019t on all of them. Even if they are on all of them, doesn\u2019t mean you have to be on all of them.</p> <p>I always tell people, you gotta learn initially one platform that you know your audience is on and become a master of that. So if I know camping channel is where everyone is at, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to focus, if I know for me all my people are on Pinterest, I\u2019m going to focus there and master that one thing. If I know they\u2019re all on Instagram, or if I know they\u2019re all on Snapchat\u2026.Wherever your people are, that\u2019s the platform to pick. Just like the camping channel, we\u2019re going to pick that one and be the best at that and focus on that and start pulling out customers from there. And really become good at that and then after you\u2019ve mastered it, not while you\u2019re mastering, this is the key. After you\u2019ve mastered it, then go and pick the next channel. And then you can add on another one and another, but you shouldn\u2019t be in thirty different things. It\u2019s just too hard. You\u2019re watering down all of your efforts, whereas you can focus on one and perfect it, it becomes better.</p> <p>So those are some of my observations and thoughts today that I thought were kind of interesting and I hope that helps you guys to kind of look at that and say , \u201cOkay, this is being fragmented, I understand that now and I can\u2019t be everywhere at once because I will run out of money and time and energy and my message will become so diluted. I gotta pick one.\u201d Pick the one that your market\u2019s at because everyone\u2019s market is different. My market\u2019s not on Pinterest, but I\u2019ve got other friends that make tons of money on Pinterest. My market is maybe on Instagram, I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t figured Instagram out yet. But other markets I got friends making a million bucks a year a hundred percent off Instagram. So you gotta figure out where your people are actually at? How are they consuming content? And you got to be there. But you don\u2019t have to be on every single platform. That\u2019s the mistake that so many people are making. And they\u2019re spending money on so many different things. You can mine a lot of gold out of one well.</p> <p>So figure out where that\u2019s at and dig deeper and deeper and just kind of focus there and eventually, especially depending on the platform, some platforms are smaller. Some TV channels don\u2019t have as much viewership, so eventually you\u2019re going to tap out where everyone\u2019s seen your message and you\u2019re going to get ad fatigue and it\u2019s just not going to do as well. At that point do you change the message or that\u2019s when you add a second channel or a second distribution channel to focus on? But that\u2019s a more powerful strategy, go deep and try to mine all that gold out of that channel as opposed to trying to effectively be in thirty or forty or fifty different channels and hopefully dabble in all of them. I\u2019d always rather go deep in one section than dabble in a lot.</p> <p>So that\u2019s it for today you guys. I\u2019m heading into the office. I got some exciting things happening. So exciting. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be sharing those with you guys in the next little while. I just wanted to take the time to drop some of those thoughts with you guys. So that\u2019s what I got. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "12:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_217.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1460395515, "title": "Episode #216 \u2013 Good Marketing Solves Everything", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What area in life are you struggling with today?\u2026 Good marketing will solve EVERY problem.</p> <p>On this episode, Russell talks about good marketing, and why it can solve every problem in your life.\u00a0 He also goes over why bad marketing is destroying the Boise State Wrestling Program and how good marketing could fix it.</p> <p>Here are 3 cool things you\u2019ll learn in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell isn\u2019t currently donating time or money to the Boise State Wrestling Program.</li> <li>How good marketing has the potential to save the Boise State Wrestling Program.</li> <li>And \u00a0how applying good marketing into every aspect of your life (yes marriage, relationships, finances, business, etc\u2026) will make it better.</li> </ul> <p>So listen in below to discover how to solve problems in all aspects of life with the power of good marketing.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, right now I\u2019m actually in the middle of a carwash and this is a first for Marketing In Your Car. Alright everyone, if you guys can hear me or not, we are in the middle of a carwash.\u00a0 I hope you can hear this; it\u2019s kind of loud outside. I got car washed a week ago and then I had it the other day and it rained, just drizzled a little bit, and then my cars been spotted for the last week and I\u2019m like, you know what I\u2019m going to go and get this washed so that it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m driving a car that\u2019s been sitting out for the last 2 weeks or whatever.</p> <p>That\u2019s where we are at, that\u2019s the water going over us if you can hear that. Now we\u2019re moving to the extreme polish section. Sweet, it\u2019s dumping tons and tons of suds all over me and there\u2019s all these crazy lines of red, green, I feel like I\u2019m in a disco right now. This looks awesome from the inside. This is one of those carwashes you drive in and put your car in neutral and it pulls you through the whole thing while it\u2019s washing everything. I think my wife might be behind me. There\u2019s a car that\u2019s just like my wife\u2019s behind me, which would be really weird. Who knows? Maybe she\u2019s getting her car washed today too.</p> <p>I\u2019m driving the Corvette, so the guy was staring at me, looking at me he\u2019s like, \u201cNice car.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThanks.\u201d Anyway, I have some serious stuff to talk about, but I want to wait til I can hear you and you can hear me. We\u2019re about to pass through to the end. The final scrubbing and wax It says the element of protection is going through, now it\u2019s rinsing off all the bubbles. And now we\u2019re about to go through the part where they crank on the heat and the air, and it\u2019s going to blow all this water away. And here it comes. This is my favorite part. Right now all the water is being blown up the windshield so it feels like, it\u2019s awesome. And check that out you guys, I\u2019ve got a car now that is clean. It\u2019s not completely dry but it\u2019s mostly dry. Oh here comes the last phase, oh, I see flames. Alright you guys, now we\u2019ve experienced a carwash on Marketing In Your Car. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that.</p> <p>What I\u2019m doing right now, it\u2019s getting loud again. So I\u2019m going to actually pause it for a second, because I gotta go vacuum out the inside real quick, then I got something very important to talk to you about. So that\u2019s the game plan, I will see you guys in a few minutes here. We will pick up where we left off.</p> <p>Alright, alright, we are back on the road, and ready for an amazing day. So what I want to talk about today is a very important subject, in fact it is the most important subject, arguably that you will have to learn about or think about in your life. And that is very broad, but it\u2019s important and I\u2019ll explain why here in a second. It\u2019s marketing. Marketing matters. I was going to say that it\u2019s the only thing that matters, but that\u2019s not quite true, but it\u2019s the only thing that matters if you want anything in life. So there you go.</p> <p>Now kind of to explain this; most of you guys know, if not you need to go back and listen to all the other 5000 episodes to catch up with who I am. But, I\u2019m a wrestler. I grew up, was a wrestler in high school, was a state champ, took 2nd place in the country, was an all American. I went to Brigham Young University for a year, wrestled there. They dropped the wrestling program, transferred to Boise State, wrestled here, finished up my wrestling career here and then later went and tried to try out for the Olympics. We kind of built an Olympic training center here in Boise Idaho. I employed half the Olympic team to wrestle when our company was at a big peak, and then the company kind of collapsed, I had to cut the program and that really sucked.</p> <p>But, there\u2019s my wrestling background in a nutshell. So I love it more than probably everyone on earth. I spent over $600,000 that year on the wrestling program and it didn\u2019t go anywhere, which is a lot of money to throw away. But that\u2019s how much I love wrestling. So yesterday morning I get an email from some of the wrestlers on the team and they\u2019re talking about the Boise State coaches. I wrestled Boise State and we had two coaches. The head coach and assistant coach. The head coach, while he was a really nice guy, horrible marketer. Worst marketer on planet Earth. Can\u2019t recruit, can\u2019t train, can\u2019t sell anybody in anything, somehow he got the head coach job. He\u2019s kind of been there forever so when the old coach left they let him come in there. He\u2019s kind of run the program into the ground, and instead of noticing that and being like, \u201cHey I should surround myself with great people.\u201d He did the other thing, which is \u201cLet me get rid of everyone around me who knows what they\u2019re doing to make me look better.\u201d And I had that same thing happen\u2026\u2026.</p> <p>It\u2019s something that\u2019s common among wrestlers and among leaders who aren\u2019t necessarily great leaders. So instead of trying to up their skills they fire and they cut the people around them and make them look better. Which by the way, horrible management idea. To anyone that\u2019s followed my podcast, or what I believe. I\u2019m the other way, I surround myself with A player geniuses that are smarter than me, because they make me look good. That\u2019s kind of the opposite. But for him the idea was, \u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna cut people around me who are doing good stuff because it\u2019ll make me look better.\u201d So yesterday he actually fired the assistant coach, which is insane because the assistant coach ran the whole program, did all the recruiting, did everything. But because of that, it made him look bad, so instead of being grateful and appreciative to that person like he should have been, he instead fired him, so that it would make him feel more secure in his role.</p> <p>Now there is a huge uproar in the wrestling community here. So I got on this email chain that went on back and forth and back and forth all day long with people who want to get our coach fired. Trying to talk to the administrator and all sorts of things. Reinstate the assistant coach in place of the head coach and all sorts of crazy things. I just mentioned really quickly, \u201cOkay, I agree there needs to be a change. I don\u2019t invest money in the Boise State wrestling program anymore, because of some issues. And I would love to invest money back in the program. I love wrestling, I love Boise State, but I haven\u2019t because a lot of the issues that everyone is talking about right now.\u201d So one of the guys messages me and he\u2019s like, \u201cWell as a potential investor, what things would you like to see that would make it so you would be willing to give money.\u201d They said, \u201cPlease be brutally honest.\u201d</p> <p>So that should be an entrance way to give me the ability to say what I really believe, and then should listen, they should shut their mouths, listen because you asked me to be brutally honest. So I went through and I was brutally honest. \u201cThese are the reasons I would not give money to the Boise State Wrestling program today.\u201d And I gave the reasons, boom, boom, boom, boom.</p> <p>A marketer would have looked at that and said wow, if you guys came to the funnel hacking event, it talked a lot about how, \u201cHere\u2019s the 3 step process to build the business. Step 1 find a market, step 2 ask them what they want, step 3 give it to them.\u201d So you\u2019re trying to figure out how to get money from me, so I say here are the reasons I\u2019m not giving you money. The smart thing a marketer would say, \u201cWow, he told me exactly how to sell him.\u201d And you come back and say, \u201cRussell, sweet. You want this, I will do this.\u201d And you would give me what I asked you for, and I will give you money. It\u2019s so simple. All you need to do is just listen to what I said, and then give it to me and you get free money for doing nothing. That was what should have happened.</p> <p>Instead, this guy, bless him he\u2019s a wrestling coach\u2026.I don\u2019t know. I love wrestlers, but\u2026\u2026.anyway, he came back on every one of the reasons why I said I don\u2019t currently invest and instead of saying \u201cwow, let me fix that so you will give me money for free. Came back and fought me on every single one, and insulted me on multiple of them. I was just like, \u201cAre you freaking kidding me.\u201d I am telling you what it will take for me to give you money and instead of saying, wow let\u2019s do that so you will give me money. He came back and fought me on every single point, insulted me on multiple ones and basically told me I wasn\u2019t a true wrestling fan. I was like, \u201cAre you freaking kidding me. Four years ago I spent 600,00 on wrestling here in Boise to make Boise wrestling better. In the last 12 months I\u2019ve spent I probably won\u2019t say, but insane amounts of money. More than the entire budget of the Boise State wrestling team for the next five years on my own wrestling room. I love wrestling more than anyone. Period. The end.</p> <p>For you to come in and attack me and insult me like that, now I sure as heck don\u2019t want to give you money first off, second off, your problems are all business issues you\u2019re struggling with. And you\u2019ll have a bunch of wrestlers that don\u2019t know anything about business trying to solve these business issues. There are a couple of people in our little community who are business owners who actually know how to build a business and help solve these problems, but instead of listening to people who actually know how to run big organizations and made tens of millions of dollars doing it, you insult them because we don\u2019t agree how it\u2019s been run up to this point, which obviously hasn\u2019t been a good job and that\u2019s why it\u2019s gotten to the point it is today.</p> <p>It was just kind of interesting to me. In all of my points, the things that I wanted so I would give them more money, were nothing like, \u201cRussell needs a statue of himself in the wrestling room.\u201d Although that would be pretty dang cool. All of them were like, \u201cI didn\u2019t know about any of the events last year. I only went to one match because I didn\u2019t know about it. We don\u2019t market to our own people. If me, Russell, who is obsessed with wrestling, who spent $150,000 to build his own wrestling room in his backyard, doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s a match coming up, there\u2019s a problem there.</p> <p>Instead of saying, \u201cWow, you\u2019re right Russell. As someone who\u2019s marketing and sold tens of millions of dollars a year in your own products and services, would you mind giving us some advice on how to market this?\u201d I would say, \u201cI would love to donate my time and my energy to a cause I believe in which is wrestling.\u201d But instead they come back and say, \u201cAll the true fans know when the matches are, those who don\u2019t we should probably try a little harder to let you guys know about it.\u201d Are you kidding me. I\u2019m saying I will give you more money if you will effectively market your business, that\u2019s what I told them and instead of asking me the best way to do that, they fought back on every single one.</p> <p>My dad started this All-star Match in Utah to be able to fundraise for Utah Valley Wrestling. When BYU dropped the wrestling program, I was there, they dropped the program and my dad came back and built the coalition and teamed it, \u201cSave wrestling in Utah\u201d and they actually started a new wrestling program called Utah Valley Wrestling at UVU. My dad\u2019s All-star match is running for 18 years, makes about $25,000 a year through this All-star match for the thing. I said, \u201cYou guys should run an All-star match.\u201d I told them this a couple of weeks ago, and they\u2019re like, \u201dWe have. We\u2019ve run one for two years in a row.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cReally, how much money did it make.\u201d \u201cLast year it did $3 grand and this year $4 grand.\u201d And I asked how they ran it and they were running everything wrong. So I asked my dad, \u201cThis is what\u2019s happening in the program. You\u2019ve been running one for 19 years, what would you do differently?\u201d and he told me, \u201cHere\u2019s all the issues. First off, you guys are doing it after the wrestling season, which means\u2026..this issue, this issue\u2026.\u201d And he went on all the issues and he talked about how he marketed it and how he got coverage in the newspapers and all this stuff. And my dad marketed it and successfully. It has become a huge fundraiser. Raised over a quarter of a million dollars for the wrestling program through this thing he did.</p> <p>So one of my things was like\u2026and Boise State, they fundraise every year by doing a golf tournament, I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re wrestlers, we should do wresting stuff to raise money for wrestling. I\u2019m not going to go to a golf tournament and give my money to wrestling. That\u2019s stupid. We need to use wrestling. We need wrestling camps, with junior wrestlers coaching these camps. That\u2019s just common sense. Things that revolve around wrestling to raise money for wrestling. We had an All-star match, apparently you guys from last year, has been a complete bomb. If you want my money we need someone to run a good allstar match. My dad has run one successfully for 19 years in Utah and raised $25,000 a year. Not one person has ever asked him how he did it. If you want me to donate my money, we\u2019ve gotta become business owners and marketers and focus on those things.\u201d</p> <p>So Instead of him saying, \u201cWow, can I talk to your dad\u201d He comes back and says, \u201dFirst off, we\u2019ve run this thing two years in a row and it has not been a failure, it\u2019s been a huge success.\u201d Then he starts going and getting defensive and talking about all the reasons this thing was a big success. I didn\u2019t even respond. I just pushed it off. I\u2019m using this podcast as my way to vent because I was frustrated. But I was like, Okay, what constitutes success for you? Was it a good wrestling match? Probably was. Did the athletes have a good time? Yeah, probably did. Did the few people who actually knew about it have a good time? Yes, they did. So from your standpoint as a wrestling coach it was a huge success. As a business owner, making $3000 from an event like that is a huge failure, horrible failure.</p> <p>If my employees ran that, I would have fired them. I\u2019m not saying from a, we ran a good event standpoint, it wasn\u2019t a good, I\u2019m sure it was. But as a business venture, it was ran horribly. And just from my 5 minute conversation with my dad I know 8 things they did wrong. If they just would have asked they would have known. I didn\u2019t even know that we had an All-star match in Idaho until I told them they should start one. Oh we have for two years. How have I never heard about it?</p> <p>These guys are missing the whole point. So what I\u2019ve found in my life, and I think its true is almost every single problem in life can be solved with good marketing. That\u2019s it. And until people understand that and embrace that, they\u2019re going to continue to suffer from mediocrity. Think about any aspect of your life. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend. My life sucks.\u201d How do you fix that problem? You learn how to market yourself. That\u2019s it. If you don\u2019t have a girlfriend or a wife or a spouse or a husband, or whatever the issue is, it\u2019s because you suck at marketing yourself. That\u2019s it. Any other excuse you give yourself is just BS, you suck at marketing yourself. \u201cNo one\u2019s coming to my business. No one\u2019s buying my products.\u201d There\u2019s only one problem, you suck at marketing your products. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s why nobody\u2019s coming to buy your thing. \u201cNo one\u2019s coming to my wrestling tournaments.\u201d Because you suck at marketing. \u201cNo athletes want to join our team. \u201c Because you suck at marketing.</p> <p>Every problem in life can be fixed with good marketing. I\u2019m convinced of it. I don\u2019t care what it is. You give me any problem, anything, it\u2019s because you suck at marketing. That\u2019s the issue. That\u2019s the overlying issue. I look at the problems I have in my life, even in the ones in my personal life. If I was to be completely honest and look back at myself and ask myself a question, my question was, \u201cRussell, why are you horrible at this aspect of your life?\u201d and if I was honest with myself it\u2019s because I sucked at marketing myself in that aspect of my life. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>So for you guys, who may not be wrestling coaches or people who care about that, but care about other aspects of your life? If you are not successful at anything that you want to be successful today, it\u2019s because you suck at marketing, and it\u2019s time to up your game and start becoming a student of marketing. Someone told me one time, \u201cRussell, you are so smart. That\u2019s how come you\u2019re a multimillionaire.\u201d And I was like, \u201cIt has nothing to do with being smarter.\u201d This guy was a doctor. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou are a million times smarter than me, infinity times smarter than me, maybe ten infinity times smarter than me. The only difference between me and you is I focus my time and energy on something that produces cash. Marketing. You focus the same amount of effort on how to become a doctor. Unfortunately while doctors get paid a lot, you don\u2019t get paid nearly as much as someone who focuses on marketing. It\u2019s just how the world works.\u201d So for those of you guys out there who want to solve any area of your life, business, relationships, everything, the most important thing you can do is up your game in marketing.</p> <p>It\u2019s time to become a student of it. It\u2019s not time to quit dabbling like, \u201cI read an e-book, I read the blogs\u2026\u201d It\u2019s time to become a student of marketing. If you come into my office, you will see ten walls wrapped in books from top to bottom, every marketing and sales book known to man. I\u2019ve upped my game. It\u2019s important to me. I love marketing and if you don\u2019t love marketing yet, it\u2019s time to step up your game and become a student of it and to become someone who loves it. If you love marketing, you love this game; it\u2019ll transform your life in all aspects. Business, financially, if you want to raise money for charity, whatever it is that you want to accomplish in life, all those problems, the issues, the headaches that you\u2019re struggling with will all be solved with good marketing.</p> <p>So that is my message and my rant for today. I\u2019m hoping that the wrestling team will see the light of day. A bunch of guys are going to talk to the administrators. My goal, what I hope happens, is that they clear house, let go of everyone, bring in a new team and allow people like me and a couple of other people who run successful businesses to come in and run this thing like a business. If we do that Boise State Wrestling will be saved and become an amazing program. And guess what? Our athletes will win. And they\u2019re not going to win by having better wrestling coaches. They\u2019re going to win because they have better marketing. That\u2019s how you get good recruits. You get good recruits with good marketing. You get people to show up to your matches because of good marketing. Everything comes around with marketing.</p> <p>I look at guys like Dan Gable the greatest wrestler in our sport. Not only was he one of the best athletes of all time, he\u2019s the best coach of all time. After he won the Olympics, he went and started at Iowa State became head coach of the Hawkeyes, won 23 national titles in a row. Something crazy like that, and if you go to an Iowa Hawkeye event, there\u2019s the entire auditorium is completely filled and you\u2019re like, \u201cMan, How did Dan Gable do that? He must have been a really good wrestler.\u201d Yes, he was but that\u2019s not how you fill events. You fill events by being good marketers. You become national champs by being good marketers and recruiting the best talent in the world to where you are at. I would say Dan Gable was probably the best wrestling coach in the world, and he was definitely the best wrestler marketer in the world.</p> <p>I was talking to a bunch of the guys and they talked about how a lot of schools will wrestle and they\u2019ll ride people, they\u2019ll turn them over and pin them. While that\u2019s good from a wrestling standpoint, it\u2019s not fun to watch. If they drilled them like\u2026..if we want to get fans to show up we have to have a wrestling style that\u2019s fun to watch. We need to dominate people; we need to push them over. If we\u2019re going to get people to show up, this is a show. This is show business; we gotta give them a good show. You give them a good show and people show up.</p> <p>So I did that, and they went from being this sport that nobody cares about, if you go to an Iowa Hawkeye event, you\u2019re looking at 30 or 40,000 fans going nuts, because they built it as a show because Dan Gable is a good marketer. That\u2019s it you guys. Good marketing solves all problems. Not some problems, solves all problems. That\u2019s how I really feel. So there you go, you guys. Rant over. I\u2019m heading into the office, get some stuff done. Go up my game with some more marketing. I gotta learn, I gotta educate and prepare. I gotta be good enough to accomplish my tasks. That\u2019s my plan for today; I hope it is for you as well. That\u2019s it you guys. Talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "20:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_216.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1459895411, "title": "Episode #215 \u2013 Batman Vs Superman Vs Funnel Hacks Live", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Here\u2019s a quick recap of what happened during this year\u2019s Funnel Hacking Live event!</p> <p>On this episode, Russell recaps the speakers and presentations from Funnel Hacking Live.

Hey everyone, it is the Tuesday after the live event and I survived. Congratulations, I\u2019m here to talk another day. No, I just wanted to kind of give you guys a quick recap of the event, because it turned out amazing. It was just so much fun.</p> <p>So the whole thing began with, I guess before it began it was me trying to get, my wife and I trying to get all of our kids to San Diego, which is a story in and of itself, but we got there. Then I\u2019ve got all this deep seeded fear. One time 7 or 8 years ago we did a big event in SLC and sold 500 tickets and when we got there, there was about 100 people that showed up, which is embarrassing to go from 500 seats to having hardly anyone sitting there and trying to pull seats out. It was horrible. Then fast forward a few years later, some of you guys may remember Rippln. The second Rippln event we\u2019re expecting 1200 people to be there, or something crazy like that. And when we showed up there was about 100 people in the hallway, so we spent 15 minutes pulling chairs out and shrinking this room down to about 20% of what it was, and it was the worst, most embarrassing, horrible feeling I\u2019ve ever felt. Showing up with 150 people in the room as opposed to the thousand you thought. So because of that I\u2019ve got all these deep seeded fears that nobody\u2019s going to show up to my events. Last year, same thing, I was freaking out, scared to death the whole time. When I walked in the room before I got introduced the first time and there was actually people in the room, I was like, \u201cThank heavens.\u201d</p> <p>But that fear peaked its horrible head once again this year and I was stressing out like crazy. We had pre-registrations from 2 til 9 the night before, so I assumed everybody would show up and pre-register, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s just me thinking that people are not like me. Because I probably wouldn\u2019t have pre-registered either, not going to lie.\u00a0 But I just assumed, so the night before I\u2019m going to bed and they\u2019re like, \u201cSo far, only 300 people pre-registered.\u201d I\u2019m like are you kidding me? Either nobody showed up or they\u2019re all planning to pre-register in the hour we have before the event. So I\u2019m totally once again, going to bed freaking out that night. Wake up in the morning scared to death. I get down there and luckily over 1100 people had showed up and we filled the room and it was amazing. So thank you guys for everyone who showed up. It was just such a cool show.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, you put so much time and energy and money and everything into these events and I think at first people think, oh this is for you. You\u2019re trying to make money or whatever, and obviously that\u2019s part of the plan, but that\u2019s never the number one goal. The number one goal is to put on a show that\u2019ll be not just something that\u2019s going to transform your business, but hopefully change your life.</p> <p>When I look at it, we\u2019ll get the final numbers back probably in a week or so, from our cost and profits and all those kind of things, but we spent over a half a million dollars to put on that show for the people that came.\u00a0 In between speaker fees, and hotel fees, and food and beverage, travel for our team, and everything. Looking at half a million dollars, 500,000 or more to entertain you guys for a couple of days.</p> <p>I was thinking about this, yesterday I took a day off and I was just kind of trying to relax and I really wanted to be entertained. I\u2019d been entertaining all weekend and I wanted to be entertained, so we went to see Batman VS Superman. Before, I\u2019m looking at it all and there\u2019s all the critics saying the movie sucked and all these things. And I went to the movie yesterday and it was amazing. On so many levels. The cinematography was awesome, the story lines were cool. You know, we all kind of hate Ben Affleck right now, because who on Earth does what he did to one of the most beautiful women on Earth, anyway, so we hate him so we\u2019re glad when Superman was kicking the crap out of him. There was some deep seeded anger and resentment against him, but as a whole the show was amazing. And I was thinking about how many tens of millions, probably hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to create that movie where they were there to entertain us for two and half hours. We spent $10 to go to it. We paid a little extra cause we got the D-box seats, the seats that shake when you\u2019re sitting there. It was amazing, it adds a whole other level of dimension to the experience. I\u2019m watching this thing, I spent between my wife and I maybe $35, $40 to watch this movie. I was like, people spent and risked hundreds of millions of dollars to entertain me for two hours and it cost me $40. It was amazing, and anyone who says it\u2019s not amazing is just a high maintenance piece of garbage, is kind of my thoughts.</p> <p>I feel the same way, if you came to the Funnel Hacking event and you didn\u2019t get value\u2026.I spent a half a million dollars to entertain you for 3 days to educate you and train you to hopefully change your life. You spent, between flights and hotels, maybe $1500 to come. For those of you who came and made that investment, I hope that what we provided back was amazing and I think it was. The feedback from this event was awesome. Tons of people talked about how last year was life transforming, this one was even more so. I had one person who came to me and said, there\u2019s been 5 times in his life where his life has been completely changed, he said this is one of the 5 times. One person came to me ahead of time and told me that they were suicidal before this weekend, they were planning on ending their life and after experiencing what we went through, they have a new look on life and they have a future and hope and everything once again.\u00a0 As I hugged that person who was crying, it was just amazing. It was awesome, it was worth the investment on our side.</p> <p>To put on the show, and you know this year we wanted to do a lot of things. One thing that I wanted to heavily skew and give everyone in their mind, even people who don\u2019t have information businesses to understand the power of information funnels. So most of my talks were tied around that, and I spent a lot of time just trying to convince and show external business owners who don\u2019t have info product businesses why info product funnels are so important and how you can use it to get customers for free, and you can change the paradigm. And you can make it so that the price resistance you might be feeling in your business is completely gone. I wanted people to understand that and we shared with them all of the core info product funnels. And I think that, hopefully for everyone, for me that was the gift I wanted to share with everybody and I hope that everybody loved that.</p> <p>On top of that I brought in some amazing people. Alex Charfen, he came and I always pronounce his last name wrong, so I\u2019m trying to get it, but I apologize Alex, if you\u2019re listening. But he came and talked about the entrepreneur personality type. Afterwards I had so many people like, \u201cI understand myself now, I don\u2019t feel alone, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a weird person.\u201d Which was really cool. So many amazing speakers. Sean Stephenson came, spent the first 20 minutes just making fun of me, which was awesome. Then delivered something that, I don\u2019t think there was a dry eye in the audience. It was amazing. One of my favorite things he talked about there, he talked about the helicopters that go out in the ocean and try to save boats that capsized. You go out there and the helicopter can only hold 5 or 6 people and there might be 20 people that are in the water. Who do you decide, who are you going to save. It\u2019s a good question talking about us with our business. There\u2019s all these people we want to serve, and give and help and save. Who do we save? He talked the helicopters, said that when they get out there, the only people that are able to save are the people that are swimming towards them and how profound that was to think about for us. We can try to change the world, but you can only really affect the people that are swimming towards you. The people that hear your voice, the people that hear your message, and they come towards you and if you focus on them first and you help them so other people will see that and be like, \u201cThey\u2019re helping people that swim towards the boat, we should swim towards it too.\u201d And more people will come towards you, but initially when you\u2019re focusing your message is focus on the people that are swimming towards you first. I thought that was really profound. His talk was amazing.</p> <p>Kyle Cease who\u2019s a comedian but also just life transformation, he came to his comedy show it was all about transformation as well, it was so cool. Just so cool, I totally geeked out on all that stuff. We had my Clickfunnels partners and founders and everyone get on stage and we talked about the future of Clickfunnles from the tech side and all that\u2019s happening. We kind of bragged about our tech team for the first time ever. A lot of people don\u2019t know, the tech team who\u2019s building Clickfunnels right now, they\u2019re a bunch of what Ryan, our CTO said, he said that they\u2019re like the Russell Brunson\u2019s of the tech world, of the programmer world. In fact, one of them was gone this weekend and speaking at this machine learning conference, he literally wrote the book on Machine Learning and he\u2019s one of the dude\u2019s who\u2019s doing all the backend, database structuring and data and stats for Clickfunnels. If you look at people after people, it\u2019s like a who\u2019s who of the coding world, who are develops are, which is pretty amazing if you think about it.</p> <p>He talked about why would they come to us versus the other companies, most of these guys are sick of working for VC backed companies that don\u2019t really care about the customers, they\u2019re loving working for a company where they get to see a difference, and when they make something it changes people\u2019s lives and it\u2019s pretty awesome. So that was really cool.</p> <p>Who else, I know I\u2019m missing some other stuff that happened. Let\u2019s see, the first day, man there\u2019s so many cool things, I don\u2019t want to miss any. The second day we did a big hug hack-a-thon which was awesome. We had I think 7 or 800 people that actually stayed and pulled all-nighters with our team building out pages and funnels and sites. Which was cool. Bill Jones ran the whole hack-a-thon. We had a charity thing, ended up raising, over the last 12 months we donated over $45,000 for World Teacher Aide. During this weekend we raised another $45,000 which was awesome. $90,000 in the last year has been given to World Teacher Aide because of Clickfunnels members, which is sweet. So that was cool.</p> <p>Let\u2019s see then we had day 3 we came on with Garrett White, came and shared his message. Oh, on day two, I forgot, I did a presentation about becoming a Funnel Consultant, we had a lot of people who applied for our Funnel Certified Clickfunnels Consultant Program, which was cool. So we\u2019ve got a lot of new people coming in there. We had a guy named Alex, who is one of my inner circle members, he came and showed how he does local funnels. How they\u2019re blowing up gyms. They\u2019ll have a gym and they have two different funnels they run, they just run traffic for a week and after two weeks they\u2019ll completely film an entire gym before it\u2019s launched, take that money to go buy the actual gym equipment, they launch the gym with $50,000 in their pocket along with 150 clients from day one, which is nuts. So that was awesome.</p> <p>Day 3 Garrett White came and spoke about finding your voice and showed progression that he went from, from being who he was to finding his voice and his message. He kind of talked about that whole process, which was really cool. After that I did my funnel stacking presentation, which I was excited for and I think it turned out pretty cool. And then Jacob Hiller came and told this story about the jumpman, which is a info product that teaches people how to jump, which was amazing. And then the last part, which was the coolest for me, was Marcus Lemonis from the Profit, came and spoke.</p> <p>It was so cool. He was so cool. I can\u2019t even tell you how cool that dude was. We were expecting him to be high maintenance, like a real celebrity. He showed up, he Ubered from the airport over and kind of hung out and everything.\u00a0 Before the event, we had a chance for 30 minutes to kind of talk about he event and everything, he asked what Clickfunnels was and we explained it. He was getting so excited. First it took him about 5 minutes to get it, then when he got it he was like, \u201cWait a minute, how do you use this for camping?\u201d we told him, \u201cHow do you use this for sweet peas\u201c we told him, \u201cHow do you use this for\u2026..\u201d business after business. Finally he\u2019s like, \u201cIs there any business that Clickfunnels won\u2019t work for?\u201d and we\u2019re like, \u201cNot really. It\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d So he\u2019s like, \u201cWe need to get you guys on the show. You guys need to be on the Profit. I\u2019ve got a whole bunch of people with shows coming up. I\u2019m going to figure out a bunch of these ones and you guys can come and build these funnels on the show.\u201d He\u2019s awesome. So then we\u2019re like, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take you in the back, w have a secret elevator, bring you up that way nobody will bug you and you can come out the back of the stage.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNah, it\u2019s Saturday, we\u2019re just hanging out. I\u2019ll just come in and\u00a0 hang out and take pictures with everyone if that\u2019s cool.\u201d I\u2019m like alright, so he just came in the back, hung out with everybody, got pictures, and he came up and did his presentation and it was cool. It was way different than I thought it was going to be. It was more like a Tony Robbins event. \u00a0He sat there and did interventions with people only he was fixing people on the fly. Super cool.</p> <p>And then I had another presentation I was going to give, but I felt like it would have detracted from the message that Marcus kind of left, so instead we just ended the event, Ignite Inner Circle people went and got pictures with Marcus, I went and got pictures with everybody else. And that was a wrap, that was the event. Man, it was cool.\u00a0 So for those of you guys, who were there, I hope you had an amazing opportunity. I hope you took advantage of it. Oh Liz Benney spoke on day one and Ryan Stewman spoke on day one. Sorry, how did I forget those guys? Which was amazing, Liz told her whole story. She had the whole audience in tears, inspired and motivated. She shared all her stats, her numbers, her webinar, which was awesome. Ryan showed his backend funnels, how they work. The coolest part, at the end he had people line up for free copies of his book, he said, \u201cYou can have any objection and I\u2019ll solve it right here on the spot.\u201d And he resolved objection after objection after objection. That was dang cool.</p> <p>So anyway, as a whole was an amazing experience for me, hopefully for every one of you guys who were there, and I hope that the small amount of money you put was worth the investment. Like I said, we spent over a half million dollars to entertain, educate, train and inspire you guys and I hope you got all that and a whole bunch more out of it. We\u2019re excited for next year. Next year Funnel Hacking Live will be in February, which will be cool because it\u2019s going to be the last week of February in Dallas. My goal, and this isn\u2019t happening yet, my goal, I\u2019m putting it out there right now, I want to get Mark Cubin, and I want to get Tony Robbins this next one. Otherwise, we can\u2019t make it better than this years, this years was pretty dang cool. If we wanted to step it up, that\u2019s the only thing we got to do it with. So that\u2019s my goal and game plan, but no promises yet, but that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re shooting for. We will see.</p> <p>Anyway, with that said, I\u2019m at the office. I took yesterday off to just lay out, hang out. Today I\u2019m going to be using as a planning day, I\u2019ve got a lot of stuff and projects and cool things happening, so I\u2019m going to try to plan it, organize and just figure out the next steps. I hope you guys are as well, especially those who came to the event. Because now you have this reflection moment, \u201cOkay, what am I going to do? All these things have happened. What should I do?\u201d I remember listening to Tim Ferriss at an event one time talk about himself, and somebody asked, \u201cwhat are you\u2026if we were to follow you around for a day, what would we see?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019d be pretty boring, most the time I\u2019m just sitting there thinking, and reading and meditating. It doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m doing much because for me, it\u2019s all about\u2026I don\u2019t want to spend a week, a month, a year, whatever it takes, trying to figure out of all the dominoes all the dues, all the things out there instead of trying to knock over every single domino like most people do, I try to sit and figure out what\u2019s the one big domino that if I push that one over it knocks down all the rest of the dominoes or makes the rest of them irrelevant. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p> <p>So today is going to be like my big domino day. I\u2019m going to sit back and try to figure out what the big domino is I need to knock over that will make all the rest irrelevant or knock over the rest of the dominoes.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my game plan for today, I hope you do the same thing as well. With that said, Have an amazing day. If you haven\u2019t watched Batman VS Superman yet, go and watch it and don\u2019t complain. These guys spent hundreds of millions of dollars and it\u2019s going to cost you $10. With that said, I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon. Thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "17:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_215.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1459289908, "title": "Episode #214 \u2013 My Entrepreneurial ADD Comes Flooding Back In", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What happens the second the pressure is lifted.</p> <p>On this episode,Russell talks about getting the finishing touches done for his presentations for Funnel Hacking Live.

This is Russell and welcome to another edition of Marketing In Your Car. Hey everybody, hope that things are amazing today, I\u2019m just backing out. Today I\u2019m driving the Corvette because last night I was driving home and I got a flat tire in my brand new tires, which is kind of frustrating. I don\u2019t even know how to get it from my garage now to go get new tires but I\u2019ll figure it out another day. Today we\u2019re going to the office to go finalize everything for the event. Tomorrow morning we all fly out. Some of our team\u2019s already down there and I\u2019m going to be heading out in the morning, I was there last night until about 2 am working on presentations and I\u2019m feeling good. I finally got the main presentation done and designed and figured out.</p> <p>Why do I call it the main presentation? Well, some of you guys may know that one of the reasons why everybody does events is to hopefully make some money at them. We make some money out of ticket sales but most goes back to speakers and advertising and promotions and all those things. So our event is really kind of twofold. One is to bring the community together to get everyone talking, funneling and getting more excited about Clickfunnels and having a great party. Number two is we want to make some money from it. I think everyone would be disappointed if I didn\u2019t. I would not be practicing what I preach, I would not be congruent there for, I promise those who are at funnel Hacking Live, I will try to sell you something, and that\u2019s what I was working on last night. Now our sales pitch is the same this year as it was last year. We try to have the event a million percent content and just one percent pitch, so we are offering our certification program again. So that\u2019s what I was working on last night, the presentation for the certification program.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve had a lot of fear wrapped in this because we\u2019ve dramatically increased the price of certification. So because of that I\u2019ve been nervous on how to present it and how to pitch it. Got some good advice from one of my friends and one of the inner circle members, Darin Stevens, and based on that, did something new so I\u2019m excited. I\u2019ve never sold this way before, but hopefully it will work out good for me and for you and for everyone that\u2019s there.\u00a0 I\u2019m excited, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been working on late til last night, which was fun.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve been stressed trying to get all these presentations done. I think I have 7, I believe. And now they\u2019re all done, and I\u2019m going in today just to clean up all the slides and make sure when I click slide to slide the right thing pops up at the right time. Make sure that logically, it all makes sense. So today will be kind of an easier day. So the hard work got done last night at 2 am, because that\u2019s the hard part for me. Getting all these ideas and concepts out on slides and then now it\u2019s just cleaning them up.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because, this is the whole burnout thing we talked about last week, but now that the bigger barrier is out of the way. In fact, this is the first time I\u2019ve gone to an event that my slides are done before I get there, ever, in the history of Russell Brunson.\u00a0 So I\u2019m kind of excited about that. It\u2019s funny because now that that pressure of this big task that I\u2019ve been avoiding is done, all day today all I can think about is new cool stuff I want to do. It\u2019s the A.D.D. entrepreneur right. I should be thinking let\u2019s take a break, but no, instead I\u2019m thinking, okay so I\u2019ve got some cool ideas. First off, during this whole researching phase, I\u2019ve been going through and getting a bunch of stuff, I looked at a lot of Gary Vaynerchuk stuff just because he\u2019s been really intriguing to me a lot lately. Watching the Gary V. Show, watching how he presents himself, watching these other little videos he does. And I got a cool idea for a type of video I want to start creating. You know how, I\u2019ll turn on a couple clips at the event, but Gary\u2019s got this short 30 second to 1 minute videos that he talks about one topic. They\u2019re really powerful and awesome and they\u2019re the kind of thing that you share because you get this one nugget and it feels awesome. So I kind of want to do that, but obviously I don\u2019t want to copy Gary, I want to figure out my own model and method to make it cool.</p> <p>And I was thinking, we\u2019ve got all these cool hand doodle sketches. Tons are in the DotcomSecrets book and tons that are in the new Expert Secrets, and tons that have been in presentations that will never see it in print. I thought won\u2019t it be fun to do a show where each show we focus on one of those little printouts and I talk about it? Anyway, I thought that\u2019d be fun. So I was like, that\u2019d be really cool.</p> <p>And the other thing I was thinking about, some of you guys may have seen our tv show we launched back in the day called funnelhacker.tv, I only did two episodes then I never did any more. And it was probably because the whole setup to create one of those, there was a lot of stuff that went into that. So it wasn\u2019t just bust out a video each week, or bust out a podcast while driving type of thing.</p> <p>Oh man I hate cops when I\u2019m on my phone. I\u2019ll drive by and hopefully he doesn\u2019t flip around. Okay, I think we\u2019re safe you guys. Otherwise, I\u2019ll introduce you to one of the nice Boise policeman here in a minute.</p> <p>Anyway, where was I? Sorry I got A.D.D. you guys, I\u2019m off track. Anyway, funnelhacker.tv I did two episodes and we just never did any more. I was thinking, it was a cool concept, people liked it, but it wasn\u2019t done right. It wasn\u2019t done in a way that\u2019s easy to follow through. So what if I changed that and made that show where it\u2019s like, all of you guys go funnel hack people and then record it and send it to me and I can make a video, you have guest episodes on, it\u2019d be kind of cool. And the other thing I was thinking, and maybe this is, I don\u2019t know, I got to talk myself out of this but it gets me excited. One of the big things that I like doing, obviously, is building funnels. You know, back a few years ago we launched a whole bunch of businesses and I was trying to make a bunch of money and those kinds of things and it was okay. Some of the businesses took off, like Neuracel and a couple other ones, but other one\u2019s just flopped because we stretched ourselves too thin. So part of me doesn\u2019t want to do this, part of me thinks it will be really cool to have this be part of funnelhacker.tv or maybe Funnel University or something. But wouldn\u2019t it be fun to go and create some sales funnels in different markets? Allow you guys to see what I\u2019m doing and why I\u2019m doing it, behind the scenes.\u00a0 How we write the script, how we produce the video, how we get the formula up, where we get the traffic and just show the whole thing and do a funnel maybe, in the weight loss base. And a network marketing funnel and then maybe, I don\u2019t know, pick 3 or 4 different funnels and just show the process behind the scenes. And show dates on funnelhacker.tv so you can kind of see it, but then\u2026I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just a thought.</p> <p>There\u2019s some dude that\u2019s riding my butt. Should I tell you guys his license number in case something bad happens? He\u2019s riding me really tight, I\u2019m not sure why.</p> <p>So that was just an idea. Would it be cool to pick 3 or 4 markets and start slowly, not aggressive, but slowly building out funnels and building out the pieces and just letting you guys, let everybody see behind the scenes of what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it. I feel like I\u2019ve never been a real C.E.O. before so I\u2019m like, what\u2019s the role of the CEO. So CEO of Clickfunnels, what\u2019s my job? It\u2019s supposed to be to inspire people and to internally run the organization and things like that, but I feel like almost, the way I view it is my goal as CEO of this software company, whose just trying to teach people to use Clickfunnels, is to create amazing funnels that you guys can look at and you can model and you can funnel hack.</p> <p>I think a big part of the reason why we\u2019ve had success up to this point is that we\u2019ve showed off, here\u2019s our sales funnels, look at the Dotcom Secrets Labs book, the Split Testing book, look at the Dotcom Secrets book, you look at coming out, we\u2019ve got the Funnel Stacking book, we\u2019ve got the Expert Secrets book. We\u2019ve got a lot of videos and training, the funnel hacking webinar, all these things, what I\u2019ve been doing is basically showing behind the scenes of what we\u2019ve done.</p> <p>Obviously as we\u2019ve launched Clickfunnels, I\u2019ve done less of other businesses funnels. You know a lot of those things, no one gets to see. I feel like doing a little bit more of those kinds of things, you guys get to see them and reverse engineer them and do some of those things is a good idea. That\u2019s a big reason why we\u2019re launching Funnel University because I think more people should be doing continuity programs. There was a time that all we talked about online was membership sites and continuity programs. I remember in one year we came, or Ryan Deiss came out with Continuity Blueprint, we came out with Micro-continuity, Ryan Lee had a continuity program, or his membership site program. We weren\u2019t the only ones, there was probably ten other people. It was the year of continuity, everyone talked about it, it was amazing. And then it went away, nobody really talks about it anymore. So we want to launch Funnel University, give people a model for how to do their continuity program.</p> <p>People always come to our Facebook group and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m looking for a real estate funnel I can hack.:\u201d Or whatever it is. Looking for continuity funnel, looking for a webinar\u2026so I feel like one of my roles, or jobs, responsibilities should be to create really cool funnels that work, that people can see that they can funnel hack and they can model. So obviously, we\u2019re doing that inside the Clickfunnels world. You guys will see some really cool funnels coming out after the event. I was thinking it would be fun to do it outside, so you guys can see it as well. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m thinking about it. It\u2019s just a whole other project, so it\u2019s not going to happen soon, but if it did happen I gotta figure out a way to work that\u2019s simple easy thing that\u2019s easy to be consistent with.</p> <p>Anyway, just some thoughts. It\u2019s mostly me, because I\u2019ve got some pressure taken off my mind. All the sudden I have a thousand new ideas and cool ways to serve flooding back in. This is probably not the best thing a lot of times. Anyway, I just wanted to share with you mostly to get it out of my head. Hopefully it gives you guys a couple ideas of cool stuff you could do and kind of look at what you\u2019re role and responsibilities to your organization, to your community. IT may or may not happen, so don\u2019t see me in 3 months like, \u201cRussell, you promised me this thing.\u201d Because it may never happen. It might\u2019ve been a bad idea, that I thought would be fun to talk about. My goal really with Clickfunnels company, if you look at the event and post event, we\u2019re rolling out really cool front end marketing systems that\u2019ll take some of the pressure off of me doing all this stuff, and then give more affiliates ability to do a lot of cool things and that way I can start creating more cool things like that for affiliates and for front end funnels to get people in.</p> <p>Anywho, I don\u2019t know if that made sense, it makes sense in my head. Sorry Because I just don\u2019t have the whole picture. I apologize. Anyway, you\u2019ll see a bunch of cool stuff coming out over the next few months and maybe we\u2019ll start showing off some more niche funnels if it makes sense.</p> <p>Anywho, that\u2019s the plan you guys. I am in the office. I\u2019m at the office now, I\u2019m going to go in and clean up my slides. I\u2019m going to be cleaning up the affiliate center and then we are out of here, we are jumping on a plane. Taking my whole family, all my kids, I want them to meet Sean Stephenson and kind of see a thousand people in the room with their dad on stage. I think it\u2019ll be kind of fun for them to see. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening then they\u2019re going to go to the zoo or something, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the game plan. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, I will try to podcast you guys from on the road. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll happen though, so if not, I\u2019ll talk to you guys next week when we get back. I\u2019ll \u00a0report back on the event, what happened, all that kind of stuff.

Hey everybody, it\u2019s a beautiful day, the sun is shining, it\u2019s awesome outside, I\u2019m heading in, I\u2019ve got two days to work my last presentation before we jump on a plane and fly out to Funnel Hacking Live to hang out with most of you guys, which is going to be awesome. I\u2019m feeling really good. Last week there was some stress, some burnout, some ups and downs and all sorts of craziness, but I wanted you to know that I feel great today and I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>I came in on Saturday, and I think we talked about that, but I put in some hours getting the printouts done, so we can print out and hand out some stuff that turned out amazing. It ended up being 300 slides, so we fit 3 slides per page, so 100 page printouts for every single one of you guys who are coming, full of all of the amazing, cool stuff we\u2019ll be talking about and it\u2019s going to be good. I am really looking forward to the next few days of getting stuff done and then coming down and hanging out with a bunch of you guys.</p> <p>So what I wanted to talk about today, and this is something I talked about a little while ago, but it\u2019s been on my mind and I just did 3 voxes with people in our inner circle all about this same concept, so I wanted to share with you guys as well because I think it\u2019s important. So if you look back, there was a podcast that I did a little while ago called Urgency and Scarcity, it was probably 2 or 3 months ago. If you go to marketinginyourcar.com, you can scroll the titles, you can see the once that says Urgency and Scarcity, but I just want to talk about, reiterate what I said there, because in case you guys missed it, that was a huge deal.\u00a0 So I figured out something, only thing that gets people to buy, it\u2019s not the only thing, but the main thing, is there urgency and scarcity? It is completely ridiculous.</p> <p>One big thing is this event. So we\u2019ve been promoting this event for 8 months, something crazy like that. And we could not get people for the life of me to buy at first. I was like, \u201cGreat lets cancel the event, no one\u2019s buying, it\u2019s totally stressing me out.\u201d And we\u2019re trying to get people to sign up and trying all sorts of stuff. We were calling them on the phone, 4 months from the event. They\u2019re like, \u201c4 months away, I haven\u2019t event thought about this week, let alone 4 months away.\u201d It was like pulling teeth to get people to sign up. So toward the end we get to like, 6 weeks out, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWe got like 500 more seats we got to fill or else I\u2019ll look like an idiot when no one shows up at the event.\u201d Then I thought you know what we should do. We got urgency and scarcity, that\u2019s what we got, those are our secret weapons. How do you cause urgency and scarcity without selling out? I don\u2019t want to be like, tickets are sold out when we only sold 50. I didn\u2019t want to be like, we\u2019re selling tickets out this week, and then not sell them out. It\u2019s this whole chicken and the egg thing.</p> <p>So I was thinking if we did urgency and scarcity and say tickets are selling out this week, we could probably sell a bunch, but what if we don\u2019t sell out, how are we going to sell the other 399 tickets or whatever it is. So we thought, let\u2019s add urgency and scarcity to pieces of the offer. So we did a big push, some of you guys probably saw this, where we were giving away the recordings from last year\u2019s event. So that was the first thing of urgency and scarcity. \u201cHey this week Sunday at midnight we\u2019re pulling away the recordings of last year\u2019s event. You can still get tickets in the future, but you lose the recordings.\u201d So that was the first big push and we started talking about that. Guess what happened when we added a little bit of urgency and scarcity to pieces of the offer? People went nuts. That week we signed up 150 or maybe even more, I don\u2019t know. More than 150, less than 200 somewhere in that range people signed up because we had this urgency and scarcity tied to one feature of the offer. So Sunday at midnight we pulled that off the sales page. I was too lazy and it would have been a huge pain in my butt to actually go and pull it away from people who were buying, so if you bought it afterwards, you still got the recordings from last year\u2019s event, don\u2019t tell anybody. But it was off the sales letter, so no longer was it part of the offer, so you lost that part of the offer. But man, pulling that thing away gave us 150 ticket sales, which at $600 a piece, that\u2019s almost 100 grand, my math\u2019s probably way off, but somewhere like that. So then that ended, so ticket sales stopped again.</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cYou guys keep buying, we gotta sale this event now.\u201d So I was like, \u201cThat worked last time, so how do apply urgency and scarcity to another piece of this.\u201d So we applied urgency and scarcity to a price point. So we said, \u201cWe have 2 for 1 tickets. This is going to disappear.\u201d So we pushed urgency and scarcity the next week on that, and guess what happened? We sold a whole bunch more tickets. And then when that ended tickets sales dropped to nothing again. I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p> <p>Urgency and scarcity kept bringing it back, bringing it back until we actually sold out. And then the coolest thing about selling out an event, is after you sell out, that\u2019s when people start buying tickets, because they\u2019re like, \u201cWait, you sold out. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve been telling you every day for 8 months. Seriously? I\u2019m going to strangle you.\u201d So anyway, ticket sales were flying in like crazy when we were sold out. People are freaking out and paying more and trying to get in, and it\u2019s been awesome. So selling out an event is almost the best way. We sold out our event when we passed 1,000 tickets sold, which is how many currently fit in the room, but if we shift seats around, we can actually get more than that, so we got some extra seats, so we\u2019ve been selling on the back. People call, we charge more because they freaking waited forever and stressed me out, so they must pay for stressing me out.</p> <p>So there\u2019s lesson one of urgency and scarcity. Here\u2019s another example. We were doing the Funnel Scripts Webinar, did the webinar, sold a ton on the webinar. I think we had a 40, I can\u2019t remember the numbers, something crazy like 45% close rate on the webinar, so did well over 6 figures live on the webinar. Then the next day replays and stuff continued to sell well. It was 60 grand day two. Then 40 grand and then you know sales kept coming really consistently, really well. And so part of me is like, let\u2019s just leave it on. And then I\u2019m like, you know what we can\u2019t just leave it up because then it\u2019ll just trickle out. We need to do some urgency and scarcity. So we decided to have a cutoff date. So Sunday at midnight we cut it off. I like Sunday at midnight cut off things. Probably because I queue up the emails on Saturday before I go to bed and Monday morning I come in and look at the sales, and I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Sunday, it\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>We add urgency and scarcity and we did as much sales on the last day as we did the first day.</p> <p>It\u2019s crazy right? So I started thinking, if urgency and scarcity is the secret to buying stuff, I\u2019m going to start applying this everywhere. If you look at what I\u2019m currently doing, this is my big secret for you guys, I hope you take advantage of it. So I used to have people opt-in, they\u2019d opt-in to a list, then I would promote an offer, then I\u2019d transition into a secondary offer and I\u2019d be leaving content in and out and that\u2019s how I looked at things. So instead I thought, okay if somebody opts-in to a squeeze page, there\u2019s one core offer, one core thing that I\u2019m trying to sell. So when they enter that squeeze page, they entered that gateway and came into my world, I now have a window where I\u2019m doing little mini product launch. And the goal of this product launch is 2 or 3 fold; I\u2019m trying to build the relationship with attractive characters, I\u2019m still doing a soap opera sequence to build the relationship, but I\u2019m doing that and pushing them towards buying a product and in that sequence, I\u2019m applying urgency and scarcity. so basically what I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m sending out ten emails for 7 days when someone joins my list. You guys are thinking, Russell that\u2019s crazy. But it\u2019s not. Trust me.</p> <p>So the first set of emails are all building relationships, pushing people to the offer, making a really good offer, and if I\u2019m making good offers, I\u2019m not saying, \u201cHey, here\u2019s my product go buy it.\u201d For example, somebody buys any of my offers now, let\u2019s say you buy the Perfect Webinar Script, there\u2019s this little mini product launch sequence that\u2019s happening over seven days, ten emails, that is getting you to sign up for the Clickfunnels trial, and I\u2019m not saying, \u201cGo get the Clickfunnels trial. Hey, go get the Clickfunnels trial. Hey you should go get a free trial.\u201d everyday, right. I\u2019m making this mini product launch. I\u2019m saying, \u201cLook, you just bought Perfect Webinar Secrets so you know webinars are important, Clickfunnels is the tool we use, so for any of you guys who go and get the free Clickfunnels trial today, I have a\u00a0 really special offer. I\u2019m going to give you this bonus, where you\u2019re going to get this\u2026\u201d and I give them this crazy bonus worth, I don\u2019t know $500 or $600 if they go and get the free trial from Clickfunnels. You guys see what I\u2019m saying?</p> <p>So imagine you\u2019re doing an affiliate launch and I\u2019m trying to get you to buy someone else product and competing against a thousand other affiliates I\u2019m going to create a really good special offer for you to go buy this thing. This same thing I\u2019m doing now and this autoresponder sequence, here\u2019s the product over here, for me it\u2019s Clickfunnels. I\u2019m not just saying, \u201cGo buy Clickfunnels.\u201d I\u2019m saying, \u201cWhen you buy Clickfunnels today this is the bonus you\u2019re going to get. I\u2019m going to give you this two hour training I did here, you\u2019re going to get this script right here, you\u2019re going to get this shared funnel here, you\u2019re going to get boom, boom, boom. Here\u2019s 5 or 6 things you\u2019re going to get that are amazing and can\u2019t get anywhere else, you get today.\u201d</p> <p>Now the cool thing, by making that special bonus offer, what I am able to do is now I can have urgency and scarcity, so that you opt-in.</p> <p>Build a relationship email one. Email two, I\u2019m talking about this offer, here\u2019s a special offer I make, here\u2019s bonuses, bonuses, bonuses. Now because I\u2019m not saying here\u2019s a site to go buy a thing, now I\u2019ve got these bonuses and now I can apply my two magic gifts. Urgency and Scarcity.</p> <p>So check this out, the last two days it says, \u201cHey guys, you got 48 hours left to get the Clickfunnels free trial and then this free offer with special bonuses disappears.\u201d Boom, urgency and scarcity. Next day, \u201cTwenty four hours left before you lose out on this bonus, you\u2019re going to lose out on this, this, and this.\u201d Boom \u201cTwelve hours left, you\u2019re going to miss out on this, this, and this.\u201d \u201cThree hours left, you can still get Clickfunnels tomorrow, that\u2019s cool and you should, but if you don\u2019t get it in the next 3 hours you lose out on all these bonuses.\u201d Now I can apply urgency and scarcity to the product I\u2019m trying to pitch. And the thing about actually shutting it down or those annoying things we have to do as marketers, and guess what happens? People take action, people buy, people ascend. A whole bunch of amazingness happens.</p> <p>So the moral of today\u2019s story, is start thinking about that. When somebody opts-in to your list, don\u2019t just promote the next product in your queue. Use this as a mini launch sequence. Pretending like you\u2019re a super affiliate, making an amazing bonus offer they have to buy. Buy or die. And apply urgency and scarcity. This can work for anything by the way, you guys. Think about your affiliate, maybe you don\u2019t have a product yet, go to Clickbank, go somewhere, find an amazing affiliate offer, create a squeeze page from that affiliate offer and have a seven day, ten email sequence. It pushes really hard urgency and scarcity, where you\u2019re delivering some bonuses and things like that, and test it out. I guarantee you\u2019ll make at least 3 times, and probably a heck of a lot more than that, but at least 3 times as much money than you do right now, however you\u2019re promoting your affiliate offers.</p> <p>If your own products you\u2019re selling. I bet you\u2019ll make 3x of how much you make in every single campaign. Because urgency and scarcity my friends, is the secret. That is the big aha I\u2019ve had over the last few days. So hopefully this little nugget will benefit you guys. It\u2019s amazing, try it and test it out. Let me know how it goes. And I promise you, you will make a crap ton of money. That\u2019s what I got you guys. I\u2019m out, have an amazing day and I will see you guys at Funnel Hacking Live.

Alright I had to start that one out a little bit louder than normal because it\u2019s a beautiful day and things are amazing. It\u2019s Saturday before our live event, I am actually heading to the office really quick to go finish out some slides, so we can send it to the printer, so that the printers can print them and ship them to the event and I\u2019m excited because that means that, what\u2019s that 6 of my 7 presentations is finished, no technically 5. I think 5 of my 7 presentations are finished, the other one\u2019s just not going to print. This is my deadline, today is my deadline, so I\u2019m hurrying to go get this out the door, so they will be in everyone\u2019s binders when they show up, which is gonna be cool.</p> <p>And the last thing I\u2019m waiting on, and this is what I wanted to talk about today with you guys because all of us in our businesses are educators. You\u2019re educating your employees, your team, your customers or whatever, even if you\u2019re not in an info product type business you still are an educator and a motivator and a leader and all these kind of things.</p> <p>I think one of the biggest things that\u2019s helped me over the last few years, and it didn\u2019t happen on purpose, but I\u2019ve been trying to teach a whole bunch of really cool, kind of complex topics for years. The way that was easiest for me to explain is to get someone in a seminar room and we have a white board and I would show them this process and they\u2019d see the process and be like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying.\u201d And I\u2019m sure\u00a0 a lot of you guys are the same way, which is why most of us internet entrepreneurs are obsessed with whiteboards. We have white boards in our office, we\u2019re sketching things out, we\u2019re showing it to our team that way, we\u2019re doing all sorts of stuff.\u00a0 All of my training videos for years were done on Microsoft paint where I\u2019d just open paint and I\u2019d sketch things because it gets people to understand complex things better.</p> <p>So rewind probably 2 \u00bd maybe 3 years ago, when we first started to put together the Dotcom Secrets book, initially it didn\u2019t have all those cool sketches, it was just a typical book. As I was writing the book what I found was, it was interesting, when I teach a seminar I\u2019m on stage, I can sketch out a concept and people are like, \u201cOh that makes sense.\u201d In a book you have words and you\u2019re trying to explain these concepts and it\u2019s harder because they can\u2019t hear tonality, they can\u2019t see your hand expressions, they don\u2019t see sketches, and it really just makes things suffer. So I was trying to figure out, how can I replicate that process? That\u2019s kind of where some of these sketches were born. One of my close friends, Daegan Smith he probably a year prior had taught this really cool thing on story selling and he had kind of doodled out this whole concept on a whiteboard and he showed it to me and it was awesome. So as a gift to him I had this guy named Vlad on my team go through and turn it to a nice image and I sent it back, \u201cHere you go, man.\u201d And he was like, \u201cWhoa this is so cool. It makes this concept I made look real.\u201d I remember looking at Daegan\u2019s thing that I\u2019d sent him back, and I was like, \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d</p> <p>So I started going back through all my doodles and all the whiteboard sketches and all these things in seminars and workshops, and just for my team and things as I\u2019m doodling out concepts trying to grasp them better, and I went back through and had Vlad take all those concepts and turn them into really cool drawings. And that kind of became the foundation for the Dotcom Secrets book. Every one of these chapters have at least one if not a couple of different doodles so that it\u2019s not just words. Words are hard to visualize and I wanted to take, here\u2019s a bunch of words, but then here\u2019s the graphic representation of what we\u2019re trying to illustrate, and we did that and then boom all the sudden there it is.</p> <p>So that became how the book was done and I think it was one of the big reasons why people were so successful with it, not just from, \u201coh this is good book.\u201d But \u201cWow, this is a book I can actually do something with.\u201d So since that book came out, a lot of other teaching things we do, I\u2019ve had Vlad come in and sketch things out for me and it\u2019s been really cool. So what\u2019s been fun, as you guys know I\u2019ve been working on the Expert Secrets book, so I\u2019ve been having him kind of sketch these concepts the same way we did before and it\u2019s been kind of a slower process. Each chapter I do it and from that chapter there\u2019s two or three concepts we need to sketch out so we can understand it visually.</p> <p>And that\u2019s been really cool, but since this events coming up it\u2019s kind of cranked up. Because as you know the presentations I\u2019m giving at the event are very tied in line with what I\u2019m teaching in the book. So a lot of them I had to get done quick. So yesterday I submitted 17 or 19, a lot, I think it was 17. 17 sketches to Vlad, I needed him to turn into amazing sketches for my slides, and I took my little chicken scratch that I do, basically I sketch it out on a pad of paper, take a picture of it, upload it to Trello, our office management software, and Vlad grabs it from Trello and makes it look awesome. So I have this book where I\u2019m just sketching idea after idea and concept after concept and trying to get them all in really nice format and add them to Trello and then he goes through and sketches them all, so this morning at 7:57 I was going to work out at 8, 3 minutes earlier, and then all the sudden I look at Trello there\u2019s nothing in there, and one second later he drops 17 images. And it was so cool. All these concepts that are just beautiful now. They look amazing and they\u2019re done and they\u2026\u2026I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>What I\u2019ve done is the last couple of days, I finished my presentations and I just copied and pasted pictures of my hand chicken scratches into these presentations, waiting to replace them with Vlad\u2019s amazing designs and today right now I\u2019m driving to the office to go drag and drop all these designs into slides so that everybody during the presentations will see these things and be like, \u201cOh my gosh this is amazing.\u201d And they\u2019ll understand really complex topics and make them really simple and broken down. And then these images will be the same one\u2019s that are in the Dotcom Secrets book in the very near future. So I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>I told you that story because it\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about right now, but second off, I want you guys to start thinking about that as educators, as leaders, as trainers. Sometimes we try to get up and try to share things with people, try to get them to be motivated and inspired, but I think a big problem is that words either vocal or written, a lot of times it\u2019s hard to\u2026.typically there\u2019s a process behind the words and words are very much like you\u2019re moving from left to right, up to down, where a lot of times concepts aren\u2019t that way. There\u2019s a motion happening. There\u2019s forward to backward, and backward to forward, and up to down, all these kind of things and it\u2019s hard to capture that a lot of times in words. Where it\u2019s really easy to capture in doodles and sketches and things like that. So what I recommend is to look at what you\u2019re doing or teaching or giving or trying to explain or whatever those things are and figure out ways you can take those complex things and turn them into a doodle or a sketch or something because it\u2019s amazing what that will do.</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve seen post on Facebook where they took the Dotcom Secrets books and took all the sketches and they blown up and had them printed out and they\u2019re all over their wall and office, which I think is so cool. You look at something and instantly recollect all this stuff that maybe 30 pages of text, and you\u2019re trying to remember and you look at one image and boom everything floods back into your conscious mind and you\u2019ve got it again. You\u2019ve got that concept and you understand it in a way that\u2019s hard from just words.</p> <p>I think that if you start doing that you\u2019ll see some interesting things that I saw. First off, people you are teaching and training and educating will understand what you\u2019re doing better and you\u2019ll see a higher adoption rate, a higher people doing what you\u2019re trying to share with them. Doing it from an employee standpoint, people understand your vision better and they\u2019ll understand what you want. It\u2019s from an employee/employer side. And I think it\u2019ll give you a ton of clarity as well. As I sketch things out for me, it makes these complex things very tangible and real. And it\u2019s exciting so there you go.</p> <p>I think I got some cool things I\u2019m going to be doing with this. I\u2019m showing a clip from Gary Vaynerchuk in one of my presentations. The clip\u2019s really cool, he\u2019s sharing one core message, a 30 second video explaining something, and I think I want to start making a video series based on all these little sketches and doodles where I focus on one in each video and just talk about it, give quick impressions on each thing. Anyway, I think that will be born, it\u2019s just an idea right now, but I think in the next couple of months that\u2019s going to be a real thing. So if and when it happens, you guys heard about it first. So there you go, I\u2019m almost to the office, I\u2019m going to go plug in some doodles. I\u2019m excited for this weekend for everyone who\u2019s going to be there. I\u2019m excited to hopefully share, give and inspire and give you guys something that\u2019s going to be amazing. With that said, have an amazing weekend and I\u2018ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "10:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_212.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1458940683, "title": "Episode #211 \u2013 Where Do You Go When You Need To Get Work Done?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Late night adventures before the Funnel Hacking event.</p> <p>On this late night episode Russell talks about all the work he\u2019s gotten done and how much he has left to do before Funnel Hacking Live.

Hey everyone it is 2:26, freezing cold driving home. I hate when the sun goes down and it just gets colder and colder. We\u2019re almost in Summertime, so in my head I think it\u2019s supposed to be warm, but no, it\u2019s not happening. When it gets this late at night it\u2019s cold.</p> <p>I was up late tonight doing a whole bunch of power point slides for the event, which I\u2019m really excited for now, they\u2019re turning out good. For me, the content are scary because I only teach them once. Last year one of my presentations that I spent a lot of time doing it and in theory it was awesome, but I got on stage, I just didn\u2019t feel it. It felt clunky and weird. But then that\u2019s the only time I ever give that presentation so I missed the shot. So it\u2019s one of those things that I\u2019m thinking through these things a lot because I know it\u2019s a one shot for me to get up, give the presentation, hopefully knock it out of the park, and then I\u2019ll probably never give this presentation again. So there\u2019s a lot of thought that goes into that. Make sure that it flows and make sure that it flows, the first thing makes the second, and how they all tie together. Also, you have no idea. I\u2019ve got a time block I\u2019ve two 90 minute presentations the first day and I don\u2019t know how many slides 90 minutes is. I don\u2019t know if I get up there and I get nervous I\u2019ll talk really fast and I\u2019ll be done in 30 minutes. But if I don\u2019t get nervous and I have fun and start telling stories, I could be going for 3 or 4 hours. So some of those things is also kind of hard because I\u2019ve got a hard deadline. I\u2019ve got to hope that this got enough stuff to cover me to go long enough, but also not too much that it goes on for forever.</p> <p>So those are just kind of the fun things that I got to play with and kind of do tonight, which is really cool. What else exciting is happening? I did a podcast earlier today, which I guess was almost 24 hours ago, on burnout, and a lot of you guys reached out to me already, which is super cool. So thank you for that. I\u2019m actually feeling good now. I think I was feeling a lot of overwhelmed because I felt like I was so far behind and I didn\u2019t think I would get it all done in time. The nice thing about tonight, I was able to get a lot of stuff done. It\u2019s interesting, one thing about working from 9 til 3 in the morning is that a lot of distractions are gone. All your friends aren\u2019t on Facebook posting every five seconds, no one\u2019s Skyping you, no emails are coming in. All those active communication channels that people have to get access to you, disappear because everyone\u2019s in bed at night. So you get the chance to actually work. In a six hour shift like that, typically I can get done what I\u2019d do in two or three days. That\u2019s sad, but true.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if any of you guys have read the book Remote, I said it with\u2026.so the first book was called, Rework and the second one was called Remote, Jason Fried and those guys over at 37Signals, who I\u2019m just huge fans, in fact, Stu McLaren, who listens to Marketing In Your Car pretty often I believe, and he\u2019s going to be at Funnel Hacking Live and we\u2019re hopefully going to be donating a bunch of money this year to their charity again. He\u2019s the one who told me about Rework so I read that book and that changed my whole paradigm on business. It\u2019s funny almost every mistake I have made in my business career, up to the point I read that book, I was like, \u201cOh crap, chapter 3 would have taught me that. Oh chapter 4 would have\u2026.dangit!\u201d It\u2019s a really good book and a really fast read too. But first book was Rework and then they came out with a second book called Remote. Interestingly enough right before we launched Clickfunnels and I\u2019m grateful for that because I think that that book gave us permission to build Clickfunnels the way we did, where people are Remote. Had I not read that book and Todd and Dylan and all the guys on our team, I may have pushed a lot harder to get everyone to relocate to Boise, which would have been a lot more fun, not going to lie, but not necessary I don\u2019t think. But one thing they talked about in the book that was interesting that I think is worth thinking about, they talked about if you have to get something done, where do you go? If you ask your employees for that, hey if you get something done, where do you go? None of them ever say they got to go to work. They\u2019re like, I gotta come in early, stay late, pull an all-nighter, I got to leave and go to the library or whatever it is, but they never say they\u2019re going to do it at work, because it\u2019s hard to get work done at work, because there\u2019s so many distractions. There\u2019s proximity in power. There\u2019s benefit in being around people because there\u2019s things you can only push forward through that, but at the same time, it\u2019s good to go back in your cave and actually get stuff done.</p> <p>That\u2019s what tonight was for me, just a chance to shut down from the world and focus on moving things forward, and I made a lot of progress, which is cool. I got my first two presentations done for the first day. Mostly the presentations are done, but I need to\u2026..there\u2019s ton\u2019s of doodle sketches kind of like from the Dotcom Secrets book. So Vlad, who does all those, I sketched them all out on my notepad today, and send to him and he\u2019s hopefully going to get them done tonight. I\u2019m hoping by the time I wake up in the morning they are all done, and I can copy and paste them into my slides and then first two presentations, first 3 hours of content for me, which is basically gonna be covering everything that the new Expert Secrets book will be finished, which is exciting for me. Then I gotta work on the presentation I\u2019m giving the last day called Funnel Stacking which is really cool. It goes along with the outline of the Funnel Stacking book that you guys will all be getting for free when you join Funnel University. I\u2019ll be going through that which is fun because I\u2019ll be showing all the pages of the three core funnels, Tripwire, Webinar, High Ticket. I show the email sequence, I show pretty much everything from in those funnels. So I gotta create that presentation. Trying to get all the original graphics from the book so I can just plug those in.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the goal. Bust that one out tomorrow, and then I\u2019ve got one, my last presentation will be short, like 15 minute one that\u2019s called, What Happens When The Funnels Flops, and I\u2019ll be going over the process in more detail. Kind of like two podcasts ago, I was talking about the wrestling and making adjustments. So I\u2019ll be going over my process for that. That will be kind of a wrap up of the event, which will be cool. Which means all I have left after that is two more presentations. Oh man, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do. One presentation is gonna be called, The Future of Clickfunnels, I\u2019m going to be sharing a whole bunch of cool stuff that\u2019s happening with Actionetics, there\u2019s some ninja crazy cool stuff coming down the pike, that\u2019s going to make it where I think a little difficult for any autoresponder to compete with what we are coming out with. So I\u2019m going to be showing the future there. And then we have a presentation about being a Clickfunnels funnel consultant. A lot of people asking about that, going crazy about it, so we\u2019ll be giving a presentation, and then hopefully, be getting people to join the certification program.</p> <p>Those are the things that I\u2019ve got left to do. My goal, hopefully tomorrow I\u2019ll be able to get done. Finalize the first two presentations, finalize the Funnel Stacking, finalize the What Happens When The Funnels Flops, finalizing the Actionetics The Future. Because if I can get those done, we can send those to print, which will be good because that\u2019ll get those all in the binder for the event. And then I can work on the Funnel consulting one over the next few days, which will take me a little while to get that one perfect because creating content training is one thing, but creating a webinar presentations that actually have a dual purpose, which is also to sell is a little bit different, so it takes a little more time, energy and thought. Maybe not more thought, just different kind of thought. So that\u2019s the game plan.</p> <p>Tomorrow hopefully I\u2019ll have 5 or 6 of them done, then I\u2019ll have the last one and then I\u2019ll be able to relax and hang out and go to the event. So that\u2019s kind of my goal. I don\u2019t know if this is of any value to you guys. Hopefully it gives you some ideas in getting work done. You should go read the two books, Rework and Remote. You should take a nap, because that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do in a few minutes, as soon as I get in the garage. So that\u2019s it for me tonight guys, appreciate you all. Thanks for listening and I\u2019m excited to see a lot of you guys at Funnel Hacking Live. I\u2019m working my butt off to put on a good show for you guys and I hope you enjoy it. Peace out, have a good night and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "10:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_211.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1458857338, "title": "Episode #210 \u2013 Approaching Burnout\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What I do and what you can do as you start to approach \u2018burnout\u2019 in your business or in life.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about feeling burnout from preparing for Funnel Hacking Live.

Is that funny that I crack myself up every time? I gotta try to be louder and more obnoxious each time otherwise it\u2019s going to be boring. So welcome you guys, I hope you\u2019re excited. I\u2019ve got crazy allergies happening. I\u2019m not the kind of guy who gets allergies except for around cats. I\u2019m deathly allergic to cats. But I don\u2019t normally get them, but ever since I got back from New York, the wrestling tournament I\u2019ve been sneezing 50 times a day and my nose is super raw. It\u2019s horrible. So I\u2019m hoping and praying that when we get to San Diego next week for Funnel Hacking Live that I don\u2019t have allergies, cause that would be horrible on stage, sneezing every five seconds. It\u2019d be really embarrassing. I\u2019m sure I could take some kind of antihistamine or whatever, but those things always make me tired and throw me off my game and I gotta be on top of my game. There\u2019s going to be a lot of you guys there.</p> <p>First off, if you\u2019re going to be there, congratulations because you need to be there, it\u2019s going to be amazing. So that\u2019s number one, and number two, if you\u2019re not going to be there, you missed it, we sold out. You can come even if you wanted to. I\u2019ve been warning and begging and pleading for a long time and now you\u2019re one shot is gone. So there you go.</p> <p>So with that said, I want to talk to you about something today that\u2019s kind of serious. For me, right now, and probably for you a lot of times. I\u2019m doing this on my way to my haircut, so my the one podcast when I was getting my haircut, ever since then, every time I post a video online, everyone\u2019s like, \u201cNice haircut, nice haircut.\u201d So thanks I guess for messing with me. It\u2019s pretty funny actually. So I\u2019m getting a haircut real quick, the last haircut before the big event. So hopefully I will look normal when we get there.</p> <p>Alright, what I wanted to talk to you guys about today\u2026Dang there\u2019s a lot of traffic\u2026\u2026is burn out. I\u2019m curious, how many of you guys have ever felt burnt out? I think the first time that I ever got burnt out of something, because typically when you\u2019re a kid you\u2019re just doing a bunch of cool stuff all the time, everyday is like a new adventure. My kids think they get burnt out because they\u2019re tired of doing whatever the activity is. But the first time I ever really felt burnt out was my sophomore year of high school, I was wrestling 130 pounds, and each week I would check my weight on Sunday night, and on average I would be 160. Which meant, I usually had weigh ins on Thursday or Friday, which meant I had 4 or 5 days to get from 160 down to 130. And for any of you guys that have ever tried to go through wrestling practice, it\u2019s not easy, but the only way that it gets harder is you put on plastic suits. My dad used to call them rubber gear back in the day, we called them plastic when I was in it, but it\u2019s basically this plastic suit that goes tight around your neck your wrists, your ankles, and it\u2019s heat impermeable, so heat cannot get out of it. So what you do is put on a pair of sweats and put on a pair of plastic on top of that, and put on another pair on top of that and you walk in the wrestling room and by the time you\u2019re in the wrestling room you\u2019re body is cooking. I could feel my heart beating really\u2026it was just horrible. Then you go through wrestling practice, and the most I ever lost in an hour was, with my plastics on, was 8 pounds. So you can lost a lot of weight, 8 pounds of water is a gallon. A gallon of milk weighs 8 lbs, I think. Does it weigh 8 pounds? Yeah, I think it was 8 pounds. So that\u2019s the equivalent. So I\u2019d wrestle an hour and suck a gallon of water out of my body. So you\u2019d get done with practice, you take your sweats off, you take your plastics off, and you\u2019re sweats would be soaking wet, and you could take them and wring them out, all the water would flush out of them. So every week that was my process.</p> <p>Weigh in Sunday night 160, I\u2019d weigh in Thursday night for the dual meet or the tournament on Friday and I\u2019d be 130. So 30 pounds\u2026it\u2019s not easy. Because the first practice you lose 8 pounds, second practice you lose 5 pounds, third practice you\u2019d lose 3 pounds, next practice you\u2019d lose 2 pounds, because you just don\u2019t have as much water to give and at the end you\u2019re trying to lose the last 2 pounds and it\u2019s a nightmare, and you\u2019re tired and sore and hungry and thirsty. Actually, you\u2019re not hungry, even though you don\u2019t eat, you don\u2019t have hunger pains, you have thirst pains are way worse than hunger pains. So typically I\u2019d stop eating two or three days before the wrestling tournament, which probably isn\u2019t that smart. Knowing what I know now, I\u2019d probably do things a lot different. Nevertheless, that\u2019s what we did. And then I\u2019d stop drinking 24 hours before, and about 3 days before, I\u2019d drink really minimally because the water is the weight right. Food doesn\u2019t actually weigh anything, foods the calories. I\u2019d try to eat really heavy calorie food because that would give me some energy. But then, I hardly drank any water because water weighs the most. So 24 hours before we cut out all water and suck the last bit and it\u2019s painful and it sucks and it\u2019s horrible. But in a weird sadistic way I really enjoyed it. We had to get into it. I think a lot of it, is 5 or 6 of us all cutting weight together. Just the camaraderie. Anyway, I honestly miss those days. In fact, when I go to wrestling tournaments now, even the NCAA tournament, I feel guilty drinking water or eating food, because I think, I\u2019m in a wrestling tournament, I should not be eating, this is weird. I have this weird guilt. Anyway, I would go get mental help, if I was still wrestling, but I\u2019m not so it\u2019s good.</p> <p>So going through an entire season like that, by the time I was at the end of wrestling season, I was burned out.\u00a0 It showed. I\u2019d beaten the state champ, the kid that ended up taking the state champ that year, I\u2019d beaten him twice during the year, and I ended up taking 5th place in the region tournament, didn\u2019t even qualify for the state tournament that year. I went on to watch this kid I beat twice become a high school state champ which was my goal. It was hard. I remember sitting in the state tournament watching him win, and it was sad, it was frustrating and everything and I was just burned out. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I remember sitting there and to get through that burn out, I took a week off and I just did nothing except for eat cereal and watch cartoons, which was awesome. Then I went back to wrestling and we did freestyle and Greco and the way I got out of burnout is I started having fun with wrestling again. So I went to these tournaments, I didn\u2019t cut any weight, I went up by like 5 weight classes, I was at 154 in my freestyle and my Greco weight, didn\u2019t cut any weight, I showed up, weighed in and whatever I weighed, I went against these huge dudes, and it was good. I started lifting and getting strong and eating and getting healthy and I just made it fun again. And that\u2019s how I kind of got through that burnout period.</p> <p>So that was the first time, the next time I really know I had a burnout bad. If you listened to my podcast in the past you know some of the ups and downs. It was after we had 100 employees and everything crashed. We had a year of trying to save our butts and earn money to pay back the government and all these crazy things and at that point I was beyond burned out. I would\u2019ve walked away from this business if I didn\u2019t have so many outstanding debts and liabilities and coaching fulfillments and all these promises we made people. I had to fulfill on those things so I kept coming through, kept pushing it, and I was a burnout. I hated it. I woke up everyday hating what I did. And what got me through that burnout period, it was interesting it was one of my friends Daegan Smith, who was one of my wrestling buddies at NCAA last weekend. But Daegan called me, he actually called me and interviewed me on something. So he interviewed me and then we just sat there and talked for an hour or two telling stories and all these things. And he got me re-excited about marketing and about what we were doing and how we were doing it. Just all the cool things that we can bend and do and learn and discover. He made marketing fun for me again. And on the tails of that came a lot of amazing things for me and probably for you. You know the DotcomSecrets came as a by-product that we went through this testing phase for the next year. We were testing and trying and doing all these things and from that came the DotcomSecrets book, from that came Clickfunnels, from that came all the amazing things we do now. But they came on the backside of burnout, which is\u2026burnout\u2019s hard.</p> <p>So right now, I\u2019m a week away from our event and I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m feeling burned out. You know, we\u2019ve had a big mountain to climb. We had to sell over 1000 tickets, which is a not easy task. I remember my, back in the day we\u2019d do events, we\u2019d get 100 people show up and I remember going to a Dan Kennedy event one time and there was 1000 people in the room and I was thinking, this is incredible. I cannot believe that that is even possible that they have 1000 people in the room and thinking that was an insurmountable task, and we just accomplished this and it\u2019s amazing. But the cost has been burnout.</p> <p>So anyway, it\u2019s 1:00 right on the dot, and my haircut is starting right now, so I\u2019m going to stop this, go get my haircut, then I\u2019ll come back out and we\u2019ll talk about burnout some more. Two reasons, one, I need to talk myself through it to help me get through kind of what I\u2019m feeling right now, and the best way I\u2019ve found to get through some of those things is to share with others. And then number two, I know that some of you guys are probably experiencing that right now, hopefully it\u2019ll give you guys some hope and faith in what you\u2019re doing and keep you moving forward. So I\u2019ll be back for part two of this podcast here in about 30 minutes.</p> <p>Alright, so where were we? We were talking about burnout. I\u2019m sure that most of you, at least I hope so, I hope it\u2019s not just me that goes through that every once in a while, and I\u2019ve had little spouts, but honestly since Daegan kind of came back in and got me re-excited about marketing it\u2019s good, everything\u2019s been moving forward. You know, I think the last two years or so has been more intense than normal and part of it is just because we had this opportunity, Clickfunnels came and so a lot of it is like, strike while the iron\u2019s hot. However you say that thing. Anyway, we did, we went intense. We\u2019ve gone hard and we\u2019ve pushed it and we\u2019ve done amazing things and it\u2019s been so much fun. So because I\u2019ve been working so hard, I just haven\u2019t thought about\u2026You\u2019re focusing on this one mission and you\u2019re pushing things forward. I was reading Gary Vaynerchuck\u2019s new book this weekend and one thing he talks about is the dirt and the clouds. The clouds is your vision and the dirt\u2019s getting your feet dirty, and moving forward and working. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been. It\u2019s been the clouds hurts the vision, and then boom hit the dirt and pounding it, and focusing on those two things and it\u2019s been good.</p> <p>There\u2019s been so much stuff happening and we\u2019re moving things forward and all of this amazing momentum so we\u2019ve been running with it. But this last week and a half, two weeks or so as we\u2019re moving towards the event, all the things we\u2019re doing to push forward, to fill the event, and we were about to launch Funnel University and Clickfunnels and all this stuff along with new sales page, new one day challenge, new certification program. Man, there\u2019s so much more stuff that I probably haven\u2019t even talked to you guys about that\u2019s happening, that\u2019s all at the point of fruition where everything is going to be rolling live now. And just all this fun momentum over the last little bit, and I\u2019ve had to stop because, first I was trying to finalize, finish up, my goal in this was to finish the new book by the event which didn\u2019t happen. But now it\u2019s like, I just stop everything to get all the presentations done for the event and with that there\u2019s the handouts, and the order forms, and all these little detail things that I just not a details person, but we\u2019re at a part of the game where the details are what matters. I\u2019m in charge of executing a lot of those details because I\u2019m really the one who understands what and why and how and all those kind of things, you know.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m at, and I\u2019m not going to lie. I\u2019m starting to feel that burnout, cause this is the part that I don\u2019t enjoy the most, which is all those kinds of things. So I have to slow back and all these other projects we\u2019ve been trying to push out push out push out before the event, I\u2019ve had to stop and just like, this cannot happen before the event. I\u2019ve had to start cutting things to be able to execute correctly on the event, and make it an amazing experience for everyone\u2019s who\u2019s there. I\u2019m just kind of feeling it. So for the last four days I was supposed to be working on my presentation and day one I didn\u2019t because I was focusing on this and day two there\u2019s something else and each day I keep putting it off, I think it\u2019s probably because I got a lot of pain associated. There\u2019s something about the finality, is that the right word? This thing being final, like writing a book. When you write a book, at least for me it\u2019s stressful, because it becomes so final. It\u2019s concrete, it doesn\u2019t change. When the book\u2019s done, it is what it is. You don\u2019t change it, right. I feel the same with the event. When the presentations are done, next step is me giving them, there\u2019s so much, it\u2019s so final, I think I put a lot of pressure on it, so it kind of stresses me out.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019ve been moving forward, moving forward and yesterday I spent probably 2 or 3 hours just outlining all the presentations and I think I have 6 presentations that I\u2019m working on. And I got excited because it\u2019s looking really cool and I know what to deliver, and I know what I\u2019m trying to bring across, but now I know I gotta break those core concepts into slides, and power points and images and things that\u2019ll make this all make sense. In a very streamline format. You know to take really complex thoughts or ideas and make them simple, it\u2019s hard. The Dotcom Secrets book was hard. How do we take this abstract idea that I understand in my gut but then change it into something that I can explain to someone and they can look at it and be like, \u201cOh that makes perfect sense.\u201d That\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m at now. I\u2019ve got all these amazing things, for the next two days I have to lock myself down and figure out how to explain them in a simple easy way and get doodle drawings to match, and all those kind of things. So it\u2019s a lot of work to do, but the other thing I got is this looming deadline that I have to get them done so we can get them printed so we can have them in people\u2019s books by the time the event starts. All these things that, and I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m feeling that burnout.</p> <p>Last night at about 5:30 at the office I had this pounding headache, I was just like, I gotta stop and go home. I\u2019m going to go home and play with the kids for a little bit, put them to bed then come back. I didn\u2019t\u2019 get them to bed until late, because it\u2019s Spring Break for them. We didn\u2019t get them to bed until 10:30 and I was just like, I don\u2019t have it in me to come back, I\u2019m going to wake up early and come in. Then the morning came and I was like, I don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m not ready. I kind of slept in a little bit, but now I\u2019m feeling really good. I\u2019m still in this phase where I\u2019m kind of, there\u2019s so much pressure and stress and buildup and all this stuff that I think part of your brain, the burnout happens where you just want to relieve that pressure, you want to take the pressure valve off and just ahhhhh. But I can\u2019t yet because the big show\u2019s about to happen. So that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling. In complete transparency, I\u2019m feeling the pressure and stressed and worried and I want to make a good experience, because there\u2019s things happening and that\u2019s kind of where, and I think a big part for me is because I have to cut all these things, that are important to me, that I want to have done, that I physically cannot get them done anymore before the event, I feel a lot of stress and pressure and guilt because I had to cut these things. I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s kind of where it\u2019s at.</p> <p>So there you go. I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m feeling it, and I\u2019m sure you guys, have ever felt in the past, you\u2019re there right now. So I just wanted to kind of give you some of my thoughts on what I\u2019m trying to do to be able to kind of push through the burnout. Because we still got to execute. We\u2019re seven days away from the event, starting at the time I\u2019m recording this, we can\u2019t stop. But how do we still make it fun and\u00a0 then when the event\u2019s done, take the pressure valve out so we can keep executing and having fun. Because when you\u2019re having fun, it makes it hard to be creative an deliver the cool stuff. So here\u2019s my game plan.</p> <p>So first off, I have to get through, I talked about this on a recent podcast, I had pain associated with the birthing process of these presentations. So I have to, today and tomorrow, I\u2019ve got two days to really dig in deep into these. A big part of that is because I attach and associate pain with this I have to attach pleasure. How do I? What do I make fun? How do I make these into games? What do I give myself when I finish one? How do I do that? So that\u2019s a big part, is that.</p> <p>Second big part is my mind, I know as I start working, my mind\u2019s going to try to go to pleasure every single time. Let me chat with someone, let me check Facebook, let me do all these kind of things. So for me, what I do, and I talked about this on a different podcast, but when I switch to power point zone, and I\u2019m going to use my treadmill desk, and shut off everything else and just have me walking and focusing on presentations. So that was number one.</p> <p>Number two is, I have to celebrate the little whims along the way, so as I finish one I have to do something to celebrate. Either go out to eat, or eat junk food, or hanging out with friends, go walk, or check Facebook, or whatever it is. Have these big rewards as I get things done, it\u2019ll push me through those pain points. Second off, I\u2019ve got to, you guys can tell I\u2019m creating this as I go, I\u2019m trying to think this through, so that\u2019s a big one for me to get through the day to day.</p> <p>I think when the event is done, I\u2019m not very good at taking time off, it stresses me out, but I think I need to force myself. When I get home from the event, I\u00a0 need to take one or two days off and just not do anything, because I need to take that pressure valve off. Part of me wants to do a product launch. Tuesday after the event I want to launch Funnel University. IT\u2019s driving me nuts that it\u2019s not live yet. I probably shouldn\u2019t but I still might. But taking that pressure valve off so we can execute right. I would in theory, back when I was wrestling I would have been better in Freestyle if I would have cut weight during the off season, but I didn\u2019t and it was hard because guys were bigger and stronger than me, but I enjoyed it more, I had more fun. So I think it\u2019s, you\u2019re taking some of the internal pressures off. I don\u2019t know about you guys but I give myself a lot of pressure. Probably that\u2019s unneeded, but I don\u2019t know. I was thinking about this a lot, I think it comes from my wrestling background. In wrestling we\u2019re always focused on who could be beating us. I could be the number one kid in the state but I\u2019m thinking about, Man, this guy\u2019s training this guy, this guys training this guy. I have to do more than them because I don\u2019t want them to pass me.</p> <p>I remember Dan Gable, who\u2019s one of our sports legends. He\u2019s like the Michael Jordan of wrestling. Dan Gable, when he was training for the Olympics and he\u2019d work out 7 hours a day, and he\u2019d try to go to bed at night and he couldn\u2019t sleep because he knew that on the other side of the world the Russians were awake training and it made him sick to his stomach knowing the Russians were training while he was sleeping, so he\u2019d get up and run at night.</p> <p>And I kind of feel that for me, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, or something I got from wrestling, but I feel like, right now we\u2019re in the number one position in our industry. We\u2019re doing amazing things, but I feel this pressure. Like, \u201cWow, what\u2019s everyone else doing that we\u2019re not? We got to make sure we\u2019re on top\u201d So I put a lot of pressure on myself which is maybe unnecessary, I don\u2019t know. But it is what it is. So I think I\u2019m going to try to take the week after the event, try to release some pressure on some things like that and set more realistic timelines and goals on things, so that way we can make it fun. Just like Freestyle and Greco was fun\u00a0 because I took the pressure weight cutting out, and just enjoyed the process. It\u2019s like how when I worked with Daegan again, the process became fun because I had focus on the creativity in the marketing and less on the \u201cWe\u2019ve got to launch this, we got to make money.\u201d Things like that I stepped back and because we stepped back and enjoyed the process we were able to create amazing things. I think that that\u2019s really for me the next step, is after the event. Because we can\u2019t\u2026the event\u2019s happening and we\u2019ve got to make an amazing show, but then after that\u2019s done, how do I take some pressure off, so we can execute correctly and have a fun time with it and make it enjoyable. So we don\u2019t burn out.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the thoughts from me. I don\u2019t know if that helps you guys out at all. Make you think Russell\u2019s strange, maybe gives a glimpse inside of my head, I don\u2019t know. But I hope it makes you guys who are going through any kind of burnout to feel understood. Because I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019m going through it now and those are some of the things I\u2019m going to be trying to do to protect myself, so I don\u2019t hit it. Because burnouts, especially this point in my business, it\u2019s tough because I have business partners, I have friends, I have staff, I have teams that rely on me. I can\u2019t let them down.</p> <p>I can\u2019t just disappear and kind of take the foot off the gas because I owe it to them as well. So how do you manage that? How do you protect yourselves so you don\u2019t go through it? If you do go through it a little bit, you manage it in a way that will actually serve you and your team moving forward as opposed to crippling you and hurting you. So there you go, that\u2019s all I got for today. I\u2019m at the office, it\u2019s time for some world domination. I got to get some presentations done. So that\u2019s what I got for you guys. Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "23:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_210.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1458684770, "title": "Episode #209 \u2013 Two Awesome Lessons From The NCAA Wrestling Tournament", "author": "", "summary": "<p>#1 \u2013 Belief, #2 \u2013 How to make tiny adjustments so you win the match</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about being at the NCAA Wrestling Tournament and how if you believe you can win, you can win, and how you can apply that to your business.

Hey everyone, it\u2019s been a little while. I\u2019ve been out traveling the world, gallivanting. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really even the right way to use that word, but it sounded cool today. I was in New York all last week, for the NCAA wrestling tournament with my dad. If you guys listen you probably knew that already, and it was great. I was planning on doing a bunch of podcasts from there, I actually saw one of my favorite marketing people in the world. Daegan Smith was there. We sat by each other for most tournaments. I was going to share some podcasts with you guys and him, but it just never happened. It was too crazy of a week, and too much wrestling, too much New Yorking, too much good stuff happening.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m back now to report and share with you guys some cool stuff. I hope that things are going well. We are a little over a week away from Funnel Hacking Live. We are completely sold out which is a nice feeling to have. So this week I gotta go and work on my presentations, I got some cool stuff I\u2019m going to be sharing with you guys and with our community. I just wanted to make sure that it\u2019s amazing. We were going to launch Funnel University last week, and then this week, and then decided to just kind of put it on hold until after the event and that way we can focus on making the event flawless. Then we will have Funnel University when we get back. So it\u2019s all done and ready and it looks amazing. Our survey software is awesome, just lots of good things.</p> <p>So that is kind of the game plan from here. So I wanted to share with you guys probably what I think is the most important lesson I learned from the wrestling tournament this weekend, which will relate to you guys even if you\u2019re not wrestling people, which you all should be. That\u2019s an argument and a sales pitch for another day.</p> <p>So the NCAA wrestling tournament is amazing. IT\u2019s more like the world championship, in fact, Coach Shultz, if you guys have seen Foxcatcher, Mark Shultz, who is the main character in that movie, was my wrestling coach at BYU, and I actually saw him this weekend which was really fun. But one thing that he said is that the NCAA wrestling tournament, because this style of wrestling is only done in America, he said it\u2019s pretty much like the Olympics, the World Championship, which it is. IT\u2019s kind of a big deal. It\u2019s like the Super Bowl of our style of wrestling, which is cool. The best athletes from all the conferences around the country all come to this tournament and it\u2019s a big deal. And it\u2019s really big for wrestling, it\u2019s on TV, which is the only we get on TV ever. So that\u2019s pretty cool, it was just awesome.</p> <p>We\u2019re in this state, we\u2019re in Madison Square Garden, and the entire stadium is just filled with wrestling fans, which is cool. We had tickets we bought that were on the 12th row, it was right in the middle of Hawkeye fans, which if you know anything about wrestling, you know that Iowa Hawkeyes had a dynasty for the last two decades, three decades. Dan Gable was their coach and built this huge thing and so they\u2019re fans are kind of insane. So we were stuck right\u00a0 in the middle of all these Hawkeye fans that were just going nuts the whole time, which made it really fun too.</p> <p>What I wanted to share with you guys, at the NCAA wrestling tournament, for whatever reason, there are tons and tons of upsets, which are the fun ones. You get to see on the big monitor up top, \u201cthe number 14 seat\u2019s wrestling the number 1 seat and somehow this dude wins.\u201d How does the 14th seat, who\u2019s got like whatever, 20-10 record, come in against an undefeated guy and beat him? How do these things happen? I was thinking about that and talking to Daegan a lot about it. One part of it is interesting is belief. It\u2019s just weird, if you believe you can win, you can win. But it\u2019s all mental, it\u2019s all this belief. Do you believe you can actually do it? We watched this one guy, he was undefeated, hadn\u2019t lost the entire season, or excuse me, he only once the entire season, and he lost to this guy who wasn\u2019t that good, wasn\u2019t ranked that high, and they met in the semi-finals and I was watching it and I was like, I think this guy\u2019s got a shot of winning the underdog. The only reason why is on paper this guy should not even be close to the number one seat. It\u2019s not even close, but because he beat him earlier in the year, which was kind of a fluke, he had this belief that, \u201cI can beat him.\u201d And because he had the belief he could do it, and sure enough he almost beat him, he lost, but it was crazy close.</p> <p>I have had matches in my career where I on paper should have lost to people, but because I had thought I could win, I had this belief for whatever reason, that guy looks weird or whatever, I had this belief that I just knew I could win. I was able to win. It was weird. I remember this one time I was wrestling, there was this guy in my Freestyle Greco club who I beat all the time, didn\u2019t have much respect for him as wrestler. He wasn\u2019t that good. One day I\u2019m at this tournament, and I\u2019m wrestling this other kid from some other state, the kid was good, we\u2019re having a close match, and I\u2019m actually losing going into the third period. My Freestyle Greco coach, I guess there\u2019s not periods in Freestyle Greco, sorry it\u2019s been a while. During one of the injury breaks or injury time or something, my coach came out and tried to tell me some stuff, he\u2019s like, \u201cHey you need to work on your level change or whatever. By the way, Matt beat this kid\u00a0 by 8 last match.\u201d And instantly I was like, \u201cMatt beat him by 8.\u201d In my head all the sudden, this kid in my head was no good, and I had a perfect belief that I could beat him, and the last minute and half or whatever it was, I came out there and I tech-falled him. Because all the sudden\u2026..it was the same match. I was struggling this whole match and suddenly my belief switched in my head to this kid should be really easy for me and then he was.</p> <p>There\u2019s this weird thing about belief, it just beats all odds. If you believe you can win, you can win. I remember last year, NCAA tournament there was a kid that was number 4 team seat, and he became a national champ, and I posted on my Facebook wall and I forgot about it until yesterday, because yesterday it popped up saying, \u201clast year here\u2019s a memory you posted.\u201d And the thing I posted was picture of the kid, and they\u2019re interviewing him at the end. They said, \u201cYou were the 14th seat, how in the world did you come here and win this?\u201d he said, \u201cWhen I got here I looked at the brackets and I looked at all these people and I said, this is who I have to beat to be a national champ so I came and beat them.\u201d It was just pure belief. Anyway, I thought that was important for all of you guys because it\u2019s not skill, it\u2019s not talent it\u2019s not a record, it\u2019s not anything, it\u2019s belief. And that same thing is true in your business.</p> <p>I think the reason why I win a lot of times, is I just have such belief that what we\u2019re doing is going to change the world, and it just does. So my first question for you is,\u00a0 how much belief do you have?n Do have belief you can win. So that\u2019s question number one, the second thing I want to bring up and this is the second half of the equation. Is being able to look at a loss and not looking at this devastating thing, but looking at it and trying to figure out what you need to change to win. Good example, in 174 lbs finals, which you guys should Google this match, it\u2019s amazing. Beau Nichols, from Penn State, undefeated the whole year, was supposed to win the tournament, again this other kid, who is a true freshman from Oklahoma, this true freshman had lost to Beau Nichols three times during the year. In fact, in the big tens he got pinned by him. So he no shot of winning, no way he was going to win. He comes into this finals match and him and Beau Nichols lock up, he launches him, throws him to his back, almost pins him, gets a bunch of near-fall points and then Beau ends up trying to play catch up the entire wrestling match and ends up losing, just huge upset. True freshman wins this thing. Everyone\u2019s going nuts. It was amazing. One of those matches, I stood up and I stood amongst all the Iowa guys who were not standing and I gave him a round of applause. To come back and to lose to this kid, the best kid arguably in the world right, and to have to lose to him three times this season, to come back and win, that\u2019s huge. What is it? What causes that?</p> <p>I remember my junior year in high school, I worked hard all my sophomore that summer long, I had gone Freestyle and Greco and we worked all day long, I just knew my senior year, I would be state champ. Go out there, first match against a kid that had taken 2nd the year before, we go out there to wrestle and I had belief that I could win, but this kid was better than me. And he beat me. It was devastating for me. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be state champ that year, and I lost my very first match. My dad had recorded the match and then after the match, my dad was rewinding and watching it, rewinding and watching it. My next match happened and he started recording, and he actually recorded over the first match except for about 13 seconds. So we had 13 seconds of footage of this match against this guy named, Nick Fresquez. So my dad, every day for the next four months watched that 13 seconds of film to see what he was doing and how it was working, and he\u2019d do this little funky moves on me. We\u2019d go with my dad and watch this match all weekend long and practice the next week, and we\u2019d drill it, drill it, drill it. And we\u2019d come back and I remember my dad watching this little clip over and over and over again, because it\u2019s all we had. It\u2019s all we had to pick apart what he\u2019d done to beat me. And we focused on that all season land, and I actually wrestled this kid in the state finals. And in the State finals, not only was he not able to do that move on me, but that\u2019s actually the move I used against him to win the state championship, which is kind of a cool turn of events. But what it was all about is, I lost, after I lost I looked at why I lost, and we made adjustments.</p> <p>This is the key, this is why wrestling was such a big important thing for me. There\u2019s some people that are just amazing wrestlers. They come in and they just win all the time, I was never that guy, so I would usually go to a season or whatever, I\u2019d wrestle somebody, and I could beat most people, but against the best people I would lose. So I\u2019d lose and be like, \u201cWow, why did I lose?\u201d I lost because my elbow\u2019s right, I lost because I was overextended, I lost because I took a bad shot, I lost because of this\u2026and we looked at what the reasons why we lost and then we went back to the room and we practiced and we practiced, and we made adjustments and took away those things that they had the last time they beat me and came back and wrestled again. Sometimes I\u2019d lose to them a second time and it\u2019d be closer, I\u2019d look, \u201cWhy\u2019d I lose this time?\u201d make those adjustments, make those tweaks, make those changes and come back and eventually we would win.</p> <p>That\u2019s the kind of wrestler I was. I was not, again an amazing athlete, but I was amazing at looking at why I lost and making adjustments and come back a second time stronger and harder.</p> <p>So what happened in this finals match, this guy had beaten him three times during the year, in fact he pinned him two weeks earlier, and he looked at that. \u201cWhat mistakes did I make? What adjustments do I need to make?\u201d And he came back and was able to beat him in the national finals. So this is the 2nd lesson. I see this all the time in our business, in fact, I\u2019d say with our Inner Circle members, this is where I spend the majority of my time, they go and they create a sales funnel, they create a sales letter, they create all these things, and they go out and they launch it and it doesn\u2019t work. Then they\u2019re devastated emotionally, \u201cI can\u2019t even handle this, I lost this thing. I spent all this time on it, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d And they\u2019re shattered, and I get\u00a0 it, but because they haven\u2019t had, I mean most people don\u2019t have a chance to go through wrestling or sports like that where you get beat on and you don\u2019t have an opportunity to go and just quit, you get beat on and you have to go look at the film and figure out why did you get beat on and you make the tweaks and the changes. Same thing is true for us in marketing. We put out a campaign and we launch it and 90% of the time it doesn\u2019t produce the way I wanted it to at first. We get beat. So I have to come back and make adjustments.</p> <p>I look at the numbers across the whole thing. How much did we spend on ads? Was it high? Was it low? Was it good? How many people opt-in on the landing page? Was it high? Was it low? Was it good? How many people bought off the sales video or the sales letter or the webinar? And we look at every single piece of this process, just like I would in a wrestling match. We break it apart. \u201cWhat was I doing wrong? Were my elbows out? Was I overextended? Was I shooting far? Is my headline not captivating? Are people not opting in? Are people not buying? Are people not showing up to the webinar?\u201d I\u2019m looking at all the things that went wrong in the process and I\u2019m making little tiny adjustments. I\u2019m not going and reinventing the wheel from the ground up saying \u201cThis sucks.\u201d And throw it away and restart.\u00a0 That\u2019s not how it works. It all comes off of tiny little adjustments. So initially when we created our first sales funnel, we\u2019re trying to make the best possible thing we got, then we launch. People always ask me, \u201cCan you critique this before we launch?\u201d I\u2019m not going to critique it before you launch it, go launch it.\u00a0 We have no idea what\u2019s going to happen until you\u2019re put in a competition, until you see how you react to the real world, see how people react to you.</p> <p>I think it drives a lot of my inner circle members crazy sometimes. I\u2019m not going to critique it until we drive some traffic, I don\u2019t want to screw things up. It could be perfect, it could be far off, but we need to let traffic tell us. I don\u2019t want people telling us their opinions, who are coming and looking, \u201cOh, this is my opinion. You should tweak this.\u201d No let people vote with their credit card. The only thing that matters is people voting with their credit card. If they are willing to pull their credit card out and give you those digits, then you\u2019re right. That\u2019s how you win this match. That\u2019s how you win this game. I never give people critiques ahead of time, I have them launch it, we drive traffic, spend a couple of hundred bucks and then we look at what happened, and then we make the adjustments, and then we come back for the second match stronger. The second match we may not win either, that\u2019s okay you look at the numbers again, you look at every step in this funnel, this page, what\u2019s happening. We then make some tweaks and make some adjustments. Then we come back again and make some tweaks and adjustments, then we come back again and we keep doing that until we have a winner.</p> <p>Neuracel, our supplement did not win the first time. In fact, if you look at the numbers, it lost the dual meet, it lost tournament. It lost the conference. It lost the semi\u2019s. But then in the end if it wouldn\u2019t matter. I think Neuracel\u2019s like the seventh or eighth variation of it, that\u2019s the one that took off and won. Same thing with Clicklfunnels, when we launched that, it wasn\u2019t the first, second, third or fourth. It was the fifth, sixth or seventh variation that one. So you guys gotta think about that. IT\u2019s not throwing out the whole thing. IT\u2019s looking at what\u2019s happening. Looking at the process and making tweaks and adjusting until you\u2019re right. That\u2019s how you win at wrestling, that\u2019s how you win at business.</p> <p>So there you go guys. Two things that I hope will help you from my weekend. Number one is belief, number two is getting out there and having the match and making the adjustments you lined to make to win. And if you do those two things in your business, just like in wrestling, just like in anything that\u2019s how you win. Alright you guys, I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019ve been sitting in the parking lot for like 5 minutes because I was so excited about sharing this stuff with you guys. But now, I gotta get back in the game. I got a big match today, got a lot of work to do. Appreciate you guys, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "16:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_209.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1457974362, "title": "Episode #208 \u2013 Why I Did This Podcast For 3 Years When No One Was Listening", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Crazy what\u2019s happening now\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how he\u2019s been doing this podcast for 3 years and still doesn\u2019t know how to check how many people actually listen to it.

Alright everybody, hope you guys are doing good. I just went shopping for some clothes for the Funnel Hacking Live Event because I only have like 8 shirts and I do a lot of videos and I\u2019ve done a lot of events and I noticed recently, I was watching some promo videos from last year\u2019s event and all the shirts I was probably going to wear to the event were the same ones I wore last year and I\u2019m like, \u201cCrap.\u201d I\u2019ve got to get new shirts. Mostly you can get away with the same shirt twice or three times or twelve times. I can\u2019t because they\u2019ve been on video, on promo videos for forever. So I just got some new clothes, which clothes shopping is not my favorite thing. Now I\u2019m driving home to go play with my kids and that is my favorite thing. So it\u2019s all good.</p> <p>I just had a thought for you guys I want to share, because I think it\u2019s interesting. And it has to do with this podcast, with Marketing In Your Car. When I first started it, it was funny, people are like, \u201cHow are you monetizing it.\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cHow many people are listening?\u201dI was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d I didn\u2019t know. I still honestly don\u2019t know how to check how many listeners we have. I assume we have a few because people keep telling me. I don\u2019t even know how to check how many listeners we have, I don\u2019t really care, I don\u2019t know how many downloads, I don\u2019t know how many reviews. Every once in a while I\u2019ll look at reviews, which is exciting, but I don\u2019t know that they are happening.</p> <p>All I knew was that when I decided to start a podcast, \u00a0I knew that if it wasn\u2019t something easy, I would never do it.\u00a0I would have a lot of friends who did interview podcasts, and they\u2019re hard to keep up with you because you have to find someone to interview, you have to find the right time, you gotta interview, all these things. I was like, if I\u2019m going to do it, I\u2019m going to do it while, in a spot that I can consistently do it all the time, which is when I\u2019m driving, which is how it got the name Marketing In Your Car. Which probably has hurt me because there are way cooler names that probably would have gotten more people in. For all of you guys that are faithful Marketing In Your Car people, it\u2019s cool right? But I have basically no strategy, other than I knew I needed to do it consistently.</p> <p>So I was going to do, and I didn\u2019t even so much have, not a topic, but it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOkay, first I\u2019m going to teach this, then I\u2019m going to teach this\u2026\u201d It was more like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to share what\u2019s going on in my head.\u201d Because I have all these things in my head and there\u2019s something magical about getting things out of your head. I\u2019m not that good at communicating with people I don\u2019t think. You could ask my team that, they\u2019d probably agree. Or my wife, I\u2019m not this great communicator one on one sometimes. Because I assume people know what I\u2019m talking about.</p> <p>On this I assume that the microphone has no idea what I\u2019m talking about. So I can just share and give and it\u2019s easier right. So that\u2019s why I did it. I think it was more therapeutic for me. It\u2019s funny I find myself doing these a lot of times because for me it helps. I don\u2019t even know how many of you guys are listening to these but I do know some are. And that\u2019s what I wanted to talk about today. Some of you guys are listening and it\u2019s been interesting watching. My guess is that I think we just passed 3 years of doing this. My guess is the first year I would have probably get on average maybe, 50 or 60 listens per episode. If even that, small group of people. And most people including myself, obviously one big reason why I haven\u2019t looked at numbers. When I look at numbers sometimes I\u2019m like, \u201cOh it\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d And I stop doing it. And I didn\u2019t want to know because I didn\u2019t want to have an excuse of \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this cause there aren\u2019t enough people.\u201d Or whatever, I just wanted to do this and just do it.</p> <p>So I do it and I keep doing it and keep doing it, and what\u2019s interesting is this exponential effect has been happening with this podcast, which is kind of cool. And some of you guys know what I\u2019m talking about and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re one of these people come let me know. Come to the Funnel Hacking Event and tell me. Basically people will hear about me somewhere, or someone will mention the podcast or whatever, and then someone will come and listen to an episode and because it\u2019s not like an hour long episode and you get sucked into all these things, it\u2019s short and fast and I share one idea or one thought, people listen to it, they consume it and as long as they don\u2019t listen to one of my dumb episodes, that\u2019s completely useless, and I have had a few. I\u2019m not going to lie. But if there\u2019s one they relate to, then what happens, it\u2019s interesting, they start at the beginning, and then they plow through all of them.</p> <p>If you listen to all of them, it\u2019s like hundreds of hours I think. Maybe one hundred hours, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a long time. I\u2019ve been driving this car a lot. It adds up, it\u2019s probably 40, 50, 60 hours that people listen to. I get people all the time that come to me, and usually it\u2019s people who joined my Inner Circle program, or a higher level thing, and they say, \u201dRussell, I didn\u2019t know who you were. Six months ago so and so told me about this, I listened to it, then I went on a Marketing In Your Car binge. For the next two weeks all I listened to was you every single day, for hours at a time, and now I\u2019m in your Inner Circle.\u201d I think it\u2019s so cool.</p> <p>There\u2019s somebody at the door selling my wife something as I\u2019m pulling in. Oh great. I\u2019m about to have to go yell at this solicitor. Anyway, I\u2019m home now. Anyway, I just think it\u2019s interesting so, the thing I want to tell you guys is if you think about podcasting or blogging, or whatever you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t worry about the numbers because what happens is this compounding effect where someday, as it\u2019s grown, somebody will come into your world. They will read or listen or follow something you said, and they will become a fan and they will go through and they will consume insane amounts of your content that you don\u2019t think anyone would ever do, but they will.</p> <p>And next thing they know they will become, like I said, a fan, and they\u2019ll buy everything. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening, so it\u2019s been kind of a cool effect. So for those of you guys who have done that so far, thank you.</p> <p>Thanks for coming in, thanks for going on an immersion program and going through all the Marketing In Your Car\u2019s. Thanks for, a lot of you guys signing up and hanging out in Inner Circles and stuff like that. Coming to events and using our stuff. It\u2019s been a cool compounding effect. And I can always tell that my best, I don\u2019t know what to call them, not customers, clients isn\u2019t good either. Student? My best people, my peeps are Marketing In Your Car people. That\u2019s why I keep doing it, and I again, I still don\u2019t know how many people are listening and I don\u2019t care. All I care about is the fact that you\u2019re listening. That\u2019s why I keep doing what I\u2019m doing. So hope you guys enjoy that. I hope it gives you some hope and some faith, because maybe three years down the road, you\u2019ll be getting tons of people joining your Inner Circles and your 25K programs, all sorts of things because of the work you did today, and the work you do tomorrow. Because it has a compounding affect thanks to the inner webs and the internet. These things stick and they last for a long, long time, and my guess is long after I have passed on from this earth and I\u2019m no longer hear, hopefully people keep listening to these and get value from them. That would be my goal. So that\u2019s it for today. I\u2019m done, heading home. Gonna play with the kids, and I will talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "08:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_208.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1457739422, "title": "Episode #207 \u2013 Today We\u2019re Pushing Some Cool Stuff Live", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Now that we\u2019re a legitimate company, this is the actual process.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about how stuff used to get done so fast and he would make fun of big corporations that moved slow.

Hey guys and gals and everybody else who\u2019s hanging out with us today. It\u2019s a rainy day in Boise Idaho, but guess what today, we have stuff going live, so I am excited and pumped up.</p> <p>I want to tell you a story about my life pre-Clickfunnels. Pre-Clickfunnels we would, even not just pre-Clickfunnels, even like, the first year of Clickfunnels, we would have an idea, we\u2019d do it, and then it would go live and it was amazing. Stuff would just get done so so fast. I used to totally make fun of corporate companies, for example ClickBank, we\u2019re really good friends with those guys, but we needed some tech stuff done and we\u2019re like, \u201chey you need to do this.\u201d And they\u2019re like \u201cOkay we\u2019ll do that in Q 3 of 2092.\u201d It would be like on their desk schedules so far out that nothing could get done. It was just so much it was ridiculous. We could never get anything done. I was like, I\u2019m so grateful we can move fast and be nimble and things like that.</p> <p>At least we used to be able to. We used to could. Now we struggle. So what happened is, as Clickfunnels started growing both from a members standpoint and also from a code standpoint, what would happen is, we would have an idea and be like, \u201chey let\u2019s change this really quick.\u201d So Todd or Dylan would go and edit something and push it live and we\u2019re like \u201cSweet that feature is done, everyone is going to be happy and we\u2019re so excited.\u201d But we didn\u2019t know that by doing this thing over here, it would go and affect something out way over here. It\u2019s like the butterfly effect.</p> <p>The butterfly flaps it\u2019s wings in the San Francisco and it goes and causes a Tsunami across the ocean in Hong Kong or whatever. That\u2019s what would happen. We\u2019d fix something and something else huge over here would break. We\u2019d fix that thing over here, then three other things over here\u2026.It was just this weird thing. And I\u2019m not a code guy so I don\u2019t know exactly how it all works, I just know that it was frustrating. Our users got frustrated. I\u2019m sure you guys remember this in the early days of Clickfunnels. You guys are like, \u201c Hey we need this thing fixed.\u201d So we\u2019d fix it and then something else would break. You\u2019re like, \u201cThis has always worked. Why has it stopped working?\u201d and we\u2019re like, \u201cBecause we fixed this, it caused this.\u201d It was really frustrating.</p> <p>Fast forward now a couple of months we found an amazing developer and now partner who came in and basically said, \u201cHey, this is the way that legitimate software companies are run.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cCool we didn\u2019t even know any of that.\u201d\u00a0 So build out so that basically around every\u2026 you know we spent the last 6, 8 months or so, and we\u2019re actually hiring a team now to help increase this. But going back through all the code they\u2019ve ever written and writing tests around this code, which is super supposedly really monotonous and boring. And it\u2019s slowed our progression down dramatically because it\u2019s no longer we can just keep doing new things and fixing bugs and moving stuff forward. Every line of code we write they write tests around it. And the way that works is there\u2019s all these tests around all this code, this is my limited understanding, I\u2019m not someone who really gets it, but supposedly that way when we do a new bug fix or add a feature or whatever, we add the feature and click a button and it goes and tests what does doing this line of code, how does that effect everything else in the system. It\u2019ll go and it\u2019ll run against all these tests. And we\u2019re like, \u201cSweet, this line of code didn\u2019t break anything else, push it live.\u201d Or \u201cHey, if we do push this live these two things will break.\u201d So we gotta go figure out how to do this so it doesn\u2019t break those things.</p> <p>So because of that, we\u2019ve had to slow down our process to be able to get all these tests in place. and now when we roll any new code, same thing it\u2019s slower because we got to put all these tests in place and we got to test it. But what it does long term, is it gives you guys, the users, the ability where every time we fix or add something cool it doesn\u2019t break ten other things!</p> <p>So this has been in place for the last 8 months or so. So on my side it\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like, I want things to get done so much faster, and it\u2019s just a slower process now. But it\u2019s how legitimate software companies do it so that when we decide to add new fonts, the entire editor doesn\u2019t break or whatever. So it\u2019s a good thing, it just slows things down.</p> <p>So that\u2019s been my frustration and I know that some users who are like, \u201cWe want things faster.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019re trying as hard as we can, but you don\u2019t understand what we\u2019ve built, it\u2019s huge, it\u2019s insane.\u201d So the reason why I\u2019m excited about today, is today we\u2019ve got a bunch of amazing things going live, which I\u2019m excited for. Things I\u2019ve been begging for and waiting for. Especially things\u2026..(sneezing), Whoa! Excuse me, there is a sneeze, proving once again that we don\u2019t edit these podcasts. You\u2019re getting it as live and as real as possible. Whoa that was a big one. I can barely see right now.</p> <p>Anyway, so today I\u2019m excited because a bunch of stuff I\u2019ve been waiting for regarding the affiliate program and tracking ideas and things like that are going live. As well as hopefully the new sales letter, as well as the 21 Day Ignite Your Funnel program, and a bunch of other cool things we have in place. To hopefully get more people excited for Clickfunnels, get people to stick longer, reactive old members and then make our affiliate programs way more amazing. You can do tracking ID\u2019s you can search by tracking ID\u2019s. you can see commissions. Not only for Clickfunnels but we're basically moving all of the Russell Brunson Dotcom Secrets brand products into Clickfunnels over the next 30 days. So if you promote my book, we\u2019ll we push people to Clickfunnels you\u2019ll be paid a commission. You promote The Perfect Webinar Script you get commission on Clickfunnels. If you promote anything, it\u2019ll all be going back and be Clickfunnels. Anyway a lot of work has been going on behind the scenes to make this happen and now it\u2019s pretty much happening, which is exciting.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. I\u2019m excited. So hopefully you\u2019ll see some new stuff from me and Clickfunnels. From everything happening for the next couple of days, actually couple of weeks. We have a bunch of big editor updates going live before the event and just even more amazingness happening. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go in there and play. I\u2019m excited to show you guys the new stuff that\u2019s coming out. In future podcasts, I\u2019ll explain some of what we\u2019re doing with the 21 Day Ignite Your Funnel program to increase your retention and stick the desire of members as well as a bunch of other stuff. Anyway, fun things happening here at the labs, and I\u2019ll be sharing with you guys here on the Marketing In Your Car podcast.</p>", "duration": "07:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_207.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1457730107, "title": "Episode #206 \u2013 Two Lessons I Learned From My Dad", "author": "", "summary": "<p>There are two types of people in this world\u2026</p> <p>In today\u2019s episode Russell talks about going to the NCAA Wrestling Tournament with his dad.

I hope you guys are doing amazing. My name is Russell Brunson and I want to welcome you to Marketing In Your Car. Alright guys, it\u2019s a beautiful day, beautiful day. I\u2019m excited. I got my haircut yesterday as some of you guys heard, which is nice. I wanted to add, I was thinking about as I was getting my haircut, and there was one other thing. I was telling you guys about my OCD with socks and stuff. I realized another reason why I hate socks. I\u2019m going to talk about one more thing with my OCD-ness and then we\u2019ll get back to business.</p> <p>So you know when you have pants on, like Levis and shoes and socks, you have white socks underneath right. And you sit and when you\u2019re standing your pants are the right length most of the time, but sometimes you sit and they come up and you can see your white socks. And it feels like your high watering. I hate that too. When you have sandals on and flip flops and you sit down and your pants are a little bit higher, nobody knows. You got white socks on, everybody knows. So another reason why I hate socks.</p> <p>So now that we are over that, let\u2019s get back to work. This morning was awesome. I woke up early and went out there and was doing squats and legs. Had a good leg day, and at the end of leg day I thought I\u2019m going to do box jumps because that would be a great way to destroy my legs at the end of leg day. I learned a very valuable lesson that is important for all of you guys who do legs and that is, don\u2019t do box jumps at the end of leg day. Because somewhere in the ten, you know I did three sets of ten box jumps, the higher ones, At was at three box jumps left and I slipped and smacked my shin in two spots on the box and I\u2019m bleeding, and I got a goose bump the size of a golf ball on my leg. And then right above it is bleeding like crazy. So that was not fun. So another lesson to learn today.</p> <p>Today I\u2019ve actually got two important lessons that actually are useful, as opposed to the ones I gave you yesterday and today. I hope that you made it through yesterday and now you guys are prepared for some good stuff. I\u2019m going to teach you guys two lessons that I learned from my dad that have been vital to everything in my life. I think that they are helpful for you and for your kids, and for your everybody who you work with and have a chance to serve. So I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot because my dad and I, next week are actually going to the NCAA wrestling tournament. So as you guys know I\u2019m kind of obsessed with wrestling. With wrestling, we\u2019re not on TV, we don\u2019t get people to show up at our matches. IT\u2019s kind of like a sport that gets very little love right. So the once a year when it\u2019s a big deal and we\u2019re actually on ESPN, maybe it\u2019s ESPN 2 I don\u2019t even know, but we\u2019re actually on TV is the NCAA wrestling tournament. So a couple of years ago my wife and my dad surprised me. They booked me a trip out to the NCAA\u2019s. I didn\u2019t know, they basically said, here\u2019s airplane tickets, you\u2019re going somewhere. And I kind of knew, I\u2019m like, well I know NCAA tournaments this weekend, everyone in the airport\u2019s got cauliflower ear, kind of know what\u2019s happening right. So I\u2019m getting there and they were like, \u201cWhen you land in Denver, open this package but don\u2019t open it before.\u201d So I land in Denver I open the package and there\u2019s two tickets to the NCAA tournament, and it says meet your dad at terminal whatever, and it was just the coolest gift, I had no idea he was coming. And I went over to that terminal, and my dad was there and we went to the NCA together and had a great time. That was probably 5 or 6 years ago.</p> <p>I\u2019ve gone back once or twice since them. Deagan Smith, my man, invited me a couple of times. We, I think two NCAA\u2019s ago, he got me front row tickets. So I flew in, got front row tickets to the finals, we watched the finals together, and I flew out, which was so cool. This year Deagan was like, \u201cHey you going?\u201d and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go this year. I just have so much stuff happening for the live event. You know, if my dad went with me, it\u2019d be worth it.\u201d So I texted my dad, \u201cHey dad, if I get tickets to the NCAA, you in?\u201d and he texted back \u201cYes.\u201d I was like, \u201cCool.\u201d That was before church a couple of weeks ago. So after church I called him like, \u201cHey I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re in.\u201d and he was like, \u201cWe better be going, I\u2019ve been telling everybody that I\u2019m going to the NCAA tournament.\u201d So I\u2019m like, \u201cSweet man.\u201d So we bought tickets. It\u2019s in Madison Square Garden this year in New York. So we got a place downtown where we\u2019re going to be staying. We got 12th row seats, we were trying to get front row seats, but they were gone. So we got 12th row seats, which is pretty sweet. It\u2019s going to be fun, so I\u2019m excited and looking forward to that.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve just been thinking about my dad a lot and actually called him on, what was it, my birthday, Tuesday was my birthday. He called me on my birthday and we talked for an hour and it was super fun. So I started thinking about him and just cool stuff I learned from him. There\u2019s two lessons that I think were really important that I wanted to share with you guys.</p> <p>Lesson number one, my dad used to always tell me when we\u2019d have our little dad conversations, you know when we\u2019re driving or whatever. I don\u2019t even know how it came up, but I remember him saying this multiple times and it having a really big impact on me. I remember just always hearing this thought in my head, but he used to tell me, he said \u201cthere\u2019s two kinds of people in this world Russell. There are people who are really good at finding problems, that\u2019s the majority of the world. The second kind of person are people that are really good at finding answers. You wanna make sure that you\u2019re the type of person that finds answers.\u201d And I remember hearing that and I thought it was cool, but it didn\u2019t make sense to me then. Then I fast forward and I start this business and I start doing things and I realize that\u2019s how the majority of the world is. They\u2019re finding problems all the time right. They come to you here\u2019s a problem, here\u2019s another problem, here\u2019s a problem and they\u2019re just all about finding problems. It\u2019s about as hard to find a problem as it is to find a solution.</p> <p>As I started this business and I realized that people always have these problems I thought, I went back to my dad\u2019s lesson and I l thought, You know what, there\u2019s a lot of problems out there and I don\u2019t want to be the dude who always finds problems. I\u2019m going to be the guy that finds solutions. Man that\u2019s served me my whole life. It\u2019s served me so much in my business. You look at why we create products, we\u2019re creating answers to people\u2019s problems. So problems are everywhere. We just gotta figure out how to solve those problems and people will give you insane amounts of money for that. I look at my coaching program, I look at our software, I look at all the stuff we do, it\u2019s all, we\u2019re the second person. We\u2019re the people that are finding solutions or finding answers.\u00a0 That little nugget that he gave me probably when I was ten or eleven years old and I repeated it a few times throughout my childhood, has meant the world to me.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the first one, I\u2019ll repeat that. There are two types of people, people who find problems and people who find solutions. Make sure you\u2019re the type of person who finds solutions. So that was number one, which is so cool on so many different levels. So there you go.</p> <p>Number two, this is a lesson that was a lot more subtle, and I guess it was a lesson at first I thought was more of a guilt trip, but man it worked. My parents were really good at giving us chores and making sure that we worked and were producers inside of our family. It wasn\u2019t like we didn\u2019t have work to do, which I\u2019m grateful for, I hated it at the time, but love it now. So one Saturday, as they\u2019re giving out the chores to everyone, for the Saturday day, my chore was to go and clean his car. So I went and I washed the outside of it, and I washed the inside of it. I\u2019m spraying the windows, doing all that kind of stuff, and then I came in to my dad and said, \u201cOkay dad I\u2019m done. Do you want to come look at it?\u201d and he looked at me and said, I can\u2019t remember exactly, but basically he said, cause I asked him, \u201cYou want to come look at it and make sure it\u2019s good and I can be done?\u201d and he said, \u201cAre you proud of it?\u201d and I go, \u201cAm I proud of it?\u201d He said, \u201cIf you\u2019re proud of it, then you\u2019re done.\u201d And I remember thinking, huh, am I proud of this? I was thinking in my head, I know that I cut corners, I was trying to get done so I could go goof off. He\u2019s like, if you\u2019re proud of it, you\u2019re done. I remember thinking, I\u2019m like,\u00a0 \u201clet me go check again dad. I\u2019m going to go back and check.\u201d So I went back again and I started looking around and I realized that I wasn\u2019t that proud of it. I had just gone halfway and did a couple of things, so I went back in the car and I did it right. I did it in a spot where I was proud of it. I came back and I said, \u201cDad I\u2019m done. Do you want to come look?\u201d He said, \u201cAre you proud of it?\u201d I said, \u201cI am.\u201d And he said, \u201cOkay then you\u2019re done.\u201d He didn\u2019t even have to look at it, he knew if I was proud of it that I had done it. And I think that, again another lesson that served me my whole life. I look at what I do in wrestling, in business, in parenting, in all the different things that comes back to me. \u201cAre you proud of it. Did you do a good enough job that you are proud of it, and if you did then you\u2019re done. If not, then go back and do it til you\u2019re proud of it.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, just kind of a little thing that has meant the world to me. There you go, there\u2019s two amazing lessons from my dad. He\u2019s just an amazing guy, amazing entrepreneur, amazing father, amazing friend. Someone I look up to. I\u2019m excited next week to spend some time with him, it\u2019s going to be amazing. Hopefully those lessons that have meant so much to me have meant a lot to you as well. It\u2019s something you guys can take from this podcast. Alright guys that\u2019s it for today, I\u2019m at the office. Got an amazing day today, and I\u2019m excited.

Alright, everybody today you\u2019re going on a different trip with me. We\u2019re not going home from the office, we\u2019re not even going to the office. We are heading to get my haircut. Yes, my head is starting to swell. I\u2019ve got really thick, I\u2019ve got a fat head just to start out with, and then I\u2019ve got really thick hair on top of that, and it just keeps getting thicker and thicker, so as my hair keeps growing, the size of my head actually looks bigger to the point where it gets hard, and I\u2019ve got a thick neck from wrestling, but it gets hard to hold my head up. I\u2019m just kidding.</p> <p>I remember, you guys have all seen So I Married an Axe Murderer, one of my favorite movies ever. There\u2019s the kid with the huge afro, he keeps watching TV and he keeps sitting in front of them. Mike Meyers playing his dad in front of the TV is yelling at his head. He\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s like an orange on a toothpick.\u201d I always thought that was funny, and I feel like that today. My head is like an orange on a toothpick, so I\u2019m going to go get it chopped down to normal size, which would be super cool. Then I\u2019ll be able to function better.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m going to tell you guys all my personal drama as a kid growing up, when I was a kid growing up\u2026.everyone in my family has really thick hair, actually my brother, Scott who edits these audios so he\u2019ll probably hear this, he\u2019s got the thickest hair of my family. Just insane, I remember we used to drive down the street and he\u2019d stick his head out the window, and be going crazy. He\u2019s like, \u201cCheck out my hair guys.\u201d And he\u2019d pull back in and be like, thunk, and he\u2019d just sit there, like this big shell. So yes, his is the thickest. Mine\u2019s right behind it, just thick hair. So growing up I was embarrassed because I didn\u2019t know how to comb my hair, I never combed it. It was always just this helmet on my head. Even my parents didn\u2019t know how to style it. So I was subconscious about it my whole life, In junior high, my first couple of days of junior high someone was like, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t comb your hair?\u201d And then I\u2019m just like, as a junior high kid, I\u2019m just devastated and scared and all these things wrapped into one. So I start combing my hair, but it\u2019s not like me getting a comb and combing it. It was trauma. I\u2019d have to wake up two hours earlier, I\u2019d go in there and put gel in my hair, but my hair is so thick you can\u2019t part it, so with a mountain full of gel, put all these gel in it, and I\u2019d part my hair, and it always looked horrible. I had to make a cool wave in the front, and I\u2019d blow dry it until it would get hard as a rock, because of all the gel in it, it would harden and crunch. I\u2019d get the big old girl brush, and I\u2019d break it out and it would just stay with the part. But I always hated it, and it looked so horrible, but I\u2019d go to school after two hours every day of trying to do my hair so it looked normal. And I was just like\u2026.if someone would bump me my whole, my turkey tail in the back would pop up, boom. And it would just be horrible right. It was so socially, I would have extreme anxiety every day that someone might bump me and my hair would pop out of place and I looked like an idiot. That\u2019s what I did because some punk kid told me I needed to comb my hair.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my childhood drama.\u00a0 I know, I lived a horrible life, that was the worst of it all. But it was tough for me. So there\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m telling you guys this. Fast forward now to 9th grade, no 10th grade, I\u2019m wrestling, which just makes your hair get even bigger, right. It\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s just huge. So I go to wrestling practice and come out and it\u2019s just like my head\u2019s twice the size of the rest of my body. It\u2019s horrible, so everyone\u2019s kind of making fun of me all the time. So finally that summer I shaved my head. Shaved it off. The next morning I woke up and didn\u2019t have to comb it, didn\u2019t have to do anything. I remember as it started to grow back, I kept shaving it off, shaving it off. Then one day I realized I had more self confidence having a shaved head. I had more excitement, more happiness, more everything. So I shaved my head every week, or every other week, for probably 10 or 15 years. I feel like, kind of like in the bible, you know the story of Sampson and he\u2019s got hair and if you cut it he becomes weak. I felt the opposite. As soon as I cut my hair I became this strong person again. So I cut my hair for forever, and it gave me the confidence I needed to be able to become a wrestler, all the other things in my life. And my hair was this limiting factor and it\u2019s funny because I think 5 or 6 years ago, maybe a little longer, my wife\u2019s like, \u201cYou should grow your hair out, I think it\u2019d look good.\u201d So I did, and when I did it was weird, when I grew it out I became super self conscious about my hair, about everything. I was like this is not good, this is ruining me. So finally I figured out a way to do it where it\u2019s easy, it looks alright, doesn\u2019t look great, but it\u2019s like whatever, I look fine. And now I\u2019m okay with it.</p> <p>But it took me a couple of months to get to that point where I was okay with it. I was literally hiding because I was so embarrassed of my hair. And another problem is, my head is so fat, I can\u2019t wear normal hats. I always tell people that and they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, whatever try this hat on.\u201d I put the hat on and they\u2019re like, \u2018Whoa, your head is really fat.\u201dI\u2019m like, \u201cI know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. I can\u2019t wear a normal hat. I\u2019m not a normal person. My head is just thick.\u201d There you go. There\u2019s my drama.</p> <p>The reason why I\u2019m sharing with you guys, is because as stupid as little things like that are, they have a huge impact. I can\u2019t even tell you how hard it was to function in school because of my stupid hair. Even when I started growing it, I was embarrassed to go to the office, and to do videos and all these kind of things that were brought up because of that. Why did I tell you guys that? I don\u2019t really know other than, when I feel comfortable I can do more stuff with myself. It can be a lot of things. It could be your looks, it could be you weight, it could be your clothes. Whatever those things are. You know, I know that\u2026..I don\u2019t want to sound like a jerk, so I\u2019m trying to phrase this carefully.</p> <p>When I buy clothes that I like, that I fit well and I feel comfortable, I do better. I\u2019m not a suit and tie guy. I can\u2019t stand a suit, I can\u2019t stand a tie, I can\u2019t suit jackets, I can\u2019t stand all those kind of things. I can\u2019t even stand shoes and socks, like I wear bare feet all winter long, because I feel more comfortable. I think a lot of times we try to put on a suit or uniform or something to impress other people right. And there\u2019s a place and a time for that. I go to church, I dress up, I dress nice. If I was to go get a job interview, I\u2019d dress nice. There\u2019s time\u2019s to dress nice. But there\u2019s times that are functional times, when you\u2019re trying to get things done, and accomplish things and move things forward. And you\u2019re trying to be an entrepreneur and your trying to run\u00a0 all these\u00a0 kind of things. I really think that these little barriers that are in our way can actually slow us down and hurt us. It\u2019s kind of interesting. I remember, if you listen to my podcasts for a while, you know my stories. But back when we had our big office with 100 employees, the guy that ran the sales floor, he liked dressing up, so he made guys dress up nice every single day, and on Friday they\u2019d have a casual day. I was like, that\u2019s kind of cool, but I wanted to flip it, so I\u2019d have casual day everyday and on Friday everyone would dress up. And I remember for probably 2 or 3 months, I\u2019d wear a shirt and a tie and everything, and everyone did. We looked good, but I remember hating it. I hated it so bad. I was so miserable and I remember one day, I\u2019m trying to put this stupid tie on, I\u2019m tying it and I\u2019m like, I hate this. Why am I doing this. I created this business, I shouldn\u2019t have to do this if I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t think anyone else is enjoying it. Let\u2019s just not do it. Let\u2019s all just be comfortable. If we\u2019re comfortable we can all just do our thing and get stuff done. So I\u2019m a big believer in that.</p> <p>So I would say, sit back and next time at your desk, or wherever you do your work, sit there for a second and just notice what it\u2019s\u00a0 like. What parts are comfortable. Are your shoes really comfortable? They are cool, but take them off and put on sandals like I do. If you are wearing slacks and you\u2019re like, these are\u2026.. or jeans or whatever. My kids hate jeans, I love jeans. I would sleep in them if my wife didn\u2019t think that was weird. But my kids hate jeans, so why make them wear jeans if they want to wear basketball shorts every day, even in the winter. It\u2019s comfortable, if they\u2019re comfortable they\u2019re going to perform at a higher level.</p> <p>The thing about that. I think about for me for weight a lot of times. Day\u2019s when I eat healthy and I do good, I feel better. But some days I don\u2019t and I see my stomach or my double chin or whatever those things are and I\u2019m like, those things make me self conscious and they keep me from producing. Even on the small subconscious level. I might not want to get on the phone with someone, or talk to someone, or do a webinar or go to a seminar or whatever, because I don\u2019t feel comfortable. And again, it could be any feature. Your hair, I\u2019m really like, the last three days I haven\u2019t done a Periscope. Guess why. Guess why this is a Marketing In Your Car and not a Periscope. Because my head looks like an orange on a toothpick, it looks horrible to me. So because of that, I\u2019m not producing at my highest level. It\u2019s these stupid little things that don\u2019t matter at all, except they matter so much because it keeps you from doing what you want to do.</p> <p>I guess my message for today, and maybe it\u2019s like the dumbest message of my entire, however many episodes we\u2019ve done, but I think it\u2019s important to be comfortable. You can\u2019t produce if you\u2019re not in a comfortable spot. I\u2019m talking about weight, I\u2019m talking about how you look, I\u2019m talking about how you feel. I\u2019m talking about the clothes you wear, the chair you\u2019re in, your surroundings. All those kinds of things have huge, a little tiny impact, but they compound and they become really, really huge. And when you have all those things together, it can keep you back from doing what you need to do. We\u2019re entrepreneurs. We\u2019re on a mission, we have something we\u2019re trying to do and trying to accomplish. And people\u2019s lives we\u2019re trying to change. So all those little things are friction points, they keep you from moving forward. So I think a big thing is next time you guys are sitting there working, is to stop and become aware. How am I feeling? Do I feel awkward, do I feel weird, do I feel good? How do you actually feel and then try to figure out how to break off those friction points.</p> <p>For me it was as simple, I stopped wearing socks. It was just like, this is the dumbest thing, but when I wear socks, they compress on your feet, so you take your socks off, and there\u2019s that sock line. I hate it cause you go to someone\u2019s house, and you take your shoes off and maybe your socks stink, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh crap. Let me take my socks off.\u201d And you do and you get that sock compression. All these issues that seem so dumb that happen in a split of a millisecond in your head, but all those things keep you from producing and performing at your highest level. When I flipped it off and got flip flops, and I don\u2019t have that issue anymore. It just magically disappears. Again, it\u2019s so dumb. Some of you guys are rolling your eyes. Are you serious Russell? You have OCD like I never even knew.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about getting rid of any resistance to me performing at my highest level. So become aware of those things. It\u2019s interesting, I was, this is a long time ago, I was listening to a Matt Fury course about productivity and about, I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was, but he was talking about how changing your environment, your atmosphere, how much it changes things. For example, next time you go in your office, just move something. Move your desk or move your monitor, move something and notice how it feels. It feels different right? There\u2019s a whole study about Fung Shei, and I don\u2019t know anything about it, but I know it has to do with that same kind of concept. It\u2019s just like, if you start becoming aware of it, how are these little things all effecting me, and if you start tweaking them and changing them and moving them around, then it can have a really big impact long term. So there you go.</p> <p>There\u2019s the message from the OCD Russell. I\u2019m just excited because in 7 minutes from now, my hair will be chopped back down to size and I will be able to get back to work on things that are important. Move our mission and our message forward. So there you go guys. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at today. I\u2019m now officially at the hair cutting place. I almost just t-boned this lady, that would have been bad. So that\u2019s it for today guys. I appreciate you all.

Alright, my friends. I\u2019m just leaving Fred Meyer right now, with a bag of grocery store sushi at 9:15 at night. While I was in the grocery store a thought came to my head and this is the message for today.</p> <p>The thought was, it\u2019s not good for man to be alone. It is true. Man, I\u2019m almost getting in a wreck in the parking lot. So this is what I mean by that. Oh crap. Sorry, \u00a0late night parking lots is like bumper cars almost out here. So this week I was really excited because4 my wife and kids were leaving as you know. I was like, \u201csweet I can finally get some stuff done, this is going to be amazing. I cannot wait to catch up and get some stuff done.\u201d So they left yesterday as you know, I was at the office til 4am, when you guys got my message about getting choked out. I have no idea if that was even coherent at all. Today, I passed out, had an alarm, my alarm went off at 5 minutes to 8, jumped up had a call at 8 o\u2019clock, then went and passed back out again. Actually drank some ketone, then passed back out again. Woke up at about 1 o\u2019clock today, got to editing my book. Spent the next 5 or 6 hours editing the book. Then I was so excited because I got all this stuff done, it\u2019s looking amazing, I\u2019m proud of it and everything that I wanted to celebrate, and I got up and I looked around and nobody was there to celebrate with me. I was like, crap, what good is doing something awesome if there\u2019s no one to celebrate with. So I voxed my wife and told and she voxed me back and forth, that was fun. Then I voxed my friends, then I voxed everyone who might even care a little bit. I\u2019m celebrating with them because I\u2019m so excited something cool happened.</p> <p>And that was good, at least there were some people that would give me some feedback. Then I was like, \u201cI need to get out of here for a little bit.\u201d So I went in the backyard, went in the weight room and just threw some weights around, had a good time out there. Then our pool, we opened our pool, even though it\u2019s way to cold to open the pool, we thought, you know what, why not? Let\u2019s just do it. So we opened up the pool and the heater is trying to warm it, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s warm or not. So I looked and it said 76, I\u2019m like, \u201cDude that\u2019s amazing.\u201d And I opened the top and I put my foot in the shallow end, and I\u2019m like, \u201cit\u2019s warm water, I\u2019m going swimming right now.\u201d So I opened the pool, go to the diving board, dive off, and I found out that like the top two feet of the water is 76 degrees, and everything below that is freezing, freezing, freezing cold. I jumped into this nice warm, hot pool, and then it turns into sheer freezing-ness, stabbing my whole body. Which is probably good from a bio-hacking stand point, I\u2019m guessing. I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>But I immediately jump out of the pool. As I\u2019m jumping out I come back through this warmth. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know what to do, it\u2019s cold, its warm. It\u2019s really confusing, right. I get out and I\u2019m laughing and all this stuff, looking around and there\u2019s nobody there. And I\u2019m like, dangit. So I voxed my wife, \u201cHey, I just jumped in the pool.\u201d I\u2019m telling people, I\u2019m making podcasts. I\u2019m trying to get other people engaged. It\u2019s just thing after thing, after thing. I realized that as excited as I was to have my own alone and get stuff done and be home alone and be able to have time to work and focus, all those kinds of things. I\u2019m so so so grateful that it\u2019s just for a finite amount of time. I was sitting in the pool like, I wish my kids were here. As I was celebrating my book, I wish my wife was there. As I get every step along the way and the thing going through my head is it\u2019s not good for man to be alone. We need people around us to celebrate. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of anything we\u2019re doing?</p> <p>If you can\u2019t, I mean, It\u2019s not much fun. So I was thinking about that, it\u2019s true in life, but it\u2019s also true in business. I was solo entrepreneur for a long, long time, I think when I started surrounding myself with other people on my team, my employees and my friends and all these kinds of things. And my partners and all that kind of stuff, that\u2019s when business became more fun for me. It wasn\u2019t just me celebrating, \u201cLook at this amazing stuff that I did.\u201d It was \u201cLook at this amazing that we did, that we accomplished.\u201d It just changed it. So for you what I\u2019m thinking is, I know we got a lot of solo entrepreneurs on here, but you\u2019ve got to find someone to celebrate with. It can be a spouse, it can be a friend, can be a family member, can be an employee, can be a partner, can be a something. But if you don\u2019t have that around, I\u2019m guessing that that might be why you are struggling a little bit. Because today, it\u2019s 9:20 at night, I haven\u2019t had dinner yet. I just barely showered.</p> <p>People around you is a good thing and it moves you forward and keeps you doing amazing stuff. That was my message for today. So anyway, it\u2019s not good for man to be alone and I\u2019m excited my wife and my amazing kids will be back tomorrow, and I cannot wait. I miss them and it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun. Then next week, I\u2019ll be back on with the team and we\u2019ll be able to celebrate all of our victories and our wins together and it\u2019ll be amazing. So that\u2019s what we got. In fact, one thing we started doing is Friday\u2019s we do Marketing meetings. We have different divisions right. We have programming, our support teams, all these different things, and I kind of focus on the marketing side. So Friday at the end of the day we have a marketing meeting, we kind of, \u201cHere\u2019s all the cool stuff that happened this week, and here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing next week.\u201d So we all have a focused motivation and a focused effort for that coming week we\u2019re running towards. And it always gives us a chance to talk about it Friday so that all weekend long your thinking about how to make that better and cooler and all that kind of stuff. Anyway, that\u2019s one of my favorite parts of Friday. We all get together and brag about our wins, celebrate a little bit. It keeps us all going for another week.</p> <p>Find someone to celebrate with. If you don\u2019t have it, let me know. I can celebrate with you. Message me on Facebook and I will celebrate with you. But we need to be celebrating because otherwise what\u2019s the point? Seriously. Alright, I\u2019m home and back in the garage. I\u2019m going back in. I\u2019ve got another 10 chapters of my book or so to plow through tonight before my kids get back home. Then I\u2019ll get back to normal. I gotta teach at church tomorrow, so I got to plan a lesson tonight still as well. But I just drank some caffeine ketones so I may be up for\u2026.till church tomorrow, who knows. We will see. Alright guys, have an amazing day. I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m going to have my grocery store sushi, my ketones, I figures carb and a ketone, just negates itself and makes me feel good, we\u2019ll find out soon. Thanks everybody, have a nice night and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_204.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1457381249, "title": "Episode #203 \u2013 What It Feels Like To Get Choked Out", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Late night ramblings about business and Jiu Jitsu.</p> <p>On this special late night episode Russell talks about what he got done during his late night and what\u2019s coming up.

Welcome to a very, very late night Marketing In Your Car. Alright everybody, how are you doing tonight? It\u2019s probably not tonight for you right now, but for me it is 4:20am, and I\u2019m just leaving the office. It\u2019s raining and cold out here. Dang. Anyway, I\u2019ve had a great night; I\u2019ve gotten so much stuff done. This doesn\u2019t happen very often and it\u2019s not something I want to happen very often, but every once in a while, it\u2019s kind of nice. My kids had school off on Friday, but I had a coaching call on today so I couldn\u2019t go and play with them, and my wife wanted to go down to her family\u2019s house a couple of hours south from here, so she packed up the kids this morning, and she went down there. And she\u2019s going to be down there today and tomorrow, and then she\u2019ll get back on Sunday. So Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So Friday was today and I worked a normal day, and then she booked a massage for me. What a great wife, she knows my birthday is coming up and she knows I love massages. So basically they were gone, I got done working the day, I went and got massaged and the lady who gave me the massage was amazing. One of the best massages I\u2019ve ever had ever, and I\u2019m a pretty picky, high maintenance massage dude, so that says a lot. And then I got done and then I slammed a big old thing of Ignite, which is one of our supplements that makes it so that you don\u2019t have to sleep.</p> <p>Oh man, I\u2019m seeing Jack In The Box and I\u2019m craving Jack In The Box. I can\u2019t believe they are open at 4 in the morning. Do I go or do I not go? The voices in my head want jack in the box. Anyway, I passed it, I didn\u2019t do it. There we got, we\u2019re going home. So anyway, oh yeah, so I drank my Ignite, got back in the office and boom, put in another 8 hour shift. That\u2019s awesome. So that was cool so I was working on finishing the new Clickfunnels sales letter, which is I\u2019m so proud of. It\u2019s amazing, I think, I think, I think. So I\u2019m excited for that, it\u2019s going to be going live next week. And then worked on the Clickfunnels affiliate program, redesigning all the pages, the affiliate platform the whole thing there. Then I worked on the Funnel Script affiliate program because everyone\u2019s been begging us. And then got a whole bunch of pre-stuff done for copywriters, got 20 banner ads designed, a whole bunch of really, really exciting, amazing things.</p> <p>So yesterday, I think I told you guys, I had the laziest day where I did nothing, today I\u2019ve already worked two 8 hour shifts and both days crushed it so that was nice. 4:23 right now, heading home, going to pass out. I have a call with Jim, my partner in Funnel Script, Jim Edwards, at 8am, so we\u2019re at like 3 and \u00bd hours from now. Gonna pass out for a couple of hours, wake up talk to him, pass out again, and wake up. And then tomorrow, I\u2019ve got a really exciting project, well I\u2019ve got to finish a couple of things first. The Funnel University affiliate platform, and what else is happening? Funnel University affiliate platform, oh, and then a couple of front end offers for Clickfunnels, gotta get those all keyed up and working better again. Getting ready for affiliates. We\u2019re trying to, I think I told you guys before, but we\u2019re trying to get a whole bunch of ways affiliates can promote Clickfunnels, that aren\u2019t Russell doing a live webinar. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>Anyway, so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re working on, and then tomorrow, some of you guys know Expert Secrets first draft has been done, it\u2019s been done about a month, and I\u2019ve been slacking because there\u2019s so many things happening, and I have not had a chance to go through it. But tomorrow I\u2019m going to try to go through the whole thing for a couple of reasons, one of the big one\u2019s is, I was trying to get the book done before the live event, but it\u2019s physically impossible now, but at the live event I\u2019m going to be teaching most of the core concepts that are in the book. I\u2019m going to be showing the 7 different expert funnels, the progression between them and how it all works. So by getting the book done, it\u2019ll also, in return help me get all my slides done, because I got to get all the sketches and all the doodles done, just like the Dotcom Secrets book to match all the chapters. So I\u2019ll get all those done which will be the majority of my slides. Then I just got to get tons of examples and case studies for my presentation. So It\u2019s going to get me propelling forward, which will be really, really good.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening over here. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I love it when I can just work hard like that. It\u2019s so fun. I was going to try to go all the way until my call at 8am, but then about 4 o\u2019clock, things started getting a little hazy, a little blurry. I was like, okay, it\u2019s time to tap out. It\u2019s\u00a0 kind of like, for those of you guys who have ever done Jiu Jitsu, and you get choked out. I remember the very first Jiu Jitsu tournament I\u2019d ever been to, I didn\u2019t even know what Jiu Jitsu was. I was literally flying home from a speaking gig in Las Vegas, and on the plane was one of my wrestling buddies from Boise\u00a0 State, and I\u00a0 was like, \u201cHey man, what\u2019s going on.\u201d It was Southwest, so we got to sit by each other, so we\u2019re sitting by each other. We\u2019re flying and I\u2019m like, \u201cso what are you up to?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cI live in Vegas now, I do Jiu Jitsu and I fight,\u201d I don\u2019t remember if it was UFC, he was one of my JV wrestlers at Boise state, he wrestled behind me. I was like, \u201cReally? That sounds crazy, I can\u2019t believe you do fights and stuff, a lot of it\u2019s just Jiu Jitsu.\u201d And I\u2019d heard the word Jiu Jitsu, but I didn\u2019t know what it was, I assumed it meant kicking and boxing and stuff and I was like, \u201cI could never do it man, I can\u2019t take a punch to the face, I\u2019m kind of a girl.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo man, Jiu Jitsu is like wrestling for old fat guys.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really laid back and slow. It\u2019s really, really easy to do, doesn\u2019t take a lot of energy.\u201d And I was like, \u201cAre you kidding me, I\u2019m in.\u201d I got home and one of my friends I knew who did Jiu Jitsu, I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I want to Jiu Jitsu, because I heard it\u2019s like wrestling for old, fat guys.\u201d And he was like, \u201cOh, well there\u2019s actually a tournament this weekend, you should come to it.\u201d I was like, \u201calright, I\u2019ll go wrestle a bunch o fold, fat guys. I have no idea what Jiu Jitsu even is. So the night before the tournament, I went to one practice, where I learned that Jiu Jitsu is not wrestling, it\u2019s similar, but it\u2019s definitely not wrestling. And that was my experience before I did my first Jiu Jitsu tournament, was like one 2 hour practice.</p> <p>And the guy that was coaching me, during that practice had learned Jiu Jitsu from watching Youtube, he\u2019d never actually practiced it or done it either. Looking back, it was a really bad idea, but I had no idea. I don\u2019t know if this is actually really funny, or if I\u2019m just so tired, I\u2019m delirious. So my Jiu Jitsu coach/youtube expert teaches me some Jiu Jitsu that he learned, we go the next day to the thing and they\u2019re like, \u201cyou need a gi.\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what a gi is.\u201d, and they\u2019re like, \u201cIt\u2019s those white things that look like pajamas.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh cool.\u201d So I didn\u2019t have a gi so I went and I found some dude, I\u2019m like, \u201cHey can I borrow your gi.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cSure.\u201d So he gives me this gi and I put it on. I can\u2019t figure out how to tie the belt, which becomes a big nuisance later, when they won\u2019t raise your hand until your belts been tied, which I didn\u2019t realize at the time, another long story. So I go out there, all I know is its like wrestling, but I got to try to choke the dude afterwards. So I go in there, I double leg this guy, pick him up, boom slam him down. Then I pick him up again, and boom, and I\u2019m just thrashing him. I also learned a knee on belly, so if I put my knee on their belly, I get three points. So I\u2019m doing knee on belly, let him go, pick him up slam him down, over and over. So I\u2019m destroying this dude, I think it\u2019s 9 or 10 points to nothing. And then all the sudden he grabs my gi and folds it across my neck and everything starts going blurry. In wrestling when you get pinned it\u2019s frustrating, but the ref looks at your shoulder blades and says, \u201cOh you\u2019re pinned.\u201d and he slaps the mat. And you\u2019re like, \u201cNo way, you screwed me.\u201d Or whatever, you get all mad. And that\u2019s kind of what we do in wrestling. In Jiu Jitsu, there\u2019s no ref that slaps the mat, the ref sits there and looks at you and watches as your face turns purple and your eyes starts bulging, and the ref thinking, \u201cYou moron, it\u2019s time to tap or you\u2019re going to die.\u201d Now for me, I\u2019d never experienced being choked out before, so I didn\u2019t know what it was like. All I knew is that all the sudden the lights start going dim, everything is getting confusing, and I\u2019m getting\u2026.everything is kind of blurring out, and it\u2019s just like\u2026.it\u2019s not pleasurable. I\u2019m like, you know what, I can fight this. And I remember thinking that and then things started getting blurrier and darker, and I was like, I don\u2019t know if I can fight this. And then It got to the point where in my head I\u2019m like, I would rather die than tap out. And then about one second later, I thought I\u2019m about to die, so I tapped out.</p> <p>I just remember that was a horrible, horrible experience. I would much rather have a referee pin me, than me tap out, because it\u2019s basically when you tap out, it\u2019s you saying, \u201cI\u2019m a wuss, this dude\u2019s tougher than me, I give up.\u201d And it\u2019s literally the worst feeling on planet earth. So that was my first match. So afterwards, my youtube Jiu Jitsu buddy is like, \u201cHey when they grab your collar, you gotta do this thing.\u201d So I try to learn this thing, go to the next match and I think I beat the next two or three guys, and I end up taking third and I got a big old medal. Then they had no gi and so I call me wife, I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I won a couple of matches.\u201d And at this point I think I\u2019m invincible right, because I learned how to not get choked in the gi.</p> <p>So round 2 now, is no gi. I call my wife, \u201cYou should come check it out. I\u2019m really good at Jiu Jitsu, it turns out.\u201d So she comes and watches me, first match I wrestle this guy. Same thing, I go out there, beating him, doing really good. Then I pick him up, double leg and I slam him down in the ground. In wrestling, we take someone and we cover their body with your head and neck and everything. In Jiu Jitsu you don\u2019t, that\u2019s how you set up a triangle lock. So I do this amazing take down and it ends up with me and no oxygen to my brain, tapping out once again. I tried to fight it as long as I could because once again my pride is saying I\u2019d rather die than getting tapped out, until you realize you will die unless you tap out. It was pretty awesome. So I tap out then, and then the second match same thing. Beating the guy, beating the guys, Boom double leg him, sets up a triangle, locks me out and I tap out. So that was my very first Jiu Jitsu experience.</p> <p>Prior to that point in my life, I assumed that I could hang with most people, from my wrestling background and career. And at that po9int I realized there are people that know things that I don\u2019t know and they can kill me. So that\u2019s when I started to learn Jiu Jitsu and spent the next couple of years learning that. Anyway, that is my Jiu Jitsu story. I don\u2019t even know why I told you that. Oh, I remember why, because I felt like I lost oxygen to my brain when I working tonight. Just like I did in Jiu Jitsu. That\u2019s how all these stories come together. Anyway guys, I\u2019m home. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m going to go to bed. I hope you guys have an amazing day. Work hard, have some fun, remember this is a game. It\u2019s not that important when all is said and done, it\u2019s just a lot of fun. But what really matters is your family. So I\u2019m excited for my family to get back here in a day or so. Next week\u2019s my birthday, so I\u2019m taking a day off to just play with them. It\u2019s going to be awesome; I\u2019m really excited for it.

I don\u2019t know though. I\u2019m going to describe it and then let me know if that\u2019s how the real world works. I hope it\u2019s not, if it is, it kind of sucks. I kind of had a glimpse today, so I hope it\u2019s not.</p> <p>So usually I wake up and I\u2019m just like super fired up and excited and all sorts of stuff. I just\u2026anyway, the last couple of weeks have been kind of crazy.\u00a0 A lot of stuff happening, in the next 3 weeks, 4 weeks for our live event. Which if you haven\u2019t got your tickets yet, go to funnelhacking.com. Play and pitch play and pitch. Same thing, just a lot of pressure, it\u2019s just been kind of tough. I\u2019m usually fine, I can balance it. I get in this state, I go, I move, I work and its fun. Just had some kind of annoying things happen on my side, just things that I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of just disappointed by or whatever.</p> <p>So this morning I woke up, and I didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. I don\u2019t normally feel that, but I assume that\u2019s how a lot of people feel. You always hear, \u201cI hate Mondays.\u201d Or whatever and I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s how it is. But I did, I got out of bed, got ready, helped the kids get ready, everything. And then fed them breakfast and said prayers, got them out of the door. And then I walked back in the house, normally I go and jump in the shower, get ready and head out. So I start walking back to my room, and I walked and I saw my bed and I walked past and I stopped and then I went over and I got in bed. I was like, \u201cScrew it. I\u2019m just going back to bed.\u201d And I went back to bed and I laid there for probably like\u2026.and I couldn\u2019t sleep. I wasn\u2019t tired; I just didn\u2019t want to do today. So I just laid there in bed for almost an hour. And then my wife came in that was really good. It was awesome. We just hung out and talked and made me feel better. And I had some big things happening today that I needed to be at the office for.</p> <p>So we had a big Blab hang out, and we ended up having 3,000 people on it. We interviewed Garret White and Liz Benny and Ryan Stewman and it was really, really cool. But then typically when i get to the office, and it\u2019s like go time, boom and I just go go go. And I remember one time reading something and it didn\u2019t make sense to me at the time, but I think I kind of get it now. I think it was actually a TED talk from Jason Freid, the dude that owns 57 Signals and Base Camp. He was talking about the concept of Remote. He wrote a book called Remote as well, which is an awesome book by the way. But he was talking about how if you want to get work done\u2026..if you ask someone, if you get some work done, what do you do. They\u2019re like \u201cI come to the office earlier, or I stay late, or I work from home.\u201d But they never said they get work done at work. Work is not typically a place people get work done, I guess apparently.</p> <p>And then, I can\u2019t remember if it was there or something else, but someone said, the average person works 8 hours a day, but they only actually work 2 hours a day or something like that. I remember it didn\u2019t make sense to me. Really? That\u2019s weird.</p> <p>Today was kind of like the extension of after I got out of bed and I finally got to the office. I had two big things. I had a recording I was doing for a webinar and I had the Blab. And normally I sit at my desk and it\u2019s just Boom! Go time and I just go, go, go until it\u2019s next thing I know it\u2019s the end of the day and I got to go home and play with my kids. And today was more like, what I assume most people deal with. You just don\u2019t want to deal with the thing, you should but it\u2019s going to take all this effort to start it, and I don\u2019t really want to start it, and then I look at the clock and it\u2019s like 45 minutes til the next thing. I can start this thing, but I\u2019m not going to be able to get much done on it, so instead I\u2019ll just go to Facebook, and I was totally\u2026..It was amazing. And today sucked from a productivity standpoint. I did the two things that I had to do and that was about it. I got a couple little things done but, not very much.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m heading home, and I\u2019m going to get, actually I decided I\u2019m going to go home, we\u2019re going to have junk food, I\u2019m going to sit and watch a movie with the kids tonight, we\u2019re going to keep them up even though it\u2019s a school night, we\u2019re going to jump in the hot tub. I\u2019m not doing a normal night tonight, I just don\u2019t want to. I want to do a night that I would want to do when I was a teenager. I\u2019m doing that tonight because I want to, I\u2019m going to. So there you go, you can\u2019t stop me.</p> <p>But anyway, it\u2019s just kind of interesting. I\u2019m allowing myself today to feel that way, and tomorrow I won\u2019t ever again. Well, maybe someday I will but not for a long, long time because I didn\u2019t really like it, I felt kind of crappy the whole time and uninspired and I didn\u2019t feel like I was really moving things forward. But I did get on the Blab. That was really fun actually, that was cool. Those guys are all awesome, they really inspired me. That was cool.</p> <p>But I felt that way so I just wanted to record this message for a couple of reasons. One to document it for myself. Like, Wow, if you enter the day in a bad state that can kind of destroy your whole day. And literally I probably got 2 hours of work done today. Where on a typical day I would say, some people are like, how any hours a day do you work? I\u2019m like 8. And how much work do you actually get done? I\u2019m like, 8 hours worth. Typically I get 8 hours of stuff done in an 8 hour day and today was closer to the 2 that most people get. Anyway it was kind of interesting, so I\u2019m documenting it for myself, and then for you guys too, to start thinking about that for yourselves. How many hours a day are you actually working? When you\u2019re working are you working or doing what I was doing today which is not necessarily working. Anyway, it\u2019s kind of interesting. You know we only have so many hours in a day and none of us spend enough time at home with our families and things like that. And I think that part of it is cause we\u2019re too busy at work not working and doing whatever.</p> <p>So I think if all of us can start focusing more and getting more done during the day, we can work half days and get twice as much stuff done. At least I think so. That\u2019s my theory after today. So you\u2019re allowed one per year that was my one. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to kick my own butt, get back and stay. We\u2019re going to go hard and fast cause we got a lot to do. But just wanted to kind of document that and let you guys know that every once in a while, even I crash and just can\u2019t even function, and it does kind of feel good. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m really excited to just veg out and eat junk. So I\u2019m going to do it and nobody can stop me. So there you go.</p> <p>This is probably the anti\u2026.the opposite of an inspiring podcast. It\u2019s the truth for today. There you go. I got nothing else. I\u2019m almost home and I\u2019m excited, it\u2019s kind of rainy and sunny, so I think we\u2019re going to get a rainbow, which is cool. A cool way to end out the day. Oh there it is. Holy cow there\u2019s a rainbow. Well look at that. Alright, there you go guys, we got a rainbow shining down on us, what can go wrong when there\u2019s a rainbow. Alright I appreciate you all. Have an amazing time and I\u2019ll talk to you guys on the next episode of marketing in your car.</p>", "duration": "08:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_202.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1456787850, "title": "Episode #201 \u2013 Hanging Out With Alex Mandossian", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A meeting I\u2019m excited for, as well as some random things I did not learn from my friends.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about meeting with his mentor, Alex Mandossian, and the stuff he learned from him.

Hey guys and gals and anybody else who\u2019s listening to this. Hope you guys are doing awesome. We\u2019re officially past 200, we are 201. We\u2019re like a legit podcast now. I don\u2019t know, now that we have 220 + episodes, there\u2019s not a lot of podcasts that can say. Even though my podcast is not like a normal podcast. It\u2019s more like, me hanging out in my car, hopefully some people like what I got to say. Appreciate you guys for being faithful fans and followers. And we could have never have kept doing it without you guys here. I finally after 200 episodes, I finally have a call to action at the end of the podcast as well. As you will see when this is over, there\u2019s a call to action. I\u2019m totally a legit podcaster now. I went from being this dude in his car driving around talking to himself, to being a legitimate podcaster all within 200 episodes. It only took 3 years. Appreciate you guys all.</p> <p>I\u2019m excited for today, I\u2019m actually going into my office right now to meet with a legend. When I got started in this business, there were a few people that were my mentors, that I looked up to. I\u2019d say, some of the initial ones, it\u2019s crazy it\u2019s back 10 to 12 years ago now, guys like Armand Morin, and Alex Mandossian, and Steven Pierce, all the people that were at Armand\u2019s old big seminars. They were my people, that\u2019s where I learned a lot of stuff initially from. I\u2019m excited because today, Alex Mandossian is flying into Boise, I think he flew in last night, technically, but he\u2019s here today. We\u2019re going to hang out, its\u2019 going to be really fun. I look back at the stuff I learned from Alex, impactful stuff that had a huge directional changes in my business. One of the first higher ticket products that I bought was Teleseminar Secrets, which is his product teaching how to do teleseminars. I remember debating, it\u2019s funny because now I\u2019m always trying to convince people to buy stuff, I remember back in the day, I was making money. I think I was making 10 grand a month or so when he came out with Teleseminar Secrets, and most of my money was coming from teleseminars. I\u2019m like, \u201cI already know teleseminars, Do I buy this thing or do I not. It\u2019s $1,000.\u201d You know all the drama that we go through in our heads when we\u2019re trying to make investments. It seems like a big deal at the time, but later you\u2019re like, it\u2019s $1,000, come on now.</p> <p>I remember Tellman Knudson was like, \u201cHey do you think you could learn one thing from that course to help you make an extra $1000 on one of your teleseminars?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThen why wouldn\u2019t you buy it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cthat\u2019s a good point.\u201d I stood up from the dinner table, walked over and I bought it. That course made me a heck of a lot more than $1000. That was amazing when he had another one called Stick Strategies, which were all these ways that you could get customers to stick longer, which was amazing. He had a report I read one time on a flight and I remember I was flying somewhere and I had this report called Consumption Theory I believe. And it was talking about the importansce of consumption and I think one of the stories he talked about, I think I shared this a little while ago with you guys, it was talking about shampoo companies, PertPlus or I don\u2019t know one of the shampoo companies and they used to have on the back of their bottle, the instructions, maybe they didn\u2019t even have instructions, and then some smart dude added instructions that said, \u201cWash, rinse, repeat\u201d and it went from people who used to shampoo their hair once a week to get the oils out, now it\u2019s like wash them every day, to hey you should wash them multiple times per showers. Consumption.</p> <p>Shampoo went through the roof, and it was all about consumption theory. Getting your customers to consume that product and how important that is and how that is what can fuel everything. It\u2019s\u00a0 funny because recently that\u2019s been a big topic in our company is consumption. How do we get our customers to consume Clickfunnels. The more people who consume Clickfunnels the better, more they\u2019re going to stick longer the more they\u2019re going to be all these kinds of things. My initial thoughts around consumption, what we can do and how we can do it, all came from ten years ago from a report I read on a plane from Alex Mandossian. It\u2019s just kind of crazy, and he is actually here in the office today! I\u2019m exciting. We\u2019re going to be making some promo video for Clickfunnels, he\u2019s doing a big roll out for one of his newproducts and on the back end we\u2019re going to plug in Clickfunnels, it\u2019s going to be really, really cool. I\u2019m excited because I\u2019m totally geeking out. When one of your mentors come into your office, you\u2019re just excited no matter what. But he keeps telling me, \u201cThis time the teacher\u2019s coming as the student. I\u2019m coming to learn from you.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, everything I learned I learned from you guys.\u201d Anyway, I\u2019m just excited. It\u2019s going to be really fun. Hopefully some gold can come out of it. If I get some cool things I\u2019ll share it with you guys tomorrow or tonight or some time.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of one thing that\u2019s happening today that will be really, really fun. I\u2019m excited for it. A couple of other fun things, we did the Funnel Scripts webinar last week. I told you guys about that. It completely crushed it, we closed 45% people online, and it\u2019s been selling like crazy all throughout the weekend, so today\u2019s the last day. I\u2019m pulling down the page today. So we\u2019re doing a big urgency scarcity push and hopefully in the next 18 hours or so we\u2019ll sell a lot more. That\u2019s kind of the goal. For those of you guys whoever follow product launch stuff, there\u2019s Jeff Walker is like the father or product launches, but he had they call it, the Walker W, if you look at the typical product launch. You look at the graph of sales, at first there\u2019s like a spike on launch day,\u00a0 and it goes down a little, usually in the middle it peaks up again, then it drops down, and the last day it peaks up again close to the first day. It looks like a big W, so it\u2019s always called the launch w or the Walker W. Hoping to get the W, otherwise it\u2019s just going to look like an E that tipped over or something like that. Something weird. So hopefully today sales will be close to what we did on day number one, which would be awesome.</p> <p>We have a bunch of other\u2026.anyway, it\u2019s kind of funny, a lot of you guys, I talk about stuff that\u2019s always happening, and I\u2019ve had 5 or 6 people message me, \u201cDude, why didn\u2019t we know about Funnel Scripts before it happened?\u201d I was like, \u201cI guess I haven\u2019t really talked about it on the podcast.\u201d Mostly cause Jim Edwards was doing most of the work behind the scenes on the script and everything, and I just started this week on the webinar pitch, I started on Monday. I mapped out the one thing and the three secrets, Tuesday I ran out of time, and Wednesday I put together the presentation following The Perfect Webinar Script. Which, guess what guys? It still works, in case you\u2019re wondering. I\u2019ve had people tell me this week, \u201cIf everyone is using it, it won\u2019t work anymore\u201d. I was like, \u201cDude, if everyone just copies my slides it won\u2019t work anymore, but if you listen to what I\u2019m saying, \u00a0you understand the one thing and the three secrets and how to do the stack and how to create an amazing offer, it will always work.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of funny, when I was speaking at a Tony Robbins event in Fiji, this is probably, how many years ago now? It\u2019s before Aiden was born, he\u2019s five, so probably six or seven years ago. I was in Fiji speaking at a Tony Robbins event. You know he\u2019s friends with Frank Kern and all these guys like that and they must have said something about squeeze pages and they weren\u2019t working anymore. I remember at the event I talked about landing pages and how to get opt-in\u2019s and how to follow up and that kind of stuff that was ground breaking for people especially seven years ago. And after I got offstage, tony came up, \u201cThanks, by the way, is it true that squeeze pages don\u2019t work anymore and that soon they\u2019re going to be non-existent?\u201d I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d I kind of laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t know which of your guru buddies told you that, but that is definitely not true. Yeah, crappy squeeze pages will always get crappy opt-ins. But great squeeze pages and great hooks and curiosity based headlines will always work, until people stop being curious they will continue to work for forever.\u201d It kind of made me laugh. It\u2019s kind of like when videos first came out, I\u2019m going to get in trouble for teasing all my friends now, this is when video first kind of came out and people putting videos on landing pages and everyone was talking about it. I was at a Mastermind Meeting with Bill Glazer, and Bill gets up and shows conclusive stats that video does not out perform text copy on a landing page. He showed this stuff, and everyone in the Mastermind group was taking notes, \u201cNo videos on landing pages\u201d, taking all these notes and stuff. And I\u2019m like the only one looking there, from somebody who\u2019s actually ran split tests. Looking around like, so I raised my hand, \u201cHey Bill, first off, no offense man, you\u2019re not that good on video. Have you tested someone\u2019s who\u2019s good on video, versus copy, versus someone who\u2019s bad on video? Cause my guess is it\u2019s not the video doesn\u2019t convert on landing pages, it\u2019s your video that doesn\u2019t convert on landing pages.\u201d It was kind of a joke, but at the same time I was like that is the truth, my friends.</p> <p>Anywho, that\u2019s what I got. I\u2019m at the office, I got a busy day, I gotta go. I don\u2019t what I\u2019m going to keep rambling. I\u2019m going to get in trouble if I keep teasing my friends. Anyway, I would not be where I am now, so as much as I tease you guys I love you all. Hope you guys got some fun today, I will report back in on what I learn from Alex over the next few hours. Appreciate you guys, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "10:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_201.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1456527981, "title": "Episode #200 \u2013 Phase 2 Of Our World Domination Plan", "author": "", "summary": "<p>After you\u2019ve mastered consistent new customer flow, then you\u2019re allowed to do this\u2026</p> <p>On this special 200th episode Russell talks about his Funnel Scripts Webinar and closing 45% of people on it.

I wanted to talk about something important, some of you guys know yesterday I did a webinar for a new product we created called Funnel Scripts, and we had 5,038 people register for the webinar, which is crazy. Goto Webinar only let 1,000 people on, we had all sorts of technical issues. I can\u2019t even tell you all the problems that came with it, but even with those things in place, we closed 45% of those who were on. Like 450 sales which was nuts. It was not what I was planning, I was thinking 100 would be awesome, 200 if I did well, so yeah it was insane.</p> <p>And I was thinking about that and it reminds me of when I started working with Drew Canole at Fitlife TV. He had one product he\u2019d been selling for 5 or 6 years and they sold an insane amounts of them, but pretty much the market had bought his product and they were struggling financially, they couldn\u2019t do anything else. Outside of trying to fix and tweak their existing funnel, which we did. Next thing, I was like, \u201cThese people want to buy from you. I bet if you offered something else, they would buy.\u201d In fact, I knew because I bought Drew\u2019s stuff and then he had nothing else to buy. He had one thing, a 100 dollar kit, it came with a vegetable scrubbing brush, a water bottle. Anyway, I bought that, and he told me I was one of three people that ever bought that. I was like, \u201cI want to buy more stuff from you, I assume everybody else wants to buy from you as well.\u201d And I think that us, as marketers, we have this thing where we feel guilty, even if we don\u2019t think we do, we feel guilty selling more stuff, because we\u2019re like, Man, they already bought this thing, I don\u2019t want to sell them more things.\u201d But the reality is people like to buy things.</p> <p>One of my friends and mentors, David Fry, I few years back he told me, \u201cThe reason why I don\u2019t make more money, is I don\u2019t make more offers. Russell, you make more money than me because you make more offers. You put more offers out there and people continue to buy because you give them stuff to buy.\u201d It\u2019s been interesting the last year of my business. We pretty much stopped promoting affiliate offers, we don\u2019t really sell other people\u2019s products anymore, which has been a good thing. Except for obviously I miss the revenue that came from that, but we\u2019re trying to keep everything more internal. We\u2019ve sold Clickfunnels a lot, in fact I\u2019ve talked about it probably everyday for the last 18 months. Because I\u2019m in love with it. And we\u2019ve sold a lot of it, we\u2019ve got 11,000+ active members now. It\u2019s growing rapidly, it\u2019s been amazing. But I haven\u2019t really sold anything else, we haven\u2019t really come up with another product. We\u2019ve had some little things here and there, but nothing\u2026We have little free+ shipping offers to get people into Clickfunnels, but nothing big and new and exciting.</p> <p>So This is the first thing. So similar to what happened with Drew Canole, they launched their new supplement called Organifi and now they sell a million dollars a month selling Organifi to an existing audience who was just waiting. They were bursting at the seams just waiting to give him more money. It kind of happened to us yesterday, I think. We had a 45% close rate which is crazy. But people are looking for more stuff, they want to continue to buy and consume.</p> <p>What I wanted to talk about, is that, but I wanted to also give a huge warning sign because I\u2019ve been doing this a long time. 12+ years now, and one of the, I\u2019d say the cardinal sins of why people\u2019s businesses shrink and eventually disappear, I\u2019ve seen it, I can\u2019t tell you how many friends and partners and guru\u2019s and things that I\u2019ve seen in the last 12 years go through the cycle.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got a lady literally going 3 miles an hour in front of me right now. Are you kidding me? You\u2019re not even above 5. Alright, she\u2019s gone. Oh and now she\u2019s about to turn into me, holy moly.</p> <p>Anyway, that was weird. I\u2019ve seen these people who\u2019ve had business who have shrunk and just disappeared and they\u2019ve lost relevancy and I think the reason why is because they just start selling their existing audience more stuff, and so while I think that there is a spot when you can sell your audience more stuff, this is the big warning and the big caveat, is that you should only start selling your existing audience more stuff is if you have a front end funnel that\u2019s bringing in new traffic, new leads, new blood into your business. If you don\u2019t have that, this is what happens.</p> <p>This is the pattern, I\u2019ve seen it hundreds of times to people who, I\u2019ve seen them at the top of the world. They come in and they\u2019ve spent a some amount of time building up a list. Sometimes it\u2019s through a product launch, sometimes it\u2019s through whatever, and they get this audience. Let\u2019s say the audience is 30,000 people and then they stop doing things that get new blood in. They have this 30,000 person list, then realize the way I make money, I sell something new to this audience, and they make a new thing. And they make a new thing. And they make a new thing. And they make a new thing. And they keep doing that and every time they do that the list goes from 30,000 to 29,000 to 28,000 to 27,000 to 26,000 and it keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller. Because their entire business consists of creating new things to sell to their existing audience, and you can do that for a while, but you have to be very, very careful because that will eventually disappear. And I\u2019m not saying that in theory, I\u2019m saying that, in I\u2019ve seen it hundreds of times in people who were ten times more successful than me who are no longer relevant, who\u2019ve disappeared because their entire existence, their income became on just completely selling new things to their existing audience and they stopped focusing on front end traffic.</p> <p>So this is the lesson and this is the warning. The lesson is, you\u2019ve got to have two things. One is a front end funnel that\u2019s bringing in new blood into your ecosystem, your world. That\u2019s number one, and number two, then when you have that, if and only if you have that first, then I will allow you to go and start creating new offers for this existing audience. One really good example, if you look at Agora publishing. So Agora spends insane amounts trying to create new front end offers so they can bring new traffic into their whole world. They set up a whole team that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing and that\u2019s what they\u2019re best at in the whole world. So they\u2019re bringing all these people on their $50 a year newsletter, they upsell them on lifetime access for $500 and that\u2019s their break even funnel, then after people are in, they do once a month webinar selling their new training course, and that\u2019s where they\u2019re actually making money. But they have insane amounts of time and effort all focused on bringing new blood into their world. And then once a month they do a big internal promotion to those existing customers\u00a0 selling them the next thing. They\u2019re doing, I think on average, 12 new webinars a month to now monetize this audience. Not a month, year. 12 new webinars a year to monetize this audience. So that\u2019s a really good strategy, but it works for them because they continue to be adding new blood, new leads, new people into their world.</p> <p>So I want to make sure that you understand a couple things. First off, you can\u2019t turn off the spigot that fuels your company. Because that\u2019s going to be a temptation because you\u2019ll be like, \u201cWow, I made more money selling my existing audience.\u201d Yeah, you will but that happens and that works because you had the faucet filling up the audience bucket and you cannot turn that off. That\u2019s the first thing. Keep an ey on that, keep that up, keep that happening. Keep doing your weekly webinar. Go back to the archives of Marketing In Your Car you should listen to the one that\u2019s called, \u201cThe Model for the Next 12 Years\u201d That episode is one of the best episodes we\u2019ve ever done in all the 200 episodes of ours. Where I walk through the webinar model. That should be the fuel you\u2019re never turning off. That should be happening every single week. Every single Thursday you should be doing that. That has to stay, now while that\u2019s happening, now on the other side, now you can start focusing on what are cool things I can create to monetize this audience. What are other products and services and things they will want?</p> <p>Now when you start thinking through that its exciting because there\u2019s a million things you can do, there\u2019s a million partnerships, there\u2019s a bunch of stuff. I would steer you heavily away from doing traditional affiliate things. Because that\u2019s another way people burn their lists out really quick, they start promoting other people\u2019s offers, they\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 want to create something else, I\u2019m going to create, promote this person\u2019s offer.\u201d And you do that but the problem is as soon as you promote that person\u2019s offer, those people are on that person\u2019s list and you lose them. You lose you brand you lose your credibility. So if you look at the webinar I did yesterday with Jim Edwards, he had a bunch of software that wrote sales letters, so if he would have come up to me initially and said, \u201cHey Russell, would you promote my sales letter course to your audience?\u201d I would have told him no, because it didn\u2019t make sense for me. I would have been diluting my audience, I would have been pushing them over to somebody else\u2019s business. It didn\u2019t make sense for me, but he was very strategic and very smart.\u00a0 He said, \u201cHey let\u2019s partner on this thing. Let\u2019s build it together, I will customize it to your script, to your brand, to your thing.\u201d So we created this thing called Funnel Scripts. And now this is a new product I get to add to my arsenal, it\u2019s a new thing under my brand, under my umbrella. It helps build my company, helps build my business, but it was a partnership.</p> <p>So the joint ventures I look for now are ones that are more strategic like that; where it\u2019s building my company, my business, our brand, all those kind of things. And so it gives very smart, very strategic for him. So look for that in your side, either create your own thing or find people you can partner with, but you can bring it under your own brand. That\u2019ll help your existing audience stay within your world and continue to buy, to send up, and to keep buying your cool things. So that\u2019s my suggestion.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that was helpful for you guys. Again, create new stuff to sell to your existing audience, that\u2019s important, but only if you have dialed in the front end faucet to drive new leads into your business. That\u2019s more important. More important is getting new customers into your business and making sure that is consistently running. If that\u2018s doing it, if that\u2018s running, if it\u2019s working, then I recommend now creating new offers and new things to sell that existing audience. And that\u2019s what I got for you guys. Hope that gets you excited.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got a bunch of cool things coming out. Funnel Scripts is obviously doing well. We\u2019re gonna do a bunch a replays the next few days and see how many more people we can get into that program before we shut down the initial beta, and then with Funnel University coming out next. We rebuilt from the ground up our whole survey software, which is part of what\u2019s going to be inside Funnel University which is exciting. That should be happening. My birthday is March 8th, so if you guys want to pre-plan presents, send them to me. Just kidding. I\u2019m totally kidding don\u2019t give me presents, unless they\u2019re Gold or Silver. Those are exciting. I\u2019m just kidding again. But my goal is to launch that either on my birthday, or the day before, day after. Somewhere in there. So look for that, because that\u2019ll be our next big, cool, exciting, fun, amazing thing we have rolling out. After that it\u2019s just focusing on filling the event.</p> <p>Oh, and we have this really cool thing called Funnel Graffiti coming out too. Dang, we got too many cool things happening. It\u2019s fun, right? Alright, guys that\u2019s what I got. Happy 200th episode, or maybe 199, but I think it\u2019s 200. If not, we\u2019ll celebrate again tomorrow, which would be awesome. We can celebrate our birthday twice in a row? Why not? Alright, guys, appreciate you, have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you again soon.</p>", "duration": "13:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_200.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1456265608, "title": "Episode #199 \u2013 Yes, Everyone\u2019s Intentions Are Good", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A little lesson I was reminded of yesterday, when dealing with a very difficult circumstance.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about intentions and why he thinks everybody has good intentions. He gives a few examples of why he believes that to be true.</p> <p>Here are 3 cool things in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Anakin Skywalker had good intentions, and how he just went about it the wrong way.</li> <li>Why a man thinking about killing his entire family, actually had good intentions.</li> <li>How people who seem to be doing and saying things that you think are wrong, doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have good intentions,and why you need to try to understand their point of view.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear why Russell thinks people always have good intentions.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everybody, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey everybody, so I\u2019m driving right alongside the other car my kids and my wife are in and going to the Little Gym. They just drove past. So that\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>Anyway, I wanted to say hi to everybody today. And I\u2019ve got an important lesson I think. Yesterday started out awesome, and then it ended out really weird. I\u2019m not going to get into details of the weirdness because it doesn\u2019t really matter, but some weird stuff happened. It was really weird. So this took a good two or three hours of my life away from me, while I was trying to resolve things that were just weird. So there you go. There\u2019s the weirdness that you\u2019re all wondering what in the world I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not going to get into details even though it\u2019d be fun to. That\u2019s a rant for another day.</p> <p>What I wanted to talk about is my thought, this thought kept coming to my head during this process. I\u2019m grateful for this thought because it helped me to respond a little differently and I think it was valuable so I wanted to share it with you guys today. And it\u2019s all about intentions. What are people\u2019s intentions? What are your intentions? What are people\u2019s intentions? And not so much that people with good intention or bad intentions, but I\u2019m going to argue today that everybody goes towards having good intentions. I know it seems backwards, but even people that are doing really, really bad stuff, I think they have good intentions.</p> <p>Not to flash back to Star Wars or anything, but my kids we took them to watch Star Wars part 7 a couple of weeks ago and then I was trying to explain to them on the drive over about the whole story about Anakin, Darth Vader, Luke and Leia, so that they\u2019d have some context. Then they wanted to see all the movies so we watched all the movies. I watched them and as The emperor and as Anakin became Darth Vader in part 3, and his goals weren\u2019t evil right? He had to go to the dark side of the force and going about the goals the wrong way, but Anakin\u2019s whole goal was he wanted to restore peace for the galaxy. He had good intentions right? He just felt that this was a better way to get those intentions. I think a lot of times we look at people and we think that they have these bad intentions. He\u2019s trying to screw me over, he\u2019s trying to hurt me, or whatever it might be. But I don\u2019t think people do that, I think that about people as a whole, not most people but all people.</p> <p>And I think the first time I really got this was at Date with Destiny with my man, Tony Robbins. And he was telling a story that was interesting. He was talking about this concept of intentions and he kind of said, \u201cPeople always act out of the best intentions.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhatever dude. People have screwed me over all the time. People have done things like, they have bad intentions.\u201d And he was arguing, \u201cNo, people always move towards good intentions, sometimes the path they choose effects other people negatively, but they\u2019re always moving towards good intentions.\u201d \u00a0A story he told, he said he was at Date with Destiny a few years back or whatever, and they do different exercises, if you\u2019ve been to that program, you write down different things. I guess one of the attendees was writing out stuff in the book that he was planning on mass murdering his entire family.</p> <p>So the partner he was sharing his thoughts to, during the breakout sessions, starts panicking like, \u201cOh my gosh, this guy is about to kill his entire family.\u201d So he ran up to Tony between the break, this is the work\u2026I can\u2019t remember if he gave him the work book or just told him about, but \u201cThere\u2019s a guy in the audience who\u2019s planning on killing his entire family and he\u2019s mapping out during this presentation.\u201d And Tony obviously is alarmed, he used it as a teaching experience and finds out who the guy is and brings him up on stage and tries to figure out why this is happening. He hears something like, hey this dude\u2019s about to go kill his wife and kids, that\u2019s guys got bad intentions, he is a horrible person. In our mind, we just cast him as this horrible person doing this horrible thing. But when Tony brought him on stage and started talking and going through this whole process and figured out why was he going to do that, the reason was that when he was a kid, his father had left. His father had left him and his wife or excuse me, his mom and brothers and sisters. And in his mind, it destroyed his life. It was the worst thing on earth, his father leaving. So much so that he wished he would have died. Because it was such a bad experience it destroyed his childhood, it destroyed his older life. Everything bad came from that one pivotal thing, when his dad left.</p> <p>And his dad was at spot now where he wanted to leave. He wanted to either leave or commit suicide, or something. He wanted to leave himself from the world, but he knew if he did that he would cause so much pain to his wife and his kids. The same thing he went through as a kid. That pain was worse than the pain of losing a father and he did not want his kids and his wife to have to endure that pain, cause it was so intense for him. So his solution, \u201cWell if I kill my wife and my kids they won\u2019t have to go through that pain that I went through as a kid, and I\u2019ll be saving them from this thing.\u201d</p> <p>And you listen to that and you realize that as twisted as the outcome was for this thing, he did it because he had good intentions, he thought that was the right thing to do. And I started looking around at people and business people and family people. People that make decisions that don\u2019t make sense and you feel like it\u2019s Anakin Skywalker, they\u2019re going to the dark side. And maybe they are and maybe their intentions aren\u2019t, not the intentions, maybe the direction and what is happening isn\u2019t right. And you feel it\u2019s wrong and it scares you and it makes you nervous and unsure, but I honestly believe that everyone does what they do out of good intentions. They think that they\u2019re doing the right thing for them or their family or whatever.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they are. Like Darth Vader becoming the Sith Lord of the entire universe was not a good thing for everybody. But he thought it was the right way, it wasn\u2019t, he was trying to become evil. He was trying to do something but he went about the wrong way, but his intentions were right. And I think that if we use that lens when we talk to people, and we realize that even though what they are doing or saying or being completely goes against what you believe and that you know is right, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re a bad person. They have good intentions; they\u2019re doing it because a reason that have convinced themselves of is right. And I think that when we look at people and situations through that lens, hopefully it gives us a different perspective and hopefully we judge them and the situation differently.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard. Its hard cause in your mind they\u2019re still wrong. You know what I mean? But I think when you understand the intentions right, it gives you the ability to still love that person, even if they hate you. Because, you realize that what they\u2019re doing is not out of spite or out of hate or out of whatever it is. It began with the positive intentions. So, there you go.</p> <p>You may think I\u2019m crazy. You may think, \u201cNope, Russell that dude\u2019s got bad intentions over there.\u201d But I think that if we sit back and we try to look at it though a different lens we\u2019ll find interesting things. So I hope that helps a little bit. It helped me last night when I was dealing with some really strange things that I didn\u2019t enjoy dealing with. But realizing that people were overreacting the way that they did, or attacking the way they did, were not doing it out of spite or out of hate, but out of what they thought was good intentions for them. I can love them and respect them for that, even if I disagree with the route and the path, but I definitely understand a little more why. And I hope that that lesson serves you guys as well.</p> <p>That\u2019s it for today. Appreciate you all, have a great day. Make sure you don\u2019t choose the dark side, even if your intentions are pure. Anakin could have done so much good if he just would have not been evil. But there you go. Alright, guys. Appreciate you all have an amazing night, or an amazing day, whenever you\u2019re listening to this, and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "09:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_199.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1456180940, "title": "Episode #198 \u2013 It\u2019s Time To Turn Up Your Sexy", "author": "", "summary": "<p>There\u2019s a reason why no one is buying your stuff\u2026</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about how to turn up the sexy in your business.</p> <p>Here are 4 interesting things about today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>How Russell learned how to turn up the sexy in his dating life and later within his own marriage.</li> <li>Why if people aren\u2019t buying your stuff, it\u2019s because it\u2019s boring and you need to turn up the sexy.</li> <li>The steps you should take turn up the sexy in your own offers.</li> <li>And why Russell had to delete his Facebook app, and how that can help you.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how Russell turns up the sexy in his business and life.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson, and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey everybody it\u2019s a beautiful Monday morning after an amazing weekend. Right now it\u2019s sunny outside, I\u2019m wearing shorts. What more could you want in life? Seriously. I did ten rope climbs this morning, trying to get back to the time when I used to be tough. My dad growing up he built a big huge rope climb in our backyard, he spent a whole ton of money buying playground equipment and stacking it up and we had to climb the rope ten times each night before we could have dinner, and I became the best rope climber in the world pretty much. Because for wrestling rope climbing is the most important exercise on earth, so we got really, really good at it. Since then I became weak sauce, so we hung ropes in our wrestling room and I\u2019ve been trying to get back into it. So right now I\u2019m not doing ten times a day, I\u2019m trying to do ten times once a week. This is my third week in a row. I did ten this morning and it was hard and my hands hurt. But I did it and I\u2019m proud of myself. So there you go.</p> <p>So today, oh crap, driving a stick shift again, I gotta remember how it all works. I just killed it. My kids preschool, so all the preschool moms are laughing at me, but it doesn\u2019t matter because nothing can make today not amazing.</p> <p>Alright, so today\u2019s message, is turn up the sexy.\u00a0 Now let me give you some back-story before you just think that\u2019s a weird thing. It\u2019s interesting to me, that people come into my programs, they ask me questions like, Why isn\u2019t my funnel working, or why isn\u2019t anyone buying my thing, or whatever it is. There\u2019s a lot of reasons right, sometimes the sales pitch sucks, sometimes whatever, but the core issue behind why people don\u2019t buy your stuff, is because it\u2019s not sexy enough. That\u2019s it. So you gotta look at everything you\u2019re selling and figure out how can I turn up the sexy. How can I make this sexier? Because most of the stuff that people are selling, if it\u2019s not selling well, it\u2019s because it\u2019s not sexy. Nobody cares, nobody wants it.\u00a0 You\u2019ve gotta figure out how to turn up the sexy.</p> <p>So I bring this back to a real world example. Obviously I\u2019ve been off the dating market now for, man, thirteen or fourteen years. Quite a while, so I don\u2019t really remember this 100%, but I do remember enough to know that when I was in dating, prior to falling in love with my beautiful wife, when I went out on the market. When I just went out normal, guess what happened? Nothing, because I wasn\u2019t sexy, so guess what I had to do? I had, well, I shaved my head back then, but if I had hair I would have combed my hair. If I was going out on the market trying to find a date or a woman, or a wife, I would turn up the sexy. I would comb my hair, I would put on some nice clothes, I would try to shower before I went out, so I didn\u2019t stink. I would try to have some interesting things to talk about when we went out to dinner. I would try to be a cool person. I would try to help other people. I would try to be the best me possible. I would turn up that sexy as much as possible. Because, guess what women want? They want some sexy.</p> <p>Same thing the other way. If you see a woman, and she\u2019s all frumpy and angry and frowning, guess what you\u2019re not going to do? You\u2019re not going to ask her out on a date. But if she looks good, she\u2019s put together, she smiles. She can carry on a conversation. She\u2019s turned up the sexy in her life, then guess what? That\u2019s the kind of person you\u2019re going to be attracted to. Now one thing I found out about marriage goes on, you still gotta turn up the sexy every single day for your spouse. Because otherwise they\u2019re going to get bored with you and they\u2019re going to leave you. It just happens; I see it happen to too many of my friends. So a big part of that is you gotta learn how to turn up the sexy in your relationships, all the time. Otherwise people aren\u2019t going to be interested. Your spouse is not going to care about you if you don\u2019t do that. So there\u2019s little things we have to do to keep the other person in our relationship attracted to us. So there you go, there\u2019s my dating advice for today, and my marriage advice.</p> <p>Throughout your life you have to figure out how to turn up the sexy. The exact same thing is true for your offers. My guess is that most of you guys, if nobody\u2019s buying your stuff it\u2019s cause it\u2019s boring. I can\u2019t tell you how many opt-in pages I\u2019ve seen in Clickfunnels, where people are like, \u201cGive me your name and email address and I\u2019ll give you a three week e-course on how to do something better.\u201d Are you kidding me? That is so boring, there\u2019s no sexy in that. Give me your email and I\u2019ll give you my free report how to do things better. That\u2019s the pitch for the most part. That\u2019s not exciting. I don\u2019t want a free report. Maybe back in the 1980\u2019s that was cool, but today there\u2019s 18 bagillion reports, we\u2019re in the information age. The last thing on earth I want is more information. Unless it\u2019s packaged in a really what? Sexy way. We\u2019ve got to turn up the sexy. If I had given away a free report called Dotcom Secrets, guess what? It would have been hard for people to opt-in. But because I made it into a physical book, I turned up the sexy, I made it interesting I made it intriguing. I made a video that was interesting. I turned up the sexy. I made it seem mysterious and cool, and I made it as sexy as possible. Guess what happened? A Lot of people bought my book.</p> <p>We have a new offer coming out in the very near future called Funnel Graffiti. It\u2019s stickers that you can put on to build out funnels on your mirrors or windows, or anywhere you want. That\u2019s a sexy offer. Most of the reason why people aren\u2019t buying your stuff you guys, is it\u2019s not sexy enough. So look at every single step in the process, look at your ad, is it sexy? The pictures aren\u2019t sexy, and I don\u2019t mean sexual, because that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not talking about having ads with girls with big boobs on it. That may help some markets, but in most markets it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m talking about being sexy. What does your market want, What do they desire, what gets them excited? What\u2019s going to be fun for them to click on. They\u2019re in Facebook bored out of their mind trying to find something. What picture is going to be sexy enough that they\u2019re going to click on. It\u2019s probably a picture of you doing something stupid. When I\u2019m in Facebook I\u2019m looking for my friends and people who do stupid things. Most of our best converting ads are pictures of me doing stupid thing.</p> <p>That\u2019s the first step, the second step was in my opt-in page, sometimes into the landing page. Why is it sexy? Why would someone give me their name and email address on that page? If it\u2019s not something sexy they\u2019re not going to do. \u201cNo one\u2019s opting-in my page, my conversion on my page sucks. I did what you said Russell.\u201d No you didn\u2019t, you did the least that I said. I said make a sexy, exciting, interesting, intriguing offer that\u2019s going to get somebody to give you their email address. Curiosity based. On the landing page, my video sales letter, my webinar whatever it is, if the thing is not sexy, they\u2019re not going to want it. So that\u2019s my message for today you guys. Time for us all to turn up our sexy because that, my friends, will get some people to take action. It gets them to ask you on a date, it gets them to ask you to marry them, it gets them to click on an ad, it gets them to opt-in, it gets them to buy, gets them to buy again, it gets them to a send up. The sexier your stuff the better. So watch over the next 60 days, some of the offers and things we\u2019re rolling out and one common thread I want you to notice is, Has Russell turned up the sexy. I think he has, I think he\u2019s going to a whole other level. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here, and that\u2019s what you need to be doing on your side as well. Because your market, they\u2019re bored. That\u2019s why people buy from you, just in case you\u2019re wondering. It\u2019s not because they necessarily want your stuff, it\u2019s because they\u2019re bored out of their mind. They\u2019re on Facebook goofing around all day, stealing time from their boss, looking for something to entertain them. I mean it\u2019s sad, but that\u2019s true. That\u2019s how most of our buying decisions are made. It\u2019s in a state of complete and absolute boredom. That\u2019s when they\u2019re going to see your ad, that\u2019s when they\u2019re going to click. If you are engaging and entertaining and if you turn that sexy up, it\u2019ll get involved, get engaged, they\u2019ll buy and continue to buy. Because that is how the world works today. It\u2019s funny we\u2019re on Facebook and we\u2019re all connected, but we\u2019re bored out of our minds.</p> <p>I removed the Facebook ap from my phone a while ago, I think I told you guys about that, because I found at night I would try to go to bed, and I\u2019d be like, \u201cLet me see if there\u2019s anything cool happening in the world.\u201d And I\u2019d sit there and scroll through Facebook for 20, 30, 40, 50 minutes sometimes, trying to find something exciting and I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d go to bed bored out of my mind. I was like, I can\u2019t keep doing this. This Facebook thing is sucking the life out of me. So I deleted the ap, got rid of it, and guess what? The quality of my life is up. I\u2019m going to keep preaching to everyone that you should do that, but most people aren\u2019t. So you\u2019ve got to realize that\u2019s the state you\u2019re getting them in. You\u2019ve got to be exciting and sexy and fun. Again, I\u2019m not saying sexual, I\u2019m saying sexy. Making it intriguing and exciting and engaging. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get them out of that state and into the state you need them to be in to buy.</p> <p>I hope that helps. Turn up the sexy you guys. I\u2019m going to go inside to the office and turn up my sexy. I encourage you guys to do the same, not only in your business but in all your relationships. I\u2019m going to be called the love coach now too, I guess. No, just kidding. I just wanted to illustrate that. Hope that helps. Peace you guys. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "09:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_198.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1455664300, "title": "Episode #197 \u2013 The Seven Minute Lunch Consultation", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Here\u2019s a quick recap of everything I shared during my lunch consultation today.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell shares some cool things he shared with some clients at a lunch consultation.

Hey guys and gals, this is actually the second Marketing In Your Car I\u2019ve done today. Do you wanna know why? Because I\u2019m in my car again and I\u2019m driving, so because of that you get to get me again, because I had nothing else to do. I just wanted to share with you guys. I had a really cool lunch today with, there\u2019s a company called Kount K O U N T, which is a really cool fraud protection company, and the CEO is one of my close friends, he used to be the CEO of Clickbank, in fact, Clickbank and Kount are owned by the same company.</p> <p>Anyway, I had a chance to go eat lunch with them today, which was really fun to get to know the guys and their sales team and marketing team and stuff. I enjoyed it, and I learned some cool things, not things that I learned, but I shared some cool things with them that I think would be good for everyone so I just wanted to share some of the thoughts and ideas that came from it. Hopefully it\u2019ll give you guys some value.</p> <p>The first question they asked me, \u201cClickfunnels sounds cool, but we\u2019re selling BDB. With BDB, do funnels work, is that just a BDC type thing?\u201d and it made me laugh because first thing I said, \u201cCool, how do you guys get clients in the door right now?\u201d He actually used the word funnel, \u201cWell the first step of our funnel is\u2026\u201d Then I kind of smiled and then he explained the whole thing, \u201cWe go to trade shows and we get leads, and we put the leads, and these guys call the leads, and leads forum, and then leads score guys, and if they\u2019re good they go to these guys and then sell to them.\u201d I kind of smiled, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay well that was a funnel right there. All we\u2019re trying online is replicate that. How do we make it so that instead of you having to have a guy or a gal or somebody do each of those steps, a lot of those things happen online.\u201d I told him about how back in the day, some of you guys know my story, we had a call center that had 60 full time sales people who were outbound calling every one of our leads find people qualify them and all those kinds of things. And while that worked, it was expensive. That\u2019s a lot of people. Everybody had to dial 100 dials a day and all that jazz. It was just super inefficient, expensive and honestly, wasn\u2019t a great experience for people. People don\u2019t want to get phone calls all day long. So when we shut down the call center, we reinvented the model and kind of changed it around. We started driving traffic into a funnel, the funnel sifted and sorted and qualified people and just gave us leads and customers who were ready to sign up today. And that was the transition, that\u2019s how it kind of moved.</p> <p>We went from having 60 full time sales guys to now we have two.\u00a0 While they don\u2019t do quite the same top line revenue, they definitely do more profit. Considering two guys versus 60 its pretty dang close to the top line, which is exciting. Anyway, I think that was cool illustration of a funnel. So the next question was, \u201cHow do you guys get leads into your funnel?\u201d So we kind of talked about that a little bit, I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re doing a little bit of everything. We\u2019re trying a lot of things. We have a Facebook ads that run.\u201d And theyre like, \u201cFacebook ads don\u2019t run for us.\u201d I\u2019 m like, \u201cReally? Why not?\u201d they kind of talked about their messaging on it, and their messaging was very specific li,e, \u201cHey you can increase your transaction value for this.\u201d I was like, that\u2019s not what people are looking for. Your product is fraud protection you\u2019ve got to create a desire in their minds. When we launched Clickfunnels initially we started selling like, here\u2019s funnel software. And nobody bought it no matter how excited I was. We had to change it. How to get people excited about funnel software. We had to explain what a funnel was and get them excited and show examples of your funnels and what\u2019s actually possible. And that\u2019s why I built the funnel hacks webinar. To show them, here\u2019s what a funnel is. Here\u2019s how it works. Here\u2019s how you funnel hack somebody else. Here\u2019s how you go to Clickfunnels and actually build it, and here\u2019s how you get traffic. I gotta create desire and belief that what I have is gonna actually help somebody.\u201d And I showed them that the reason that your Facebook ads not working is because you\u2019re not creating desire or belief. That\u2019s another goal of funnel, it could be through a sales video, it could be through a webinar, it could be through whatever, but you gotta create desire and belief, those are the two core things you\u2019ve got to create through your funnel. That\u2019s the goal, if your funnel can create desire in the thing that you sell, and belief that it will work for them. Notice that I didn\u2019t say, not that it\u2019ll work, but it\u2019ll work for them, that\u2019s how you get ads to convert. So that was the next thing.</p> <p>Then we talked about other ways to get leads, and all the things we were doing. I asked them, \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re building out kind of a front end call center, who are going to call leads and start selling our programs. Have you guys ever heard of billwith.com?\u201d they said, \u201cYes, we used builtwith.com but it didn\u2019t really work.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHow did it not work?\u201d they said, \u201cwe had guys exporting lists of hundreds of thousands of leads and they were calling them all day and getting 1800 numbers and dead calls and things like that. So if you guys know builtwith. Builtwith.com is this site where you can say, hey show me all the sites that were built with Leadpages, show me all the sites that were built Unbound, show me all the pages that were built with Infusionsoft. It shows you all the pages and then gives you full the contact info of those people. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. You\u2019ve got these sales guys that are cold calling all these unqualified, cold, freezing cold leads. I don\u2019t want my sales guys talking to anybody unless they\u2019ve raised their hand. There\u2019s a really cool business model that we\u2019re implementing right now that you guys should look at. It\u2019s a book called Predictable Revenue. I think I\u2019ve mentioned it to you guys before in the past, but if not go to predictablerevenue.com, I believe, and go buy the book, it\u2019s like a $10 book. The books not really well written but the concept is awesome.</p> <p>So what they do in this book, it kind of documents the case study of how sales went from 0 to $100 million in sales and they did it basically, getting lists that they knew had builtwith.com. conceptually the same thing. You get this cold call list and instead of just having your sales dudes just call and burn sales out, you have the sales guy take 100 leads and then email 100 people and say, \u201cHey are the person in charge of marketing at this company?\u201d and typically the person is like, \u201cNo I am not. So and so\u2019s in charge of marketing.\u201d Then they introduce them to so and so. Now the person\u2019s got a warm introduction to the person who\u2019s in charge of that aspect of the business and that opens up a great call. Then you\u2019re only calling people who\u2019ve raised their hands and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m Joe and I\u2019m the marketing guy you\u2019re looking for. Let\u2019s get on a phone call and talk.\u201d\u00a0 So your sales guys are only talking to people that are warm. So that book, I think the model and I don\u2019t know exactly the numbers, each sales guy emails 100 people a day, from that they should get 11 responses and from that they should have 6 calls or whatever. And they just kind of\u2026.that\u2019s the model. Now your sales guys aren\u2019t trying to make 100 dials a day. Your sales guys are sending 100 emails and talking to 11 people who actually raised their hands. It makes for a better experience and way more profitability and less headaches and costs, and all the things that are associated with the other model.</p> <p>That was kind of another little tidbit and idea. There you go guys. There is the end product of our lunch consult for today, I did with the Kount guys. I hope it gives you guys some ideas for your business on the funnel process, converting ads, different places, different way outside of just Facebook to get leads. A cool conversion process to convert those leads and a bunch of other things. So there you go. Seven minutes and fifteen seconds of gold I hope I dropped on you guys. If you get some value out of that, let me know. Share this episode on Facebook or whatever that would be sweet. If you want to see any back episodes go to marketinginyourcar.com, You can find all the old episodes. Get the transcripts to the old shows and a bunch of other amazing things.

Good morning and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Alright guys and gals and everybody else who\u2019s hanging out with us today. Today it\u2019s a beautiful day in Boise, Idaho so I broke out the corvette. I think so far in Clickfunnel\u2019s we\u2019ve given away 9 or 10 of these things this year. If you haven\u2019t won yours yet, it\u2019s time to join the Clickfunnels affiliate program. I just want to give you a car, that\u2019s all I want in life.</p> <p>I hope things are going amazing for you wherever you are today in your business. If you\u2019re not smiling yet, please smile. It\u2019s amazing how much more goodness will come to you when you smile. Alright, I wanted to talk about something that made me laugh. I kind of hate Facebook for a lot of reasons but the main one is there\u2019s like a million people who have unlimited access to talk about you and tag you and it\u2019s so annoying.\u00a0 And then message you. Facebook blocks out a lot of people, but every once in a while someone gets through and I\u2019m like, \u201cHow did that person get the ability to get in my inbox and annoy me.\u201d Anywho, there was this dude that comes in, and this is a lesson for everybody, so he\u2019s stressing out like, \u201cRussell, I want to use Clickfunnels, but I can\u2019t because your integration with Infusionsoft doesn\u2019t pass all the data it only passes part of the data. And your integration with Ontraport doesn\u2019t do something specialized that I need for my thing, and I was talking to these people over at Leadpages and\u00a0 they were making fun of me for using Clickfunnels because Leadpages does integrate with them better and blah blah blah.\u201d All this crap.</p> <p>At first I was just going to delete it, but then a part of me was like, this guy is complaining about a bunch of things that don\u2019t matter at all. I was like, \u201cHey why are using Infusionsoft?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cbecause I need to do tagging.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do tagging inside of Clickfunnels?\u201d \u201cClickfunnels can\u2019t do tagging.\u201d \u201cYes, it can. Why do you even need tagging? I don\u2019t know anything about you or your business, but my guess is if you\u2019re not making at least ten million dollars a year right now, there\u2019s no purpose, no need, no reason that you need to be doing tagging. The only thing you need to be doing is selling a product. I\u2019m curious, what are your revenues? Are you selling a lot or are you not?\u201d Guess what he came back at, \u201cNo I haven\u2019t launched my business yet or one of my funnels, I just got Clickfunnels, I like it and I\u2019m trying to figure it out. So I was researching people who are talking about this and that. How this doesn\u2019t work and how that doesn\u2019t work and all these kinds of things.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cDude, right now our average, our members are making on average $600,000 a day through stripe. Inside of Clickfunnels, right now we\u2019re making anywhere from $40 to $50,000 a day through clickfunnels through stripe. For you who has no business yet, is stressing how our integrations with other companies. Dude, first off don\u2019t integrate it. Do not worry about our integrations, you don\u2019t need integrations. That\u2019s why we have Clickfunnels so you don\u2019t have to do integrations. I run my entire business through Clickfunnels.\u201d \u201cYeah, but right now you don\u2019t have advanced tagging like Infusionsoft.\u201d \u201cWhy do you need advance tagging. You don\u2019t even have a business yet. You\u2019re not even selling a product yet. I don\u2019t even use advance tagging yet. You have my permission as soon as you pass $10 million a year in sales. Then you can start stressing out about advance tagging. Until then the only thing you should worry about it selling your product. You set up a Clickfunnels page. On the first page you just have an opt-in, on the second page you just have a sales button that goes through stripe, third page you should deliver the product you just sold. And you should focus on driving traffic, that\u2019s it. He came back and he\u2019s like, \u201cWow, thank you. You\u2019re right, all this time I\u2019ve been stressing on these things that don\u2019t actually matter. I was in analysis paralysis or whatever. Right now I not even making a quarter of a million a year, I\u2019m not making ever $100,000 a year. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not making any money right now.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, therein lies the problem. You\u2019re worrying about all this stupid crap that doesn\u2019t matter. Clickfunnels does everything you need to do. Don\u2019t look outside, Don\u2019t look for Infusionsoft, you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t look for Ontraport\u00a0 you don\u2019t need it. Everything you need is right here. Just use Clickfunnels.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cOh man, this is awesome.\u201d</p> <p>So I thought I solved this big problem right, so I thought. So then yesterday, two days later, he comes back to me and this is why you should never respond to people on Facebook because it never ends. So he came back to me and he had screenshots from all around the inter-webs, different Facebook groups and things and he had blackened out all the people\u2019s names to protect their innocence from me. All these kinds of things, all these posts of people who supposedly were upset at Clickfunnels, were canceling Clickfunnels or didn\u2019t like the way that the integration with Aweber, or whatever those things were. He went and scoured the internet. You could tell he spent days looking for all these different possible things, issues that might possibly happen that he didn\u2019t want to mess up, and didn\u2019t want to not make money so he was just finding any way possible to not use Clickfunnels. And he came back, \u201cRussell, there are all these people who are friends of yours, and there are people who are insiders, and one of them used to be an employee and you fired him and you should let him back because he was so good\u2026.\u201d All these things and he showed me pages of screenshots from all these people.</p> <p>And then he started talking about how, If only we had a Zapier integration, then he could do everything, you just need to Zapier\u2026If we could just have all the tech guys focus on Zapier for him then all of his problems would go away. And I wrote back and I said, \u201cHey, how many products have you sold this week? Dude, you\u2019re stuck in your same problem. This is why you\u2019ll never be successful. You\u2019re searching so hard for a reason to not make money, and you\u2019re going to find it if you keep looking. Right now we eleven thousand members and its growing rapidly, most those eleven thousand members, guess what they do? They just make money. They use Clickfunnels and they make a crap-ton of money and they\u2019re fine. But guess what, there is a fraction of a fraction of a percent who are frustrated. And guess what that fraction of a fraction, those are the ones the go to Facebook and complain about, \u201cThis didn\u2019t work, my aweber integration didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m pissed at Clickfunnels and I\u2019m canceling.\u201d Let\u2019s say 1 percent of our customers vocally complain, that\u2019s 1000 people a day vocally complaining on Facebook and it\u2019s not that. So you take 1 percent of 1 percent. That\u2019d be 100 vocal people on Facebook a day, and it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s like five, five or six. You take 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent and a half of that, you\u2019re looking at how many people are actively mad on Clickfunnels and they\u2019re the ones posting and those are the people whose opinions you\u2019re freaking out about. Look at the other 10,997,000 or whatever the number is, who are happily just using Clickfunnels and making a crap-ton of money with it. That\u2019s who you should be looking at and focusing, not the complainers, not the people who have some issue.</p> <p>I was looking at one of the complaints he sent me over, and again the name was blurred out to protect the innocent, and in this thing this lady was all upset because the Aweber integration didn\u2019t work the way she wanted it to work, and I understand that. That\u2019s frustrating. But there\u2019s a work around, so the support person gave her a work around and she was so mad. \u201cSupport didn\u2019t get back to me for 24 hours and I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m cancelling, I\u2019m refunding my money. I\u2019m getting my $100 back.\u201d I started laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re upset over $100. Look at what we gave you, the ability to create amazing sales funnels. The ability to have upsells and downsells and membership sites and affiliate programs and all this stuff for $100. It reminded me of a dude I heard at a standup comedy thing, and this guy is sitting on a plane, and they\u2019re flying over the Atlantic Ocean somewhere. And the guy sitting next to him is upset because it\u2019s too hot, or it\u2019s too cold, the food didn\u2019t taste that good. All these things he\u2019s complaining about thing after thing after thing. And the guy looks at him like, \u201cYou\u2019re flying. You\u2019re in a airplane over the Atlantic ocean flying. It cost you $100 or $500 for this ticket. 300 years ago, 1000 years ago kings would have given everything they owned for this experience and you\u2019re complaining because the food doesn\u2019t taste good, because your seats not big enough. You\u2019re flying.\u201d Oh my gosh, quit freaking complaining.</p> <p>So I was laughing, a year ago, pre-Clickfunnels, for you to create what you just created, worst case scenario it would have cost you $1000 to get a designer, a programmer, an analytical. Worst case $1000. Here you get all that times a million times more, for $100 a month, and all you got\u2026.and one little hiccup makes you freak out. I want to tell you about my experience prior to Clickfunnels when we were paying a designer $50,000 a year and a programmer $`100,000 a year and 8 other people involved to just get one funnel live, and guess what? 90% of the time the shopping cart would break and the auto-responder would break and the sites would go down and on and on and on and on. And now those things are almost zero. I don\u2019t say zero because there are little issues here and there that happen, but it\u2019s almost zero and guess what you\u2019re paying for that? $100 a month. You\u2019re flying, quit complaining. Look at the positive. Look at what we\u2019re giving you for $100 a month. It\u2019s insane to me.</p> <p>What is the moral of this story? The moral of the story is you\u2019re freaking flying. Quit complaining about the bumps and the air, and the fact tha you don\u2019t like the food. You wish the food did something different. And you wish you could eat steak or sushi, or you wish you could have a shower on your plane, or whatever it is. Quit complaining, you\u2019re flying. With Clickfunnels you are flying. I understand there will be hiccups or things don\u2019t work the way you want them to work, or whatever it might be, but you\u2019re flying. Don\u2019t forget that.</p> <p>Alright, that\u2019s it for today guys. I\u2019m going to go and help some more people fly and if you\u2019re the one looking for 1000 excuses about why you can\u2019t be successful, I promise you, you will find them. But if you\u2019re like the rest of us who are just doing our business and making money and realize there are going to be hiccups and bumps. Just work around them. If that\u2019s you, then welcome to my world. You\u2019re the people I want to serve, you\u2019re the people I care about. And you are the people who are benefiting from Clickfunnels and the training, and everything else that we\u2019re providing for you guys at an insane rate. Its still is insane to me, what you\u2019re able to accomplish today for $100 a month. If you were to rewind and look back 12 months ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago it was a different story, a whole different world and the world you live in is amazing. Be grateful because you guys are flying now. I\u2019m out of here, appreciate you. Have an amazing day. I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "11:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_196.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1455225857, "title": "Episode #195 \u2013 It\u2019s On Like Donkey Kong", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to get so much stuff done that people don\u2019t think you ever sleep.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell shares his secret about how he gets so much work done and why it seems like he doesn\u2019t sleep.

Alright guys, so today I have my yellow shirt on that says, \u201cIt\u2019s on like\u2026\u201d and then there\u2019s a big picture of the 8 bit Donkey Kong.\u00a0 You know what that means right? Its means it is on, it means we have a webinar today and we are gonna get paid. It\u2019s going to be payday today. So I\u2019m excited. It\u2019s officially on like Donkey Kong and I\u2019m really, really excited.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve done a live, live webinar. I kind of took a couple weeks off and let auto webinars run, because I\u2019ve been buried in so much stuff. So I\u2019m getting my hands dirty today, I\u2019m getting out in the trenches and doing it. I\u2019m excited, really excited actually. We\u2019re doing it with Jason Fladlien\u2019s audience, who are all Amazon sellers which is cool too, so we\u2019re going to be converting everyone from the world of Amazon to the world of Funnels, which is a great, really great thing. So I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>With that said, I gotta share some cool stuff with you guys today, so I was trying to think about what we have\u2026.I don\u2019t even know how to explain it, but kind of the back-story. Some of you guys saw, if you follow me on Facebook, I don\u2019t know if you follow it, it was on my personal Facebook, I don\u2019t know if you can follow it. But if you are one of my personal friends on Facebook, you probably saw I posted the manuscript for Expert Secrets. We finished the first manuscript and I printed it out and was going to start reading and editing, so I printed and posted it there. Which was really cool. Tons of people commenting and stuff. Someone\u2019s comment was, \u201cWhen do you sleep?\u201d Which is awesome. And it made me smile for a couple of reasons.</p> <p>First off, I sleep a lot and I play with my kids a lot, and I goof off a lot and I don\u2019t work as much as people think I do. In fact, my bet is that I work the same or maybe less hours than most people, but when I\u2019m working I\u2019m on. A couple of things about that, first off when I\u2019m working I\u2019m on. I heard somewhere, some study, or I don\u2019t know, something. They\u2019re talking about how the average employee at the office gets I don\u2019t know, two hours of work done in an 8 hour day or whatever. My guess is some of you guys probably do that right? You\u2019re probably on Facebook goofing off, checking emails. If I\u2019m at the office for 8 hours, I work for 8 hours; it\u2019s not me goofing off. People want to come to the office and see what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s me working. It\u2019s not exciting. It\u2019s exciting for me because I\u2019m working on cool stuff, but there it is.</p> <p>Okay, second thing, and this I think is the big secret, this is if I could give you one thing today that I think will be the most valuable for you is, the reason why I get so much stuff done and it seems like I don\u2019t sleep, is because I have built up over the last twelve years, an amazing team of people that can help me with all the different aspects of what I want to get done. If I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I wanna do\u2026I have an idea to sell something.\u201d Most people it\u2019s going to be like a 6 month process to have it come to fruition, where for me first off I know, here\u2019s the twelve things that need to get done. I know here\u2019 s my video guys, Boom, here\u2019s my graphic guy, here\u2019s who\u2019s doing the logo, here\u2019s who\u2019s writing the concept, here\u2019s doing copy, here\u2019s doing\u2026..and so as soon as I have an idea, I send it in Trello, which is where I do all my magic, I post some things and within five minutes we have an idea every single person who I have found to be the best in the world in my humble opinion. Have messages on what to do, and then they just do it, and they send it back and within a week I\u2019ve got back everything I need. It would take a normal person 6 months to a year.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m magic, because I\u2019m not at all. In fact, I\u2019m not talented at all to be honest. Don\u2019t tell anybody. What I have though, I have built up an amazing team of people. And they\u2019re not all employees, a lot of them are contractors as well. They\u2019re kind of both. I think about when I first got started and it took me a long time to get stuff done and I think about that, why was it hard? And I think it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have the people in place. I look at now, I know who does my logos, I know who does this, I know all those pieces right. It took me a long time. Sometimes, I didn\u2019t find those guys for 5 or 6 or 8 years into my business before I found them. But when I found them I treated them really, really good. Because I want when I have a crazy idea at 2am and I want it done by 4am, I want to be able to message those guys and they take care of it. Same reason why when I have babysitters, we pay them a lot, and the reason why first off, I got 5 insane kids, so that\u2019s kind of crazy. But second off, I want when I call them to see if they\u2019ll come babysit, I want them to cancel other babysitting jobs and come to my house instead. If I\u2019m paying them more, it\u2019s a better experience, and all those kind of things. Same with contractors, I want to be able to take care of them, so much as a boss, that when I\u2019m like, hey I need this, it just happens.</p> <p>This is really, really cool actually. Vince Palko, some of you guys know him from Adtunes. We had this idea for marketplace when we were trying to get done in three days, and it\u2019s like 8pm or something and I vox him like, \u201cHey man I have an idea we\u2019re trying to launch Thursday. Is there any way you can get it done in time?\u201d And his messaged me back, and he was like, \u201cFor most people that would be\u201d\u2026I can\u2019t remember exactly what he said, but something like, \u201cFor most people that would be impossible, but for you it\u2019ll be done.\u201d And I was just like dude, that\u2019s awesome! I try to make it so my relationships with everyone who is doing things is like that, so they\u2019ll drop other projects and other things because I take care of them and I care about them as people and things like that.</p> <p>For you guys I\u2019d recommend, because everyone\u2019s on different cycles in their business, but I would be looking at where you are now, a big part of it when you\u2019re going out there and you\u2019re trying to find your team. Everyone\u2019s gotta have an amazing\u2026I\u2019ve got an amazing team of people. Everything from graphic design, to artist, to web, to copy, to animators, to sketch artists, to traffic generate. Every piece of this puzzle I\u2019ve got really good relationships with people that can do all those things, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to get stuff done so fast.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always that way. I was thinking about when I first kind of started I was trying to find programmers and I was using a site back in the day, called Scriptlance, it was recently purchased by Freelancer.com, but same thing as freelancer.com and upworks.com, it was a site, right? And I would start hiring all these Indians, and Romanians, and Filipino\u2019s and all these people on projects. I would say on average, I would probably hire 15 to 20 people before I found someone that was reliable, someone that was actually good, that I was like, wow, this person is good. I\u2019d be like, \u201cHey, I wanna do more stuff with you, you cool with that?\u201d and they\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I\u2019d give them more projects, and eventually some of these guys became friends. I\u2019ve had one of them actually moved here from Ukraine.</p> <p>When I find people who are good, I treat them well and I try to involve them. Either I make them an employee or a contractor, or just one of our go-to people that we use over and over again. And that\u2019s kind of what we do. So for you right now I would start hiring people, a lot of people. And even if they\u2019re for dumb little tasks, a lot of them, my projects that I hire people for on those sites are just stupid little things that don\u2019t matter. But, I\u2019m trying to find talent. People who respond who take care in their work., people who are awesome. That\u2019s kind of how it works. When I see somebody\u2019s sit e that I like, or I see a logo that I like, I try to find who did that logo, where are they at? For designers I go to this site called Dribbble. D R I B B B L E .com. Three b\u2019s it\u2019s kind of weird. I go there and I swear I spent an hour and a half last night, but I do this all the time. I search for stuff and I find people that have awesome UI design, or awesome logo design, or awesome\u2026.whatever I\u2019m looking for and then I just contact them and I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, that logo is amazing!\u201dAnd they\u2019re like, \u201coh, thanks.\u201dCause they\u2019re designers and they want you to talk about it. I just like, \u201cMan, I respect good design and your stuff is amazing. You\u2019re awesome. Are you hirable, can I hire you in the future to do something? Cause this is awesome.\u201d Then they tell you yes and you go from there.</p> <p>I would think one of the biggest things you can do to have more success today, but even more so tomorrow, and the next day, and it\u2019ll make it so as you\u2019re growing your business, it\u2019s like a ball or a big rock rolling down a mountain and it\u2019s getting bigger and bigger the whole way down, is by identifying those team members and people that could become your go-to people to get stuff done.\u00a0 I would spend a huge focus on that cause that\u2019s so much more valuable than you getting smarter, or you figuring out how to do things. It\u2019s all about finding out who are the people that you can trust, that are rock stars that you can put on your team. And then when you find those people treat them awesome. Don\u2019t be mean. Do whatever you can to bring value to their lives and if you do that they\u2019ll do whatever they can to serve you back. And it\u2019s awesome.</p> <p>That my friends, is how you get so much stuff done. Not because of me, because I understand all the pieces and I found a team that can do all the pieces and because of that we can move fast. So there you go. Hope that helps. I would say right now there\u2019s probably 15 projects that I have that are in Trello, not in transit, they\u2019re in some level of thing and there\u2019s people from all around the world building pieces of those while I\u2019m sleeping. So I can sleep at night because those pieces are all happening and moving forward, which is awesome.\u00a0 There you go. With that said, I am almost to the office. So there is your homework assignment today you guys. Start building your team, and then it\u2019ll be on like Donkey Kong. So go get a shirt that says, \u201cOn like Donkey Kong\u201d for your sales days, it\u2019ll help.</p> <p>Actually I hope. I will let all you know if I crush it today. If I bomb, this shirts going in the garbage, going in the fire. It\u2019s gone. Alright, I\u2019m out of here. Have an amazing day everybody, and I\u2019ll talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "10:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_195.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1455051392, "title": "Episode #194 \u2013 What To Do When Someone Rips You Off", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What to do about pirates, copy-cats, and unethical people.</p> <p>On this episode Russell shares why people can copy your message but they can\u2019t copy your fire.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Alright, everybody, hope that you are having an amazing day today so far. I wanted to have some fun on today\u2019s podcast. I had like 4 or 5 ideas that we could talk about, but this is the most fun because it\u2019s one that drives us, as producers crazy, yet when all is said and done it\u2019s really not that big of a deal, but it still drives us crazy.</p> <p>This morning I was listening to one of Garrett J. White\u2019s podcasts about how they can\u2026.I can\u2019t remember the title, something about, they can copy you, but they can\u2019t clone your fire, they can\u2019t copy your fire or something like that. He was talking about some other friends, who in his mind, he just kind of knocked them off, or they kind of knocked him off. And he\u2019s talking about how you can copy the marketing style, you can copy the message, you can copy all those kind of things, but you can\u2019t copy your fire. I thought that was really cool, and it was interesting because we had, last month when we were doing our hack-a-thon, we had all our Clickfunnels team out here and that was one of the concerns we had. Do we have all developers move in house, we can have tighter controls on our codes, nobody can steal the code. You know, all these different things. And what was interesting is that, this is me as the outside marketing guy being nervous, like, \u201cI don\u2019t want people to copy us, or what if somebody got our code and they hack Clickfunnels and they\u2019re competing with us?\u201d It\u2019s this fear mentality mindset. The developers kind of laughed, \u201cyou know like have the stuff we\u2019re doing is open source and we\u2019re open sourcing it, we\u2019re giving it to the communities so people can build on it to, and all these things. If someone wanted to steal the code it wouldn\u2019t matter because most was out there anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, I don\u2019t know how the open source is, but apparently we\u2019re donating most of our code to open source for other developers to develop on and make cooler things and all these things, and I\u2019m just like, \u201cIt\u2019s so weird to me because it just seems backwards.\u201d But one thing\u2026.I can\u2019t remember if it was Todd or Ryan, but somebody said, \u201cThis is the deal. Somebody could go and they could copy our code, or parts of our code, or whatever that might be, but there\u2019s intangibles that they can\u2019t copy.\u201d Similar to what Garrett talked about, they can\u2019t copy your fire. They can\u2019t copy our message and our community, and our work ethic, and our team, and our vision and all the other pieces that go into growing an empire.</p> <p>They can clone things, but they can\u2019t do all the rest of it. It was funny, I was reading an article last week, I had 10 people tag me to it on Facebook, but it was about a company in the UK that basically knocks off every big hit. Amazon came out, they knocked off Amazon. Groupon came out they knocked off Groupon over in the UK. They knock them off, and build them up really fast. They straight just rip everything. You look at the sites, color scheme is the same, layout is the same, everywhere in the menu set up the same spot. Everything is just identical, and they were saying they have teams of people that all they do is monitor these sites daily, and if Amazon shifts the menu one pixel to the right, they shift their menu one pixel to the right. They\u2019re assuming that Amazon is doing all sorts of crazy testing, so they just straight rip them off. Their whole model is they just rip these guys off and then come back to the original companies and sell them. They\u2019ve sold their Groupon clone to Groupon and they\u2019ve done it others. These guys made over a billion dollars, just ripping people off. So it\u2019s like, you see things like that, and you\u2019re like, I don\u2019t want to be ripped off.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because I see people that all the time, my stuff\u2019s up for sale on eBay, I see the pirate sites, as soon as I create a course it\u2019s for free on the pirate sites. The other day I was looking for one of my logos, I couldn\u2019t find my logo file. So I just Google imaged it, and I found the original logo file to my design, I\u2019m like, wow! Who has this on their site? How cool is that? I can\u2019t even find it on my own computer. I went to the site, and on the site there was this thing, \u201cHey here\u2019s Russell Brunson\u2019s course, I\u2019m going to buy but I need people to pony up some money.\u201d There\u2019s like 100 people that all ponied up like 50 bucks to be able to buy my course so they could all just rip it off and share it together. It\u2019s just ridiculous. It\u2019s funny because there was this time in my life where there was so much fear behind that. I was just like, Oh if they rip it off, then this and that and all these kind of things, and I\u2019ve had people come to me, who are like, we are eBay\u2019s company and we\u2019ll police eBay and we\u2019ll knock off anyone who steals your stuff and posts it. We\u2019re going block it and all these kind of things.</p> <p>In fact, we had this guy, I probably shouldn\u2019t name names, but I have to name names for the story to be funny. His name was Cody Moya, and he used to clone everything we did. We created a product, and I would announce, we\u2019ve been spending three months on this product, and we would announce that we were launching it. And that same day he would send me an email launching his version of what we did, and he\u2019d somehow just put it together really quick, and he\u2019d have the identical product as us. It was crazy. So we used to call him Cloney Moya, because he\u2019d just clone anything that any of us did, it was so interesting. This is a funny part of the story. Joel Comm had\u2026He bought a copy machine in his office, a big huge copy machine. The tag was like, the Copy Master 2000 or whatever, and he broke the tag off and put his own tag on and it was called the Cloney Moya. So he\u2019d do photocopies on the Cloney Moya. It was so funny because\u2026.that guy had some success for a little while, but has anyone heard of him since then? No! It\u2019s because you can copy the sales process, you can copy the content, you can copy whatever, but like Garrett said, you can\u2019t copy the fire. I thought that was really a powerful message for me today.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, I had a guy that we published for a little while, and I asked him about his journey, like \u201chow did you get successful online?\u201d He said, \u201cYou know what\u2019s interesting, I used to go to\u2026..\u201d some pirate website in internet marketing space, where you can get pretty much everybody\u2019s product for free, he said, \u201cI used to go that thing and I would download everyone\u2019s products and I\u2019d listen to them, and it was the weirdest thing, I had all this information in my head, all these things, but I was never successful. One day I realized that I was straight ripping everybody off, and I\u2019m trying to go out there and provide value to world, and trying to help, to sell my own products. There\u2019s some weird thing with the universe, if you\u2019re ripping other people off, you\u2019re stealing their intellectual property, other people aren\u2019t going to pay for theirs. One day I just got sick of it and cancelled my accounts. I went to some of the products that had the biggest impact on me that I\u2019d stolen, I went and I bought them just to pay the authors for those things. When I did that everything changed. Suddenly my product started selling.\u201d Everything good came after he had done that. I thought how interesting that was.</p> <p>I\u2019m not too concerned when people rip off my stuff anymore, because they\u2019re not the kind of person I want to serve anymore anyway. The dude who\u2019s okay going and ripping a product and consuming it, and can sleep well at night, is not the kind of person in my coaching programs, using my software. I\u2019m not okay with that kind of a person. So if they want to do it, that\u2019s cool and hopefully someday they\u2019ll see the light, but I\u2019m not concerned about that kind of person. The customers I want are the customers who are going to pay me because they know the value I provide to them.</p> <p>In fact, if you look at my business now, almost everything we sell now is free. You know what I mean? All our best stuff is free plus shipping. We do have upgrades where you get more, you know upsells and stuff like that. For the most part it\u2019s all free. I give all my stuff away from free. People always ask me, like my Perfect Webinar script, \u201cHow much is it going to cost?\u201d Just go get it for free, for 5 bucks we\u2019ll ship it, just go get it. And they\u2019re like, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll pay you for it.\u201d And I\u2019m like \u201cJust take it.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cIf you actually implement the perfect webinar, guess what\u2019s going to happen? You are going to make a crap-ton of money and then you are going to come and give me $25,000. And that is so much more valuable to me than getting $97 from you today.\u201d</p> <p>For me, I\u2019m all about giving away all this stuff, so that people can consume it and get a ton of value, and then they\u2019ll want more. They will come back if what you give away is amazing. Just a side note, I\u2019d never heard of Dan Kennedy, this is back in the day. I was on eBay and some dude ripped off Dan Kennedy and I didn\u2019t know, but it was like this marketing thing, and I\u2019m like, \u201csweet I like marketing.\u201d So I bought these Dan Kennedy Cd\u2019s for a $100, and turns out it was like $1,000 course, but I didn\u2019t know that. So I was listening to this course and it was awesome, I got so much good stuff. So because of that\u2026in the product he kept talking about his Platinum Group, and I was like, \u201cI want to be in the platinum group!\u201d This whole course kept indoctrinating me and I eventually call up DKC and I begged them to let me in and I paid them $25,000 to be in the platinum group and I was in that group for 6 years.\u00a0 So they made, $150,000 off me, plus I spoke at their events, I sold their products. I\u2019d say they conservatively made 3 or 4 million bucks off me during that time.</p> <p>I came into their world because somebody else ripped them off. And I remember, Bill at the time, was all freaking out about the pirates stealing his stuff. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, do you understand that I am in your world today because some pirate ripped you off and unbeknownst to me was selling your product on eBay and I bought it and now I\u2019m here and you\u2019ve gotten 5 or 6 million bucks from me. Was that worth it?\u201d Yeah, let the pirates have fun, if they want to go do that they\u2019re spreading your message, they\u2019re spreading your word. Just don\u2019t deal with it, because a couple of things, first off, the right people will pay. The people who stumble upon that stuff, if your stuff\u2019s awesome they will come back for more. It\u2019s the drug dealer close right? You give them the first one for free and then they gotta come back.</p> <p>That\u2019s how I feel, I want to make content so addictive that when they have it, they gotta have more. I don\u2019t know if that helps at all. The biggest thing is don\u2019t stress out about people knocking off your stuff. I don\u2019t put password protect stuff on my download pages because I don\u2019t care. Again, people who are going to rip me off, can rip me off. People who want to buy are buyers and they\u2019re going to continue to buy. And those are the ones who I\u2019m catering towards and to and that\u2019s all that really matters for me. So there you go. If you are stealing stuff right now, knock it off because it\u2019s probably keeping you from where you want to be. As weird as that might sound, I don\u2019t know how or why but for some reason, that\u2019s just how it all works.</p> <p>Alright guys. I\u2019m at the office, I\u2019m gonna go create some cool stuff. Hopefully go change the world and hope that something comes out today that\u2019s going to help you guys.\u00a0 Appreciate you all, have an amazing day and I will talk to you guys all again soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "11:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_194.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1454970811, "title": "Episode #193 \u2013 There Is A Law, Irrevocably Decreed\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The three steps to get any blessing in life that you want.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode of Marketing In Your car Russell relates a Sunday School message to marketing.</p> <p>Here are 3 interesting things in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why you can become who you want to become as long as you follow someone who already is what you want.</li> <li>What Tony Robbins said is the best way to be successful.</li> <li>And how after you find someone to model, you have go back and put in the work to get what you want.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear what Russell\u2019s church lesson has taught him about marketing.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everybody, and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Alright guys, so I\u2019m driving cautious today because I couldn\u2019t find my wallet this morning, which happens more often than I\u2019d like to ever admit. But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at today. So I don\u2019t have my license with me. Good thing it\u2019s all back roads from my house to the office.</p> <p>So I hope you guys had an amazing weekend. For me it\u2019s Monday morning right now, it could be any time for you. I mean some of you guys might be listening to this ten years from now, I could be dead, for all I know and iTunes just doesn\u2019t shut it down and you guys listen to this 100 years in the future. It\u2019s pretty sweet, that is the power of what we all do.</p> <p>As of today, I\u2019m really happy. I had an amazing Saturday, I remember sitting there looking around, and feeling like, this is one of the most amazing days in my life. If every day was like this it would just\u2026..anyway, it was amazing. I was home with my kids. I was out in the wrestling room with the kids. We went hot-tubbing with the kids. Then I went on a date with my wife to go see The Piano Guys. It was amazing. Days like that make everything, kind of puts everything into perspective makes it all amazing. So that was really fun.</p> <p>Then yesterday, so I am a Sunday school teacher at my church. Some of you guys may or may not know that. So I teach the 14 and 15 year old kids, which is a fun age, because about 15, 16 is when kids go insane. At least that\u2019s when I did. So I\u2019m hoping to have a chance in my own little way, to touch their little hearts before they get to the insane stage. So it\u2019s a fun age to teach, and I have 21 kids in my class. Which is just way more than one teacher should ever have to teach, but it is what we got. So it\u2019s kind of fun teaching them.</p> <p>The stuff I taught them yesterday, actually really applies to you, who is listening. So today, I\u2019m going to put on my church hat and I\u2019m going to be Brother Brunson today. And I know some of you guys, you obviously didn\u2019t come listen to this to hear a church sermon, but I promise this relates to you. Even if you don\u2019t believe in anything, even if you don\u2019t believe in God, it doesn\u2019t really matter, I think this is still something that is valuable to you. And I hope that you get some value out of it. So, there you go.</p> <p>Alright, there\u2019s kind of three core pieces I taught them that I thought was really cool, and it\u2019s kind of been like a guiding force in my life, so I wanted to share them. So the three core concepts you got to understand, so I\u2019ll share all three and then I\u2019ll kind of tie them together.</p> <p>So the first one actually, so in Mormon theology, we have a couple books of scripture, one is the Book of Mormon which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of, the other one is called the Doctrine and Covenants. And in the D&amp;C there\u2019s a really cool scripture.\u00a0 It\u2019s D&amp;C section 130 verse 20 and 21, and this is what it says, \u201cThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated. When we obtain any blessing from God, by obedience to that law upon which is predicated.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but that is amazing. So it basically said in heaven before we got here, there was a law irrevocably decreed, which means it cannot be taken away, it\u2019s there forever, from the beginning of all time til forever. Irrevocably decreed upon which all blessings are predicated, not some blessings, but all blessings are tied to these laws, right? And then if we get a blessing from God it\u2019s because obedience to a law that is tied to that blessing. Is that pretty cool?</p> <p>So to the class there and said, \u201cWhat blessing do you want?\u201d So again, these are 14 year old kids, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat blessings do you guys want?\u201d Ones like, \u201cI want a hot wife.\u201d So I wrote it on the board. And one\u2019s like, \u201cI want a 4.0., I want to go to school.\u201d Anyway, they had everything from wanting a hot wife, to I want to watch TV all day. So we had all these blessings on the board. I was like, \u201cCool, so these are the blessings you guys want,\u201c and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think about worldly blessings, but who do you want to become?\u201d That\u2019s a blessing right? \u201cWho in your life, bigger than just like, I want blah. Who do you want to become?\u201d We wrote down some of those things, like who they want to become. \u201cI want to become a great father.\u00a0 I want to become someone who contributes to society. I want to become someone who changes the world.\u201d So then we start having some of these blessings that were who they wanted to become. So that was kind of the first step and then I pointed, I said, \u201cEach of these blessings you guys want right now, as we now know, they are irrevocably tied to a law. And If you follow that law, then guess what happens? You get the blessing.\u201d Again, irrevocably is a powerful word, God cannot take it away, it is irrevocable. If you follow that law you get that blessing. So I\u2019m like, \u201c \u201cSweet, now we know that, all we got to do is figure out, what\u2019s the law that God created that then gives us that blessing?\u201d</p> <p>So that was step one in this process. Step two I started talking about Tony Robbins. Now, a bunch of 14 year old and 15 year old kids and none of them have ever heard of Tony Robbins. Like, \u201cDangit. Well he\u2019s this big huge giant with big hands and big teeth. But one thing that Tony taught me, he said, \u201cIf you want to be successful in this life, all you have to do is find people who are successful and then model them.\u201d Step number two, I was like, \u201cIf you know who you want to become, there\u2019s got to be somebody else who\u2019s already become that, which means that they followed some certain laws to get that blessing. So if I want that blessing in my life, the first thing I need to do is find someone who already has that blessing. Because they\u2019ve done something right, they followed some law and God gave them that blessing. So step two in this is modeling, find somebody who already has what you want, what you want to become. So I was like, \u201cWho do you guys have? Who\u2019s a potential mentor, someone you like at like, \u2018Man if I could be like that person, that\u2019d be amazing.\u2019 So that\u2019s step number two, finding that person and modeling them.\u201d</p> <p>I talked about how; when I started wrestling I was a really bad wrestler. I think I\u2019ve shared this story before, but one of my first days of wrestling practice, I found a guy who was better than me, his name was Adam. I was like Adam is better than me, I\u2019m going to model him. We went out and were running the track, and he kept slowing down and taking short cuts and all these things. I\u2019m like, oh well, he\u2019s good, maybe if you\u2019re good it doesn\u2019t really matter. You can just take short cuts.\u201d So I\u2019m taking short cuts with him and I\u2019m just following him as my mentor. And unfortunately, what I didn\u2019t\u2019 realize at the time is that he was doing things wrong. And the very first tournament I went to I remember watching Adam, and I\u2019m like \u201cthis is my mentor, this is my guy. He\u2019s so good.\u201d And I remember watching him get beat badly, just getting thrown around like a little girl. I was like,\u201dI picked the wrong mentor. I picked someone who\u2019s taking short cuts. Who\u2019s not taking short cuts I can model.\u201d I looked and there was this guy name Matt Wood, he was a three time state champ from my high school, he was about to be a three time\u2026.. I said, \u201cYou know what? Matt is the new guy I\u2019m going to model.\u201d I realized he had a blessing that I wanted. I wanted to be a state champ. So what are the laws he had to go through to get that? \u00a0And I looked and watched him work. I watched his work ethic, I watched the moves he would do, I would model him. And within 2 and a half years of making that decision I became a state champ, and it was all about finding someone who already had it and modeling them. Same thing happened in business. I was not a smart kid. I would say, I remember when I applied for college, they have you get a rank of where you fall in your class, my graduating class was 950 people, was a pretty big class, right? But I was on the lower half. More than half the class was smarter than me. It was a lot more; I was in the bottom third. I was like, \u201cnot only am I dumb, but I\u2019m one of the dumbest kids in this school.\u201d And that\u2019s what I thought about. I struggled through high school and struggled through college, but when I got in business I found people who were successful. People I remember modeling, guys like Armand Morin, I looked to him every day.\u201d Man, he\u2019s doing what I want to do. He\u2019s making software and he\u2019s selling it and people love him. I want to be like Armand.\u201d So I modeled him and guess what happened? In a very short period of time, I had a company similar to Armand\u2019s. I found other mentors and I modeled them. So the second step is after you know what blessing you want, is finding a mentor that\u2019s already gotten that blessing and then modeling them. Because they have, either consciously or unconsciously, they have followed that law to get that blessing. That\u2019s step number two.</p> <p>Then the third step, and this one is very important. And this is again, scriptural. It\u2019s a concept we call the law of the harvest, I asked the kids, \u201cwho knows what the law of the harvest is?\u2019 and one of them said something that was right on, he said, \u201c you reap what you sow\u201d I said \u201cyeah, a lot of us we look at what we want to become. I want to become whatever that thing is down in the distance where we\u2019re going.\u201d And we get started, say, I want to get in shape. So we work out three days and like, \u201cI\u2019m not in shape, this sucks, I\u2019m out.\u201d And you just quit. That\u2019s not how it works. Let\u2019s say I own a farm, I bought this land, and I\u2019m like, I want broccoli for dinner tonight. You can\u2019t walk out there and throw broccoli seeds out there and then get upset that by dinner I don\u2019t have any broccoli. That\u2019s not how it works. It\u2019s all about we have to sow first. You can\u2019t reap until you sow, so you sow, you put the seeds out there and you water them, and you weed them and you do all these things. And you protect them from the elements. You do all the things you have to do to sew seed.\u00a0 And then when the season comes ripe, then you can reap the benefits of that. It\u2019s the same thing for you. Just because you find a mentor does not mean you\u2019re suddenly going to start eating broccoli that night. You\u2019ve got to go back and sow the seeds. You\u2019ve got to put in the work and the effort and the trials. And there\u2019s going to be a lot of them.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, I moved into my new ward, and I look like I\u2019m eleven. Some of you guys know that. We have a bigger sized house and I get people all the time who are confused, like, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d and I think sometimes they think that I got lucky. But they haven\u2019t seen the twelve years of sewing that I\u2019ve had to put in to get to this point. It\u2019s insane, if I could show you the battles that I\u2019ve lost, and the scars that we have. I\u2019d look a lot more than eleven if you could see that side of it. But I\u2019ve sewing, sewing, sewing, and finally we\u2019re in the season that we\u2019re reaping it, and it\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s not something that happened over night. It\u2019s the law of the harvest. So, that\u2019s the third step, you know the blessing, you know who you want to become, you found a mentor, you found someone to model. So you can find out which laws they followed and then you have to put in the work. It\u2019s the law of the harvest. You\u2019ve got to go and plant the seeds, you gotta do the work. If you do the work, which by the way, you\u2019ll notice from your mentors how they got there too, they sewed. That is how they got to where they are now.\u00a0 But if you look at that, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to get to where you want to become.</p> <p>So for you guys, I want to challenge you to start thinking about this, start thinking about who you want to become. Find a mentor to model, then start living the law of the harvest. Start planting the seeds and it may not today, may not be tomorrow, might not be a year from now, might not be three years from now, but if you sew, based on the law of the harvest, you will reap. And that\u2019s something I also believe in as well. So there you go.</p> <p>Hope you guys didn\u2019t mind my church lesson for today. I hope you see how it\u2019s applicable to you in your life, no matter what you believe, no matter what faith you\u2019re in. It\u2019s something that my faith has brought to me, it\u2019s gotten me excited. I hope that it gives some value to you as well. So that\u2019s it you guys. If you don\u2019t have your tickets yet to funnel hacking live, you\u2019re insane, go get them. Funnelhacking.com is the place. The tickets are on sale now, but they are going quickly. This event may be the last I ever do, because I have no idea how I\u2019ll ever top this. We\u2019ve got Marcus Lemonis from The Profit speaking. It\u2019s going to be amazing. So be there or be square.</p> <p>Some people are like, \u201cRussell, tickets are expensive.\u201d Are you kidding me? I spent almost a hundred grand just to get Marcus there so he could talk to you. And other people, I have to fly out my whole staff, and get a hotel. I don\u2019t make money on this event, just so you guys know. I\u2019m risking hundreds, not one hundred, but hundreds of thousands of dollars to entertain you for three days. And if you\u2019re not willing to spend you know, whatever tickets are, 5, 6 or 700 bucks for flights and hotels to come out here and do it, you\u2019re insane. I remember Tony Robbins talking about one time, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what drives me crazy? People will go to this movie, and people have risked hundreds of millions of dollars to make this movie, and you come in and pay ten dollars and sit there for three hours and come out and say, that movie sucked. Are you serious, someone risked hundreds of millions of dollars to try to entertain you for 180 minutes and you\u2019re complaining because you didn\u2019t think it was good. You think about kings back in the day. The most wealthy, powerful people on earth, they\u2019d have a court jester to entertain them and you have people spending hundreds of millions of dollars and you pay ten dollars for that experience.\u201d It just makes me laugh. I\u2019ve never said I hated another movie since then, when I kind of realized, wow, people are putting in their time and effort to entertain us and the cost is ten bucks, fifteen bucks. Insane, be grateful for what is out there, it\u2019s pretty amazing what\u2019s happening now days.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s it guys. I\u2019m here at the office. I got a fun filled week of work, while the rest of my community is at Traffic and Conversion Summit. So I\u2019m going to be working while they\u2019re playing.</p> <p>One last story, some of you guys know Dan Gable. He\u2019s like the Michael Jordan of wrestling. Dan was undefeated all through high school, all through college. His last match in college, he lost to Larry Owens from Washington. Only match he ever lost. He went on, three years later to be an Olympic champ, nobody scored on him in the Olympics. Not a single person scored on him, that\u2019s amazing. But, while he was training for the Olympics, he would put in 7 hours a day at the gym, because he was so obsessed and wanted to beat the Russians.\u00a0 The Russians were the powerhouse at the time. And he\u2019d go to bed at night and couldn\u2019t sleep because he knew the Russians were awake, training, and it made him sick to his stomach. So in the middle of the night he\u2019d wake up and be like, \u201cthe Russians are training, I can\u2019t let them beat me.\u201d So he\u2019d get up and go running at two or three in the morning, because he knew that he didn\u2019t want to be sleeping when they were training. I thought it was pretty powerful and that\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m at right now. This week is kind of about, while everyone else is asleep, I\u2019m training. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Appreciate you guys. Have an amazing day and I will talk to you all again very, very soon.

Welcome to a foggy Marketing In Your Car. Alright, so I\u2019m driving through the fog right now. It reminds me of, have you guys all seen, what\u2019s it called, Rudolph the Red nosed Reindeer, the old clay-mation one. Where Yukon Cornelius and them are running away from the abominable snowman and they\u2019re going through the fog, and he\u2019s like, \u201cthis fog is as thick as pea soup.\u201d Anyway, this feels like today, we\u2019re going through pea soup, I can barely see the stop lights in front of me. But it\u2019ll be fun, so that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>So today, I\u2019m excited. I\u2019ve been kind of on lock down. I feel bad, I haven\u2019t done a Periscope this whole week. At least I\u2019ve been talking to you guys right. I\u2019ve just been in work mode, it\u2019s been awesome. I had, I think it was Monday I had a bunch of calls and meetings, and Tuesday same thing. I can\u2019t remember, anyway. But Wednesday and Thursday, all I did all day was build a new funnel we\u2019re launching called Funnel University. I\u2019m so excited. I\u2019m so proud of it.</p> <p>But, I want to call my shot so I\u2019m going to pull a Babe Ruth on you all and I\u2019m going to call my shot. So, I look at what\u2019s happened to our marketplace since we launched Clickfunnels a year and a half ago. And back then there were people doing a lot of things, and since then we kind of launched really hard and heavy with the Webinar Funnel and the High Ticket Funnel, that\u2019s what people have seen. And it\u2019s been interesting as I\u2019ve watched my clients, my students, and even Clickfunnels members as a whole, everyone seems like they pretty much\u2026not that they only have, but as a whole the masses have focused on\u2026and also excuse me, Trip Wire funnels, the masses have focused on those. There\u2019s been Trip Wires, there\u2019s been Webinars, High Tickets. And I would say 98% of pages I\u2019ve seen in the last year has been one of those three things which is cool, which is awesome cause those are the ones we\u2019ve been pushing hard. You know people are funnel hacking me and the process and then everyone else is doing it and funnel hacking each other. It\u2019s been fun and interesting.</p> <p>But what\u2019s been weird for me, cause I\u2019ve been doing this for a long, because I think this is year 12 or year 13 for me. I\u2019ve been doing this a long time, and I see cycles of what people are focusing on, what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re selling and stuff like that. So the cycle\u2019s been Trip Wires, Webinars, and High Ticket, which is cool because, I mean the new book we\u2019re launching called Funnel Stacking focuses on Trip Wire, Webinar, and High Ticket, that\u2019s the thing. But there\u2019s two pieces that I feel like are super valuable in this whole marketing game, that in times of my career have been the most important thing. Again, I watch the trends, and two trends that I feel like have been dead in the last two years, and I\u2019m calling my shot and maybe this is just me, I don\u2019t know and maybe I shouldn\u2019t be saying this, maybe it\u2019s me thinking I\u2019m cooler than I am, but we\u2019ll see. So I\u2019m calling my shot right now. Two things that I\u2019m bringing back with the Funnel University launch that\u2019s happening, it was supposed to happen yesterday, but we missed our deadlines. The lead or gold deadline was not hit, somebody\u2019s going to be shot in the head. No, just kidding. But we\u2019re going to be launching it, rolling out next week.</p> <p>Two things that are going to be unique number one, is we\u2019re launching a continuity program. And obviously that\u2019s not a new concept, but I haven\u2019t seen someone launch a continuity program in a long, long time. Have you? I\u2019ve seen SAAS businesses, but I haven\u2019t seen a traditional continuity program. It\u2019s funny I remember when I joined the Dan Kennedy world way back in the day. Man, it\u2019s probably ten years ago now, dang I\u2019m getting old. Anyway, they launched their entire continuity program based on the \u201cfree plus shipping\u201d with the big huge package and their greatest free money making gift in the world and they put you on a continuity program which was a print news letter. And in the internet marketing space no one was doing it back then, so I saw and I was like, \u201cSweet!\u201d So we made a free dvd offer and put people on a forced continuity program and we launched and I think in month one we had 800 people within 6 months we had 6000 people on this continuity program with our print newsletter and we were just crushing it, and then guess what happened? Everybody and their freaking dog did it too, it was kind of crazy. Soon it got to a point that there was 8000 print newsletter in the internet marketing industry, and all of them sucked except for mine. Well, no I\u2019m going to say that they really did. I joined all of them cause I was thinking that they were going to be good, but no, they were all pretty bad. And maybe I\u2019m biased, but I don\u2019t think I am.</p> <p>And then, what happened, eventually they all died away. And I\u2019ve been the only one, we\u2019ve been consistently doing a newsletter now for almost a decade, almost 10 years. Which is kind of cool. So, there you go people who\u2019ve come and gone, we\u2019re still going hard and strong. Alright, so that\u2019s number one, is continuity program, and I\u2019ve figured out a really cool way to do the pricing, the pitch, everything. That\u2019s number one the new thing. So watch, I\u2019m calling my shot over the next six months you will see dozens if not hundreds, of continuity programs launched modeling this one. So that\u2019s number one.</p> <p>Number two is the rebirth of the video sales letter. I was going to do a webinar to launch this, and I thought you know what I don\u2019t want to do a webinar, I don\u2019t want to do this. So I didn\u2019t, so instead we did a video sales letter. We went back to the old Dotcom Secrets Labs book, and we went through all of our split-tests and there\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, 50 split-tests are all based on video sales letters. Because in the cycle when we were hot and heavy with that, with the testing for that, we put it into the book, everything was video sales letter driven. Every one of our products, everyone else\u2019s products. That\u2019s how products were sold back then. But I\u2019ve seen very little of it in the last 12 to 18 months in our worlds, so I decided I\u2019m going to come back and do a video sales letter, you\u2019ll see the video spoiler box, you\u2019ll see all the elements that were proven winners from back then I have built into this page, which is excited. I\u2019m excited for it, you should be excited as well. That is kind of what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>So that\u2019s two things we\u2019re launching. A video sales letter version, a selling system to sell a continuity program. So I\u2019m calling my shot, I will see that knocked off more times in the next 6 to 8 months than anything prior to that. It\u2019s going to be the rebirth of continuity programs and the rebirth of video sales letters. So, I\u2019m excited. Because I feel like my real goal in the Dotcom Secrets side of the business is to push the envelope and do cool things and everyone else can funnel hack me and model it for their business. That\u2019s kind of how I view my role right now. And hopefully I\u2019ll make a bunch of money in the interim while I\u2019m kind of going through that process. I really want to be a good example of ways to sell things and cool things to sell. That people can then model for their individual businesses. That\u2019s really how I see my role right now.</p> <p>I think that there will be a time where Russell Brunson and Dotcom secrets brand will fade into the night and disappears. But, until that happens my goal is to be a shining beacon and you guys can all copy me. Just kidding, but that\u2019s kind of how I look at it, is I want to be a perfect model of cool stuff you can take and emulate. It\u2019s been fun in my coaching program, people like, \u201cRussell I want to sell Mash print, how should I do it?\u201d Boom! Go to Russellbrunson.com, funnel hack that funnel, that\u2019s how you should do it. \u201cEveryone wants a webinar, what should I do?\u201d Boom! Go to whatever.com, and should do that. You know and I just, I can show them perfect examples. \u201cRussell, I want to do a continuity program, what should I do?\u201d Boom! Go to funnelu.com and kind of point people to our models of each different selling models. \u201cHow do I do an invisible funnel?\u201d Go to doubleyourreading.com. Like exactly. That\u2019s what I want me to be, is creating models that people can use as selling systems to reach each of their different things they\u2019re selling. So there you go.</p> <p>Hopefully that gets you guys excited a little bit. But that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. So I\u2019m excited to roll south for nothing else, except it looks dang cool and I\u2019m excited. Oh, there\u2019s another thing that I did. So typically when we do a video sales letters, and if you\u2019ve read the dotcom secrets book you know this too, we use the star story solutions script to write a video sales letter typically. The problem is star story solution script works but it\u2019s kind of hard. It\u2019s a lot of work, to be completely honest. I think of all the selling things to do it\u2019s probably the hardest one which is why I think a lot of people have gravitated away from that, because it\u2019s a lot of work. Which is why typically for good video sales letter, you pay a copywriter 15 or 20 grand to write a really good star story solution script. That\u2019s just, in my experience, how it kind of goes.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want create a star story solution script and I was going to do a webinar, so I was like, \u201cWhat if I just do a webinar for a video sales letter, and I just make it a really cool video. High production value, but I\u2019m just doing my webinar pitch. So I\u2019m doing the perfect webinar pitch for my video sales letter. So when you see it you\u2019ll see that\u2019s what it is. I recorded it at my house in a couple of different locations. I teach three secrets, I do the whole belief pattern. I take the belief patterns, I crush them and rebuild them, do my stack.\u00a0 I basically I did the perfect webinar for the video sales letter, which I\u2019ve never done either so I\u2019m excited to see how that does, it could completely bomb, but I think it\u2019s going to crush it.</p> <p>And the reason why, it\u2019s funny it\u2019d never even crossed my mind as an option until we did that Periscope, a little while a go, I did a podcast talking about how we did $150,000 through Periscope. That one I took perfect webinar script during a live Periscope, it took me 25 minutes to do it. We did $150,000 in sales, so I was like, \u201cMan, this perfect webinar concept can work in other places.\u201d And it was funny I was looking at a lot of weight loss video sales letters. Cause still into weight loss industry people still sell things in a traditionally do video sales letter. There\u2019s a lot more content and base stuff like, \u201cHere are three foods that are going to make you die. Or the three foods you think make you skinny that actually make you fat.\u201d So those still work. Those are structured a little more like a video sales letter, excuse me, more like the perfect webinar script. So that\u2019s the reasoning behind testing it. We will see, but hopefully people will start transitioning their webinars into videos like this.</p> <p>A couple of other cool things we did, again, it\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s me I\u2019m teaching, I printed out a bunch of websites. I have them up on a easel and I\u2019m showing cool stuff on them in the video. I got this cool graphic GUI animation guy to animate the graphics as well. We\u2019re trying to make some cool stuff, so hopefully you guys can look at those and model with your offers and your videos. Hopefully you get some inspirations.</p> <p>That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m at the office right now, in this thick fog that\u2019s as thick as pea soup is keeping me from getting there on time. Decade In\u00a0 A Day starts in 3 minutes, 2 minutes now. Hopefully I get there before it starts. And then I got that for 4 hours, I\u2019m going through 4 new inner circle members. I\u2019m doing intake calls from them. Which will be fun. We call it process Decade In A Day, if you wanted to be part of that just go apply for inner circle at russellbrunson.com.\u00a0 And then after that I\u2019ll be focusing on getting in the rest of Funnel U live and hopefully by Monday or Tuesday next week you guys will see Funnel University. You have my permission to model it.\u00a0 Hope that helps, appreciate you guys. Have an amazing day and I will talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "11:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_192.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1454536680, "title": "Episode #191 \u2013 Turn Off The Dang Football Game And Get Back To Work", "author": "", "summary": "<p>No one\u2019s ever progressed by watching four hours of football\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about turning off the football game and getting back to work because people are wasting their lives away watching sports.</p> <p>Here are 3 interesting (but possibly offensive) things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why spending a significant amount of sports is not a good use of time.</li> <li>What Russell recommends if your number one hobby is watching sports.</li> <li>And why you should find out what part of your life you are passionate about, that doesn\u2019t involve watching other people succeed.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how Russell is going to piss off all the people who love sports.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everybody, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car. Hey everyone, I hope you\u2019re having a good day today. It\u2019s freezing in Boise, I don\u2019t know what it is but I keep thinking it\u2019s going to be summer, and then no. And the way our new house is built, I don\u2019t know if I told you this, It\u2019s one of the pains of our house. So, it\u2019s a little bit bigger of a house and there\u2019s four different heating zones. And my bedroom is the last one, and also the heating system and the water system are tied together. So what happens is, because we\u2019re the last room, we have those cool nest controller things, so we have the temperature set in our room to 71 which is perfect normally. But when it gets cold it\u2019ll show 71 is where it\u2019s trying to get to but it\u2019s only actually 67. And for some reason, if it gets to freezing or below, I\u2019m just pretty much screwed. That part of my house is freezing. At night we\u2019re freezing cold. We have all these space heaters, and we\u2019re trying to warm it up and everything, but it can\u2019t get warm. We\u2019ve had 5 guys come, so that\u2019s part of the issue. But that\u2019s okay cause we can bundle up in blankies and stuff to keep warm. The other part though, and we\u2019ve learned this, if I look at the temperature in my room on my nest, let\u2019s say it\u2019s 71, but it\u2019s actually under 71, that means it\u2019s not able to get the heat it needs to warm my room, which is also tied to the hot water heater, which means my shower cannot make a warm shower. If the gauge on my room is 70 or 71 right now, I\u2019m going to have a warm shower, but if it\u2019s not I\u2019m going to have a freezing cold shower. For the last 3 days it\u2019s been below. Any other showers in our house are fine, so I have to go shower in the kids\u2019 rooms. But my own shower won\u2019t and that\u2019s kind of weird. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.</p> <p>I wanted to talk today about something that I\u2019m probably going to offend somebody. And if so, I really apologize. I don\u2019t really apologize; I think it needs to be said. So this is my thought.\u00a0 I was asking someone the other day, they were trying to figure out what to build, their passions and stuff. I was like, \u201cthere\u2019s got to be something you are crazy passionate about. Where you would do it for free and you could inspire others. All of your free time you\u2019re focusing there and you\u2019re learning about it and reading and watching.\u201d And maybe I\u2019m just the weird one but I assumed everyone was passionate about something. I assumed there\u2019s things you follow that you\u2019re obsessed with. For me, obviously marketing, I\u2019m obsessed with it. I read every blog post, listen to every podcast, reading insane amounts of books and courses. I\u2019m just obsessed with that concept, but that\u2019s not the only concept.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of other stuff. For a while it was NLP that became a passion. I was studying, I was learning, I was reading books and courses and cds. It was consuming, immersion of NLP. I had a time I was selling. How do we sell, trial closes, and tonality, and all that\u2019s from when I became obsessed with the selling part for a while. Right now, I think my passion is bio-hacking. What are all the weird crazy cool things I can do to get more out of my body. More energy, more focus, more weight loss, more happiness.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m just insane, because of this bio-hacking phase; we\u2019re in the process about to begin to build out this huge bio-hacking room in our house. It\u2019s going to be insane. I\u2019m hoping I finish it before I\u2019m out of my bio-hacking phase. But as of right now, I\u2019m in it. I\u2019m neck deep and I\u2019m obsessed and it\u2019s so much fun and exciting. Every day there\u2019s a fun new thing. I\u2019m reading the blogs and the podcasts. I\u2019m starting a whole cool company based around it. Just a bunch of crazy, cool things. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>I love it and I have so much fun with it and I assume everyone\u2019s got something like that. So I ask this guy, \u201cWhat are the things you are passionate about?\u201d And he really struggled trying to find it. Finally he came back, \u201cYou know what I\u2019m really passionate about? Sports, I love watching football.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh man,\u201d I wanted to ask, \u201cHow many hours a day do you watch football, how many hours a week do you watch football?\u201d I don\u2019t even know where to go with this. Maybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019m not the kind of guy that likes to watch sports. I love being entertained, I love going to a two hour movie and watching and getting entertained and then coming back to the real world and doing stuff again. But it feels like with sports, especially football. It\u2019s four hours and you watch other people live their dreams and you sit there and you don\u2019t. And you talk about things that don\u2019t matter. And again, some people sports is their thing and it matters, I get that. I\u2019m a wrestler, I get passionate, I watch other people. I get that. But, I think a huge majority of people are just wasting their life away watching sports. Watching other people achieve their goals, and their dreams and things like that. Again, an average football game is four hours, and how many football games do you watch a week or weekend?</p> <p>My brother, I love him to death, but he watches football all of the time. We were at his house, and he\u2019s a lot younger than me, we were talking and he\u2019s talking about all these super bowls that happened before he was born, that he went back and watched the videos of them. Dude, you watch videos from people who are from before you\u2026You wasted four hours of time watching something that you could have just seen the score. You knew the outcome and you watched four hours of this thing. And it was just like,\u201d Ahhh\u201d. I see people watching golf, and baseball and it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. You know, it\u2019s been interesting. I love going to sporting things. I went to the wrestling match of the kids the other day. I like going to baseball games and football games. For me, it\u2019s a lot less of going to watch the sport. And the sport part is fun, I get that, but it\u2019s the people, the atmosphere. I enjoy that part of it. But sitting down in front of the TV and pushing play while your wife and kids do other things and you\u2019re just zoned out. It just makes me sick thinking about how many hours are wasted. They could be doing so many more productive things. Helping to enhance you and your life and family and people around you, people you could serve. If you took that four hours a week, assuming you\u2019re watching one game and not twelve. The four hours you spend watching a game and use it to read a book or to read blog posts, for crying out loud, just something. You can develop skills that can actually help other people and change the world in your little way. That\u2019s kind of my thought. I just feel like, there\u2019s nothing inherently bad with sitting there watching a football game. What does Garrett White say, \u201cYou\u2019re sedating yourself, so you don\u2019t have to deal with all the rest of the things.\u201d I\u2019ve been to people\u2019s houses where I go over there and their watching football and their wife and kids are in the other room, and they\u2019re missing it!</p> <p>So if you\u2019re number one passion or hobby or talent is watching sports, I recommend deleting ESPN or ESPN2, or ESPN the Ocho, or whatever. Whatever you\u2019re watching, turn it off. It\u2019s not that important. Have them text you the highlights of the game. Watch the news, the recap for three minutes. They show you all the important plays that happened and you don\u2019t have to waste so much of your time, energy and talents on that.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this. I think I\u2019m just very guarded of my time, every waking minute. Because I know that there\u2019s so much to do, so much that I want to become, and I feel like, four hours, or three hours or one hour, of whatever sport you\u2019re in, that\u2019s a big sacrifice. If you\u2019re billing your time that four hour period of time, it\u2019s not making at least 5 grand an hour, if you\u2019re not making 20 grand from there, there are way better ways to spend that time. So I encourage you guys to turn off the TV and stop watching sports. Watch the highlights, I\u2019ll allow you to do that because I even like the highlights, even sports I don\u2019t like, it\u2019s still fun. Like golf, I will never watch golf or baseball or pretty much any sport to be honest, but I love watching the highlights, because you get to see the one cool thing that happened in 4 hours. I get that, so I give you permission to watch the highlights, but turn the darn TV off, pay attention to your wife, your spouse, and it\u2019s time to cultivate a hobby or talent that isn\u2019t involved watching other people succeed. It\u2019s around you helping and serving and changing somebody\u2019s life. Think about what aspect of your life you are passionate about. Is it financial, is it health, is it business, is it recreational, is home building, is it gardening? I don\u2019t care what it is, pick something. Start doing that, because first off, when you start doing it, you\u2019re going to become a better person. I don\u2019t know anyone who becomes a better person watching four hours of football. It doesn\u2019t happen. Maybe you know players names better or you can guess the scores or you can cheer for people, but it doesn\u2019t make you a better person at all. I almost think, it\u2019s the second you turn the TV on, your progress in life starts moving backwards. I feel like we\u2019re always either moving forward or backwards. The second you push play on ESPN you start moving backwards, because you\u2019re no longer contributing, you\u2019re just being entertained. It\u2019s like a movie you guys, that\u2019s it. So there you go. I\u2019m sure I pissed off a lot of people who love sports, but I care more about you and about what you can become and who you can serve. So turn off the TVs, let\u2019s find a passion, find a hobby. Something that, first off, is going to better your own life, and second off, you can use that to better other people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s the secret spot where you\u2019re going to find a business guys. If you\u2019re not passionate about something yet, turn off the TV and go to Barnes and Noble. Lock yourself in there and walk around and read every book until\u2026.read the first chapter of a different book in every single section, and the book you\u2019re not able to put down, that\u2019s the one. Go buy it and go start consuming it and go buy all the other books around that topic.</p> <p>That\u2019s how you should begin your journey. Turn off the TV, go get a book and that\u2019s it for today. I\u2019m going to go in there and get back to work on writing a book. Book number two, first draft is done and we\u2019re working on getting it all done. Hopefully have the first printed draft live at the funnel hacking event. So I\u2019m excited. Appreciate you all, have a great day and I\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "11:49", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_191.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1454438651, "title": "Episode #190 \u2013 I Finally Know Now Why People Wear White Shirts Every Single Day", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What is t-shirt video publishing schedule?\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell realizes why other marketers wear white shirts every single day.

I had a thought.\u00a0 I think I figured out why people wear slacks and a white shirt, finally. It took me a long time to figure it out. Yesterday, for example, we had 4 of our Clickfunnels certified consultants, who are just crushing it, come in and we filmed their stories; which are really inspiring. One of them is doing over a million bucks a year from what he got in the certification program; which is crazy inspiring because it was 8 months ago. One of them is a stay at home mom.\u00a0 She\u2019s got 12 full time clients now paying her between 1200 and 2500 bucks a month which is super cool.\u00a0 One is a network marketing guy who was struggling with network marketing and now he\u2019s doing this and just crushing it.\u00a0 Another one is Donna. She\u2019s a graphic designer. She went to the certification program. She doesn\u2019t just sell them graphic design now, now it\u2019s funnel building.\u00a0 She\u2019s able to 10x what she charged each of her clients.\u00a0 It\u2019s really fun hearing all of that. I was going to go meet them and I had to pick my wardrobe. I was going through all my stuff and I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve worn this shirt at two different events and I\u2019ve probably filmed 12 videos in it. And this shirt I\u2019ve worn to three events and I\u2019ve probably filmed 15 videos in. Everything single thing of clothing I have I can remember multiple, like 5 to 10 videos that I\u2019ve worn it in. I don\u2019t have a ton of clothes. But my wife is always mad at me because I always go buy more clothes. I\u2019m like you don\u2019t understand because I make a video and that video is out there forever and everyone has seen that thing. And it\u2019s funny because I\u2019ll go to an event and I\u2019ll have a shirt on and people will be like, \u201cHey I saw that shirt in whatever.\u201d And people will say stuff like that.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t typically wear a white shirt and a tie, or a white shirt and a sports jacket or whatever.\u00a0 I just wear t-shirts or I wear button up shirts like that.\u00a0 But the problem is when you wear something like that\u2019s got color or flare or whatever you want to call it, or it\u2019s a t-shirt with a funny saying. After you\u2019ve worn it once, then it\u2019s in stone on a video. You can\u2019t wear it again. For Funnel Hacking Live, I have to get all new shirts, because everything I\u2019ve worn, a percentage of the audience has seen me wear before and its awkward because their like, \u201cDoes Russell wear that shirt every day? I thought he was successful.\u201d It\u2019s like this horrible thing.</p> <p>I was thinking about my friend, Ryan Deiss, he does his events and videos and he always has a white shirt and a suit jacket on. I used to think he\u2019s trying to be all business-y, which is the anti of me, but now I kind of get it. If he wears a white shirt and jacket, people just assume you have on a new white shirt every time, but it could be the same shirt. He can wear the same shirt every day, for the last ten years and nobody would know, because it\u2019s a white shirt.\u00a0 And people assume, \u201coh if you\u2019ve got a white shirt and tie, you\u2019re a business person and you\u2019ve probably got like 50 of them and they\u2019re all dry-cleaned every single day. For all we know, Ryan\u2019s wearing a shirt and no pants.\u00a0 Or it\u2019s the same shirt and he never washes, he goes to the office and he\u2019s just got one hanging up there, throws it on and boom, does a video, but nobody knows. So, there\u2019s something to think about for today.</p> <p>I have no idea why I brought that up, outside of the fact for any of you guys, especially doing daily periscope videos I keep preaching and telling everyone to do. After 5 days everyone\u2019s seen your wardrobe. If you go back through my periscopes, you kind of know my rotation. Monday I\u2019m probably wearing this. Tuesday I\u2019m probably wearing this. It drives my wife crazy because there\u2019s only 5 shirts I like. I got this really cool one that I got online. Its yellow and it says \u201cIt\u2019s On Like Donkey Kong\u201d and it\u2019s got a big picture of Donkey Kong. I love that shirt. I would wear it every day if I could, but people would see it. \u201cHey Russell, three periscopes in a row and you\u2019re still wearing the Donkey Kong shirt. Why?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDangit!\u201d Even if I bought three different versions of that shirt people would still think it\u2019s weird.\u00a0 I\u2019m like, \u201cNo I washed it, I can wear it two days in a row, because laundry night was last night. So I can wear it.\u201d But no you can\u2019t. It has to be two weeks out. I have to plan, \u201cI wore this last week, I have to wait another week.\u201d Because you don\u2019t want people to think you\u2019re weird. I have two American Fighter shirts that I love, that are my favorite. A blue one and a red one, and again those ones I would wear every day. But the problem is the same thing. You\u2019d think I wore the same shirt every day. So I have this dilemma where some of you guys who are bloggers or podcasters, you can wear the same clothes every day and nobody would know. But because I had to choose videos as my medium it just ruins everything. I\u2019m trying to think if I should go and find a white shirt. Or a shirt that is plain enough, and you\u2019re like, \u201coh, maybe that\u2019s just one of many dress shirts that are similar.\u201d Then I could just wear the same thing every single day. I don\u2019t know. Then I have to start wearing dress shirts which is not going to happen. So there you go.</p> <p>I guess the moral of this story is, if you\u2019re going to pick a daily video thing, make sure that you\u2019re okay with the fact that people are going to see the same shirt every 5th episode or whatever. It was funny, a while ago I started this\u2026.I\u2019ve tried to do this whole consistent publishing thing forever. It\u2019s kind of hard. In fact, the new daily periscope thing has been the best one that\u2019s been consistent along with the marketing in your car podcast. But one thing that I remember is when I started doing that, is because I was doing this daily one. I would do this daily sketch, and I did 12 days in a row, at that point I\u2019d be through every shirt. I\u2019d start over, and they kept coming. After 3 cycles of that, jI was like, \u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201d Then we did this thing where I was like, \u201cHey if you want me to wear your shirt on my show, send me your shirt and I\u2019ll wear it.\u201d So we got all these people sending the weirdest shirts. Some things I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t wear this.\u201d But of course, that\u2019s what people wanted you to wear. \u201cLet me order the weirdest thing possible and make Russell wear it.\u201d So that kind of died. I quit doing the show and a lot of it was because I felt dumb about wearing the same clothes every single time.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if you can relate to this, but I hope that\u2026\u2026Again, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve provided any value today, but hopefully there\u2019s an entertainment factor.</p> <p>So I\u2019m at the office now. I gotta get to work. I\u2019m wearing one of my 5 favorite shirts, so if I do a periscope tonight, you guys will see it. It\u2019s a maroon one that says, \u201cObey\u201d on it. So if you see that tonight that\u2019s why. I apologize, but I\u2019m out of shirts, I got nothing else.</p> <p>So I\u2019ll have new stuff for Funnel Hacking Live. So if you don\u2019t have your tickets yet, go to Funnelhacking.com and get your tickets. So you can see what new outfits I have. If nothing else, that should be of value.</p> <p>Also, Marcus Lemonis is speaking, Sean Stephenson, Alex Charfen, Kyle Cease, me, Liz Benny, a whole bunch of other amazing people.

I\u2019m feeling good, it\u2019s a little chilly, but the sun\u2019s up, everyone looks happy outside, and I\u2019m excited.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be a great day. I\u2019ve got to film 21 more videos today for our new Ignite Your Funnel sign up process.\u00a0 We\u2019re rolling out this really cool thing when someone joins Clickfunnels\u2026 We\u2019re all about how figuring out how to increase retention and stick rate and get people consuming the product.

It\u2019s going to be really fun.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening today on my side. Today\u2019s episode is going to be kind of off topic because I thought this was funny.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious for all you guys out there, what your first business name was? All of us got started, where we\u2019re at today is not where we started.\u00a0 I got started over 12 years ago, which is funny. It makes me laugh because, my very email address ever\u2026not ever, but my very first business email address. I remember I set up a business, because I wanted a very professional business email address.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have the email address anymore, but it\u2019s funny because, my email address I set up was money4college@juno.com and it wasn\u2019t\u2026It was M O N E Y then 4 and then college @juno.com.\u00a0 And in my head I\u2019m like, this is a really good business email address, people will know I\u2019m in this business to make money for college.\u00a0 That was my email address for a long time, not a short time, a long time.\u00a0 In fact, a few people who knew me back then, Mike Filsaime, a lot of times he\u2019ll see me and still call me, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, money for college?\u201d It\u2019s so funny now because in my head I was like, this is a really good idea. This will be a very professional business entity.\u00a0 I tried to buy money4college.com, but somebody owned it, luckily. Otherwise my whole business would be based around money for college.\u00a0 That\u2019s was my first email address, I had that probably for 5 or 6 years of my business. I was doing all my professional business through a free Juno email address.\u00a0 It was funny, the first time we had 5 or 6 employees at the time and I was using Juno still. One of the guys we hired was a tech dude and he was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have email addresses at our domain? \u201c How do we do that? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d He set it up so we had Russell at whatever.com.\u00a0 So that was my first awesome business naming thing.</p> <p>A while later I remember\u2026 I was learning about online marketing and all these different things. At the time, my degree was in Computer Information Systems. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to be a programmer. I\u2019m going to program stuff.\u201d Unfortunately, it turns out I\u2019m not that smart. I could never actually figure things out. I had this SQL class, I was really excited.\u00a0 The first two days were like the coolest thing, I was like; \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d And by the third day I was lost. The rest of the semester I could never get past the third day. It was over for me. I was not going to be a programmer. I thought I was going to be, and I knew that was the route I wanted to go. I wanted to launch a software company. I spent weeks trying to find the perfect domain name. Everything I checked was gone. This was 12 years ago. It\u2019s funny now, because now you can still find good domain names if you look hard enough. So, I was trying to find a domain, and I finally found it. The one. The domain I knew from the beginning it was going to be\u2026 our entire empire would be built off of. My software company was going to be amazing. So, I was so excited so I went and bought it. I don\u2019t think I knew how to buy a domain back then. I think I spent like $40 or $50 on this domain. I bought it, and I was so excited. I had bought some website builder software. I can\u2019t even remember what it was called. Some website building platform I bought the domain through. I was so excited, I spent that whole day. My wife, we just got married.\u00a0 It was our first year of marriage.\u00a0 Poor thing, she\u2019s been through so much. It\u2019s shocking to me that she\u2019s still around. So she\u2019s working while I\u2019m at home trying to make millions between wrestling practices. So I\u2019m in there trying to build this site, and I\u2019m learning how to\u2026 this is pre, me using Front Page.\u00a0 This is total horrible website building. I\u2019m building this thing out. I bought a bunch of resale rights to a whole bunch of different software products.\u00a0 We\u2019re selling software, this is pretty exciting. In fact, we\u2019re selling exciting software. My domain I bought was exciteware.net. I\u2019m sure that domains\u2026 I don\u2019t think I own it anymore. I was so excited, \u201cWe\u2019re selling exciting software, this going to be amazing.\u201d So my wife gets home. I\u2019m like, \u201cCollette, I gotta show you what I just created; this is going to be amazing.\u201d I\u2019m building up the hype and suspense, like I like to do. If I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is the domain that I bought\u201d, she\u2019s going to be like, \u201cAlright.\u201d So I gotta build up the hype so when I announce she can hear the angels singing and it can be this big deal. So I\u2019m talking it up, \u201cI\u2019m selling software. I\u2019m selling this software, and this software. All these different software resale rights that I bought. We\u2019re selling exciting software. The domain I bought is Exciteware.net.\u201d I remember she looked at it. And she didn\u2019t hear the angels singing. She didn\u2019t get excited. In fact, she had this concerned look on her face and she said, \u201cWhen I hear Exciteware, I think lingerie\u201d.\u00a0 I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not going tell my mom you own a website called Exciteware. She\u2019s going to think you sell underwear. Exciting underwear. \u201c I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s exciting software. This is really cool.\u201d She\u2019s like \u201cNo, this is embarrassing.\u201d My whole world collapsed. I spent months trying to figure out..</p> <p>Oh crap, a cops coming out. Please say he\u2019s not getting me. I wonder if it\u2019s illegal for me to be talking on the phone like this. Hopefully that\u2019s not why he\u2019s pulling behind me. I don\u2019t know the laws. Cross your fingers, otherwise you guys get to hear a cop pull me over. There\u2019s a cop in front of me too. I wonder if this is a sting operation.\u00a0 \u201cWe listen to Marketing In Your Car, Russell. We know the route from your house to your office, this is a sting op. We\u2019re going to take you down.\u201d I hope that\u2019s not true. We\u2019ll find out in a little bit.</p> <p>Alright, so where I left off\u2026 So my wife is just like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s a horrible name.\u201d\u00a0 I was devastated because I spent $40, which back then was more than I made in an entire year. It was all my money. We had zero disposal income. I was making exactly $0 a year my wife was making less than $20 grand a year. We did not have money, so I didn\u2019t have $40 to spend but I spent it. I was devastated. I remember being depressed. This was the foundation for my empire. You just destroyed it because you think it sounds like exciting underwear. I thought that was kind of funny.</p> <p>So last night, we were in bed talking and I was like, \u201cDo you remember Money4College?\u201d and she was like, \u201cYeah, do you remember Exciteware?\u201d Oh dear me. We\u2019ve come a long way since then. I thought it was funny.</p> <p>So, I kept trying to think of other company names. I remember for some reason I always thought the word sublime was the coolest word. SUBLIME. It\u2019s like a slide.\u00a0 SUUUU and BLIME and you bounce off the end of the slide. Sublime. I thought sublime was cool. So I was like, \u201cThe only idea I have is sublime. I like that word.\u201d So I ended up buying sublimenet.com that was the company name for the next 4 or 5 years. Which is weird, it didn\u2019t mean anything. But that was the only other idea I had that wasn\u2019t exciting software. So Sublimenet, is a horrible name. Anyway, that\u2018s what it was. Sublimenet.com was the business name for the next few years. I remember I used to buy domain names and they would be part\u2026.Sublimenet would be the company, but I\u2019d have different\u2026Zipbrander or ForumFortunes. All these different products underneath there. I kept trying to find the perfect name. I remember one night; I was on buydomains.com or one of those sites. I\u2019m typing in tons of ideas trying to find one. All of the sudden I found it. It was DotComSecrets.com. I remember, I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s the name!\u201d It was amazing for me. It\u2019s funny now because now, a lot of times, I\u2019m like, \u201cshould I try to build the info business around that name, or should I not?\u201d</p> <p>The two cops took a right. The sting operation was unsuccessful they didn\u2019t catch me.</p> <p>Anyway, even when I titled my book, DotComSecrets, Jeff Walker told me, \u201cIt\u2019s the worst name ever!\u201d But I\u2019m like, that\u2019s my thing. Anyway, I still like DotComSecrets. I actually think it\u2019s really cool. Some people think it\u2019s dumb, but it became the name. It was much better than Sublimenet or Exciteware.\u00a0 Now where the info for the coaching side of our business kind of grew from, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>I remember with Clickfunnels\u2026.I almost wish we would have named the company Clickfunnels but we didn\u2019t. Because initially we had 3 software products we were going to build under this brand. It was going to be Clickfunnels, Backpack, and Actionetics, were the 3 software companies we were going to launch with one parent company. We were trying to think of a cool name for it. Most of you probably don\u2019t even know this, but Clickfunnels parent company is Etison. It\u2019s a domain that Todd had bought a long time ago. And we thought it was cool because Thomas Edison is cool. But the whole Edison/Tesla scam thing\u2026.the T was kind of for Tesla. So it\u2019s like this weird thing. Initially we were going to give away Tesla\u2019s when people promoted Clickfunnels. Anyway, the company name is Etison. So we were going to have Clickfunnels, Backpack, and Actionetics, as the 3 software products. But after we launched Clickfunnels and it blew up way bigger than we ever thought. Instead of making separate software companies, we made the decision to build everything internally. Now all those products are inside of Clickfunnels. I wish we would have named the company Clickfunnels. We didn\u2019t. It\u2019s similar to 37 Signals. 37 Signals is kind of a random business name. Then they had Basecamp, High Rise, all their different software tools. Recently they changed it so their business name is just Basecamp. Maybe we\u2019ll switch it to Clickfunnels someday. I don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s the history of naming of my companies.</p> <p>That\u2019s about it, you guys. So I hope that was fun. I know there\u2019s not really any educational purpose to that outside of just making fun of myself. I\u2019m sure all of you guys got cheesy names in your business domain name, email address history. I hope it makes you smile when you think about some of the goofy things you\u2019ve done along the way. There you go. I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go film 21 videos to help people ignite their funnel. Good stuff\u2019s happening today. I\u2019m also going to make a cool upsell video for our Funnel Catcher course. Yesterday we made a sweet sales video for Funnel University that I\u2019m really excited for. There\u2019s a lot of cool stuff happening. February is going to be insane. I\u2019m trying to get out a lot of things before our March event. The March event ticket sales are going crazy. In the last 3 days we sold 40 more tickets, I don\u2019t even know how sales are coming in, but it\u2019s exciting seeing it. Because I\u2019ve been stressing out, we\u2019re not going to sell enough tickets.</p> <p>Oh we\u2019ve got really cool direct mail piece that\u2019s coming out this week. It should be hitting everyone this week, actually. If you watch to Marketing Quickies Show, I showed this really cool mail piece that I got from some car dealership. It\u2019s like a forwarded email that the guy printed out and sent to me, it had a sticky note on it. It\u2019s a really cool marketing concept. So, we kind of modeled that. Basically it\u2019s a letter we\u2019re going to email to Ben; we have two Ben\u2019s on our team that are doing outbound phone sales for the event right now. So I forwarded this email to Ben.\u00a0 \u201cHey make sure people get in, extend the discount through February 5.\u201d So then we printed that out and put a sticky note of Ben saying \u201cHey, if you haven\u2019t got your tickets yet, give me a call.\u201d Then we fold that up, put in a letter and handwrite the address on it. Anyway, it\u2019s a really cool mailing piece and I\u2019m so excited.</p> <p>I was trying to send it to all Clickfunnels members, but we didn\u2019t have addresses for everyone. We ended up having addresses for 4,000. So 4,000 Clickfunnels members will be getting that letter this week, maybe you\u2019ll get one. I\u2019m really proud of that direct mail piece, I\u2019m sure the event will show the stats of how it all worked. It\u2019s pretty cool. I love marketing, it\u2019s so much fun.</p> <p>That\u2019s it guys. Appreciate you all. Have an amazing day and I\u2019ll talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "13:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_189.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1453925446, "title": "Episode #188 \u2013 One Hack I Use To Get Painful Projects Done", "author": "", "summary": "<p>If you have severe ADD like me, this may help\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how to get work done that you associate with pain and don\u2019t want to do.

Welcome back. Hope you guys are having a good time. I\u2019m heading to the office and its cold today. And of course I didn\u2019t wear shoes or socks, I got flip flops on. My car\u2026the gas light just turned on which means I have to get gas right now, in my flip flops in the freezing cold.\u00a0 You\u2019d think I\u2019d be a little smarter than this at this point, but I\u2019m not. So there we go, one more time for my wife to tell me \u201cI told you so. For not wearing your socks and shoes today.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know about you but I can\u2019t\u2019 stand wearing socks it\u2019s not worth the 30 seconds of warmth you get from the walk from the car to the door.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, I hate that at night if I wear socks\u2026.or go to church. Socks are tight around your ankle and you take them off and there\u2019s that sock line.\u00a0 And that sock line doesn\u2019t leave immediately.\u00a0 It stays there for like an hour, maybe I got swelling in my calves or my cankles, I don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s no good. I\u2019d rather go bare foot all the time.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what I do. Except for church. It\u2019s cause we\u2019re in America.\u00a0 My aunt and uncle live in Samoa. I went to church out there, with them. In Samoa they wear, you know those lava lava\u2019s, those nice flowery ones people wear in Hawaii and Samoa.\u00a0 So they have them at church and the men wear formal lava lavas. They actually look like\u2026honestly looks like a big skirt. They have a belt on them and they\u2019re long and they all wear sandals.\u00a0 They can wear it Samoa, why can\u2019t I in Boise. It\u2019s not that weird.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m going to start wearing lava lava\u2019s and flip flops to church. Is that sad I\u2019m laughing at myself?</p> <p>Back on to mission for today. We\u2019re kind of on a series of time management and getting crap done. I wanted to share another thing that hopefully will help you guys a lot.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know about you, but there are some things in my to do list of things that I need to do, that for some reason when I look at them I have so much pain associated with those things. That I\u2019ll do almost anything to avoid them. I know you guys all know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019ll look at something, If I do that\u2026..your subconscious mind associates pain with some things. Probably the best example, we have a new offer coming out called, Funnel University. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of it, if not it\u2019s going to be awesome. I wanted to make a really good free plus shipping offer to get people into that program.\u00a0 There\u2019s a bunch of cool stuff I\u2019m filming today.\u00a0 One of the things I\u2019m doing is\u2026.I found out\u2026I\u2019m off on another track, but I\u2019ll come back I promise.</p> <p>We did a periscope a little while ago.\u00a0 I talked to you guys about how we did 150k from this periscope. All I did was take the perfect webinar script that I normally do on a webinar. I did it on a periscope and we made 150 grand. That concept works, I can do the one thing, the 3 secrets, the stack close everything the same way we do in a webinar, but I can do it on a video. My next thing I\u2019m going to make a sales video, a VSL, but I\u2019m going to follow that model. So we\u2019re doing that with Funnel University.\u00a0 We\u2019re actually filming that today, which I\u2019m excited about.\u00a0 It should turn out epically amazing.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent a lot of time and effort to make this one sweet.\u00a0 You will all see it soon.</p> <p>For that free plus shipping thing, I wanted to write a book similar to the DotcomSecrets Labs book, something that\u2019s really powerful and useful.\u00a0 So I wrote this book called Funnel Stacking, The Three Core Funnels and I walk you through tripwire, perfect webinar, and high ticket funnel. I show the sequencing and the email sequences that pushes you from one to the next.\u00a0 How we ascend people up in the whole\u2026.everything. People always ask about that, so I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m going to show them everything. Here\u2019s the email templates, here\u2019s the stats, the numbers page by page. Just everything. So I was really excited by that. When we were in London, I actually wrote the first chapter. It took me\u2026. it was when we got to London and our times zones were messed up in our brains, it was 2am which, I think is like morning time for me. So I spent like 5 hours that night writing this thing. I wrote chapter one.\u00a0 When it was done, it sucked.\u00a0 I hated it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know about you guys. Writing is hard for me, it\u2019s not something I just flow with.\u00a0 I had so much pain afterwards.\u00a0 That chapter sucked! It took me two months to get the next to sections done.\u00a0 Because every time I looked at that I was like, \u201cRemember that night in London, It was painful, my eyes hurt, I was tired, my kids were up\u201d.\u00a0 All these things associated with that one task that caused pain. So much pain that I would avoid it at all costs.\u00a0 I\u2019d be like, time to write the book, and all the sudden something popped up. Of course I\u2019m going to go to sushi with you guys today. Me, who hates taking phone calls, the phone would ring, and I\u2019d be like let me answer real quick. Anything on earth I could do to avoid that task, I would do it. I think all of us have that same kind of problem.\u00a0 When there\u2019s things we know we have to get done but we don\u2019t want to, somehow our brain finds a million ways to deviate from it, because we have so much pain associated with that thing. The brain is always looking for pleasure. Where\u2019s the outlet, where can I get pleasure.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking for every escape possible.\u00a0 For me, some people are stuck in that spot forever, I\u2019m guessing if you\u2019ve got a task, a website or business that you haven\u2019t launched yet, it\u2019s because of that. You\u2019ve got so much pain associated with the birthing of this thing that you just never do it. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re frustrated and not happy with yourself and not accomplishing what you want to accomplish. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out different ways for me to smash through those things. I\u2019m going to tell you my strategy, what works for me. Hopefully some variation of it works for you.</p> <p>So when I have a task, that I have so much pain associated with it, that I know my body, my brain, my mind, and everything is going to sabotage me. Keep me from doing that. I know that I have to overload my senses. I have severe ADD, as I\u2019m assuming most of you do. Most entrepreneurs have some form of ADD and even if you\u2019ve never been diagnosed, I\u2019ve never diagnosed, but I know the symptoms.\u00a0 I know the root issues, I know how it works. I\u2018m a big believer that ADD is not a bad thing; I think it\u2019s a super power. It\u2019s kind of like the X-MEN.\u00a0 You got these dudes that can fly, some can be invisible, some have metal things that shoot out of their hands. They\u2019re super humans. The whole show of the X-MEN, the humans, the normal people are trying to take away their powers so they can be normal with them.\u00a0 It\u2019s like, \u201cDude you can fly, why would you try to get rid of that?\u00a0 It\u2019s not a bad thing\u201d. I feel the same way about ADD, it\u2019s a super power. Everyone\u2019s trying to give your kids drugs and talk about how it\u2019s bad.\u00a0 But you look at everyone who\u2019s hyper-successful today that I know all have severe ADD. It\u2019s a good thing, but you gotta learn how to channel it. So with typical people, you can look at a task and you focus on it and you accomplish it, right? For people like me, and probably you who have ADD if we focus on one task, it stresses us out. It\u2019s hard to do.</p> <p>So in school; and I was a horrible student in school, but one of the reasons, teachers are like focus, don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t make noise, listen to me. I\u2019m trying to listen to this teacher talk and I\u2019m stressing out. There\u2019s just this one thing happening and your brain is going a million miles a minute.\u00a0 So one thing I learned, I had a chance to meet the #1 ADD doctor in the world and he confirmed this, and its cool; I\u2019d have to have something in my hands and fidgeting with it, to be drawing on my paper. I\u2019d have to be doing 8 other things just to be able to understand to my teacher. Because ADD people, we have to be doing multiple things or else you can\u2019t focus on anything. The more things you\u2019re doing the more you can focus on one thing. In school I\u2019d have to fidget or tap my pencil, be doing something. If you look at me now, when I\u2019m in the office, I\u2019m on a conference call, I\u2019m doing 8 things. I\u2019m usually drawing while I\u2019m flipping the paper. I\u2019m doing all these things just so I can focus on the one thing that\u2018s actually important. It\u2019s really weird, but that\u2019s how our brains work. If you understand that, it\u2019s kind of cool. For me to actually write the book, I had to completely short circuit all my other senses. Otherwise, I\u2019d be looking at Skype, looking at Facebook, jumping back and forth. What I did\u2026If you\u2019ve seen my office, I\u2019ve got 3 monitors, I\u2019ve got a treadmill desk, a rising desk, things like that.\u00a0 So what I did I took all my chats, my Facebook, everything, I moved them on the two side monitors. And then I used my rising desk to raise my monitor up, put my treadmill under my desk, turned on music. So what happened, I started walking on the treadmill. So I\u2019m walking on the treadmill, I\u2019ve got music playing, I\u2019ve got all these things happening around me. And I\u2019m focusing just on one monitor, and the only open on that monitor is a word document, as well as an image file, I have all the images for the book.\u00a0 I was not allowed to get off the treadmill until the book was done. I started walking and what happened for me, all the other senses were\u2026..for you to walk, and to think and to read and to have music playing. All these things happening at once, your brain has to focus. So I did that and it short circuited all my body\u2019s ability to go and complain, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you check Facebook?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t check Facebook! I\u2019m walking, if I check Facebook I\u2019ll fall off this thing. Just back to the book.\u201d It kept forcing me to go and do and accomplish.</p> <p>There\u2019s the trick, guys. There\u2019s the hack, something I do. So if you\u2019ve got something like that\u2026.I remember one time when I\u2019m going to go to Barnes and Noble to sit at the caf\u00e9 and I\u2019m going to write this thing out. It didn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m looking at these people walking by and I can\u2019t focus. For me, it\u2019s all about getting a spot where I have to focus on the one thing without having all these other external things happening. Maybe a coffee shop would work for some of you guys. It didn\u2019t for me. I kept wanting to go look at different books and magazine. I was doing research. I kept standing up and walking over to the books.</p> <p>That\u2019s something that worked for me. The biggest thing I would do with you guys, your strategy is going to be different, but the concept is the same. There\u2019s a task or something that\u2019s causing so much pain inside you that your body is forcing you to not do it. So understand that you\u2019ve got to force yourself to do, but you\u2019ve got to figure out a way to do it, in a way that keeps you focused. We talk about, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work with addictions and things like that. A big part is you\u2019re always moving towards pleasure and away from pain, because that\u2019s how our bodies work. You\u2019re moving towards pleasure and away from pain. So if you can surround yourself with\u2026.when you have something that is naturally towards pain, so you\u2019re swimming upstream, you\u2019ve got short circuit the other things around you, so you can focus, then also tying pleasure to it. How do you make this pleasurable? So for me, as soon as this book is done, boom we\u2019re going to sushi.\u00a0 Or, as soon as this chapter\u2019s done, what\u2019s going to happen\u2026 For me, it\u2019s a blend of those two things. One is, doing a lot of things so your mind can focus on the one thing at hand. Number two is tying a big reward to it, so that that pleasure is more pleasurable than the pain and experiences you go through.</p> <p>There\u2019s some ideas, some techniques I use. Hopefully that helps you guys a little bit. I\u2019m at the office now. Today\u2019s filming day. So I\u2019m going to be recording 30 something videos today for four or five different projects. That\u2019s how we roll over here. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be doing today, you guys. Appreciate you all. Have an amazing day, and I\u2019ll talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "12:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_188.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1453844597, "title": "Episode #187 \u2013 Fire Your B Players And Surround Yourself With The A\u2019s", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The real secret behind delegation and getting stuff done.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how he gets so much work done.

I\u2019m already halfway to the office so this one might be short.\u00a0 Nevertheless this is part of a new series I\u2019ve started, between marketingquickiesshow.com and marketinginyourcar.com.\u00a0 These are my two content things, so if you\u2019re not on both you\u2019re missing out because we\u2019re going back and forth on the storyline. Yesterday on my marketing quickies show, Mike Stanczyk, some of you may know Mike, he asked me, \u201cI want to know more how you\u2019re so productive, how you get stuff done, your work ethic\u201d. So, I\u2019ll talk about some of those things.\u00a0 So yesterday, on the live periscope, I talked about a concept called \u201clead or gold\u201d. It kind of goes into the core foundational mindset of how to get a lot of crap done.\u00a0 So if you go to marketingquickiesshow.com and click on the one that says \u201cHow to get a lot of crap done\u201d.\u00a0 That\u2019s a foundational piece on what I\u2019m talking about today. So my goal for the next week is to share a bunch of ideas of how to get a lot of things done.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the first one.\u00a0 So go listen to that, it\u2019ll be number one.</p> <p>Today I want to talk about, it kind of shifts over to the side of delegation and outsourcing and things like that. I remember when I first got into this business, I could always tell the life cycle of where a new entrepreneur is. Because as soon as they\u2019ve outsourced the first time they all want to create a course in outsourcing, Because, \u201cYou could pay people a little bit of money and they\u2019ll do stuff way better than you do it.\u201d It\u2019s a big \u201cAh Ha\u201d.\u00a0 Initially that\u2019s what a lot of entrepreneurs do.\u00a0 They hire their first outsourcer.\u00a0 For me it was someone in Romania. I paid $20 and he built a software product that I ended up selling for $67 and I made tens of thousands of dollars on something that I paid a guy $20 to build.\u00a0 I remember having that \u201cAh Ha\u201d, \u201cWow, I cannot believe that that was even possible.\u201d So I think a lot of us start out on that journey. And the problem is that as we start outsourcing some things, where most entrepreneurs get stuck is it\u2019s hard to let go of the reins.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had that before. You give someone something and they don\u2019t do as good a job as you. You try to get them to do it again, and they don\u2019t and after 2 or 3 times you just take it back. And it\u2019s like, \u201cScrew that, I\u2019ll just do it myself.\u201d And I still struggle with that, I\u2019m sure you do as well.\u00a0 Which is why I do so much stuff.</p> <p>So a couple of things I want to speak to you on that, that have allowed me to get so many things done. And this isn\u2019t something that happened overnight, but I\u2019ve been doing this business for over 12 years so I\u2019ve hired literally hundreds and hundreds of people to do different tasks. I\u2019ve hired people that are the cheapest, and I\u2019ve hired the most expensive, and I\u2019ve hired people in between. What I\u2019ve found, I wish I had the link to the article that Todd, one of my partners in Clickfunnels sent, that talked about the difference between A players and B players.\u00a0 It showed that A players were 3,200 times more productive than a B player. So a lot of us try to get B and C players because it\u2019s cheaper, but in reality its way more expensive.\u00a0 A lot of times you can find one person who can do the work of 10, 15 or 20 people. It may seem hard to believe, but it\u2019s true. Todd\u2019s a good example of that.\u00a0 In the past we had 6 full time programmers in Boise trying to build the shopping cart software, we spent 3 years and probably three or four hundred thousand dollars trying to do it and we never got to a point where anyone could use it.\u00a0 Todd came in and looked at the shopping cart software that we were thinking about using, spent the next two days rebuilding it from the ground up and it worked. It took him two days what took 6 people 3 years and never got live.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s talk about finding A players. I think the biggest thing\u2026.You gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince. I remember people saying that when I was dating before finding my beautiful, amazing wife.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s the same thing. You gotta hire a lot of people until you find the rock stars. So what I do a lot of times now, let\u2019s say I have a project, I\u2019ll go to Upwork, used to be Scriptlance and Odesk, I think it\u2019s Upwork. I\u2019ll go to Upwork, I\u2019ll post a project, but I\u2019ll hire 3 people to do the same project. People are like, \u201cRussell why would you do that?\u00a0 It\u2019s going to cost you 3 times as much money.\u201d the reality it doesn\u2019t, it cost less money. What happens is I have 3 people build the same thing, one person sucks at it, one person does something kind of weird, and one person is a rock star. But you don\u2019t know until you get 3 people you have something to compare them against. So I have 3 people do a product. Usually it\u2019s not my big idea; it\u2019s not this huge thing.\u00a0 I\u2019ll post and get 3 people to do a smaller project.\u00a0 It\u2019ll test their skill set, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d pay tens of thousands of dollars for, but I do that to find an A player.\u00a0 After I find an A player I\u2019ll go back to that person and say, okay here\u2019s the actual project that I want you to do. And hire them to do a bigger project. That way I only have A players on our team.</p> <p>And that\u2019s a big part of it. When you do find A players, figuring out ways to lock them up and keep them close to you, because again an A player is worth hundreds of B players. A really good example is when we launched Clickfunnels initially it was Todd and Dylan who built the whole thing. Then as when we start scaling we knew we needed to bring other people in to help. One of those people was Ryan.\u00a0 Prior to Ryan, we hired a couple of people that were B, C and even D level people. It was horrible.\u00a0 Not only did they not progress things, everything digressed. Everything moved backwards. And we found Ryan; first off he was culturally a right fit. He was our same age; he was cool, same timeline in his life. He was a great cultural fit. He brought a whole other level of things. He came in and brought Clickfunnels this thing we needed that we didn\u2019t have.\u00a0 He\u2019s been amazing. After a while, the demand on Clickfunnels is really high.\u00a0 It was getting to him and his family. He had a side website making a bunch of money and he got to the point he was going to leave and pursue that, or find a job where he got paid the same for a lot less stress. We knew that if we lost him it would be painful, so we came back and said he is an A, maybe an A+ player and we need him. We needed to lock him up and so we came back and did what it took. Paying him more, giving him equity giving him profit share, whatever it takes. Because one person like him is worth dozens of other people. If you lose someone like that, it can cripple you. It can destroy you.\u00a0 What I would say, is looking at your company through a different lens, where it\u2019s less, \u201clet me hire the cheapest player possible\u201d and shifting that to, \u201clet me find the A player rock star\u201d.\u00a0 Incentivize them in a way where everybody wins. I look at my company now and we have A players.\u00a0 A whole bunch of A players. \u201cRussell, how are you able to get so much amazing stuff done?\u201d Because we only have A players. The B players we get rid of, they\u2019re gone. They\u2019re not part of our organization. All we have is A players, \u201cHow in the world are you competing with companies like\u2026.Lead Pages is a good example. They have 100, or 200 employees, we\u2019ve got 25.\u00a0 How are you able to compete and dominate those guys?\u201d Because we have A players.\u00a0 You bring in VC money, guess what you hire? A bunch of B players, right. Because that\u2019s what they want you to do; they want you to spend their money and build out a team and you need directors and managers and all this crap and people that don\u2019t actually do anything. So yeah, you can spend their budget but you get a bunch of B players. That\u2019s the difference. I look at any VC backed company, there\u2019s a bunch of B players getting funded by dudes that have money, and it shows.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the next step.\u00a0 Again, if you listened to the periscope before, or if you haven\u2019t go to marketingquickiesshow.com, talk about the foundational mindset you need to get crap done. The whole lead or gold concept that I learned from Gary Halbert.</p> <p>Today is all about delegation.\u00a0 But don\u2019t delegate to people who are worse than you, delegate to rock stars.\u00a0 Yesterday for example, I had to get done a sales letter for a new Clickfunnels process we\u2019re doing. I sat down and I locked myself\u2026.I had to get it done; I had no choice\u2026lead or gold. I got this thing done. Normally it would be me that designed the sales letter, but Dylan, who\u2019s my partner in Clickfunnels, he\u2019s a rock star.\u00a0 He\u2019s the best designer I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u00a0 So I gave it to Dylan, now I\u2019m not nervous because he will make it better than I ever could.\u00a0 The biggest problem a lot of entrepreneurs have is that we\u2019re delegated to people that are worse than us. When you do that, that\u2019s where this back and forth and struggle and headaches and everything come from.</p> <p>Start the process today of finding you\u2019re a players.\u00a0 A players have different motivations.\u00a0 Some its cash, some its partnership, some they want a cool project.\u00a0 There\u2019s different motivations. It doesn\u2019t\u2019 mean you have to pay them a lot of money upfront. A lot of times A level people are motivated by different things. A good example is Todd, when Todd started working for me, I feel bad about it now, but he worked for free for an entire year. He had different motivations. It wasn\u2019t to get money. His motivation was to be part of something bigger. After a year, I realized we hadn\u2019t paid him anything. I\u2019m like, this guys really useful, we should pay him something. \u201cHey man can I pay you?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d so I started paying him. After another year, one day I was hanging out with him and he was showing me all these job offers. He was getting 3 or 4 job offers a week for 4 times what I was paying him. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, why don\u2019t you take those?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI want to be part of something bigger.\u201d\u00a0 Crap, I need to pay him more, because I\u2019m going to lose him.\u00a0 So I\u2019m like\u201d Hey, can I pay you more?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cSure, whatever.\u201d So the A players typically have different motivations.\u00a0 Its figuring out those motivations are and aligning them with you. But if you\u2019ve got vision and you know where you want to go. Finding the A players and getting them to align with you isn\u2019t necessarily a hard thing.\u00a0 Because most of the people I\u2019ve found that are A players are less money motivated and more mission and vision motivated. That\u2019s what drives them. So find your passion, your mission, your vision and sell them on it and that\u2019s how you get the rock stars.\u00a0 If you want to go for the cheapest you can go to Odesk or Upwork and find those kinds of people, but it\u2019s going to cost you more in the long run.</p> <p>So there you go.\u00a0 That\u2019s the strategy for today.\u00a0 Hope that helps. With that said, I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m at the office.\u00a0 Going to get stuff done. I will talk to you guys all again soon.\u00a0 Thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "11:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_187.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1453748969, "title": "Episode #186 \u2013 I Almost Got Shot Outside The Bellagio\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Let me tell you a story about what happened last night.</p> <p>In this special episode from Las Vegas, Russell tells a crazy story about how he almost got shot.

Alright that\u2019s a lie, I\u2019m not in my car. \u00a0I\u2019m in Las Vegas.\u00a0 My wife and I are here for a couple of days. The Pruvit event is happening, so we\u2019re here to support that. And to be speaking a little bit, sharing one of the funnels we\u2019re building for the Pruvit guys, which will be cool. Other than that we\u2019re hanging out in Vegas. Brian, who is the owner of Pruvit, we didn\u2019t know this until we got here, they booked us a room, and he booked us a huge suite. I feel like a rock star right now, this suite is bigger than my house.\u00a0 Well, not quite but it\u2019s pretty awesome.</p> <p>I wanted to tell you guys a crazy story.\u00a0\u00a0 Last night we decided to go to a show so we jumped in Uber. We\u2019re headed out to the Bellagio, because the show is in the Bellagio. So we\u2019re getting there, we had to be at the box office by 7:30 to get our tickets.\u00a0 Being the great planner my wife is, we got there at 7:15.\u00a0 We pull into the Bellagio front entranceway, past the fountains.\u00a0 We get out of the car, we get our tickets and then we decided to go to Yellowtail. If you\u2019ve never been to Yellowtail, it\u2019s a sushi place inside of the Bellagio. It\u2019s famous because they have a sushi roll that is rolled in pop rocks.</p> <p>Now the way I found out, a couple of years ago I was in this club called EO, you may of heard of it, it used to be called YEO, Young Entrepreneurs Organization , then all those young entrepreneurs got old and they changed the name to EO.\u00a0 There\u2019s still a YEO and then there\u2019s EO, there\u2019s two of them, right.\u00a0 So I was in this group, I was only in it for a few months and got kicked out because their rules are if you miss a meeting you can\u2019t keep coming. I got kicked out cause I missed a meeting.\u00a0 Anyway, I\u2019m in my EO Forum, we all went to Vegas together, when we were here, I don\u2019t drink and all of them did.\u00a0 We did indoor skydiving, and they all wanted sushi and they were all real drunk.\u00a0 They were like, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one sober here, Russell, you can order something for us.\u201d So I\u2019m like alright and I\u2019m ordering sushi like crazy, I have no idea what I\u2019m even ordering. I\u2019m just ordering a bunch for a table, like ten guys.\u00a0 Then they\u2019re bringing out sushi and we\u2019re eating tons of it. These guys are getting drunker and drunker, and I\u2019m just eating sushi having a great time.\u00a0 All the sudden I grab one of these rolls they brought out, pop one into my mouth and it starts popping. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the heck is this,\u201d I grab the waiter and I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, my mouth is popping. What\u2019s happening?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s our,\u201d whatever roll\u201d, we roll it in pop rocks.\u201d That is the coolest thing ever. So next time you\u2019re in Vegas go to the Bellagio and eat at yellowtail and eat pop rock sushi, cause it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>So we\u2019re in the Bellagio, of course we\u2019re going to go to yellowtail and get pop rock sushi, because what else are you going to do in Vegas.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing else better. So, we\u2019re in Yellowtail, eating pop rock sushi having a great time. We have an hour before our show and we decide to walk around outside to the fountains. We go outside the Bellagio, there\u2019s a bridge.\u00a0 So we walk onto the bridge and all the sudden we look over to the side and on both sides there\u2019s thousands of cop cars, everywhere. We notice we\u2019re on the bridge, we\u2019re looking over, and all the sudden there\u2019s cops on both sides of the bridge yelling, \u201cGet off the bridge, get off the bridge!\u201d So we run over the bridge to get to the other side. There\u2019s cops blocking the escalators and all these things.\u00a0 So we get over there and we\u2019re like, \u201cCrap, we need to get back to the Bellagio. But the whole street on both sides of the Bellagio is completely blocked by cop cars. There\u2019s no way to get back. We walked over to this cop, \u201cHow are we supposed to get back?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou have to walk clear around this other way and then jay walk if you are ever going to get back to the Bellagio tonight.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I think they\u2019re filming a Bourne movie or something.\u201d So we\u2019re like, \u201cDude, are you serious? We\u2019re going to see the Bourne movie. We\u2019re going to see Matt Damon.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019re going crazy, excited. How cool would that be to see the Bourne movie?\u00a0 So we walk around the whole thing, jay walk to get back to the Bellagio.\u00a0 We\u2019re out front where the car pick up.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking out and we see cop cars wrapping the whole thing all around.\u00a0 We see cop cars, we see new cars.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s like the film crew and all these things.\u00a0 We\u2019re just watching like, \u201cThis is so cool.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to see this big celebrity come out. We\u2019re just waiting for something awesome to happen.\u00a0 Then nothing awesome happened. We had to go back to our show.</p> <p>We went to the show, saw the circus. I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called. Circus thing where they do flips into water.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty cool.\u00a0 Then we leave and the whole thing is still blocked off, \u201cMan, this must be a huge movie shoot.\u00a0 It\u2019s been like 3 or 4 hours since we were there.\u201d\u00a0 We call the Uber , and the Uber guy\u2019s like, \u201c the strip is all blocked off, he can\u2019t\u2019 get here to pick you up.\u00a0 So we had to walk for like a mile to find the Uber dude. So then we did that, and Ubered back.\u00a0 So then we get home and then today, we get the news paper in our huge suite. The front page says, \u201cShooting closes part of the strip. Part of the strip was closed Friday night as police investigate an officer involved shooting that occurred on the sidewalk in front of the Bellagio fountains after man was reportedly waving a gun and pointing it at people.\u00a0 Metropolitan police dept. officer, Harry Ladful confirmed the incident was an officer involved shooting and that the male suspect, whose name was not released, is in police custody.\u00a0 Later police briefings on the scene, metro captain, Matt McCarthey said that at least two people were grazed by bullets during the shooting. The suspect was being booked in the Clark County Detention Center on numerous charges.\u201d\u00a0 This is the best part.\u00a0 \u201cThe shooting occurred in front of the hotel casino fountains, 3600 Las Vegas BLVD south, just after 7:15 pm. 7:15!\u00a0 Do you remember what I told you a few seconds ago?\u00a0 We pulled up in the Uber in front of the fountains at 7:15! I could have been one of those dudes that was grazed by a bullet, which is crazy.\u00a0 Later in the article it says that a lot of people thought that it was the filming for the Bourne movies, but it was not.\u00a0 The Bourne movie was filmed last week.\u00a0 That 3 or 4 times parts of Vegas had been shut down this week for filming for the Bourne movie, but it wasn\u2019t this.</p> <p>So isn\u2019t that crazy? Yeah, it was pretty crazy.\u00a0 That was our night.\u00a0 We survived luckily, but it was close. We could have been grazed, as multiple people were.\u00a0 I just wanted to share that with you guys.\u00a0 That was kind of cool. It has nothing to do with marketing or business, but I thought it was interesting and kind of fun and kind of crazy.</p> <p>That\u2019s it you guys, I\u2019m going to go down right now to the Pruvit event. I\u2019m going to see some real marketing happening. It\u2019s fun watching this with Pruvit, they\u2019re a network marketing company.\u00a0 It\u2019s fun seeing how network marketers run their events, and how they do all their stuff. The one really interesting thing to me is that the majority of their time is on building belief and building relationships.\u00a0 You go to any of our events it\u2019s focused on giving cool ideas and tips, things to increase what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s all content.\u00a0 This is not. It\u2019s like recognition, team building, belief.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s backwards in my mind. There\u2019s obviously value.\u00a0 You go to MLM events, sometimes there are 2 or 3 thousand or 5 thousand people or more, where you don\u2019t normally see that at the training events. We\u2019re going to try to do more and more the blend of those two things at our events. We\u2019ve got, personal development, team building stuff along with all the content.\u00a0 Hopefully get the best of both worlds.\u00a0 I thought that kind of was interesting.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to go hang out.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be sharing with you guys messages from inside. Whatever happens. Appreciate you all. Have an amazing day. We\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "08:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_186.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1453402182, "title": "Episode #185 \u2013 Proximity Is Power", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Secret notes from within this week\u2019s hack-a-thon.</p> <p>In this special episode with Dave Woodward, Russell and Dave talk about how proximity is power.

We are on day 3 of our hack-a-thon. It\u2019s been good. So we wanted to talk about a topic that is very important and we are seeing the fruits of over the last 2 days. As a lot of you guys know we\u2019ve been doing the hack-a-thon here,\u00a0 which means basically all the head Click Funnels developers and Dave who\u2019s running all the business development/joint venture/affiliate stuff is in town. Plus everyone in the office here.</p> <p>Anyway it\u2019s funny.\u00a0 We\u2019re in my office and jammed in there, there\u2019s like 10 people. Yesterday I had to go to the bathroom at 2am and couldn\u2019t get out cause there were too many people in the room.\u00a0 Everyone was together and we\u2019re getting stuff done and moving it forward.\u00a0 So the message I want to share with you guys is that proximity is power.\u00a0 Initially I learned that from Tony Robbins.\u00a0 Where did he talk about that?\u00a0 UPW? What\u2019s the context? I\u2019m going to make Dave teach a little bit. But what\u2019s the context of Proximity is power? If you can remember off the top of your head.</p> <p>Dave: The whole key to proximity is power is you are able to get much more done, it\u2019s almost like the mastermind concept where you have so many minds working on the same thing and you have the ability to communicate much quicker. Be able to bounce ideas off and because of that you are able to.\u00a0 It like one plus one equals three or four because you are so close and you\u2019re able to actually see, you get all this\u2026he\u2019s also talking about all the senses and modalities\u2026but being able to have all that together at one time you are able to focus and get things done super quick. You can bounce ideas off of each other without any delay. You can see the emotion behind everybody. It\u2019s the whole idea.</p> <p>Russell: It\u2019s funny because when we do these we get more done in 3 or 4 days than the rest of the quarter.</p> <p>Dave: Yeah, it\u2019s crazy. You could do these at least once a week but that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Do once a month?</p> <p>Russell: Once a week\u2026. People have always said, \u201cMan, Clickfunnels has evolved so quickly in the last 12 months\u201d.\u00a0 It has. That\u2019s with everyone remote. If everyone is in the same room, we would have rebuilt the internet at this point.\u00a0 Even last night it was 1:00 and I was working on this issue in my head. It\u2019s been stuck, I\u2019ve been frustrated.\u00a0 It\u2019s been hard to move forward because of one block I couldn\u2019t figure out. I started complaining about it. Everyone was there, we started bouncing Ideas.\u00a0 All of the sudden, the answer was there.\u00a0 This is the answer.\u00a0 That answer was like dominos.\u00a0 Suddenly within 15 minutes of talking with everyone. The answer came together in perfect clarity.\u00a0 Now we know exactly what to do.\u00a0 So today we are executing that and getting it done.</p> <p>Dave: It\u2019s that domino effect that is real critical.\u00a0 Kind of talks about one huge domino, as soon as it goes everything else falls into place.</p> <p>Russell: So awesome. It\u2019s interesting, we\u2019ve built our company and one of the people we\u2019ve modeled a lot with Click Funnels is Base Camp, 37 Signals. If you read the book they wrote Rework, which is one of my top 10 business books.\u00a0 Also wrote Remote. So they\u2019re all remote, and that\u2019s how Click Funnels has been built.\u00a0 I wanted everyone in the same office, but\u2026 our 2 co-founder ones in Atlanta and one\u2019s in Toronto and they weren\u2019t moving to Boise.\u00a0 So it became a virtual company, which turned out good.\u00a0 But that\u2019s what happened.\u00a0 In Remote they talked about that fact. If everyone works from home, you get more stuff done because you\u2019re not interrupted with meetings, gossip and crap that happens in an office.\u00a0 Which is true.\u00a0 Even with 37 signals, they have a corporate office in their town.\u00a0 Once a quarter they get everyone together and play foosball, they work, just get stuff done.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we do with this. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s nice because it feels like when your apart everyone is working on pieces of stuff.\u00a0 Whereas, together it\u2019s more like what\u2019s the vision?\u00a0 What\u2019s the entire movement of the company? What\u2019s the heart and soul?\u00a0 Which is cool. We\u2019ve had a chance to define and figure out those things.\u00a0 And solve bigger problems.</p> <p>One of the big problems we have in a tech company is support. How do you keep up with taking \u2026.How do you get faster customer support? How do you get all these things? Two nights ago, we worked until 2 o\u2019clock, then everyone went home.\u00a0 The tech guys went back to a hotel.\u00a0 They said they were in the lobby until 3:30 or 4.\u00a0 Talking about that thing; tickets.\u00a0 How to make it so we have no customer support tickets and all of our customers\u00a0 are happy. Which is a big question to ask when there\u2019s not really an answer.\u00a0 By 4 in the morning, logical reasoning and ideas fly out the window and crazy things start coming.</p> <p>At 4 in the morning they had an idea that was amazing.\u00a0\u00a0 This is what needs to happen. They came in the next morning. This is what we thought. Wow!\u00a0 How did you come up with that? That\u2019s not a normal thing. What was interesting, when we started communicating it to the people involved.\u00a0 We felt like there would be resistance from one person. And there was, but then that person just removed themselves from the equation.\u00a0 All the things fell into place to be able to execute on this new vision.</p> <p>Dave: I think the key is if you\u2019re going to have a remote business, you have to get together on a regular basis for that proximity. You can\u2019t continue to be remote all the time.</p> <p>Russell: It\u2019s true with anything, like mastermind groups\u2026 Everyone comes to Boise which is not a destination location, but we do it anyway.\u00a0 Getting everyone here together.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s true with all aspects of your life.\u00a0 Not that I\u2019m giving marital advice. A lot of marriages or family relationships fall apart because there\u2019s not proximity.\u00a0 My family, once a year, we all get together for a week. The things that matter, proximity is huge.</p> <p>The moral of today\u2019s story or podcast is understanding that you can still have proximity even if you are a remote team.\u00a0 Figure out time once a quarter, at least, to get together.\u00a0 That\u2019s it.\u00a0 Anything else cool?</p> <p>Dave: we have some awesome things happening in click funnels which you\u2019ll be seeing shortly.</p> <p>Russell: Tons of good stuff.</p> <p>Dave: Consumption. That\u2019ll be a cliff hanger. Consumption.</p> <p>Russell: Should I set up a big cliff hanger.</p> <p>Russell:\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to find\u2026.There\u2019s a new place in Boise that has a juice bar. We\u2019re trying to find it because I really want a juice. I think I\u2019m another block away.</p> <p>One of the big questions last night is, how do we give a better customer experience? How do we get people consuming the software?\u00a0 One of the biggest things, this is a lesson I learned ten years ago from Alex Mandossian, he had a product or a teleseminar called Consumption Theory. It was about how if you can get your customers to consume your product, that\u2019s it. Most info product businesses don\u2019t grow because there\u2019s no consumption. People don\u2019t read the product they don\u2019t implement.\u00a0 How can you get your consumer s to consume your product more?\u00a0 One cool story he told was, whatever the shampoo company was,\u00a0 proctor and gamble, 20 years ago, whatever it was, people would shampoo once a week.\u00a0 How do we get people to consume more shampoo? So they changed the directions to wash, rinse, repeat. People read that, I\u2019m supposed to repeat.\u00a0 So people went from shampooing once a week to three times per shower session.\u00a0 Consumption shot up.\u00a0 And this thing that was, \u201cEvery once in a while wash your hair\u201d, became you have to wash multiple times per shower. It increased consumption.\u00a0 That was our big thing. How do we get more consumption of Clickfunnels.\u00a0 We looked at return rate and drop offs and those things.\u00a0 They all have 100% to do with consumption. So how can you increase consumption of your customers?\u00a0 So that\u2019s the question I propose for you guys to think through. As we implement our new, we call it, Operation Consumption.\u00a0 I will share with you guys the details behind the scenes.</p> <p>Even with little tiny tweaks, we increase stick rate by 10%, which is an extra $8 million next year. It\u2019s insane.\u00a0 It\u2019s a thought process worth having and thinking through.\u00a0 That was one we had last night at 1:30 in the morning.\u00a0 Oh, here\u2019s the answer, it solved 80 problems at once.\u00a0 So look for podcasts in the future called Operation Consumption.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s coming up. There\u2019s your cliffhanger.</p> <p>Keep listening, you guys. I know you want to unsubscribe, but you can\u2019t now.\u00a0 You have to keep listening.</p> <p>Also, Dave\u2019s about to launch a new podcast called Clickfunnels Radio that\u2019s coming out February 1st.\u00a0 So look for that. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be promoting it through on our channels as well. February 1st look for Clickfunnels Radio.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to be interviewing tons of successful click funnels members. You can see what they are doing, get some ideas.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be awesome.</p> <p>Alright, we\u2019re at the co-op.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting juice. We\u2019re out of here. Thanks you guys.\u00a0 Have an amazing day.\u00a0 We will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "10:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_185.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1453313501, "title": "Episode #184 \u2013 Are You A Doctor?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>An interesting story that happened to me earlier this week\u2026</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about how if you want to be successful in life you need to do what no one else is doing.

All right, all right, so I am on my way right now to the Boise Co-op. It's kind of like Whole Foods, except for it's not Whole Foods. The Whole Foods is a forty minute drive from my house to get to, and they just opened a co-op that's a fifteen minute drive. I'm really excited. I'm headed there to go see what they got and what's going to be happening. I've been doing a lot of cool stuff with my diet lately and really enjoying it, getting energy and feeling good. It's been awesome.</p> <p>I've recovered week one of our crazy week. We had the four day, two day Mastermind and another two day Mastermind, then I flew to L.A. to speak at Nick Unsworth\u2019s event. We did some good stuff there and now I'm back hanging out with the kids and the family. Everyone's flying in tomorrow and starting on Monday we've got a hack-a-thon with all the ClickFunnels developers and partners. We're going to be locked down for sixteen plus hours a day, building, and creating, and moving the needle for all of you guys. It'll be a lot of fun and exciting. I'm sure I will be podcasting on the way to and from some of those and we'll talking about world domination, and it'll be a lot of fun.</p> <p>Today I wanted to tell you more of a funny story. My kids are insane. I don't know where they get it from. Definitely not from me. You know how some kids are really calm, and nice, and peaceful? My kids aren't. They're nuts, which is fun. They probably get it from me, but we have a lot of fun, we play hard all the time.</p> <p>Anyway, in the last week, one of my kids was climbing up the shelves and tore one of the shelves out of the, a bookshelf thing out of the wall. Then same kid was jumping off of the sink and his shorts, grabbed the cupboard underneath, the little handle and ripped another drawer out. Anyway, it was just nuts, right?</p> <p>Then it's sitting there for awhile waiting for me to fix them, and I'm not very good at fixing things so they've just been sitting there. Finally, called the handyman, got some guys to come and fix it. It's two guys that came in and it was in the morning and I was with the kids, I was going a little bit slow because I had just finished four days of Mastermind. I was going to be flying out in five hours and wanted to hang out.</p> <p>Anyway, my wife brings him in and says, \"Hey this is my husband Russell.\" He looks at me funny and then he starts working on the shelf. As soon as everyone leaves, he's like, \"Hey I have a question for you. How old are you man?\" I was like, \"I'm thirty five.\" He's like, \"Wow. What are you, a doctor or something?\" I was like, \"Something like that.\" I was like, \"No. I have a bunch of online businesses and things like that.\" Anyway, it was so funny. I thought it was funny because he thought I was a doctor.</p> <p>That's everyone's goal now, is to go and create so much amazing cool stuff, that people can't even fathom how you're able to do it at your age, or because you're too old or too young, or whatever. Do things nobody else is doing. Dan Kennedy, I heard him one time say, \"If you want to be successful in life, look what everybody else is doing and do the exact opposite,\" which is kind of true in most circumstances because most people aren't doing much. It's crazy to me.</p> <p>In fact, also on Friday, the same day, I was lucky enough to have Justin and Tara Williams from Eight Minute Millionaire the podcast. They did a bunch of other cool stuff. They're in our Inner Circle mastermind and they've done some amazing things. They agreed to let us film their story. They came to my house and we filmed their story and it was amazing. They're intense real estate investors. I think they said last year they flipped a hundred and twenty houses, made over a million dollars in take home from that. They spent nine years doing the real estate business. They want to do the coaching business. Got into it and struggled and things like that. They said that since they joined our Inner Circle six months ago, they made more money in the last six months than they did the first six years of their real estate business, which was awesome, so cool, so cool having them tell their whole story.</p> <p>On the way from my house, I drove them back over to the office in my really dirty car, which was embarrassing, and unbeknownst to me, Justin was apparently was recording this. I feel bad for his wife. Apparently he records all their conversations so if later on, \"No you said this,\" like, \"No, no, no. You actually did say this. Let me pull out the recording. Here's the transcripts. Page thirteen, line six. This is where you said this thing,\" or whatever, right? He records all their conversations. Some of them show up on their podcasts.</p> <p>Anyway, apparently I didn't know this at the time, we were driving from my house over to the office and he was recording our whole conversation. I think it might show up on his podcast. If you guys go to eightminutemillionaire.com and subscribe, you may hear a conversation I didn't know was going to be happening. I knew it was happening, I didn't know it was going to be recorded. Anyway, I thought that was kind of funny.</p> <p>We were talking, and I thought it was interesting, it goes back to what I was saying earlier about looking at what everyone else is doing and doing the opposite. I was telling him how when I got started online, how hard it was for me because I did it and I was like, \"Wow I want everyone I know to go. It wasn't that hard. I want to show everybody how this works.\" I was showing my family, my friends, and everybody I could meet. I found out really quick that most people wouldn't do anything. I don't know if it was they were lazy, they didn't believe, or they didn't care, whatever, but it's weird. I tried to give this gift I felt like I've been given to everyone, and most people they didn't want it.</p> <p>Tara, in one of her podcasts a little while ago, she was really emotional telling the same thing, how hard it was for her. She felt like she had this gift and she wanted to share it with people and either they wouldn't take it, or they whatever the reason was. I remember that was probably ten or eleven years ago that I remember going through that. Finally, I personally shut down where most people in my personal life have no idea what I do, which is why I think most of them think I'm unemployed or they're really confused and they come over and their like, \"What do you do?\" I don't talk about it because of that. For years I did. I tried to talk and share and tried to help people and most of them won't. I don't know why. But that\u2019s how the majority is and I think I said something in the recording. I'm trying to confess to these things now, in case you guys hear it later I guess.</p> <p>The drive here, I'm like, \"Look at all these cars. All these people, most of them I don't understand what they're doing.\" You know what I mean? It's weird to me that the masses won't do stuff. They follow this path. They wake up, they eat their cereal, they go to work, they come home, they eat some ice cream, and they go to bed. That's this path and there's so much more. There's so much happening. There's so much amazingness and things you can do, and serve people, and most of them miss it because they think it's going to be too hard.</p> <p>Justin, and Tara, and I were laughing about it. It's really not that hard. When you look at the grand scheme of things, putting in a couple months of really hard, focused effort, and then pay you forever. It's not as hard as doing what you're doing now, as going to six or seven years of college, to be able to then go to more college, to be able to then get a job that what you make from that job doesn't actually even cover your payments. It's this whole cycle that we're in. We were talking, that seems like a lot more work, a lot harder than this path, which is putting in a shorter period of time and trying to create something amazing. Anyway, I thought that was interesting.</p> <p>For those of you guys that are listening, that means you are on the right path. You are trying to create, and help, and serve. You know what? It's funny in this business because you're, I don't know about you guys, but typically not that you're alone, but you're kind of alone. Right? You're here at your house or on your computer, wherever, you're doing these things, and you're creating and putting stuff out there and you don't always see the fruits of it.</p> <p>All last week was an amazing blessing that I got. Amazing gift. Part of it was because I went to the mastermind, I had my mastermind so we had probably sixty of our high end clients there and hear some of their transformational experiences were amazing. I got a chance to hear Justin and Tara tell their story, which was amazing. Jason O'Neil who joined our Inner Circle about a year ago, Friday he passed a million dollars in sales. He sent me a screen shot of a million, like, \"Oh so cool.\"</p> <p>Then hearing all of these people what they've done since the last meeting, and that we had a little piece in that, obviously it's them doing the work, but we had a little piece help facilitate that and hopefully inspire, and motivate, and point in the right direction. Cool.</p> <p>Then I went to Nick Unsworth\u2019s event and I landed my flight at five and I think I spoke at seven. I had this little two hour gap. I came and everyone was gone to lunch, but as soon as I walked in the room, one person came over to me and said, \"Hey Russell, I need you to know how ClickFunnels and your book has changed my life.\" Then another person came in and for the entire two hours from five to seven before I finally had a chance to get up and speak, it was a line of people, and everyone said the same thing. It was such an amazing gift, something that you don't get often, but when you do get it, it makes everything else worth it. It makes all the craziness and the hard nights, and the risking your money, your effort, and your things, and when ClickFunnels crashes and people are yelling at you, and it makes all that worth it.</p> <p>Anyway, I want to share with you guys because it was awesome for me and I know that we don't get that often. For you guys, that's why it's important to do some of the live events and things like that because you have a chance to see what you're doing. It's not just a number or a stat. It's a person. That's really, really cool.</p> <p>That's what I got you guys. I am at Natural ... I'm at Boise co-op, Natural Foods. I'm going to go check this place out, see what they got. See if this is going to be my new shopping center to keep me feeling good. Yeah, on that, I appreciate you guys. Have an amazing night and talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "10:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_184.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1453245104, "title": "Episode #183 \u2013 Recap Of The First Two Days From Inner Circle", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Did you miss the Inner Circle meeting?

Hey everyone, so I'm heading out to day number three of the Mastermind. My guess is, if you listen to my other Mastermind video, or audio, podcast, it was late, I couldn't get it to upload from my phone or my brother, so you'll probably get these after the whole Mastermind is done. First two days were amazing. I've been in a lot of mastermind groups. I've paid a lot money to be in, and just like me as an attendee, that was the best mastermind group I've ever been to. It was really, really amazing. Just grateful for everyone who came and shared, and was a part of it.</p> <p>Last night was cool because our second mastermind group is going today and tomorrow, and so last night we all got together and did a big dinner party and hung out, and got to know each other, and then Drew Cannoli, some of you guys know Drew from Fitlife.tv came and spoke and talked about his journey, and how they built up their following initially, and a bunch of cool stuff. Then gave everybody some Organify, which was cool. It was really, really fun. He told a story about how they kind of had started, and grew this big following, and had, you know, millions of followers on Facebook. Then Facebook changed their algorithms, and they couldn't reach anyone. They were losing about $50,000 a month. That's when I had a chance to meet him. At about that time they had a supplement they were about to roll out and stuff. We coached them through that funnel on how to build it out, and they launched it, and now it's doing over a million dollars a months. So cool. Anyway, it was amazing, a really fun experience. I think everyone had a good time hearing his story as well, and it was cool.</p> <p>Now we're heading in for day number 2. I've been taking really, really, really good notes on each of the presentations, like my big takeaways from each of them, so I'm excited. I'm going to do a couple of series where I kind of just break down some of my biggest takeaways from the mastermind group. Just hopefully give some of you guys some value who obviously can't be here, because I have some really, just like amazing takeaways. When you get this caliber of people in a room, they're all doing different things, and everyone just gets, so many cool ideas. One of the new members of our group, they signed up less than a week ago, and they live in Australia, and they jumped on a plane, and flew out here.</p> <p>A super cool couple and they were talking about, their whole story where basically they were doing these membership sites, and somebody asked them to speak at an event about membership sites. They spoke at the event, and they sold a little membership site boot camp, teaching people how to make membership sites. Then they had like, I don't know, 100 people who came to this boot camp, and then they decided to sell like done for you thing. They did like $200,000 in sales, and they were going crazy. Then they did it again 6 months later, and made 2.5 million dollars in sales. The next time, they built this whole system around that, and they have, like their seminars choreographed, like minute by minute, what happens, and how it happens, and they've just perfected this model. They showed the whole model to everyone. It was just like, holy cow. Ahhh, it was just so cool.</p> <p>Then you got, you know, people who are webinar experts walking through all the best things that they were doing in their webinars right now. We've got some of the best sales guys in the world teaching their sales scripts, and what's working now, and how to generate leads for those. Just person, after person, after person, was just like dropping gold bombs. I just felt honored to be...I constantly...it's amazing to me that I get paid to do this, but just honored to even be in that room. Some of you guys know, when I got started, the first mastermind group I joined was Bill Glazer\u2019s. At the time I was probably making around $100,000 a year or so, and I get in this program, around all these people who were making a whole lot more than that. I was the youngest and the most immature, I think I still am the most immature in the room, but definitely at that point. I didn't know anything. I remember doing my little session where I got to share my business with people who gave me feedback, but where I got all the value is like listening to all these other people share their business.</p> <p>Back then during the real estate guru booms, like half the room was real estate gurus. They were talking about the events they were doing, and the webinars, and this, and all these different things. I was like, I never even thought of those as possibilities, and then after that meeting I came back, and started implementing some of the things other people were doing in their business into mine, and made my business more full and more complete. Then, you know, every 3 or 4 months I go back to those meetings. I did that for 6 years in Bill's group. Our business got better, and better, and better, and better, and better. I probably would still be in that group, but Bill sold the business, and I kind of disconnected from that because Bill was really my first mentor in there.</p> <p>After that, I started looking for a new home. I was like, I need this, this is part of what I need to be in, one of these things every few months, and I joined, I think I joined 4 or 5 other groups. It wasn\u2019t me just picking a random group, I did my research to find out like, what's the best group? You know, and I went to the group, and I was like, ah so let down, then what's the next best group? Went to that group. Let down, and let down, and just, anyway it was frustrating. Basically at that point I asked everybody, and they were \"well, you've been to the best ones, so if you didn't like those, you should probably start your own, because there's nothing else better than that\". I was just like, dang. That was really, like, one of the main reasons why we started this one, and why we built it.</p> <p>At first I was nervous, because I'm like, what if people don't come? What if we get crappy people? All the different fears that kind of come with that, but, man, like I look at the roster of who we attracted into these groups, and it's amazing. It's pretty fun. It's been 2 days so far, I've got 2 more days, and I'm just back here just gleaning ideas off each person, and figuring out ways to perfect more so what we do, and it's pretty exciting.</p> <p>That's all I want to tell you guys. I just want to give you guys an update, letting you know all the cool stuff that's happening, and I'll probably, I don't know when, maybe Friday this week. Friday I have the morning off, I've got to fly out of town, so maybe I'll jump on, and just go through my notebook with you and share, share my top 10 big takeaways from the 2 groups, and hopefully give you guys a ton of value, and hopefully cause some desire for you guys to join the group, even though there are not many spaces left.</p> <p>In fact, I had a cool idea the other day. I was like, at our Funnel Hacking event, which, if you don\u2019t have your tickets yet, go get them, FunnelHacking.com, Marcus Lemonis is speaking. It's going to be amazing. I was thinking about having a board that said, Inner Circle, and then, like, I think I told you this before, like we're capping the inner circle at 100 people, and I'm not opening up again. I want to have a board that has everyone's picture, like all 100 pictures, or you know, whatever it is at that point. It's probably like 95, 96, and have like the 5 spots with like, blank heads.\u00a0 And just be like, \"There's the group you guys, when it's filled, it's filled. The only way that a spot opens up again is if someone drops out\", and just like, you know, and that's it. Let people go fight over those last couple of spots, if there are spots left at that point. Then when that happens, I'm basically going to turn the site where it was sold over, and just have like that, the pictures of 100 people, and then when one drops out, we'll say, \"hey, this guy dropped out. Who wants a spot?\" Then it will be up for auction, and I guarantee at that point those spots won't go for $25,000, they'll be going for a lot more.</p> <p>It's kind of fun. I'm really liking this whole concept.\u00a0 Anyway, that's about it, you guys. I'm heading in, and have an amazing week, and I'll probably talk to you guys on Friday, with hopefully a recap of all the cool stuff. All right, thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "07:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_183.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1453154986, "title": "Episode #182 \u2013 Car Wreck :(  Day #1 Of The Mastermind\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Can you believe this happened on the drive over?</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about The Inner Circle and why he\u2019s going to lock it down when it fills up.

I'm about to start a week that I am so excited for. This week is Inner Circle week. I'm actually driving to the hotel right now to come hang out with our top level clients and friends. I feel like they're more like a family now. That's what's happening and I'm so excited.</p> <p>For those of you guys that are listening to this who are part of that group, I'm excited to see you. I feel bad, I just got a vox from Brent on our team. He's heading there to help with registration and hang out and everything. He got in a wreck on the way there. For all of you guys, this is a public service announcement from Russell. If you're listening to me right now and you're in a car, please be careful. I'm going to be careful, as well, because we don't want to get hit like Brent. Actually, he hit them. He saw something on the side of the road and looked at it like, \"Oh, what is that,\" and then smacked into the dude in front of him. His airbags went off and everything. It was kind of serious. I'm hoping that while we're talking, because I'm behind him a little ways, that I'll drive by him and I'll actually see him and we can all honk and yell at him or something funny. Not that getting in a wreck is a funny thing, because it's not, but when it's your friend and he's not hurt, then it's hilarious. There you go.</p> <p>I know that some of you guys saw some of the Inner Circle campaigns and people have been asking me like, \"Did you fill it up? What happened,\" and all that kind of stuff. Kind of what happened is, as you know, in the past, we've had two coaching groups. We had Ignite, which it was $12,000 and then had Inner Circle that's 25 and they've both been amazing groups, but I decided this year that I just wanted to focus on the Inner Circle. We closed down Ignite, which is kind of scary, because that was probably 2 million dollars a year in revenue that we decided, \"Oh, let's just turn it off. Let's turn it off and focus on these other guys.\"</p> <p>Then we started thinking, \"How many people can we run in our Inner Circle.\" I've been in Inner Circles where people have done it right and I've been in ones that people have done it wrong. I felt the right was is to have a group of about 33 people in a meeting, because in two days, you can have everyone present. It works really, really good. I've been in other groups that had 100 people in it and it just doesn't work well.</p> <p>In fact, I'm in a group right now that has 100 and my first meetings next month and I'm curious to go and see how they facilitate it. I've yet to see it done well. I want to keep the group small enough that we can keep that same intimate atmosphere, but it'd be fun to have 100 people. I'm trying to figure out the math behind it. How do we do this so we can have 100 people in it? Basically it came down to having three groups. At a time, we had two groups and I'm like, \"Hey, we're basically we're to fill one more group, so three groups of 33.3 people, so it equals 100 people, right.\" In December, we did the math and already two groups were full and the third group was starting to get full, so we sent an email basically saying, \"Hey, Inner Circle's closing down. Ignite's already gone. If you want the last spots, they're going really, really fast.\" From that, I think somewhere between 12-15. I don't know. I'd have to look at the exact numbers, but people that joined in December, at 25 grand a piece, so that was awesome from a revenue standpoint, but more so from like, \"We're adding more people to this family.\" It's exciting.</p> <p>We have a few more spots. Our next meeting after this is in May, and we have our Funnel Hacking event before then and a bunch of other stuff, so they'll be sold out by May. My goal is to basically lock it down. We have really high renewal rates, people that were in it that come back each year. My goal is to hopefully not have to ever open it up again and let people just keep coming back. When spots do open up, we'll just let the waiting list know, \"Hey, there's one new spot,\" or \"three new spots,\" or whatever and keep it filled. Keeping 100 people and that's it and working really close with 100 entrepreneurs at a time and really trying to cultivate that and turn it more and more into a family. That's what's happening.</p> <p>This is fun. This week, we basically have two groups happening. In May, we'll have three groups. That's what's going down in the Inner Circle. The way we facilitate ours, and everyone kind of does them different, but basically, over two days, everyone has a chance to get up and share for about 30 minutes, first off what's awesome in their business, because that's fun to always hear. The one big thing you got since the last meeting that's been crushing it for you. The second thing is asking, \"I want some feedback from the group?\" It's kind of like group consulting, where everyone in the group is a rock star. It's not just like, \"Here's Russell's advice.\" It's like, \"Here's this group of 30 other people that are amazing. Here's them sharing what they would do in that situation and getting their feedback and stuff like that.\" It's a really neat thing where you just get amazing feedback.</p> <p>Afterwards, late nights, everyone's hanging out and you've got relationships that are built and from there it's really extending that relationship and extending everything and growing it for the next three or four months for the next meeting and stuff like that. It's exciting. I love it. That's what I'm heading to right now and having a chance to hang out with our Inner Circle family. If you're in it, I'm excited to see you. If you're not in it, you should just get in it. The spots are going to be gone and then they're going to be gone. If you go to RussellBrunson.com, you can get more info on it. My guess is, within the next month or so, there will no longer be spots in the Inner Circle. Hopefully, there never will be.</p> <p>People keep asking me, \"Russell, you shut down your Ignite coaching, so that's gone. Inner Circle's now locked out. What's your purpose and what are you doing now? What's you business like?\" I keep looking at that, because ClickFunnels is where our focus is at. It's growing consistently and is doing well and I think it will continue to do that. Inner Circle's capped out, so that business is there. We'll keep creating front end products and bringing new people into ClickFunnels.</p> <p>For me, it's really looking at now, \"What are some strategic projects that we can partner on, that I can bring my magic tricks to and the other people can become runners and operators of these businesses.\" We kind of have three that I'm doing this with right now.</p> <p>One is, you guys know the company Pruvit, which is the keytone drink that I'm obsessed with. I was able to come in and they gave me a percentage to do what I'm good at doing, my funnels and all that kind of stuff. I'm not involved in the day to days or anything like that. I'm involved in what I'm good at and I can just do that and nothing else.</p> <p>Same thing with ... Some of you guys know Anthony? We're doing the same thing with Biohacking Secrets, where he's the owner, operator. I come in and get to do my things in exchange for a percentage.</p> <p>I do another project like that with Christian who is the guy on our team who ran it. He's been running the Ignite program. He's got an amazing survival business he's building out and a similar concept. I'm not trying to get a lot of these businesses, because they take a lot of time and energy and effort and money, honestly.</p> <p>Oh crap. There's a cop coming. Please say he's not coming after me. I will be late if I get pulled over right now. Cross out fingers that he passes me. I'm going to hold the phone down a little lower. I'll talk louder so hopefully you guys can hear me. I think he's pulling the dude over behind me. Sweet. We didn't get caught. Oh crap, he just passed that guy. Cross your fingers that it's not me, you guys. I'm really nervous. He's actually pulling up right beside me, but I think he's going to pass me. Can you guys hear him? He's passing me right now. Can you guys hear that? Sweet. It's not me. I'm officially safe.</p> <p>All right. Now that I'm safe, we can get back on tangent. I don't even remember where we left off. That got me nervous, because the event starts in 25 minutes. If I get pulled over right now, I'd be late. That's a good sign. That actually happened to me one time. We were doing an event at our old office. I was on the freeway and I was already running late. I was speeding and I got pulled over, so I showed up to my own event 20 minutes late, which was really not a good thing, obviously.</p> <p>I don't know where I left off, but I think I left off somewhere. What I'm thinking about doing, I don't know, but I think this would be cool, but I don't know how to do it the right way. If you guys have any ideas, let me know. I watch Shark Tank a lot and that's a cool premise, but you get to see them pitch a deal and then that's kind of it. Then you see The Profit, which is cool, because Marcus comes in and rebuilds the whole business and that's fun. I want to do a hybrid of that. How do we make something where it's online thing and people can come and say, \"Hey Russell. Here's our business. We're going to be the owners, operators and runners, but we want you to come in and do your ...\" The three or four things that Russell's actually good at it, I'm going to come and do in exchange for equity. It'd be fun to do something like that where people come and get to present it to me and then we get to pick which ones we want to work with. Over the year, capture the story of that and film it and make a mini online TV show, showing that process. How many of you guys would like that? How many of you guys think that'd be pretty dang cool.</p> <p>That's what I'm kind of looking at the future. I was telling Jason O'Neil, whose one of our Inner Circle members who, either today or tomorrow, he\u2019s going to pass a million dollars in sales, since he joined the Inner Circle. It's super exciting. I was telling him, \"Getting $25,000 from you to sign up with really, really cool, but what would be cooler is if I got 20% of everything you did. That would have been way cooler if I would have structured it that way. We didn't.\" I'm trying to find the right projects and deals where we can do that. How do we do that, but then make it in a fun way where everyone else can see behind the scenes and watch? I like to show that stuff. I think there's value.</p> <p>I'm thinking about that, so if any of you guys have an idea. Two things. First off, we need a cool name for it. Without a cool name, it's not worth doing, right? The name is 90% of it, so if there's a cool name, I'll probably do it. Then, we need a cool concept, because I don't it to be like Shark Tank. You come pitch to me. I don't want to be mean too, I don't want to be Marcus Lemonis. I want something cool where we figure out a cool blend of that.</p> <p>We were thinking about doing something ahead of time, where people get to apply between now and the funnel hacking event and at the funnel hacking event, do a whole session where people get to present their business and show\u2026 let everyone will watch that process. I think that would be kind of fun, as well. I don't know. Who knows if that will happen before then, but I think that would be a cool concept.</p> <p>That's some of the stuff that I'm thinking about. For you guys' business, I wonder what you guys are all thinking about. After you get the initial foundation built, where you've got a good offer and traffic and customers, it really comes down to, \"How do you make exciting, fun, cool things that people want to participate in? How do you change this?\"</p> <p>Sorry. I just hit the traffic on the freeway. Crap. I bet you we're getting close to Brent's wreck, actually. I bet that's what the cop was going to. Great. I'm going to be stuck behind all these people, because of Brent. Brent's going to make me late to this event now. That's kind of my thoughts. I hope you guys are having fun with your business. If it's not fun, then why are we even doing this. The harder part is initially getting the offers and the structure and the funnels and the audience. After you have the audience, it can become really fun. How do we inspire people? How do we motivate them? How do we get them excited about our product, our service and what we're doing.</p> <p>With that said, that's about it, you guys. We're not going to see Brent, because I'm stuck on the freeway. We're 20 minutes out and I'm not even moving right. Cross your fingers I make it to the Inner Circle on time. If not, it's all Brent's fault, not mine. Just kidding. I appreciate you guys. Have an amazing day. I'll talk to you guys all again soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "12:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_182.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1452198673, "title": "Episode #181 \u2013 One Awesome Thing I Learned From A Con Man", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Understanding the power and importance of the teach-ability index.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about what he learned from a known con man, Kevin Trudeau.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to another episode of Marketing In Your Car. Hey, everyone. I can't help but laugh every time I do that. But anyway, there you go. I have no other way to do an intro, so that's all I ... I need to go to intro school and learn some other cool stuff, but for now that's what I got. I'm driving past my house and there's this huge alfalfa field next door to us, and usually every morning ... Today there's not, but there's like 500 geese in there and then deer, big deer with antlers and everything. We count about 7 deer that, every morning, come through our yard and then at night they go back the other way. It was pretty cool.</p> <p>All right, so I got something cool for you guys today. Some of you may know I've been writing my second book. I swore I'd never do it again but here we are. I felt like there was one more message I needed to share with the world and the book is called Expert Secrets, and I really feel like ... In fact the intro of the book I talk about is this the prequel to DotComSecrets or the sequel? Where does this fit in the queue? It kind of depends. If you've got an existing business, I think DotComSecrets is the first book. If you don't then Expert Secrets is the first book.</p> <p>If you have an existing business though, I think Expert Secrets is the second book. It gives you a very systematic, step by step timeline of what to do and what order to do it in. I'm excited. I feel like, it's kind of like when a weight loss author writes a diet book. I was thinking about Dave Asprey wrote The Bulletproof Diet. Here's the guide. Here's everything that he knows about losing weight. That's kind of what DotComSecrets was like. Here's everything. Then the next book they usually come out with is the cookbook, like, \"Hey, here's the Bulletproof Cookbook. Here's all the recipes you should use.\" That's kind of how this is.</p> <p>This book feels like it's my recipe book, like, \"Okay, so all the stuff we talked about in DotComSecrets, you want to implement it\u2026 What order? What comes first? Why?\" Thinking about things like attractive character. You start here and you transition to here, and which funnel do you use first, second, third and why do you use them in that order? All those kind of fun things. I'm excited. It's turned out really really good. We're I think about a third of the way done with it and I was really nervous to write this, because there's been a lot of people that have written things on how to become an expert and stuff like that and I didn't want it to be another one of those books. I wanted it to be something special, and so it took me forever to figure out how I wanted to do it and structure it.</p> <p>I feel like we're there and it's turning out cool, so I'm proud of it. With that said, there's a lot of cool things I've been thinking about while I'm doing that. I'm going to talk about one of them today. It's a concept I might have talked about on the podcast in the past. I don't know. I've done so many episodes I can't remember everything that I say so if this is a rerun for the hardcore ones, this is something to just keep thinking about. But a long time ago I bought a product by ... I'm going to blank out his name now. He's the dude that ... Kevin Trudeau. Kevin Trudeau, who's in jail right now, but one of the best infomercial pitchmen in the history of time, and someone who I do not agree with his ethics.</p> <p>He's done a lot of bad things to a lot of people I care about, but from a skill standpoint, dude's amazing. He came out with a product a few years ago called Your Wish is Your Command. In the product he acted like he was in Switzerland and there's all these kings and stuff he was teaching to. It was all BS. He recorded it in a studio in Chicago, and so it's kind of like the whole product is based on a lie, but the content actually was really good. Take that for what it's worth. But one of the things that Kevin talked about in the product was a thing I'd never heard about, but he called it the teachability index, and I talk about this in the Expert Secrets book a little bit. But he talked about, if you think about in your life when you grow up, right?</p> <p>When you're a little kid you're like a sponge. My Norah, today she took 3 steps. She's just learning how to walk, our little 10 month old, and she's like a sponge. Everything she's doing ... She took a step and we're going crazy and she's doing little things. Kids are so teachable. Look at my kids right now. Anything they touch they just figure it out, like video games or math problems. Anything we give them, boom, they figure it out so fast, so much faster than us adults ever do. You look at that's how life is. We're growing, we're evolving, we're learning. All these amazing things are happening, and we do it through elementary school and then junior high, then high school, then college, and then some horrible thing happens at the end of college. It's the worst thing that can happen to any of us.</p> <p>We get a degree, and that degree means, \"Congratulations. You have learned everything you need to learn and you're smart.\" Guess what happens to almost all the population at that point? We all stop. We\u2019re like, \"Sweet. I know what I need to know. Let's go into the workforce now and implement what I learned in school.\" The thing that sucks about that first off is that the school system's horrible, so you didn't learn half of what you need to know, but second-off, our teachability index drops to almost nothing. I got in that slump just like everybody else where I thought I knew everything, and that's why I think I fell in love with this whole business, because I started learning and it opened up my eyes.</p> <p>But, the same thing happened, I opened up and I started learning all this stuff and doing it and started making money, and then what happened? I started teaching it and then boom. It was like I had graduated. I know what I need to know and I kind of shut down for a couple of years, which was horrible because I stopped evolving, stopped growing. It was kind of like this stagnant point for me, and the real turning point for me was when I went to a Tony Robbins event. I remember sitting there at the event, and people are jumping around, going crazy, and singing and dancing and he's sharing all these things.</p> <p>For the first 5 or 6 hours, I'm sitting there with my arms folded like, \"No. I'm not dancing. I'm not jumping. All that stuff he's saying is BS. I don't believe it.\" I really kind of shut things off, but Tony's got a way, and he's pretty good at what he does. After about 5 or 6 hours, I remember I had ... For me, I don't think at the time I thought it was a breakthrough, but I was kind of like, \"You know what? Screw this. I'm going to jump around and be happy because everybody else in here is except for me.\" I started jumping around and being happy and then I started thinking, \"Instead of me saying no, Tony's wrong, what if I just say what if? Let me just change the thought in my head from no to what if.\"</p> <p>I did, and he started saying something. Instead of me immediately shutting it down like all of us do, because we're educated and because our teachability index is zero, instead of doing that, I said, \"What if?\" What happened has been life changing for me. It's opened up this whole new world of possibilities and ideas, and things and people, and experiences that I never thought were possible before. For me now, I'm very careful to not say no when new ideas come to me. It's not that I can't say no after I've investigated them and prayed about them, and learned about them and implemented them and tried them and tested them, but I try not to say no initially.</p> <p>I try to say \u201cwhat if\u201d and then put it to the test and see. The things that are good come back and can be really, really good. A good example of that, when I started learning about all this, the high fat diets, and at first my brain's like, \"No. Eating a stick of butter is not a good idea. No. My whole life I learned butter's bad.\" Okay, this morning ... I ate more butter this morning than I ate probably in the first 25 years of my life and guess what? I'm in the best shape of my life. Not the best shape of my life, when I was wrestling I was in way better shape. I'm not going to lie, but the best shape of my adult life. I'm losing weight like crazy. I've lost a pound a day every day for the last 5 days.</p> <p>It's interesting and it all came off of a \u201cwhat if\u201d. What if this whole thing that we've been thinking was true this whole time wasn't true? What if butter actually is amazing and wheat is bad? No, it can't be ... heart healthy wheat. Anyway, I started changing that and again, it's transformed my world. I look at my business and it's no longer stagnated. It's dramatically growing every single month. I looked at my relationships, I looked at all these other aspects of my life, and as I shifted my responses from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cwhat if\u201d, it changed everything. What I've done is I've basically increased my teachability index. I've opened myself up to learning again, and most people don't.</p> <p>In the book what I'm talking about, and this is kind of my message for you guys today, is as we get into whatever our business is and where we consider ourselves an expert. We're either an expert doing what you're doing or teaching it. Some of you guys are teachers as well, but a lot of us, our teachability is zero and we're kind of teaching what we've gained so far in our life, and I think that's wrong. When I was hanging out with Howard Berg, the world's fastest reader, one the of the first times I was hanging out with him, I asked him his opinion on God because I want to ... He's read over 30,000 books. The dude's a genius, right? I was like, \"What's your opinion on God?\" He's like, \"Well, you know, a lot of people will read one book on a topic and that becomes their truth.\"</p> <p>He said, \"For me, I look at that as one author's opinion, so I like to read 10 or 20 or 30 books on a topic and then I get a whole bunch of people's opinion and I have the ability to see the whole picture and then from there make my choices.\" He would go on like, \"This is what these guys believe and this is what these guys believe, and this is what this ...\" He started sharing ... It was insane. If you ever meet Howard Berg ask him for an hour of his time and ask him his thoughts on God, because it was fascinating. It was the coolest thing in the world. Any topic you ask him and he can go into that like, \"Oh, well most people read one book. I read 40 on the topic. This is what I think.\" He's just like, \"You get a holistic picture as opposed to just a fragment.\"</p> <p>I think for us as educators, as experts, as whatever you want to call yourself, it's time to open back up your teachability index and become a student again. Become obsessed with it. In fact, the very first thing I talk about in the Expert Secrets book, I call it the Expert Maker Funnel, and it's doing a telesummit or some type of a summit, because in that summit, you transition from whatever you are to ... Your attractive character profile becomes the interviewer. In that interviewer role, you have a chance to interview tons of other people. It's just like reading 50 books. Interview all these other people and suddenly what's going to happen is your picture of your reality is going to change. It's going to grow. It's going to become way better.</p> <p>I think that it's time for all of us, if we really want to serve our people at the highest level, it's time to transition away from being the leader all the time, and become a student, and really open your teachability. Because you're going to learn and gain so many things you can help your people with that you couldn't just by sticking with all that you're doing right now. That's my message for today. You're going to love the book. It goes so much deeper than that. There's so much more which I could share, but we're at the office, and I got to get to work and help try to serve some more people, get this message out because I think it's important and it's worth sharing. That's what I got for you guys today. Have an amazing day and I'll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "10:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_181.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1452020536, "title": "Episode #180 \u2013 Return And Report", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A bunch of cool things we implemented this week that you may be interested in\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about how he organizes and gets his team to get things done in a timely manner by having Monday meetings with the team.

Welcome to Marketing in Your Car. All right everybody, so my last episode of Marketing in Your Car did not make the publication route. I feel bad because it was so funny, but I figured it would probably be best for me not to do it. Sometimes you know they say, \"If you have nothing ...\" or, what is it? \"If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.\" What I did, you guys know Lead Pages just came out with a new announcement for some of the new things, and I did a whole podcast as if they had hired me to be their consultant. I wanted to point out just all of the mistakes they made, and I felt so bad, I was like... I basically was a consultant and consulted to them, it was really funny, I couldn't keep it.</p> <p>Before I posted I sent it to a couple people and they said, \"While it was hilarious and really actually pretty good it would have actually helped Lead Pages a lot if they listened to it, we probably shouldn't do that. So I didn't, so I apologize, but just know it was really funny and you guys should try to consult for your competitor sometimes because it's really, really, really an enjoyable thing to do. Don't publish it live because somehow it's going to bite me in the butt I knew, so anyway. If any of you guys have a chance to steal my phone someday it's archived in here, I've got it. It's just not going to make it to the ... what do you call it? It's not going to make it on the ... hit the cutting room floor or whatever, so yeah.</p> <p>Any who, today what I want to talk about is, remember last week or two weeks ago I was talking about compartmentalizing your days and stuff like that. I did, so yesterday was Monday and I figured I want to make sure that everybody on my team organization is running the right direction, right? The worst thing is by Wednesday people are like, \"So what do you want me to do this week?\" You're like, \"It's Wednesday, why didn't you ask me on Monday, or even Tuesday, or even Wednesday morning? Two and a half days you've been sitting around doing stuff but not like the right stuff.\" So I figured Monday is my day to aim, right? I'm sure you guys have heard this story about Abraham Lincoln where ... I think it was Abraham Lincoln, or some dude, maybe someone else. Where it's like if you were going to be in an ax racing contest with somebody else what would you do? It's like, well I would spend the first six hours sharpening my saw and the last hour winning? Whatever that is. I totally screwed that story up, but you guys get the point right? You can chop with a dull saw but it's going to take way longer than if you spend time sharpening.</p> <p>Monday is now my sharpening/meeting day to make sure everyone's pointed in the right direction, and trying to do a little more training consulting to people on my team. With all my core people that I work directly with I set up daily, or excuse me, weekly meetings. Not long ones, like fifteen minute meetings, and then we've got accountability throughout the day so each person at the end of the day they need to vox me with kind of what we call a return and report. They can return and report what they did throughout the day. They say, \"Hey Russell, today I did this. Tomorrow I'm working on this,\" then they have to tell me any issues they see standing in the way of completing what they're doing tomorrow. \"Hey, I really need some help from a graphic designer, Russell I need this,\" whatever they need from me, and boom, I can give it to them and help them keep running.</p> <p>That's kind of nice, we plugged that into place and it's going well so far. Yesterday I had more meetings than I ever wanted to have in my life but I also learned more about my business than I think I ever knew. Realized some things we were doing right and some things we were doing wrong, and some things that I need to do to step up and really feel in the gaps. That was really cool, I really am glad that I did that. We also spent time, John on our team runs our ad agency, it's an internal ad agency and we're the only client. He runs that. I had an hour long meeting with him yesterday and we just had a chance to brainstorm, and talk through things, figure out what funnels I can make to help him better. What he was doing, and get ideas. It was awesome, usually I know he's amazing and he's doing stuff but it was fun for me to see it and be able to think, \"On my side what I can do to help amplify this and make it better?\"</p> <p>Yesterday Brent was out of the office but I\u2019m having a meeting with him today because he's back. We're building out this huge new front end call center thing based off of the book Predictable Revenue, and today we're going to meet on that and start planning ... it's just, it's cool. I really enjoyed Monday meeting day. Now today, Tuesday and Wednesday, are Russell's funnel building days. I get to build funnels all day today and tomorrow, I'm so excited. That's awesome, then Thursday is the day I get to sell, then Friday is fulfillment day. Which is fulfillment of coaching, creation of projects, et cetera, et cetera. So far one day into this and I'm really liking it, so I'll report back to you guys as we keep going forward. So far I'm really, really liking it. That's very encouraging.</p> <p>Second off I had an idea this morning for a new free plus shipping offer that I am so excited for. You guys are going to hear it first before anyone else even heard of it, but we're going to have it executed here within the next two weeks or so then it will be live and you guys will see it. I was just thinking I want a cool free plus shipping offer to get people into Click Funnels, what would be a fun exciting thing. I was thinking about one of our Inner Circle members asked me about something you guys have seen when we did the big ... we blew up the Neurosales sales letter and had it huge on our office wall and they were like, \"How did you do that? We want to be able to put our funnels up on the wall.\" I was like, \"What if we made a magnet pack that had a whole bunch of refrigerator magnets in it that you could go on your refrigerator and it has ten sales page, ten upsale pages, ten webinar\u2026 all of the core funnel pages you need, right? We just have a magnetic pack then you go in your refrigerator and move things around and build your dream funnel on your refrigerator. How cool would that be?</p> <p>We're making that, so that's going to be our next free plus shipping offer to get people into Click Funnels. I just thought that was one of the coolest things ever, and if you think that's cool it means you've been geeking out with me long enough that we're all on the same page. We are making that, funnel magnets is coming soon. I\u2019ve got to go buy funnelmagnets.com or something like that, but anyway, that is another fun thing that I get to work on. One thing I wanted to kind of say related to that, I had a lot of interviews during the Christmas/New Years break, a lot of podcast interviews and stuff like that, we kind of loaded them up during that time so I could ... we're working a little less and just doing more of those. One question I got consistently a couple times it's just like, \"Russell, what's next?\"</p> <p>I kind of smile I say, \"You know what? For the last ten years of me doing this business I was looking like, what's next, what's next, what's next.\" I realized that's what was the problem, I kept trying to figure out what's the next thing to do. We spent all this time, effort and energy building something, we roll it out, and I was looking at what's next. When we launched Click Funnels a year and a half ago, and I've talked about this with you guys before, I sat back and said, \"Okay, I need to try and focus.\" We sold the supplement company, we shut down like ten other side projects that we were doing and we started to focus. I was really nervous, I was like, \"My entrepreneurial ADD ... I'm a creator, I want to create things, I want to figure out new funnels, new offers, things like that,\" that gets me excited. I had a friend, I'm not going to give him credit for it. Okay, I'll give him credit for it, his name is BJ. BJ Wright, some of you guys may know him.</p> <p>BJ said something like, \"What if you just instead of use your creativity to create a new product, what if you use your creativity to figure out more ways to market Click Funnels?\" I was like, \"Huh, that's actually a really good idea.\" If you've noticed over the last twelve months every funnel we have put out, every offer we put out, everything, including my book, they are all bait to get people into Click Funnels. Anyways, kind of interesting, just want to throw that out in case you guys haven't noticed. You probably noticed it but if not there it is. It's like this funnel magnet, that is a cool, creative, awesome idea we can do that will get people into Click Funnels, there yeah go.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm at the office, I gotta bounce. Have an amazing day today, block out your schedule you guys because so far it's been amazing and I think that we all should be doing that. Other than that I will talk to you guys again soon, bye.</p>", "duration": "08:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_180.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1451328647, "title": "Episode #179 \u2013 The High-Fat Rehab Plan, Plus My New Year Strategy", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Here are a few of the things I\u2019m doing over the next few weeks to prepare me for the new year.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about some basic rules of thumb to use to feel much better and more energized.

This is Russell and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. All right, all right, all right. As you can probably tell, I sound a little better today than I did yesterday. I wanted to send you guys that message from my death bed, so you could ... Two reasons: One, I wanted to document it for myself, how crappy I felt. And number two, I wanted to make a point that most people are living like zombies and they don't even know it. If you just change a couple little things, you feel so much better. Especially, when you're trying to dominate and take over the world. You've got to feel good if you're going to take over the world. If not, you're kind of in trouble. The whole way around it's not good.</p> <p>I wanted to give you guys some practical advice today, because some of you guys aren't going to want to change your diet and do a bunch of crazy things. Some of you guys don't want to lose weight, you just want to feel amazing all day.</p> <p>Here is the basic rule of thumb, if you just want to feel amazing so you can dominate everybody. Step one, first thing in the morning, do not eat any carbs or any protein. Your day needs to begin on fats. That's it. Just fats. What that means is, if you are a coffee drinker I'd recommend googling, Bullet Proof Coffee, and learn how to make that. If you're not a coffee drinker like me, you can make a variation of that. Basically, it's high fats. What you're looking for are: butter, MCT oil, and if you are going to eat a whole food its going to be avocado. That's your morning domination.</p> <p>I did a Periscope the other day called the avocado bomb, which if you missed it, go search avocado bomb on the blog or if you go to Marketingquickiesshow.com, you can see it there as well. Basically, it's an avocado, you chop it in half, you pull out the seed, you throw some salt on it, where the pit came out you fill those full of MCT oil, and you eat that. That's like an amazing breakfast. All you eat for breakfast are fats. That's rule number one.</p> <p>Rule number two, is the first time you introduce proteins into your diet is around lunchtime. Lunchtime you can have tons of vegetables, lots of oil again, fats are good, and then if you want to introduce some meat; that is where you introduce it is at lunch. Still, there are no carbs. The second you have carbs, you're done. Your day's just screwed at that point. You should just go to bed, because it's pretty much over. We start introducing proteins at lunch if you want to.</p> <p>Dinner time is where you have it more complete; where you have your fats, your proteins, and then you can introduce a carb at dinner. At that point, you are just going to go to bed anyways, so it doesn't matter if you feel like crap. The carbs we're introducing, though, are not going to be donuts and stuff like that. Usually, what I'm going to have is sweet potatoes or yams. If you go to Whole Foods or probably most stores, they have bagged, pre-chopped up sweet potatoes that are awesome. They taste like candy. Just taking those, basically, you're eating your chicken, your broccoli, asparagus, whatever, and then some of those. That's your dinner.</p> <p>If you guys just did that alone, most of you would probably start losing weight; but you would definitely start dominating more, because you wouldn't feel tired. First time you feel tired is after dinner; but because it's yams and not donuts, it wouldn't be a bad tired. It would be like, \"I feel good. This gave me the glycogen boost.\" I don't know. The health guys are probably making fun of me, because I don't really know what I'm talking about. I just know how I feel when I do it this way. That's it. High fat. Leading with high fat in the morning. Introducing proteins at lunch. If you want carbs, then have them at dinner. If you just follow that alone, you'll feel amazing. I feel great today.</p> <p>The next day, all I did this morning was I drank some butter, and I feel great. I, almost, hate having lunch, because that's when I start introducing some of the other stuff. I just like having just this. There's my hint for those who are wondering how to quickly get out of a slump, and it's amazing. Yesterday, I was feeling like crap, so about lunchtime I had my high fat thing, and it just flipped it all around. I felt better almost instantly afterwards. It's amazing how much your body is craving, your brain needs the high fats. Avocados, MCT oil, and butter; that is the staple of your diet, if you want to feel amazing.</p> <p>With that said, I'm headed to the office today. It's a couple days before New Year's, and my job is to get a bunch of stuff done so that when we hit January 1st, I can run really, really, really fast. A couple things, if you've been listening to the podcast, especially, over the last week or so; I did one sharing with you guys the business model for the year. That's our business model. We've got two core businesses. One is DotComSecrets, which is the training side of our business. Then, ClickFunnels, which is the ClickFunnels side of the business.</p> <p>In both of those businesses, we have a webinar that will be happening once a week. The other cool thing I was listening to Justin and Tara over at 8minutemillionaire.com, their podcast is the only podcast I really listen to right now. I really enjoy it, so you guys should go check theirs out if you're not listening to it yet. They were talking about compartmentalizing, and how they structure their day. For them, Thursday is content day, and things like that. I really like that a lot. In fact, I'm going to go, and today one of my goals is to figure out my week. Where I know every Thursday is sales day. All I\u2019m doing Thursday, I'm waking up, I have nothing else on the docket, except for selling. I'm going to be doing a webinar for DotComSecrets, and the webinar for ClickFunnels and that's it. When those are done, I go home and I don't do anything else.</p> <p>Thursday is sales day. That's all I'm allowed to do, and I'm going to figure out what the other days like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are maybe Funnel days. I hope, those are my favorite days. Friday might be content day, where I'm building out the content for the next thing. That's where I'm leaning towards. I'm going to be planning out my weekly schedule, and really start to focus on that this year, as well. I think, before, I'm kind of all over the place; where I'm doing this and I'm doing that and I'm everywhere. As opposed to, Friday is content day, therefore, what I have to do today is I've got to write three blog posts, ten emails on both companies, all the emails, record these two modules for this training, and blah, blah, blah. Whatever those things are, but it's just content day and that whole day is only allowed to build content. I'm not allowed to build on Funnels. I'm not allowed to do anything else. Then, maybe Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are Funnel days. Really, Monday would be advertising day. Tuesday, Wednesday are Funnel days. Thursday's sales day. Friday content days. I don't know. Something like that.</p> <p>See how powerful that is, if you know that going into it. Most of us, our brains go to what we enjoy the most. To me, my favorite thing is building stuff. The problem of building stuff is, in and of itself, it doesn't make you any money. Things that make you money are marketing and sales. The funnel is the thing in the middle that converts that, but I've got to be selling and I've got to be marketing. Monday might be my marketing day, where I'm sitting down with John for an hour, who does all of our ad stuff; Brent, who does our inbound stuff; Dave, who's doing our partnership stuff; and having one hour each with those guys. Just planning, brainstorming, figuring out, moving the needle forward, so that day's all focused on how to get new blood in. Tuesday, Wednesday focused on building cool stuff. Thursday sales. Friday content. I'm kind of liking that. Anyways, I'll figure it out for sure.</p> <p>I recommend for you guys is figure out some kind of schedule as well. If you don't block out time for the necessities with stuff you have to do to make money; I promise you that all the stuff you want to do will creep in and drown the things that you really need to do. I know this from experience. When we were doing webinars consistently, we made way more money, and then I'm like, \"Oh. Let's do automated webinars.\" Then, I started ... When the focus is off of sales, everything drops, so trying to make it where we really have hard focuses like that. That's my game plan, and I recommend you guys doing something similar, so when we hit January 1st, which is not far off, we can all run really, really, really quick. That is kind of what's happening over here. I hope that gives you some ideas.</p> <p>What else is awesome? I don't want to leave you guys while I've got you here. So many fun things that we're think about, doing, and talking about. A couple other things that we're going to be doing this year that hopefully give you guys some ideas, as well. Everyone, I think, has become so reliant on Facebook ads. It's become the crutch for almost everyone. It scares me for my own business, for your guy's, and everybody's. This year, I recommend trying to find out new sources for you.</p> <p>A couple of things we're doing; some of you know Success Magazine, we're going to be buying some ads in Success Magazine. Plus, their online stuff, we're going to be testing out a whole bunch of things there. Our dream clients are reading and subscribed there. That's one big thing we're going to be focusing on. Also, I'm excited for this. I'm not sure if you guys have ever been to advertising.com, but really cool advertising platform that we haven't tested yet. I'm going to spend some time in January trying to learn that network. They've got really good customization, where we can target business owners, entrepreneurs, and things like that. You'll see if you go to advertising.com; you see what it is and how it is. I haven't used it yet, so I'm not sure. I'm going to be focusing a lot more on that and those types of things, just to diversify.</p> <p>We're also going to be focusing, and I'll be sharing this with the inner circle in a couple weeks when they're all up here; but focusing hard on building up conservative, Republican lists. I think over the next twelve months is going to be a chance, for those who take advantage of it, to build up million plus person email list and Facebook followings in the political arena. Just so you guys know on our side, we buy a lot of ads on political lists. If I can be the one who controls that political lists, that's even better. Right? That's one of the big focuses that we've got for this year, as well. Just some hints for some cool things that we're doing on our side. That's about it. All right guys. I've laid down some hints. Given you guys some ideas. Hopefully, gives you some fuel for today to think through some things.</p> <p>Hopefully, change your diet a little bit, so you have a little more energy. A little more focus, so you can take over the world. With that said, I am pretty much at the office, you guys. I'm going to bounce. Have an amazing day. We will talk to you guys all again very, very soon. Bye.</p>", "duration": "11:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_179.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1451327348, "title": "Episode #178 \u2013 The Flu Shot Scam And Why You Feel Crappy", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Is what you eat directly affecting your daily performance?</p> <p>On this special day-after-Christmas episode Russell talks about using the holiday to eat whatever he wanted all day maybe wasn\u2019t a good idea.

That's right, I am still laying in bed right now. Hey everyone, so this is a special episode. It is the day after Christmas and I am laying in my bed, like I said. I am not going to be driving to the office today. I'm hanging out with the kids, having fun and yesterday was Christmas and it was awesome. The day before Christmas, I think I did a podcast, it was snowing and so we went and built huge snow forts, which was awesome.</p> <p>Then Christmas eve, we were up super late. My family tradition, my wife and I's tradition, well it's more mine, I don't think she really likes it, my favorite Christmas show is Family Man with Nicholas Cage. We stayed up all night watching Family Man and wrapping presents, which was awesome. Went to bed at about 2:00 and then the kids have a rule that they're not allowed into our room until 7, so I think they were up at about 3:00 in the morning and they're sitting there in their rooms waiting until 7. At 7:00, they run down and wake us all up for Christmas. I only had four or five hours of sleep, so we were pretty beat.</p> <p>We did Christmas and then, I thought, you know what, it's Christmas, I'm going to eat and do whatever I want. I had like 20 bowls of cereal. I had Fruity Pebbles cereal. I had Reese's Puffs cereal. I had Marshmallow Mateys cereal. I had every cereal we had, I had a bowl of that. I bought my own pint of egg nog. I drank that. Oh, so good. By the way, egg nog, I found out, for a half a cup has like 23 grams of sugar. Maybe it was 33. It was something crazy like that.</p> <p>Yeah, yesterday, I was like, \"You know what, screw it, I'm eating whatever I want.\" I ate whatever I want. What was interesting is throughout the day, I could not keep my eyes open, I couldn't keep my body awake. Collette and I both kept passing out. She would pass out on the couch after the whole opening presents and they're playing and she's passed out and I wanted to too. I was like, \"Okay, I've got to stay awake,\" because of Norah. She could choke on half the new stuff we got. I'm watching Norah. Collette slept for two hours and then Norah fell asleep, so I laid down and boom I was gone.</p> <p>Then the whole day, we were half awake, half asleep the whole day. I felt like a mummy. I felt like I was like this ... I don't know, I couldn't keep my eyes open. Then, this morning I woke up and I feel like I got hit by a train. I feel horrible and I realized, my voice sounds kind of funny right now, it had to do with the fuel I was putting in my body. I was putting in horrible food because I could barely keep my eyes open throughout the day. It is amazing, because I eat pretty clean typically. If you follow me at all, you know I eat a really high-fat diet, low carbs, things like that, and I usually feel amazing. I usually have a ton of energy and I usually just feel really, really good.</p> <p>Even the fact my testosterone levels are super low and my testosterone doctor was like, \"How are you standing right now?\" I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" He's like, \"This is really low, you should not feel good.\" I'm like, \"I feel great.\" He was like, \"That doesn't make any sense.\"</p> <p>Because of my diet, I feel really, really good all time. Yesterday, after eating probably what most people eat normally, I felt like garbage. I couldn't even keep my eyes open. I literally, the whole day, felt like I was in this foggy haze where I couldn't even keep my eyes open. It was horrible. Today I'm going to start eating normal again. I'm really excited just to feel the difference again.</p> <p>It's interesting, the fuel you put in your body, how big of an effect it has, I was thinking, I don't think most people in the world, and maybe you at this point, and this is why I'm sharing this, if you're eating cereal for breakfast and stuff, it's destroying your performance. I can tell you now, after seeing the way that most Americans eat, it's bad. I couldn't keep my eyes open. How do you function? How do you expect to come in and dominate whatever you do if you feel like that? It has 100% to do with the fuel you're eating.</p> <p>You know, it's interesting, I was just like that my whole life. I never knew it, because I know it had a bad effect on me because you're always in that state, you assume that's what you're supposed to feel like, right? I was always in that state and then first when I started thinking about it differently is when I went to a Tony Robbins event and I still remember one of the interesting things he talked about was, he talked about the flu, and showed the science behind a flu shot and how basically the whole thing is pretty much a big scam.</p> <p>All it is is a way for these guys to make billions and billions and billions of dollars but how there's no actual proof that any of it really works. Then they started showing the proof of what is shown that the truth is, is Halloween comes around, we eat a whole crap ton of candy and then Thanksgiving comes, we eat a whole bunch of horrible food and then Christmas comes, then New Year comes, and it's like a month and a half, two months of just horrible eating. By about January, so our body is so broken down that we start getting the flu. It shows its direct correlation to the holiday eating patterns and flu viruses and how that's how that goes, interesting.</p> <p>That year, I remember we went down to my parents' house for Thanksgiving dinner, or for maybe it was Christmas, I can't remember. Yes, it was Thanksgiving. On the drive down, we all got sick. My wife got sick. My daughter got sick. They nicknamed that Thanksgiving \"Tsunami Collette\" because my wife started it, she got sick first, and by the time we were done, everyone in the whole entire house, all my cousins and everyone had gotten sick.</p> <p>I was thinking about it. That was the first time I started thinking, \"Man, it's because of all this crap we're eating,\" and that's what Tony said. Now I try to, especially during the holidays, I'm very conscious of what I eat. Last week, we did a juice fast the whole week before Christmas. I'm like, \"I want to protect myself from feeling the way I feel right this second.\" Yesterday, I thought, you know what, who cares, I'm just going to go and live it up for a day. It's just crazy interesting, and I believe in what Tony said, you know, that year we all got the flu and that year, it was weird because that year we actually had flu shots.</p> <p>Then every year since then, we have never had flu shots, so I think we're pretty anti-flu shots now and we've never been sick during a holiday since. It's really, really weird the correlation of what we're eating and how we're feeling and how we're getting sick and the flus and all these things, has 100% to do with the fuel we're putting our bodies. Just wanted to record this for myself and for everyone else, to document why as I'm laying here in bed, how I'm feeling. I feel ... My nose is stuffed, my brain's all foggy. I feel like, ugh, I don't even want to move. It all is from yesterday's carb binge. It was horrible. It was amazing, it tasted good. I'm not going to lie. Yeah, it was really, really bad.</p> <p>If you're not feeling like you're in a spot every morning when you wake up where you just want to dominate the world and take over everything, and you feel like just ugh all the time, or if you don't feel great all the time, you just feel normal, normal is not a good thing. I think what I felt yesterday is what normal people feel like every day. It scares me. I feel so bad for everybody now. If you want to feel amazing, it's time to shift your diet and think differently about how you're eating. Yeah, that's my message for today.</p> <p>I am going to eat really, really good today and see how quick it can counteract. Our bodies are amazing how fast they can respond to things. I'm going to go eat some good stuff, flip it around and see if a day of amazing eating will counteract a day of crap eating.</p> <p>All right guys, so that's it. Getting out of bed now.

I'm out in the snow the day before Christmas, and we're about to lay down some Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>All right everyone, we've been hoping, we've been praying, we've been wishing, we've been dreaming of a white Christmas and sure enough, Christmas is tomorrow and today we woke up and it is snowing. We are having an official white Christmas. We didn't think we were going to get it, but we got it. I'm excited.</p> <p>I'm actually driving to the store because one of our family traditions for Christmas is, Santa brings every single kid their own box of sugar cereal. We usually eat super healthy all year round, but on Christmas day, we don't. That's a tradition we've had since I was a little kid. We use to do it when we were little kids, we would each get our own boxes. Santa would ask what we wanted for Christmas, it wasn't never I want a pony or a bike. It was I want Marshmallow Mateys, or I want Lucky Charms. Eventually it morphed into everyone ...</p> <p>At first, the first few years it was all over the place cereals. Some people getting Cocoa Krispies, some getting Fruity Pebbles. It was all over the place. Eventually we all found out that the best is Lucky Charms. That became the staple. Then we found out that if you go to the generic brand, the Malt-O-Meal or whatever, you can get the big old bags of Marshmallow Mateys which are basically like Lucky Charms only it's in a huge bag at half the price. You're getting twice the cereal and Santa Claus is basically hooking you up for a lot longer. We\u2019d each, by then\u2026 the last 10 years of my childhood, we'd each get our own bag of Marshmallow Mateys. The huge old bags, right?</p> <p>What we would do Christmas morning is, we would get a big old salad bowl out, fill the whole salad bowl full of Marshmallow Mateys. Then we eat out all the oats and not eat the marshmallows. If you ate a marshmallow you lost. We would eat the whole oats, and it's like an hour long process. By the time it was done, you got a big ole salad bowl full of milk and marshmallows, and it's pretty dang amazing. Then we eat those down, and that's Christmas.</p> <p>Christmas isn't Christmas without cereal. I'm going to get cereal right now for myself and my kids, and yes, Santa Claus is bringing me my very own bag of Marshmallow Mateys and I'm not going to share with the kids. It's going to be awesome.</p> <p>Anyway, I wanted to share with you, because I was thinking as I was driving here, I don't know if it's the same for you guys, but my brain feels like it's this track where it's always moving forward and looping things and ideas are coming in and out and every once and a while one's exciting. I had one while I was driving. I wasn't planning on doing a podcast, all of a sudden, this was like, \"Oh crap, this is a good idea!\" I'm going to share with you guys, and I'm going to be doing it.</p> <p>It's been interesting, a lot of people that I work with are trying to create lead magnets and all this crap. I feel bad because if you remember a year ago or a few years ago, Ryan Dice and Perry Belcher came out with this whole \"This is what a funnel is. You have to have a lead magnet, then a tripwire, then a core offer, then return maximizer,\" and all this stuff, right? Which is kind of true but kind of annoying because now everyone that I talk to is like, \"Oh, this is my lead magnet. This is my core return maximizer offer,\" and all these things, and it kind of drives me crazy because I don't know. I hate when people act like business is 100% cookie cutter because it's not. Everything's a little different.</p> <p>People are like, \"Russell, how come you don't have your ... Why aren\u2019t you driving traffic to a lead magnet? Why are you driving directly to your free book offer?\" I'm like, \"Because my free book offer gets three times conversion opt-ins as do any kind of lead magnet.\" Someone else, one of our coaching clients last week, they had this really cool funnel that some people built for them and their lead magnet was boring. It was costing them $18 to get an opt-in. Then, their tripwire was not that cool. Their core offer ... This is all based on their philosophy ... was awesome. I was like, \"Dude, get rid of all the other crap and sell the core offer. That's what people want. Why would you hide your sexiest thing, the thing that's going to get people to actually respond to your ads? Make that the offer.\" He's like, \"But I thought I had to have a lead magnet and a tripwire,\" and all this crap.</p> <p>Anyway, so there's my little rant for the day. You don't. You've got to find the coolest thing that's going to get people to respond and that's what you lead with. Always. Sorry, that rant wasn't supposed to come up either, but there it is.</p> <p>Anyway, with that said, for me, I lead with my sexiest thing, so free book offers, webinars, things like that. After awhile, if you've been promoting something for a long, long, long, long time, it starts getting what we call ad fatigue, where the more and more people have seen it, it gets more expensive, so you have to change the ad, change the landing page, all sorts of the things, or what I like to do now is start putting in bridge pages, which are basically a squeeze page. A page to get somebody interested and get their email address and then we can follow-up with them and sell them the main things we want to sell again.</p> <p>The problem is it's kind of a pain to go and create all these op- in pages and lead magnets and all that jazz, right? I was thinking. This is what spurred this whole podcast. I was driving here and I was thinking about a blog post that Steven did. Steven is our blogger over at ClickFunnels. He was on an episode of Marketing \u00a0In Your Car. He's from Australia, he's awesome. He wrote this one, it was 14 Tools for Funnel Hacking. Something awesome like that. It was a blog post. I was like, \"Crap, dude, that should be an opt-in page.\" \"Hey, who wants the 14 best tools for funnel hacking? Opt-in here.\" They give me their name and email address. I redirect them to the blog. Now I've got them on my email list. I can sell them Click Funnels, I can sell them whatever else I want, right?</p> <p>I was thinking how easy is that? I don't even have to create this content. I can go to Youtube, find the videos in my market that get the most views and that video can be the opt-in. I'm like, \"Hey, free video at Robert Kiyosaki, telling you why\" blah blah blah blah blah, whatever. People opt-in. I send them the Youtube video of Robert Kiyosaki talking about whatever, and then boom, now I've got them on a list and I can start selling them my stuff.</p> <p>Isn't that easy? One of my big a-ha's I learned from Neil Patel when he came out here to Boise is that ... I used to think he was writing blog posts based on keywords or whatever, and he's like, \"No, I go to BuzzSumo.com, I search my keyword, I find out what articles are already being shared and I write another article almost identical to those.\" I was like, \"Oh, that makes a lot of sense.\"</p> <p>Just go to BuzzSumo.com, find the articles in your market that have been shared 100,000 times and have 18,000,000 reads, and that might be something that people in your market are interested in, so why not just make this landing page offering them that blog post for your email address. Use the same title that they're already using because it's proven to work, and boom, now you've got these new lead magnets. I hope you guys got that because it's pretty powerful. I'm going to be busting out a crap-ton of landing pages here that aren't going to take hardly any time at all, and all they'll do is opt you in, redirect you to that landing page and then you'll be added to my list and I'm going to sell you cool stuff that you need and want.</p> <p>This works in other markets, too. Let's just say you're a brand new beginner. You've got nothing, right? Let's say you're like, \"Hey, I want to be in the ...\" What's a cool market? You want to be in the almond milk making business and I say that because this morning I made almond milk, which is awesome. I've never made almond milk before but I did it and it was one of the coolest things ever.</p> <p>I don't think there's really a market for that, but let's just pretend like there was because there should be because it's amazing. It tasted way better than regular almond milk and it's not going to kill you because there's some ingredient in regular almond milk you buy at the store that will kill you all. Just FYI, learn how to make your own. It's really fun. You have to buy a $6 sprouted seed bag or nut bag or something. That sounds horrible. Anyway, that's the only thing you need is that and almonds. Anyway, it's pretty awesome. For a $6 investment, you can make your own almond milk.</p> <p>All right. Back on track, Russell. Sorry, my ADD brain is flying. The snow is not helping. The thought of Marshmallow Mateys is keeping it going. All right, so sorry you guys. I'm sorry I'm putting you through this.</p> <p>Back to focus. We decide we want to go into the almond milking market. We want to sell the crap out of people who want to learn how to milk almonds. First thing we want to do is go to BuzzSumo.com and we search almond milk and we find out that there's this blog post that they say has been shared 150,000 times about how to make your own almond milk. People are going nuts about almond milk. I go to Clickbank.com and I find four more products about how to make almond milk, almond cake, almond flour, almond blah blah blah and I'm excited. Then, I go to Click Funnels, I set up a really quick landing page that's called Almond Milking Secrets and then I'll have a little thing underneath it from Meet the Parents. It'll have that little clip where what's-his-name is like, \"I can milk anything with nipples,\" and then the other dude's like, \"Well, can you milk me, Focker?\" I'll have that clip underneath the thing so it'll be funny and will make it go more viral. I'll have an opt-in.</p> <p>Then, boom, I'll go to Facebook. I'll target almond milking people, and they see this landing page saying, \"Hey, here's my almond milking secret.\" There's this funny video from Meet the Parents. They opt in, boom, I redirect them to the exact blog post article that already has a billion views because you know that's what people want. I've got a follow-up sequence now where I start selling them almond milking products, almond making flour, almond making whatever else.</p> <p>Now I'm in the almond business overnight. Now people are buying. Now I can ask them what they want and I can make my own product. Boom, now I've got a huge business.</p> <p>You see how that works? That's for the almond market. Imagine if we did that in a market that was actually making some money. It\u2019d be pretty cool, right? Anyway, I hope that helps because this is a strategy you should use no matter what. If you don't have a business yet, this is how you could start a business very, very quickly. If you do have a business, go out there and find all the viral, crazy articles in your market. Blog posts, Youtube videos and things like that, and just ask for name and email address. Share those with people and boom, you're in.</p> <p>There you go, guys. That's what I've got for today. Hope that helped. I'm jumping in to go and get my cereal and I will talk to you guys all again maybe tomorrow. Who knows? If not, we'll talk to you guys soon. Thanks everybody.

Tonight it is cold outside, but we're still about to do a Marketing In Your Car. \u00a0Hey everyone, I hope things are going amazing for you. Heading home from the office today, and just keep getting more and more excited about how simple and stupid my plan is for next year. The angle's always world domination, and the strategy's changed so many times, but look at the people in our coaching group that have made the most amount of money, the things that have made me the most amount of money. It's all had to do with one core focus. It comes down to this. If you\u2019re taking notes, write it down right now. If you're in a car, pull over so you can focus a 100% because this is the key. Okay, and I talked about his on my periscope, the one that I told you guys about yesterday that we did 150k sales on it. The key is having a live event every Thursday, and the one singular goal of your entire company is to get at least a thousand people a week onto that webinar.</p> <p>That's it. It's kind of like the whole 'apple a day keeps the doctor away'. A thousands registrants a week for your webinar keeps money flowing. We were doing the math on that. Let's just say, and I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me cause I'm driving, as you guys know, but say you have a thousand people a week to register. This is all sources, so Facebook, solo ads, email ads, Twitter, social media. Everything you're doing is all pushing towards this one event that's happening ever single week. You're just focusing on that. Okay, and so you're doing that. You have a thousand people to register. From that, you get thirty percent show up rate, right? That drops to three hundred who show up, and then your call to action ... Let's say you follow the perfect webinar script, if you don't follow it, you get like 1% closure. You follow the perfect webinar script, you're at 10% close rate. That means of the 330 people give you a thousand dollars from that webinar, so you just made 30,000 dollars.</p> <p>The math on that, let's say you should be averaging between 3 and 5 dollars per webinar registrant. Let's just say we spent 5 dollars per registrant, and we've got thousands. You pay 5 grand, and you make 30, okay. Now, what is that? If I was talking to my kids right now I'd say, \"Son, you call that arbitrage, okay.\" I put in 5,000 dollars on Monday through Thursday. Thursday night, I get 30,000 dollars back, boom. I didn't just get that because a couple other things are going to happen.</p> <p>Second off, from Thursday night to Friday, Saturday, Sunday, we're going to be focusing on our replay sequence, okay. Now, there are a lot of different things you can do in a replay sequence. You can just send out the replay. You can send out urgency and scarcity we talked about a couple days ago. You can do a whole bunch of cool things, but if you do it right, you should be able to double your sales from the replay sequence, okay. Because think about it, you had 1,000 register, only 300 showed up. Only 10 percent of those people bought. You only had thirty people out of a thousand. That means you have a whole crap ton of other people haven't bought yet, and so you're job is to follow up with those people and get them to buy. Give them some urgency, some scarcity, do some cool things, maybe do a periscope, rant close Saturday night trying to get them to buy, whatever it is. You're pushing these people to take action and to give you money and to close.</p> <p>If you do it right, you should double your sales. That means that 30,000 now turned into 60,000. You have 5,000 dollars in, 60,000 dollars back out. You have more than 10X your money that week, which is pretty good, right? You're like sweet this is a good business. I put 5 grand in on Monday, I get 60,000 back out by Sunday at midnight. You do that every single week.</p> <p>Let's say that was all you did. I don't have a calculator here, and I'm not smart enough to do the math while I'm driving, but if you do that, 60 grand times 52 weeks, what's that end up being? Whatever, 3 million bucks or something, right? Your cost, 5 grand times 52 weeks, you're at 250 grand. You put in a quarter of a million bucks, you made 3 million, or whatever that is. That's a great business. That's more than most people will do ever. That's really, really exciting right there.</p> <p>That's the first step in this. The second thing to think about is every single week, you're adding a thousand people to your list. Okay, so by the end of the year, you have 52,000 people on your email list. These aren't normal people. People who have gone through your webinar registration funnel, seen your indoctrination series, they've been on your webinar, they've been indoctrinated, they've learned from you, they've seen you pitch. Those people will love and respect you a lot more because of that process that you went through with them. Now you've got a better quality person.</p> <p>If you screw this up, if you don't treat your list very well, you should be averaging at least a dollar per name, per month on your email list which means by the end of a year, you should be averaging an additional 52,000 in sales just from other exterior, I know there's a different word for that, but other things you sell that list. If you do it correctly, and you follow the whole DotComSecrets modeling, you do a value ladder, and you have upsales, and you have high ticket things, and you have other webinars and things like that, you should make a lot more than that. You should make five, or six million bucks off of that list to be a hundred percent honest.</p> <p>All that came from one solitary focus. One thing, the apple a day, it came from every Thursday we do a webinar, Monday through Thursday we fill that webinar, Friday through Sunday we close deals. And that is the fuel. That's the business. I just today, right before I left the office, I went on Thursdays, for me I do mine at noon, from noon until 2 o'clock, I put on recurring, and said every Thursday from now until the end of time I'm doing a webinar. Some people say, \"Well do I do a new webinar every single week?\" No, it's the exact same webinar. \u201cWell Russell, shouldn't I do it automated?\u201d No, you shouldn't, maybe someday, but right now you're going to do it live.</p> <p>I've done my Funnel Hacks webinar at least thirty, maybe forty times live, and I'm going to do it live every Thursday next year that I am in the office. I will automate it the days I'm not there, but I'm going to do it live.</p> <p>A couple reasons why. Why would you do it live? It's the same pitch Russell, it's probably word for word, and it is at this point. This is the reason why: On Thursdays when I\u2019m doing a live webinar, guess what happens? Everyone is focused on this live webinar. Support staff\u2019s ready, we've got people answering chat, tech guys are watching everything making sure that everything's working. We've got everyone\u2019s focus and attention on this one event that's happening. Guess what happens when you focus on something? It's really weird. Whatever you focus on will grow. If you focus on how many leads a day you get, that will grow. If you focus how many webinar registrations you get each week, that'll grow. If you focus how much money you want, it'll grow. If you focus how much weight you want to lose, it'll grow, or you'll lose. Whatever it is on that side.</p> <p>There's this weird thing that whatever we focus on grows, so hey, let's focus on that, and it'll grow, and get better. We focus, everyone focuses. Thursday, this is sales day. This is the day we all focus on selling, okay. Monday through Thursday is marketing, Thursday is sales, and the rest of it is follow up. If you do that, you guys, that's the prescription for an amazing business next year.</p> <p>I was talking to Liz Benny, and I told her, I said, \u201cLiz, I've seen you when you were running the webinar model consistently, you have the right numbers. Everything was working\u201d. I told her, I was like, \u201cI think that you can do 5 or 6 or 7 million dollars\u201d, I have a hundred percent faith she can do it. I know she can, and she knows she can, and she's going to. Guess what she's doing? She's coming back to the same model, going back to basics, all of us. I'm doing it, my entire Inner Circle's doing it, I'm going to be sending this podcast to everyone and forcing them to listen to it because this is the basics. Again, if my son was trying it, I'd say \u201cSon, that is the basics\u201d. That's what we're focusing on, and if we all do that collectively, we'll change the world in our own little ways.</p> <p>That's what I'm doing, I hope you guys follow suit. I'm excited, and I hope you're excited, and it's going to be a lot of fun. I want to warn you, there's going to be some ups and downs. Sometimes Facebook's going to kick you off. Sometimes other ad networks won't work anymore. Sometimes you get crap leads. Sometimes your JV partners will screw you over. Sometimes no one will show up to your webinar. Sometimes the close rate won't work. Sometimes GoToWebinar will drop you, or webinar jam, or things are going to happen, and it's going to be frustrating and annoying and lame and hard, and you're going to be discouraged.</p> <p>Every time you get discouraged, I want you to think about the apple a day, and think about, I've got to come back. This is the focus, and every single week I'm going to get better, I'm going to get better, I'm going to get better. Maybe the first week I'm going to get ten people to register. Next week I get thirty. Next week I get fifty, and if I make that my focus, whatever we focus on, what happens? It grows. We're going to start focusing on that, and what's going to happen in the next 12 months is your business and your life will be transformed. It can't not be, and the lives of the people you're serving will be transformed.</p> <p>You say, Russell, this is cool, but I can't afford to buy Facebook ads right now. I don't care if you can't buy Facebook ads, go spam Facebook, okay. There's a lot of ways to get traffic for free. Go out there and do it. Write blog posts, promote them, go talk to people, do joint ventures. There's other ways to do it, and if your excuse is that I can't do it because my Facebook account got shut down. I can't do it because I don't know any JV partners. I can't do it because, fill in whatever excuse you want, that's all those things are excuses. There's a lot of people with a lot of good excuses out there, but the ones who don't have excuses, and just think, how can I figure this out? They focus on it. It's weird. What happens when you focus again? You get things done. It starts to grow. Start focusing on, what else can I do? I'm broke, I can't buy Facebook ads, what else can I do?</p> <p>I just saw my man Ryan from Hardcore Closer just been watching. He joined Inner Circle a while ago. I've been watching him. Just been crazy impressed with him, all the stuff he's doing, and just grateful he joined because I have a chance to see this glimpse of what he's doing and it's just been amazing. I'm watching him do these blog posts, and he's getting hundreds of thousands of millions people reading these blog posts, and it's just ... He focuses on that and it grows. I saw him post the other day how his goal of the first of the year is to get 100 thousand visitors a month, and I think now he's getting 100 thousand visitors a week, or something crazy like that. It's what you focus on grows, and he's doing that through free traffic, and he started making money, and then he started spending his money on Facebook to boost those posts, and that's the model. That's how it all works.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that all makes perfect sense to you. I hope that gets you excited. I hope that it inspires you because that's the model, my friends. That's what we're focusing on here. That's how we're going to take our company from 8 figures to 9 figures and beyond. That's how you should be taking it from 6 to 7, from 7 to 8, from 5 to 6, from 0 to 5. It's the model. It's what works. It's what's working today, and there's nothing else you should be focusing on, I don't think.</p> <p>There you go. You've got it on a silver platter now, on a napkin, you have it in front of you. You just gotta pick it up and run with it, and if you do then I only want you to send me 10 percent of what you make. I'm just joking. All I want you to do is serve other people. Help other people, get your message out there, and hopefully you'll tell people about Click Funnels along the way because we love it, and it keeps getting better every single day. Thanks everybody.

This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to a rainy Marketing in Your Car. Hey, everyone, I hope you're doing awesome. I'm actually pretty happy right now that my voice is mostly here. I teach a Sunday school class, and yesterday I couldn't even ... I kept trying to talk and my voice is like peeking out. It sounded like I was a 15-year-old teenage boy with my voice cracking all the time, so today it's doing alright. I've been up for a few hours. I already had lifting and wrestling practice, which was awesome and amazing. Now, I'm heading to the office for a little bit. But this week, it\u2019s our Christmas week, so I can't work too hard because I've got to play with my kids too, but I do have some big things that we've got to get out of the way and get done.</p> <p>I wanted to share with you guys kind of a unique win that happened this weekend that was ... It was kind of unexpected. I hope that everyone starts funnel hacking this and copying this because it was really, really cool. As you guys know, and as I've been preaching for the last few months now, my thoughts on Periscope, and Facebook mentions, and all those kinds of platforms, right? We've been trying to slowly and organically grow our audience, and make it bigger and better each time. It's been pretty cool. Last week, Mike Filsaime was launching EverWebinar, which is an automated webinar platform.</p> <p>It's kind of this weird thing. We didn't want to promote it because we have our own automated webinar platform, but he's also our number one affiliate, and his software is really, really good. It was kind of this thing finally we decided last minute, \"Yeah, we're going to help promote this, but we've got to do it in a way that's different and cool and help people understand.\" Yes, ClickFunnels has automated webinar software, but this is kind of like if you want to take that concept deep. This software does a lot more then what we offer, to be honest. That's kind of what the promotion was.</p> <p>We started the promotion, and made a really good bonus offer, and it didn't sell very well. I think we sold like 30 the first day, and it was like 10 the second day, and then like 1 or 2 after that. I was like \"Huh. Well, that sucks.\" We tried to help him out, and I was just like, \"Ah, it's not really working.\" I think the biggest problem they had was they're selling automated webinar software, but they didn't do a webinar to sell it, which I thought was kind of strange. I thought, \"I'm just going to do my own webinar,\" because I think that's a better way to do it.</p> <p>Last Saturday, so a little over a week ago, I started scripting out a webinar. I had it on paper, but I actually didn't get to the slides. Last week ended up being crazy, all these things I was trying to get done, so I never had time to do the webinar. It comes to Thursday, and Mike's like, \"Hey, you're in the lead, but these other dudes are catching up to you. And you should promote it again.\" I was like \"Oh crap. I was going to do a webinar, but I didn't.\" I was just like, \"I don't think anyone else is going to buy it based on how I was doing it.\" Then I had this epiphany. It was like angels from heaven were singing and they said, \"Why don't you do the Perfect Webinar live on Periscope and Facebook Mentions? That way you don't have to create PowerPoint slides.\" I was like \"Sweet!\" Because I know the pitch, I know what I wanted to put in there.</p> <p>I was like, \"I don't think people are going to spend 90 minutes on Periscope, but maybe I can do a condensed version.\" So I got out my white board, I wrote out the one thing, wrote out the 3 secrets. I have these cool white boards that slide over, so I slide it over, and the second white board I built out the stack. I had the stack, and then I got these white pieces of paper to kind of cover up the stack, and I covered it up. That was all my prep. I opened up Periscope, opened up Facebook Mentions, and I started talking, and I did a 25 minute version live of the Perfect Webinar. It was awesome. I did it in front of the white board, and I slide it over, and I showed the stack. I pulled the papers off each one and did the whole thing exactly the way I show everyone.</p> <p>I scripted it out to go over the 3 core belief patterns, and I followed it to a T. We did that. What's crazy is I used the one ... I'm using terminology from the Perfect Webinar script, so if you don't have it yet, go to perfectwebinarsecrets.com and go get it. It's 5 bucks. I used the one thing as the title in my Periscope and my Facebook Mention, which worked really good. We got a lot of people on. I did the whole pitch. I think we had 3,000 people live between Periscope and Facebook Mentions who saw me do the 25 minute pitch, which was crazy. How often do you get 3,000 people live on a webinar? Let alone with the click of a button, with no advanced notice. I did that, and then as soon as it was done, John, on my team started promoting the Facebook version because it was on Facebook. He started blowing it up. Within 3 days, I think, we had 30,000 people had seen that video, which was crazy. The crazier thing is that from that we sold 160 copies the next day of Ever Webinar and the day after that we sold 78 more copies. It was crazy.</p> <p>We became the number one selling affiliate. My affiliate commissions jumped to well over $100,000, and I won a $50,000 prize. That's not counting re-bills and stuff like that. When all said and done we made $200,000 off of 1 Periscope, Facebook Mentions where I just used the perfect webinar. It was amazing. I hope you guys listen to that, and I hope you take it to heart because it gives you the ability just to test, really quick, a webinar offer and see if it's going to work. I wish I would have done that before I created some other webinars that didn't work. It would have saved me a lot of time.</p> <p>My guess is you will see me over the next upcoming months, once or twice a month probably, doing a micro Perfect Webinar pitch on Periscope and Facebook Mentions. Because if you can make that much money, that quick, why not just do it, and why not do it every once in a while? That's kind of what happened. It was kind of fun. If you haven't seen it yet, if you go to blog.dotcomsecrets.com, that's where we store them all. If you go to marketingquickiesshow.com, they'll be listed there too. I think the title is something like \"How to Make an Extra Seven Figures Next Year Using this Webinar Model,\" or \"How to Make at Least Seven Figures Next Year Using this Proven Webinar Model,\" or something like that. If you search for that, you can see the video, and just see me do the pitch, and all that kind of stuff.</p> <p>This is the best part. For those of you guys who know anything about bio-hacking, or doing weird stuff to try to increase your awesomeness. One of the coolest bio-hacking things you can do is a cryo therapy unit. Tony Robins has one in his house, Dave Asprey has one in his house, and then usually most people have to go and travel to go find one. There's one dude in Boise that's got one in his clinic. I've always wanted one, and I've been begging my wife, and she keeps telling me, \"No because it's ridiculous. It's way more money then you should spend on something stupid like that.\" I don't really have an ideal spot in our house. Well, I kind of do, but anyway ...\u00a0 The affiliate prize was $50,000 towards the BMW of your choice. I don't really want a BMW, but I do want a cryo unit, which happens to be exactly $50,000.</p> <p>I emailed Filsaime and I'm like, \"Hey, man. If I win can you buy me a cryo chamber, or whatever you call them, instead of a BMW?\" He said, \"Yes.\" I actually won a cryo unit from doing the Perfect Webinar on a thing, which is freaking amazing. Now, I've just got to convince my wife that I need to remodel one of our bathrooms and turn it into a cryo chamber, so that's the next challenge. If I can close that deal I will have one in my house.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm kind of excited as you can tell. My voice, as you can hear, is starting to fall away. If you guys made it to the end of this I apologize my voice is going, but I hope that gives you an idea. Don't forget, you guys, there's a lot of ways you can pitch. This whole game is about building audiences and then figuring out how to convert those people. I feel like we stumbled upon something really cool with growing our audiences like we've been doing, and then using this as a mechanism to convert those people into sales. Pretty exciting. Hope you guys get some value from this, and I hope you guys try it. If try it let me know. Post the video on Facebook afterwards and tag me, and I'll check it out. I want to see it. We have to think of a cool name. Should we call it the Perfect Periscope, or the Perfect Blab, or the Perfect ... I don't know. We'll figure out a cool name for it for anyone else who does it.</p> <p>Anyway, there you go you guys. I hope you guys can use that. If you're ever in Boise and you want to come my cryo chamber, if I have it, you're welcome to come. I'm just joking. My wife probably wouldn't want you to come to my house. Not because it's you, just because it's those weird people on the internet. You know what I mean. Anyway, I'm going to stop before I get in any trouble. I appreciate you guys. Have an amazing day and we'll talk to you guys all again soon. Bye!</p>", "duration": "09:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_175.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1450374260, "title": "Episode #174 \u2013 The Two Magic Words That Will 10X Sales For Any Product Or Service", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Check out this case study of what happened when we applied these two simple words.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the two magic words that made Russell more money than anything else.

This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to Marketing In Your Car, everyone. Today is the day I'm going to talk about two of my favorite words. These two words have made me more money, than I think, pretty much anything in the history of my life. If you could learn these two words, it's done, that's all you need.</p> <p>Well, that's not true. You've got to have a good offer, good product, good reputation, good brand, all the things you got to do it right. If you have all those and you want to turn that into money, the two magic words are, you ready for it? Number one is \"urgency,\" and number two is \"scarcity.\" That's it. If you can have those two things, along with an amazing offer in front of the right audience, it's game over.</p> <p>Here's the back story. Last January, so a year ago, it's not quite January yet but almost, Vince Palko from Adtoons.com, super cool dude, he's the inventor of the hand sketched doodle video. Anyway, he messaged me, \"Hey man, what are your goals for next year?\" I'm like, \"Why?\" He said, \"I'll make you a cool gift.\" I wrote down about a handful of goals and sent them over to him and he ended up sketching this amazing\u2026 it's awesome, it's just the coolest thing, it\u2019s like this huge picture with all my goals drawn out in cartoon format and this really progression between, it was amazing.</p> <p>He does that if you go to AdToons.com and message him, \"Hey Vince, here's a million bucks please draw my visions so they can become true,\" and he'll do it. He did that and sent it to me and I got it blown up and I put it on my wall and it's just been there. I didn't even think about it at the time but it's a year ago, my goal was only work close with 100 entrepreneurs in my Inner Circle, that's what I said.</p> <p>At the time back then I think we only had 25 people in the Inner Circle, and it's $25,000.00 a piece and to get a 100 I think that would be pretty awesome, but it was outside my reality, but it was a goal I put up there. Then fast forward over the last 12 months we have our Ignite program at $12,000.00 and our Inner Circle at $25,000.00. We've be selling both of those and it's been doing well. Obviously a lot of people are going to the Ignite program. I think we sold 180 or so people into Ignite and Inner Circle kept growing as well. It\u2019s been interesting, as Inner Circle has been moving forward it's exponentially been growing, I think that's the right word, where it keeps getting bigger faster. I think that we do a really good job with that. I'm really proud of it. Then people find out and then more people find out and it's just kind of growing organically really quickly.</p> <p>About a month ago I was looking at it. Inner Circle has grown actually faster than the Ignite program which is interesting because it's more than twice as much money. The people in the Inner Circle are honestly my dream clients. Most of them have some amazing things happening. They just need some directional things, or feedback or bounce back ideas and just cool stuff like that where it's awesome.</p> <p>I had this idea and I was actually looking at my sketch with Vince and I saw it said, \"Work closely with 100 people.\" I think right now I'm working close with the 50 or 60 that are Inner Circle and then a little bit further distance with Ignite and then everything we're doing. I was like, \"What if we just shut down everything except for the Inner Circle and just focus on getting 100 people in there and I just really close with those 100 people, and if someone leaves and a spot opens we can refill but just actually close it down. Say there's a 100 spots and when they're gone, they're gone and just kind of do that.\"</p> <p>It took a little while to get all the pieces in place so that we wouldn't drop any balls and we can continue to service all the people who had bought Ignite up to this point. A few weeks ago we stopped selling Ignite, no more selling Ignite. We're servicing those who are in but we are not selling anymore. Let's just focus on Inner Circle. If we're going to get 100 people, then how's it going to work? There are some mastermind groups where they have 100 people in it's like stupid, it's like going to a seminar. I didn't want that. Our groups can facilitate about 35, 35 is kind of high, even 32-33 is about perfect in a group. I'm basically going to have to have 3 group, if we do 3 groups of 33.3, so somebody is going to be chopped into thirds, I'm just kidding. If we do that it will work, so we went and we actually booked all the hotel rooms for the year, and everything is kind of finalized.</p> <p>I'm like, okay cool, now we need to get, I think at that time we're about 65 or 70 people in the Inner Circle so we need to get 25 more people. All the guys on my team are like, \u201cyou realize it took us almost a whole year to fill up 2 groups and a lot of work.\u201d I was like, \"I think we can fill up the last group though in December.\" They're like, \"That's not possible, December is the worst month for sales and all these kind of things.\" I was, \"Yeah, I think we can.\"</p> <p>On Monday I sent out an email that basically said, \"This is how many spots are left, we are only having 100 people in when they're gone, they're gone.\" I used those 2 magic words. I used \"urgency\" and I used \"scarcity.\" They were true urgency and true scarcity. What's happened since then has been insane, it's been literally insane. We've had almost 200 applications. I've only got 2 guys who are doing the phone calls, they can't even keep up with it. After you apply, if you've gone though my high ticket training, you know the big focus is after someone applies, try to get them to inbound call you. We've had I think like 30 people leave voice messages from inbound calls like begging us to call them back as quick as we can. Our guys are as fast as they can calling people and making sure they're qualified because we have a high standard in the group. If they are, then signing then up.</p> <p>It's crazy, it's like every hour yesterday I get a message, boom Russell, so and so just joined Inner Circle, boom Russell so and so just joined Inner Circle, just going boom, boom, boom, boom and it looks like we're probably going to sell out all the last, and I can't remember it was like 22 or 23 spots as of Monday. I think now we're down to like 17 or 16, I don't know, but I think we're going to sell them out before the end of the year which is crazy. That should have taken almost a year to fill up but instead we did a couple of days because of 2 magic words, \"urgency\" and \"scarcity.\"</p> <p>I look at webinars we do and the different between webinar that does good and a webinar that does amazing is 2 magic words, \"urgency\" and \"scarcity.\" The better your urgency and the better your scarcity on your pitch the better it's going to do. We used to do a webinar on Thursday, and we do replays Friday, Saturday and then we kind of end it and then Monday we'd start the process over again. A little while ago we started adding in urgency and scarcity on the last day, saying, \"Hey the replay really is coming down tonight, so go and watch it,\" and then like 6 hours before we pull it down say, \"Okay 6 hours and then we're pulling it down.\" What's interesting is that last 6 hour call, I'd send 2 emails on Sunday, one Sunday morning and then one Sunday 6 hours before we pull it down. What's crazy is that 6 hour warning email where I'm applying urgency and scarcity typically makes as much money as the live webinar does which is crazy, just nuts, it doesn't make any sense.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm smiling today just thinking about how can I apply urgency and scarcity in more spots in all aspect of my life. How can I apply that to get my kids to do stuff and get things done. How can apply to force myself to get things done. How can I to get my employees to do things, my team and other things like that. Those 2 things are amazing. Try to figure out ... Oops excuse me, I just honked the horn, I hope the person in front of me is not upset. Anyway, trying to figure out how do we create cool bonus structures or cool promotional things with affiliates, how can we do that.</p> <p>I remember when we did the DotComSecrets Book launch, I think in the first week we were paying out 40 percent commission to the whole Funnel and the second week we transitioned to $20 per book and then we had a countdown. Then at, whatever day it was, Thursday at midnight when we closed the contest down it went back to 40 percent commission. We had this big urgency and scarcity, every book you give away for the next 24 hours, 12 hours, 3 hours you'd be getting 20 bucks as opposed to the other thing and people went crazy.</p> <p>Anyway, those are my 2 favorite words. I'm not a tattoo guy but if I was I'd tattoo those to my forehead or my arm or I don't know maybe I'd get one of those sweet, I don't know what it's called, barb wire chains around my bicep that would say, \"urgency and scarcity\" weaved into the barb wire, that would be pretty sweet, right? No, just kidding. Anyway. I'm such a dork. All right guys, well, I better stop before I embarrass myself anymore but think through those 2 words, urgency and scarcity. Figure out how you can apply them to all aspect of your business and your life because they are magic. It's amazing. You can move mountains if you've got urgency and scarcity. Without them people just aren't inspired to take action.</p> <p>In fact, last night there was a dude who applied for the Inner Circle about a year ago and he's what we call, this is probably politically incorrect term, but we call him a stroker, somebody who comes in, they call, they ask a lot of questions, they listen to the whole thing and they're trying to see how the process works and trying to get information and they're not really buyers. We call them strokers for whatever reason. This guy, a year ago stroked us and went through the whole process which at the end of it it was kind of annoying because is was like eh. I knew he had the money, I knew he wanted to be in it, but it was just like he didn't have whatever else to push him over the edge.</p> <p>Apparently he applied on Monday and then again on Tuesday and on Wednesday because last night I was going to bed, and on Skype there was like 10 messages from him, all in caps, \"Russell I'm trying to get in Inner Circle, no one's calling back, Russell let me in, I need to get in before it's ...\" like freaking out, I was like, \"This dude a year ago went through the process and didn't get involved for whatever reason has been sitting for a year, but now that we've got some urgency and scarcity in place, now not only is he reapplying, he is flipping out, Skyping me trying to get in. Those are good signs? There you go, you've urgency and scarcity. Have some fun with them. Actually that's your Christmas gift from me for this year, so Merry Christmas. Urgency and scarcity from Russell. Hope you love them. All right guys, I'm out of here. We'll talk to you guys soon. Goodbye and have an amazing day.</p>", "duration": "11:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_174.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1450293806, "title": "Episode #173 \u2013 What Do You Expect From Yourself?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to become more by increasing what you expect from yourself each day.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell tells a story about a guy from some Tony Robbins\u2019 events and why he expected more from himself and how that made his story is so inspiring.

All right, all right, so we've got snow out here in Boise Idaho and it's beautiful. It's supposed to snow for the next three days, so I'm hoping we just get dumped on because it would be really fun to take a day or two off with the kids and just do snowball fights, and snow forts, and all of that fun stuff. Cross your fingers that we get dumped on for a little bit here. I just wanted to jump in real quick because I just listened to a podcast and someone said something and it sparked something and I wanted to jump in here. It has to do with what you expect from yourself. We have all sorts of people in our lives that have expectations on us, right? Our wives expect us to do things, our kids, our co-workers, our employees, our parents, our friends, our brothers and sisters, everyone expects things out of us, right? That's one thing.</p> <p>I'm curious, what do you expect out of yourself? We were at a Tony Robins event and if you've ever been to UPW there's this little, not little. There's this guy, he's a little shorter, but like a stocky, bald dude, who's always on Toby Robins security, and at every UPW. If you ever go you'll see him, he's usually one of front guys in the front. He's always standing there flexing, making sure nobody gets to Tony. Anyway, the last day when Tony sells Business Mastery, usually this guy will get up and tell the story, and how basically when he was growing up ... I can't remember how bad his life was but he went to a Tony Robins event, it changed him. He started just going to every Tony Robins event and just trying to just be there all the time, and be around it, and talked about how it changed his life from being this homeless kid to being a multi millionaire, and all of these things, it was just a really inspiring story.</p> <p>Afterwards we pulled him aside and we were just talking to him, me and four or five of our friends, we were just talking to him and the dude was like oh, so motivational, I just wanted to hire him just to come yell at me once a week. He was talking, and one thing he said that was interesting is we asked like, \"What made the difference. Why do you come and work for Tony for free five times a year, and why do you do all of this stuff?\" He said, \"Where I grew up from nobody expected much from me, so I didn't do much. When I came here,\" he's like, \"Everybody expected a lot out of me.\" He's like, \"The reason why I'm so successful now, I expect more out of myself than anyone can imagine.\" I remember thinking about that like, that's the driving force. What do you expect out of yourself? You think about why we get depressed in life, or why we have issues, or whatever it might be, I think it's usually because we expect something out of ourselves and we don't do it.</p> <p>I look at the things in my life that I really struggle with and that cause me pain, and almost all of them are associated with this is what I expect from myself, and this is what I'm doing. It's like when you were a kid and your dad is ... you do something really, really bad and you're expecting him to beat you and you're preparing for a whooping, and then he comes in and he just looks at you and shakes his head and says, \"I expected a lot more out of you,\" and walks away. You're like, \"Oh, daggers in the heart. That was way worse, why didn't you just beat me? I could have handled that.\" I think that's a big thing, and I'm curious for you right now, and everyone listening is in different parts of their life, different times, different seasons, and different parts of their business as well. I'm curious, what do you expect out of yourself?</p> <p>People always ask, \"Russell how do you get so much stuff done? How do you blah, blah, blah,\" all of these things. I don't feel like I do that much but I feel like I expect a lot out of myself, because of that I don't sleep in, in the morning, I don't go to bed early at night, when I'm at the office I don't goof off, I'm not surfing Facebook and if it's not making me money, if I'm not helping someone, I expect so much out of myself that I don't, I just keep working, I keep moving forward because I expect it out of myself. I look at one of my favorite coaching clients from the last year and a half is Liz Benny, you guys have heard me talk a lot about her. People ask me, \"What was different about Liz? How come she was able to grow so fast?\"</p> <p>The reality, if you listen to the Voxer messages she sends me, I don't know anyone that expects more out of themselves than her. She is always on herself, which is part ... I'm like man, you're doing awesome, lighten up on yourself. That's why she's so successful, she expects so much out of herself. She always says, \"The Liz Benny that I am is not this, I am here, I need to be here, I need to get there. I expect so much out of myself.\" I think that sometimes we just let ourselves off the hook. If you're struggling, it might be because you're letting yourself off the hook. I don't know, it might not be, there's life circumstances, there's things. Even when I expect a lot of myself we still had issues and headaches, things that come up so I get that, that's a real thing. If you're not progressing, and not progressing your own life, your clients lives in the way that you want, I wonder if that's the issue. I wonder if you're not expecting as much, enough out of yourself.</p> <p>I'm just going to put it out there, and I may be wrong, I don't know. If someone was to ask me now thinking back on it like, \"Russell why are you having so much success?\" There's a million external forces that have made it, there's so many. My partners, my employees, and my friends, people that have made this happen, right? Internally for me it's because I expect so much out of myself, that's it. I woke up this morning excited to get to work because I expect so much, and I want to do so much, I want to help, and serve, and change, and I can't do that without it.</p> <p>Anyway I just kind of wanted to throw that out there today, again I was listening to a podcast and that just popped into my head, and thought I would share it and hopefully you get some value out of it. Yeah, it's interesting, I think the same thing was true when I was a wrestler. My Junior year I was the state champ, and the next year there was a national tournament, you had to be a Senior and a state champ to go to so I was like, \"Okay, I'm going to go,\" and I expected that I would be an all American. That was what I expected out of myself. My Senior year the state tournament I lost to this punk kid who's not very good in just a really bad match. I ended up taking third place in state that year, my Senior year. I won it my Junior year and third my Senior year and I was destroyed, it ruined my self image. Everything that I was disappeared that day and I was so mad, but I expected so much out of myself and I was like, \"No, I'm an all American. I know that already, that's not something that's up for debate just because I lost this match.\"</p> <p>I was so mad and I remember we had two months before the national tournament and as like Russell right now is not an all American but I am one, I know that, that's what I expect from myself, and that's what I need to get. For the next two months we went crazy, I was working out on average ... I remember one time when Dan Gable, when he's training for the Olympics was working out for seven hours a day, that was the standard I set for myself. I need to work out at least seven hours a day, so I'd lift, I'd go to my high school workout, then I'd try to find another high school close to me that had guys that were also training for the national tournament. I'd travel there, so I had to do two to three wrestling practices a day.</p> <p>During that time, that two month period of time, I went from being a good wrestler to being a great wrestler, I went to national tournament and because I had won the state tournament my Junior year I qualified, but I was probably one of the only dudes in the room who didn't win the state tournament that year. Came in, and because I expected so much out of myself over that two month period of time I came in and in a tournament that I think prior I would have done alright in, I don't think I would have placed in it, you walk in and the bracket has eighty six state champs in it. I came in and I beat almost everyone, I beat a two time state champ, I beat a three time state champ, I beat all of these people and I actually made it to the finals. The finals I lost by two points from a kid from New York.</p> <p>I made the national finals, I took second place in the country, I became an all American, and it wasn't something I was surprised about, I expected that out of myself, but I wasn't there at the state tournament. It took that loss and that setback, which we all have in life, it took that kick in the nuts, whatever you want to call it, that took me back, for me to really step up and say, \"Look, this is what I expect from myself and I need to achieve it all costs.\" I did in that situation, anyway, I hope that helps. I know that again everyone's in different times in life, you may have just lost your state tournament, figuratively speaking, or you may be on the two month process where you're trying to become who you know you need to become, and maybe you just placed, and maybe you became an all American and now you're kind of figuring out the next step.</p> <p>Wherever you're at, the more you expect from yourself the more you're going to achieve. Yeah, that's it for today, hope that helps. All right I'm at the office, it's snowing, and actually I have to go to head shots today so I'm just grabbing my juice, we're on the juice fast still, and I'm headed in, headed back to get my head shots then I got a webinar today. That's my plan, appreciate you guys, have an amazing day, and we'll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "09:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_173.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1450198247, "title": "Episode #172 \u2013 The Truth Behind Why I\u2019m Shutting Down The Inner Circle", "author": "", "summary": "<p>It looks like my email yesterday struck a chord with a few of you\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about his juicing diet that he and his team are doing for one of his Inner Circle members.

This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to \"Marketing in Your Car.\" All right, everybody. Hope you're having an amazing day today. I'm heading in to the office and we have sun shining. It's beautiful. I think it's still cold, but the sun's up, so it makes you feel like you're ... Makes you feel better, so that's exciting.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm really excited for today. We actually started a company-wide juice fast yesterday, so one of our ... We have a new person named G from over in London. When I was in London I met her, and then she joined the Inner Circle, and she's working on a juice cleanse product and a bunch of stuff like that.</p> <p>I was like, \"Basically, we needed some results,\" and she's like, \"Well, I've got a lot of people I\u2019ve done it for, but I don't have any videos.\" I'm like, \"All right. I'm going to drop everything on this side. I'm going to get my entire company to do it, and we're going to become your testimonials.\" It's kind of cool. Everyone, this week, is on a week-long juice fast and documenting the process and creating cool video content for her, for her new upcoming launch, which will be fun.</p> <p>Just one of the fun things we do for our Inner Circle members that's cool. Anyway, day one was actually really fun. It was interesting. I do weird stuff all the time, as you guys know if you've listened to this podcast for any amount of time. I'm drinking and eating and trying all sorts of weird stuff. I actually really enjoy juicing.</p> <p>When I juice, typically it's hardcore. I don't put any fruits or berries or those wussy things that make them taste good. I just go straight for the hardcore. I'm using cucumber, fennel, celery, and some lime for some taste and that's what I drink. Most people think it's disgusting but I love it. It's glowing green, so you drink it ... I feel like I'm drinking ooze from Ninja Turtles. I feel my whole body just, boom, exploding with alkalinity and power and energy.</p> <p>Yeah, it doesn't taste that good. It doesn't taste bad, and in fact I like it a lot. I've become very accustomed to that, so I like it. If I give that to the average person the first time, they'd just be like ... It's like it's a kick in the face or something. Is someone honking at me? I don't even know. Anyway, that's what we're ... I feel like someone's honking at me but I can't figure out who. I like pretty strange stuff. My taste buds are acquired to weirdness because of it.</p> <p>Most of them aren't, so we have this place called Tree City here in Boise and so I paid for a week of juicing, so they're going in and we grab ... Basically they give you six bottles of juice you drink all day. There's one that's called the Vitarrific, which is pure greens and ginger and really strong, which I think is awesome, but most everyone in the office is gagging on it and trying to keep it down. It's pretty funny. Then there's a coconut one, there's one called CAB, which is carrot, apple, beet, which is really good. There's coconut, there's almond milk. Anyway, it's really, really good.</p> <p>Yesterday was fun. I was drinking them thinking it was like drinking candy and most of these guys are dry heaving. They're in the bathroom every five minutes. It was awesome. Anyway, I love putting my team through crazy stuff like that when I can. That's what we're doing over here.</p> <p>Yesterday I sent out something that got a lot more attention than I thought. A lot of you guys know for the last two or three years we've been running two coaching programs, our Ignite program and also our Inner Circle program. As they've grown way bigger than I ever had initially thought or hoped ... Initially we thought we were going to get maybe fifty people in Ignite and twenty-five in Inner Circle, but it's grown to the point where we've got almost two hundred in Ignite and Inner Circle now we're about seventy, which is crazy.</p> <p>The other thing I'm looking at is how much time it's taking from me, and it's just been really hard as it keeps on growing. My thought was, \"Do we keep growing it? Do I shift focus from other things to just keep expanding this, or do we change it and shrink it?\" With ClickFunnels growing as amazingly as it has, it doesn't make sense for me to keep adding more things on that side.</p> <p>We actually, yesterday, announced that we're shutting down our Ignite program. Everyone who's in, we're going to continue to fulfill over the next twelve months of their contract. We're just not allowing anybody new into the Ignite program. That's happened on that side, which means those hundred and eighty people, there's nowhere else for them to go now.</p> <p>On the Inner Circle side, again, we're at seventy-something people. I thought, \"You know what? I think realistically I could run three groups.\" I really enjoy running those groups. It's the coolest entrepreneurs. People get such big results. Everyone who's in those groups are doers who are having success. We basically got two and almost two and a half groups filled up.</p> <p>I sent an e-mail yesterday saying when the third group's filled, it's done. I'm locking the doors, and the only way we'll ever let people into the Inner Circle again is if someone drops out. As you guys probably know, it's not a cheap program. It's twenty-five grand a year. What's cool is that most of our people, after the year's up, have been re-signing up, which just makes me feel awesome, obviously.</p> <p>I've been trying my best to serve everyone at the best level I can and it just means a lot to me when people do come back. That's what's been happening. Yesterday I sent an e-mail saying I think it's seventy-four are filled, so that means there's twenty-six spots left. Within an hour we had over a hundred applications, which was awesome. Randy and Derek on my side are going like crazy today, trying to get back to everyone and get in touch with them. I'm pretty sure those spots are going to sell out really, really quick.</p> <p>If you're listening to this, listening today and you're interested, this is the last shot. Every year I join a Mastermind group. You need to be in one. Ideally you should be in mine if you can. I hate to be ... Obviously I'm biased, but I've been in probably eight or nine different groups and ours is by far the best, for a couple reasons.</p> <p>First off, the facilitator's pretty sweet. I know him, he's a good guy. Second off, just the quality people we have has been amazing. It's such a huge honor for me that that is the group we've put together. It gives you guys, if you're in there, the ability to be surrounded with just amazing, amazing people.</p> <p>Other masterminds that I've been in, usually I come in and I'm the smartest dude in the room, which I hate that, because it's just ... I feel like I'm the one facilitating the whole time, where this time, in our groups, I honestly feel ... There's times I sit back and I'm like, \"I can't believe I'm getting paid to be part of this, just to be in this room. I'm learning so much from everybody else.\" It's just a huge honor for me.</p> <p>If you're going to be in one ... Again, everyone should be in at least one a year, otherwise you're crazy. If you want to be in ours, now's the time to get in there. All you have to do is go to RussellBrunson.com. Yep, I changed it over to RussellBrunson.com, so that when people ask ... I was always telling them this long URL before. Now, if you're interested, go to RussellBrunson.com and you can apply there. I would apply in ... There's a phone number on the thank you page. If you're serious, call that number, because they got insane amounts of apps.</p> <p>If you're listening to this six months or a year down the road, I would still go through the process, even if we're sold out. I might guess that each month, one or two spots will open up for people who have ... Their year's up and for whatever reason they don't renew. The only way to get in is to be on that waiting list. That'd be the other thing, if you're later on down the road. That's what's happening.</p> <p>It's interesting. I look at my business, my life. I really... The only thing that I want to be doing is obviously ClickFunnels, I want to focus eighty percent of my time there. I want to work really close with a hundred entrepreneurs, which is the Inner Circle. Then I want to be working on my own little things. That's what I'm doing now and it's pretty exciting. Anyway, I'm definitely, definitely excited for it. I'm excited to meet the last twenty-six people who enter into the Inner Circle. Our first meeting's coming up in January and it'll just be fun to get to know a new group of people.</p> <p>Yeah, so I'm excited. We have a couple other really cool announcements coming up. I can tell you guys because it's official now. I can't remember if I told you guys yet or not, but we've got the signed contract, we've paid the down payment. For Funnel Hacking LIVE Event, Marcus Lemonis from \"The Profit\" is coming to speak, which is so exciting. That's pretty cool. We'll have more info on that hopefully next week or so. That's just something I'm fired up about, as you can tell. Yeah, it's pretty exciting.</p> <p>With that said, I don't have too much more for you guys. I just wanted to let you know that that's what's happening with my coaching stuff. People were freaking out, like, \"Are you really retiring?\" I'm like, \"Well, kind of. Not retiring, but retiring from Ignite program, and Inner Circle we're just locking it down. A hundred people will be in at a time, and that's it.\"</p> <p>One of the other Masterminds I joined was supposed to be a small group, and it ended up getting a hundred people. Instead of breaking it up and doing the actual work, they just bundled everyone into one big group. I was at a Mastermind meeting with a hundred people, and I'm like, \"You can't, in two days, effectively work a hundred people in a group.\" Our sweet spot's about thirty-five people, so that's basically how we have it broken up.</p> <p>There's three different groups. We meet thirty-five at a time, and we can actually get some work done and do some cool things in that kind of a format. That's how we run ours. What else, what else? I think that's it, you guys. I'm almost at the office. If you haven't applied yet, go apply. RussellBrunson.com. If you're already in the Inner Circle, then you're in. Congratulations. You've locked it in. Don't let your spot slip away to somebody else.</p> <p>Anyway, that's about it for today, you guys. Have an amazing day. I'm excited to go try to take over the world in my little way. Hopefully you're doing the same thing as well, and we will talk again soon.

Hey Everyone, so today is a cold, rainy day in Boise, Idaho. It's Friday so I got a couple big things trying to get done, and then I'm going to go see ... I'm really excited for this, Rand Fishkin, the CEO and the founder of SEOMoz is actually going to be coming to Boise and speaking which will be cool for a couple reasons. First off, last ... how many years ago? Five or six years ago, maybe longer, I spoke at ClickBank Exchange and Rand was speaking as well which was cool. I felt bad because I had the big stage and then Rand had this little, tiny room. I went in there, and that dude is brilliant, so smart, it was awesome to listen to him and loved it back then. Just been a big fan of their stuff for a long time. I'm excited to go hear him speak, and I'm not sure if he's speaking about SEO stuff or other things, but regardless, it'll be fun to go and get some cool stuff from him.</p> <p>It's interesting ... He has a different philosophy on business than mine. I remember a little while ago, reading this huge article he wrote about how they raised all this crazy amounts of money, and all these things, that for me seem ludicrous, some of the worst business decisions in the world yet they're having success. There's different paths and different things. It'll be fun, I'm excited to hear what he's got to say and see what's going down in the SEO world nowadays because it's been a long time since I focused on it. I used to geek-out big time. For a while we had twenty, thirty people all in Peru doing SEO stuff for us and it was awesome. We were getting ranked for all these really difficult terms and it was amazing. We were very, very aggressive and so it was awesome because you could get really cool things to happen fast ... But then the problem was when Google got smarter than us then we started losing everything.</p> <p>It was this thing where I always felt like I was chasing my own tail. We would go and we would be running, it felt like we were running away from the cops all the time. It felt like, we used to call it ... I'm not going to brag about this, but a little while ago, a few years back, we dabbled a little bit in spamming and trying to learn that game. It's the same kind of thing, it was hard to sleep at night because it felt like\u2026 we used to call it the \u201csmash and grab\u201d, where it felt like you were walking in, smashing a window, grabbing a TV and running down the road while the cops are chasing you. That's what it always felt like with SEO and with spam. We got away with it for a little bit, but eventually they always catch you, you can't always get away with it. I hated it, a little while ago, we quit the spamming thing really, really fast.</p> <p>More so, I wanted to understand the psychology of it so I hired this dude, I was like, \"How much would you charge me to teach me how to spam?\" He's like, \"Twenty-five grand,\" I'm like, \"Done.\" I recorded all the sessions, and I remember I called it 'Spam School'. It was like eight calls or something like that. I'm like, \"Okay, I got Spam School today,\" it was awesome. We got up and running, we had to buy all these servers, and these tunneling servers, and all this intense stuff. I know the process now, and I'm sure it's evolved since we kind of played with it, but back then we were totally geeking out on it and within two weeks of starting the process, I realized I hated it and so we stopped. I'm not a spammer, I was someone who was intrigued spam and dabble, but we gave up pretty quick after those feelings. In SEO we tried a lot longer, probably two or three years. We focused, we built it up, and we'd get these rankings for amazing words and the traffic started flowing, flowing, flowing, gone.</p> <p>I remember we kept making all these huge business decisions based on SEO, and I remember one day, coming to the office and being fed up, and slamming my hand down and said, \"We will never, from this point forward in this company, ever make a business decision based on SEO. Anything that happens from SEO is like a nice gift, but it will not ever be our focus again.\" That's been my philosophy for the last three years, and so it'll be fun though to hear what's happening. I think, if you guys have been listening, we hired Neil Patel a little while ago and flew him out for a day. Paid him twenty-five grand for a day, and learning from other people and I think there's going to be a time I'll get back into more and more SEO, just because mostly I think the SEO and social. There used to be a big divide between the two business models, but now that line is blurred or maybe even gone. That's why I'm excited, I'm hoping he's going to talk about that today because that's kind of my understanding and kind of the results we're starting to see from it, is that it's a blend of social and SEO.</p> <p>I think if it's not happening now, logically, the only thing that makes sense for SEO is no longer to base stuff on linking because we can spam linking. The only thing it's smart to base it off of is social interaction because that's harder to fake. Anyway, I'm excited for that. I hope you guys got something out of that, and hopefully the only thing you got out wasn't that Russell's a spammer. In fact, the lesson I hope you got out of that, and this is really, really important, is... this is key, and I hope you guys all get this, is that you can learn a lot from someone in a really short, finite period of time. I remember a couple times I hired some employees because they were amazing, on paper, and they'd done these amazing things so we hire them, pay them a ton of money and salary, and all these things. What was interesting is they come, in the first thirty to sixty days, they would have all these amazing things that would transform things, and after that they were kind of useless. They use up their bag of tricks and they were gone.</p> <p>I feel like everyone's got that. I've got that. For some reason, they come in\u2026 I've got my bag of tricks and things I know how to do to grow a company really, really quickly, but then after that, I don't have as many things. I think my skill set's a little deeper than most people, but for most consultants, they've got a one-trick-pony. They got that thing, and so we learned a while ago, instead of hiring employees who are really good at something, hire the dude who's the best, but for a short period of time. Have him come and teach you because you'll get ninety percent of the value out of him immediately. That's kind of my philosophy, it's like Neil Patel or I'm like, \"Hey, we're going to start blogging. Who's the best blogging dude?\" Boom, Neil Patel, twenty-five K, sucked everything we need out of him, now we've got a game plan to go run with. Things like that, it's finding out who's the best and then just buying an hour or a day, or whatever the time.</p> <p>Last night I was hanging out with one of my buddies, BJ Wright, and we were talking about a site called clarity.fm, and if you haven't ever heard that site, you should, it's awesome. It's all these dudes and ladies who are amazing, who you can buy time with them per minute. He was talking about this app he was going to build, and he was like, \"Hey, this is the dude that launched,\" what was it? That mafia game on Facebook, and the dude's like two bucks a minute to call, and he's like, \"If you invest a hundred bucks you get thirty minutes of this dude's time. You can pick his brain on whatever you want.\" It's just interesting. So, I think my Christmas gift to myself this year is going to be\u2026 I'm going to look at the three or four things I'm really focused on in my business.</p> <p>Obviously we're a SAS company, so that's one. We're doing growth hacking and stuff like that, so three or four things that I'm focusing on and then go to clarity.fm and find the best one or two people in each of those categories and buy thirty minutes, an hour of their time and just get all their info. Get it all in a condensed, quick, fast period of time, and that's how you can press decades into days, days into minutes, and it's really, really cool.</p> <p>That's how I learn, people always ask me, \"Russell, how do you learn now?\" It's honestly getting harder and harder. The more you progress in this or any business, the harder it is to get new things. It gets harder. The way that I'm progressing myself, my knowledge base, outside of funnel hacking the crap out of everyone I can because I love watching what they do, even worse than what they say, but number two is that. I hope that is a value to you guys. Give yourself a Christmas present, go to clarity.fm and find someone you want to learn from and buy an hour, and just suck their brain and I think you'll get addicted to it. You'll find that, again, it's way better than reading a book, just hire the author and be like, \"Hey, just tell me what I should do. Based on all this stuff you got, like, what would you do in this situation?\" You can get there a lot quicker.</p> <p>I hope that helps, that's what I'm going to be doing a lot more of, this upcoming year. It's pretty amazing how inexpensive you can get some of these people's advice and ideas which is cool. That's what I got for you guys today. Hopefully you got some good out of it besides Russell used to be a spammer, other than that, I appreciate you guys.

By the way for those who are wondering we decided to keep it 2 separate things, so we've got Marketing in Your Car happening like this and Marketing Quickies. If you're not listening to Marketing Quickies show, please go to marketingquickieshow.com and subscribe. It's our daily periscope show. People love it and it's fun and we'd love to have you involved in it as well. Other than that, everything else is staying the same.</p> <p>We are ... I'm actually heading home real quick to go to wife .... go to wife ... go to lunch with my wife because that's what we can do, whatever we want to do, right? That's why we do what we do, so I'm going to go do that. On the drive home I just wanted to hopefully drop some bombs for you guys so this is what I call 'cool crap' and I'm really, really, really, really excited about this. This is the reason why.</p> <p>We've been playing with some concepts over the last little bit. In fact, we did an event for our Ignite and Inner Circle members called 'Funnel Catcher', some of you guys were there. It was going into this concept deep, right? It was going into ... let's say you're selling a product, right? You're hot market ... your own list buys it easy because it\u2019s like they love you. Then you go back to your warm market and people who may not necessarily know you but you know what they're interested in and so we target them on Facebook. We know, okay I'm going to target Tony Robbins fans because they may like me because they're interested in similar things or whatever that is. That's where warm traffic is.</p> <p>The big secret sauce is how you get to cold traffic because Facebook runs out of ... Facebook is like having a Ferrari on a dead-end road. You go really, really fast and then you run out of space because the interest groups dry up fast. How do you get to the point where you can sell to the cold hard masses? If you can do that, it opens up your business infinitely wide. That's been my big focus over the last couple of months. How do we do that? What are the different ways and techniques and tools and things we can do to go to the cold hard masses and ... some cool stuff's happening.</p> <p>We started implementing some stuff and that's why we did the 'Funnel Catcher' event to show, here guys, here's what we're doing, this is the direction we're going, this is where you guys should be running with if you want to go and convert the cold traffic. The biggest thing with cold traffic is you've got to meet people where they're at. Using email and funnels things like that to warm them up to where you need them to be, right?</p> <p>A good example if you have an offer that's going to work in cold traffic is going to the ... woah, excuse me that was a big sneeze. You guys got this live, I apologize. With cold traffic, imagine going to the food court at your mall and standing there and yelling at the top of your lungs, \"Who here wants to learn how to build a funnel?\", no one is going to raise their hands. That means my offer is a warm traffic offer. Now ideally, I still want to sell Quick Funnels, that's funnel-building software but no one understands that so if I go to cold traffic and I'm like, \"Who wants funnel building software?\", no one is going to give us money, right? But if I go to the food court and I stand up and say, \"Who here wants a free money-making website?\", everyone at the food court wants that. Everyone is going to raise their hand. That's why you have to think about cold traffic. If you went to the food court at the mall and yelled out what you're selling, how many people raise their hand? If it's less than 10%, your offer will not work for cold traffic. If it's above 10%, you've got something that ... you've at least got something to start working with.</p> <p>You've got to figure out, how can you change the messaging and the wording of what you're selling to get cold traffic to raise their hand? Let's say it's a free money-making website, they come in with that. Now that I've got their name and email address and we can start warming through the process. Here's what a website is and here's a free website but it's actually what we call a funnel and this is why a funnel is important. Now we can educate them and warm them up and get them interested in what we want. That's the goal of funnel catcher, was we figure out where they're at and we speak to them at that language they understand and then after we get them, then we can indoctrinate them through emails, videos, funnels, whatever, to get them to believe and desire and want what we actually want to sell. There's the overarching, long, really cool concept for you right there.</p> <p>Let me step back. A couple of the things we were doing like quiz pages and survey pages and a bunch of stuff like that. I've been out there trying to figure out ways ... we've got a bunch of them going, they're doing well. I stumbled on this guy. He's one of the main guys who built all of the email lists for big companies like NewsMax and a bunch of those type of sites. He doesn't work there anymore, now he does this kind of on his own. He builds out these survey funnels for people. I had him show me a bunch of these funnels, they're so cool. I've seen tons of these. One of them ... I'm sure you guys have probably seen before it's like the big banner ads all over like, 'Should we impeach Obama?' How many of you guys have seen that, right? I've seen that all over the place. You click on that and there's a little survey that if you think you should impeach Obama or not. So if you were to walk through the food court like, \"Who here wants to impeach Obama?\" It's going to piss off half the audience and get the other half really, really excited. It divides and conquers, that's exactly what you need to do. But you're going to get a response from everyone in the food court and they're all going to want to tell you their opinion. A perfect cold traffic offer.</p> <p>Anyway, from that one little campaign, 'do you want to impeach Obama?', they built an email list of over 2 million people and made insane amounts of money because now they have a political newsletter, they can sell ads to survival people and biz-op people, everybody else. Or they can sell their own products and services or a variation of both. That was one example. Then they showed me probably 20 or 30 other quizzes like that that they've done and they're amazing.</p> <p>I just wanted to give that to you guys as a hint. That's the path we are going down is trying to create cold traffic offers that we know that we can take. I don't know if I would do a political one because those kind of people aren't going to necessarily turn into business opportunity people. We did something similar on Facebook. We did a 'Donald Trump for President' fan page which got 150,000 followers for a couple thousand dollars. Now we're leveraging that because Donald Trump is a business-person in entrepreneurship and leveraging that to get people into our other programs, which is working really good right now.</p> <p>Those are the kinds of concepts. Meet people at cold traffic where they're at, talk about something that they're going to be passionate about, get them now into your sequences and the goal at that point is to convert them, warm them up and convert them into what it is that you're selling.</p> <p>Hope that gives you guys some hints. You will start seeing more and more of these things coming out from me in the near future. If this works with this dude and we build 1 or 2 of these for ourselves and it works, maybe we'll refer them out to everyone else but I don't want to ... I want to test it before I do. Conceptually, it works and I hope you guys start thinking along those lines, that's what we're thinking as well and it's a lot of fun.</p> <p>One more bomb of gold I'll drop on you guys. This is a trick that we've been doing. One of our guys who was at 'Funnel Catcher' just crushed it with it. He got 13 thousand opt-ins for 30 cents apiece off Facebook doing this exact same model. I won't tell you the market he did it in but I'll tell you the market we're doing it in so you can get an idea of the concept. Same kind of thing, right? You go on Facebook, we meet people where they're at. The campaign that we ran is\u2026Dave Asprey, the Bulletproof executive guy, he\u2019s got a huge following, we went and bought $1,000 worth of bulletproof stuff and then did a contest saying, \"We're going to give away $1,000 of bulletproof stuff for free, just put your email in to qualify.\" Guess what happened? We started getting everybody from Bulletproof's audience to give us their email address and got really, really cheap leads. We did drawing, sent someone $1,000 worth of these products and started marketing to those people, different products and services that we needed to.</p> <p>Hope that gets you guys excited, if not you're on the wrong podcast. This is the crap that I care about, it's so much fun. I'm out of here guys, I'm going to go hang out with my wife. Appreciate you guys all listening in, I hope you have an amazing day and we'll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "08:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_170.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1449784674, "title": "Episode #169 \u2013 Three Amazing Cool Things That Happened To Me Today", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I would share his exact quote, but he dropped 3 F-bombs\u2026</p> <p>On this special late night episode Russell talks about some cool things that happened to him today including helping Ryan at Hardcore Closer who did his first webinar and made his entire investment back.

Hey guys and gals, and everybody else hanging out with us today, hope you're having an amazing time. It's been a little while since I've been doing podcasts and Marketing In Your Car because things have been so crazy busy. I'm stuck in traffic right now heading home, which my house is like 5 minutes from my office, but the traffic is still here so I thought we should hang out and just talk about some cool stuff. Because I really had a good day today for a couple of different reasons, and I just through it would be fun to talk about it with you guys. Hope you don't mind.</p> <p>One exciting thing is Ryan over at Hardcore Closer, he joined our inner circle program a little while ago. Which as you know, is not a small investment. He paid $25,000 to get in, and he was nervous, and all these things. I kind of showed him the business model I thought he should be doing. He went and executed on it, and he's just a doer, he ran with it and did his first webinar today. I got a Vox, and I would show it to all you guys or let you listen to it because it was really exciting, but he dropped the f-word 4 times in about 3 seconds, so I'm not going to forward it because I don't want to hurt anyone's ears.</p> <p>He basically said, \"Russell, I did my first webinar.\" He said, \"$20,000. I made my money back in the very first effin webinar. I effin love you.\" Something, something, something. It was awesome. That makes your day when some dude invests $25,000 and within in 2 weeks before the first meeting even happens, he get his money back. Now he's got 364 days now of coaching for free, and we're just going to keep growing it and blowing it up. I'm super proud and excited. That was fun to hear. It was awesome. That was cool.</p> <p>What else? What else? Oh, so I've been writing this new front end book. Not a book. I'm calling it a book, but it's not. Maybe it's a report, or a manifesto, or somewhere in between. I'm trying to relaunch our continuity program and I wanted to make a really good offering. I want something really unique and exciting, and so I'm writing this book called The Three Funnels. I think I might have mention this to you guys before, but basically in our business three funnels make about 85 to 90% of all of our income. Instead of teaching all the flashy flare, let's talk about the fundamentals, and that's what this book was about. Here's the fundamentals. I didn't go into to amazing details. It's really exciting all the cool stuff I pulled out, like here's our funnels, here's our stats on every single page. Here's what you should be looking at. Here's this. Here's that.</p> <p>Anyway from our three core funnels, which are Tripwire, Webinar, and High Ticket Funnel. I'm really proud of that, and I finished it today. It's been this project that's been annoying me. You know how you have the projects that in your mind there's so much pain associated with it and you don't want to do them? That's how this has been. There was so much pain. I have all these other things I need to get done, but this one I had to get done because it has to be done, and then I have Brittanie, who does the all the design and publishing, she needs it, and then we got to get it printed, and then shipped all within like the next week and a half, two weeks. It's like I had to get it done, so the last like three days I've been locked down, and I finished it today. I know you guys probably felt that where you finished a book or finished something, and it's just like relief, just gone. It's over and you can now move on to other stuff. That was exciting.</p> <p>Also, one of my friends, Rich Schefren, some of you guys may know him, he actually helped me out a lot a couple years ago. If you are a Marketing In Your Car fan, you know all of my ups and downs. I'm pretty honest with you guys. We had built up this big company, 100 employees, and then the whole thing crashed around me. I think one of the earlier podcasts I told that story, and maybe I'll tell it again someday for the newbies. Anyway, it was a horrible experience and a lot of pain and suffering on my side, and fear, and everything. I didn't know what I was going to do when I grew up, and I still had people working for me I was trying to support, and all these things. I'm trying to figure out, \"What should I do?\"</p> <p>At the time I was like, \"Who's really having success right now in this new economy and with the things that changed and all the new things?\" I was looking around and one of the people that was crushing it right then in that moment was Rich Schefren and he was doing it through automated webinars. I didn't have one yet. I didn't even know how to do one. I called him and I was like, \"Hey man, can I fly out and just pick your brain for a day?\" He said, \"Yes.\" I'm so grateful for that. I flew out there and he gave me a day of his time for free and it was awesome.</p> <p>I went back afterwards, we launched a webinar that literally saved my business, probably saved my life in some ways. Paid off all of our debts, paid off the tax, the government, and a whole bunch of other just scary things, and it was awesome. I always feel like I've owed him for that. The initial deal was if we promote his webinar he'd do that, and we did do that. I felt more than that because it was big for me. One of the few people at that time who really helped me make a big shift that I needed, and so I'm just always grateful for him.</p> <p>Anyway, he's been kind of going through a shift in his business and business models trying to figure out ... He's got kind of this new stuff he wants to sell and trying to figure out the right process to sell them, and he's been struggling. I saw him in London actually, and he spoke, and he didn't sell very well. I feel like some of the things that I've learned over the last few years, especially through the Perfect Webinar ... For those of you who have gone through the Perfect Webinar training, I felt like I knew, and I might be wrong, but I felt like I knew what was wrong with is presentation, and his pitch, and his offer, and stuff like that.</p> <p>We spent an hour on the phone today and really pulled as much as I could out of his brain and I figured ... Because Rich's stuff is always amazing. He's so smart it doesn't make sense to average humans sometimes, right? That's the hard part. It's trying to figure out how do we make this simple so that everyone wants to buy it because the stuff's amazing. The fulfillment always amazing stuff, but it's like the selling, so he went through and walked and talked through everything. I asked a bunch of questions and I pulled out what I think was right, and we restructured the offer, the webinar, the pitch, and I'm really proud of it. I sent it all to him. I recorded a bunch of videos showing how I'd pitch it and I hope that it's something that's going to benefit him. It felt good to be able to kind of return the favor.</p> <p>You know when you have someone that does something big for you and you don't know how to repay that favor? Because it's kind of like, how do you repay that? Right? I'm just happy that I got to be part of that today. Hopefully it will help. If not, that's fine, but I felt like some of the gifts that God's given me in the last few years I was able to kind of repay him and that felt good. All these good things are happening today, which is awesome.</p> <p>Then we just booked, I think, our final speaker for the Funnel Hacking event. He's got to sign the contract and then I can announce that too, but we got some amazing, amazing, crazy keynote speakers coming. Just all sorts of fun, awesome stuff's happening. As you can probably tell I'm excited. I'm excited because cool stuff we're doing, cool stuff our students are doing, cool things we're doing with our partners, and just everything's good.</p> <p>I'm having a good day, and I'm heading home, and it's going to be awesome. Hope you guys are all having a good time. Sometimes on this show we share my ups and my downs, and everything. I just wanted to share with you guys an up because I'm happy and I hope that you guys are as well. If you're not, I was looking at the things that made me happy today. One was obviously the book, which was the me project. Which kind of is, but it's also something I'm trying to create to serve. The other two were all things we\u2019re doing for other people, and so ... Anyway, if you're struggling, you're not happy or whatever, I think I heard Tony Robbins say this, but start serving someone else around you and you can't help but make things better.</p> <p>Anyway, that's it guys. I'm almost home. I'm go inside see my kids, have a good time. I appreciate you all listening and caring enough to tune into the podcast. Make sure you guys are coming to Funnel Hacking Live. It's going to be amazing. We're about to announce all the lineup and I know tickets will sell fast, so do not delay. With that said, we love you guys. We appreciate you guys, and we are excited to keep serving you. Like I said before, you are an audience worth serving and just grateful to be in a spot and have an opportunity to be where I'm at to help you guys. Thanks again, and we'll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "08:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_169.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1449526387, "title": "Episode #168 \u2013 Why I Hate School", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My feelings after spending 10 hours yesterday with my 9 year old, doing homework.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about why he hates school and struggled there.He also rants about why he\u2019s frustrated with the school system that his own kids are in and why he thinks a lot of it is just busy work.</p> <p>Here are some frustrating things Russell talks about in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell thinks that kids shouldn\u2019t have homework.</li> <li>Why he is frustrated by his twin boys\u2019 different 4th grade teachers doing things different and overloading one of them with homework.</li> <li>And why Russell thinks you should be tested on how the real world works, instead of just memorizing the right answer.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear why Russell is frustrated with the school system his kids are in.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everybody. Welcome to a very, very, very rainy Marketing in Your Car. All right everybody hope you are doing amazing. I think we have a lot of new Marketing in Your Car followers and listeners. We just started promoting it. We just got set up marketinginyourcar.com. It's got all back episodes, links to them, transcripts, and a bunch of other cool stuff. So if you want to get on the e-mail list, to get notifications when new podcasts come out, and just see a cool thing go to marketinginyourcar.com. Other than that, I\u2019m excited to have you guys here today. Today is going to be a rant day. I hope you guys are okay. Today I wanted to rant a little bit about a thing that we like to call school. I don't know about you guys but school for me was really, really, really difficult. I think it is for most entrepreneurs. I'm guessing that if you're listening to this you probably fall in that same camp and you have struggled like I did, like most entrepreneurs do.</p> <p>I never really understood why until recently. This guy named Alex, he wrote a book called Entrepreneur Personality Type. There's only 500 of them in circulation. Anyway he did a talk at a Genius Network ... and he\u2019s actually speaking at our next Funnel Hacking Live. So if you're not coming, go to funnelhacking.com and get registered for our seminar. He's going to be speaking about the entrepreneurial personality type. When he explained it the first time I got chills like 20 times. I was like, that's me. I finally understand myself. It made me understand why I hate school and why I struggle with it, and all sorts of stuff like that. This recently I had a reason to even hate it more. So, as you guys know, we went to London a couple weeks ago and took my family out of school for a week, and it was awesome.</p> <p>Before we go we ask the teachers like, \"Hey, give us some homework so we can make sure the kids don't fall behind.\" Right? So one kid basically gets no homework, one gets a couple things, and one the teachers like, \"I haven't done my plans yet so we don't have any homework for you.\" So like all right. So we go on the trip, and out there we're like we're in London, we're seeing these amazing things, go into history they say the Buckingham Palace, they saw the Tower of London, they saw all these amazing things. On top of that my kids just recently read Willy Wonka, or Charlie's Chocolate Factory or whatever it's actually called.</p> <p>So we saw the Willy Wonka play, which was amazing. Just all these cool things, right? So we come back from that. We get to school and this is just ... It drives me crazy. We have twins so they're in the same grade but different teachers, right? One teacher's like, \"Oh cool, you got tons of culture and history. You're good. You don't have to worry about any homework.\" Then my other twin the teacher who didn't have of her assignments done now gave him every single paper they'd done in school. Plus every homework assignment for that entire time. They were insane. We sat there for the last two weeks every single night, we spent about two to three hours with him trying to this stupid homework. He's a fourth grader, right? Then like Sunday we spent probably eight or nine, maybe even ten hours with him just trying to get his homework done.</p> <p>Like dozens, like everything that you would do in school she gave him for homework. It doesn't make any sense they'd do that. Then the funniest thing is that they had a whole homework assignment on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We had read the book, we seen both the movies, and we just saw the play live in London within the last 30 days, right? So we're going through trying to answer these questions and I don't even know the answers to these things. Like it's ridiculous. It's like reading comprehension but it's asking a fourth grader all these questions that have nothing to do with anything.</p> <p>If I'm getting stumped on these questions at this point in my life, for fourth grade homework assignment on a play ... On a book .... On a play we just barely saw, it's just ridiculous, right? It goes on and on and on. It's just like this mass amount of work for them to do just to keep them busy. Like I almost think it's like parents and teachers don't want ... Like their kids are so crazy busy doing all these cool things like learning, and studying, and reading, and running, and playing, and having fun, and developing themselves as humans. They don't like that because it's like chaos and it's not structured like they want it to be. So they give us all this insane amounts of homework to like structure your kids so that they're not bugging you. It drives me crazy. They go to school at 8 in the morning, they're home about 4. Then they had like two hours ... Hour ... Two hours of homework every night as well. The entire day is taken up with school work. Which none of it has any point. You know what I mean?</p> <p>I remember in college writing papers and then the papers are done and then you threw them away. Like there's no purpose and no point to any of it. It's just all just manual, menial work that doesn't actually help you in any way whatsoever. It just drives me crazy. So I just wanted to go on a rant today with you guys. I'm sure most of you guys can empathize with me. If I was a teacher and my kids were going to London for a week, I'd think, \"Man, this is such a great experience. What I want to you do is I want you to write a report about the cool cultural things you saw, and then what you learned at the Willy Wonka play.\" Something like that that's actually is going to be so much more useful than like here's a bunch of math problems that don't mean anything. See if you can solve them. Oh, and then here's a bunch of questions on that book that are so hard that don't make ... That aren't even like logically ... Things you have to go back and reread the book like 16 times to be able to find these random, obscure things you want to bring out in a quiz, and on and on and on.</p> <p>I only know that because I had to reread Willy Wonka like 20 times yesterday trying to find all these little remote answers. Just ridiculous. Anway I just think that it's crazy. I think it's out of control. I think that our kids are stuck in a school system most the day anyway and the last thing they need is to come home and do homework. I think what they do when they get home they need to get home and get away from that, and relax, and have fun, and play, and grow and, be kids, and be creative, and stop trying to recite answers, and look up things, and figure out math problems. They do that all day at school. If they're not doing it at school there's an issue with the teacher I think.</p> <p>There's kind of my rant. Yeah. I'm sure some of you guys I probably deeply offended with that. For me it's just ridiculous. It makes me ... We're not going to for a lot of reasons, I see a lot value in the homeschooling because of that. Where you can actually have your kids study things that matter and create assignment and things that help them grow as opposed to just like, \"Oh, here's a book. You read it all. Now you've finished reading, go back and reread to find the answers that I wanted to pull out to try to stump you.\" It's just ridiculous. It's not how we learn in the real world, right? I think like the math ... Even math ... It's funny because they spend all this time trying to teach us how to do math. Which I understand it's good to know the basics. Since I've been out of college I've never done math once. There's these things called calculators we use. I almost think like they should have the kids focus 50% of assignments on learning on how to use a calculator. That's the real world we live in today, right?</p> <p>I remember one of my friends is right now in college. He's writing like a thesis statement or something like that. He's got to write this thing. I was like well you should just hire someone to write it for you. Hire a ghost writer, you do the research, tell them what to write, and have them write it. He's like, \"No, that's cheating.\" I'm like, \"Are you kidding me? That's cheating?\" Guess how it works in the real world, guess what happened when I wrote my book? I did the research, 10 years of hard work, and then I found a writer to help me write it. That's how the real world works. Okay? There's not ... I bet one out of ten books on the New York Times Best Seller List were actually written by the actual authors. There's people that help you with that. That's how the real world works. So why aren't we tested on how the real world works?</p> <p>It drove me crazy in one of my programming classes, I couldn't figure out answers so I'd hire people in India and Romania to help me figure out the answers, and I'd get the problems right. My teachers would get upset saying, \"You're cheating.\" I'm like, \"How am I cheating?\" In the real world, guess what I do when I can figure out an answer? I hire someone who gives me the answer! That's such a more valuable skill than spending six weeks trying to figure out an answer. In fact I would fire one of my employees if they had spent six weeks trying to figure out an answer instead of just asking somebody who might actually know. That's a skill that is transferable. That's what school systems should be based on. Is who here can actually find the answers to questions? Not who knows all the answers to every single question. Who can memorize things and regurgitate them? Who can find these things? Who can open Google and find the answer?</p> <p>That should be what tests are because the real world is. If we're not ... If the real wor- Great. I'm in the intersection and my car just died. Darn stick shifts. Sorry I'm not used to driving a stick shift while I'm ranting. It's hard to do two things at once. That's just how I feel so anyway. I have a lot of sympathy for my little kids who are going through this right now. Part of me just like, \"Why are they even have to do this? Like they shouldn't even worry about turning it in.\" I'm trying to be a good parent and help them understand the value in it. It's hard. So I just needed to rant to you guys who get me because I am helping my kids. I'm making sure they get homework assignments done. I'm not talking bad about their teachers. I'm trying to help them in that way.</p> <p>The reality is I just don't think that that the world works that way anymore. So for me, I'm just saying that I do not like school.

Don't let your kids go to school. Just kidding. They should go to school but just for the social reasons. Don't let them stress out too much about homework. All right. I'm out of here.

Hey guys! So we just got back from London, woo-hoo! It was a long, long, long, long, oh so long trip to get back. We made it and we are excited and now it's like 6 in the morning. My kids have not fallen asleep yet, because they're still on London time. We kind of passed out for a little bit, but we're awake now. Our cute little baby, who we haven't seen in a week, we\u2019ve been playing with her. Even though she's tired, we're not letting her sleep, because she's too dang cute. A whole bunch of stuff and it's not even 7:00 yet! I'm actually driving out to go grab some food because our house is out of food. That's what's happening over here.</p> <p>Other than that, I'm just excited to be home. I'm not traveling again for, hopefully for forever. You know how you feel after you eat Thanksgiving dinner, and you're so full you just want to pop. You're like, \"I'll never eat again, ever!\" Then five minutes later, you're hungry. That's how I am right now. I will never travel again, ever. The last 30 days, it's just been insane. We're back! We're excited, a lot of fun things. I'm excited to get my hands dirty again, and get into work and get into stuff. Speaking, and traveling, and selling, and stuff like that, it\u2019s fun. I just miss sitting behind a computer and just funnel building, funnel hacking. I\u2019m so excited! It's all good.</p> <p>We had an awesome time in London, and it all turned out really, really good. It was fun. It was cool going there and seeing all these businesses. It's interesting because you think about however many, 20 years ago even, people sold things in their communities, right? If you lived in Boise, you sold things to other people in Boise. That's kind of how things were. The Internets made it so it's everywhere.</p> <p>What's cool, a couple things that I kind of got from it. 1, going over there, you see these entrepreneurs from that other side of the world. What's interesting is their hopes, their dreams, their desires, their vision, their desire to change the world in their own little way is the same. It's not different than it is here. I think entrepreneurs; we have something weird inside of us. It's not an American thing, or it's not whatever. It's an entrepreneur thing and it's everywhere. People there have the same bug that we have here. It's awesome and I just love being around entrepreneurs. There's nothing better for me. That was really, really cool.</p> <p>What was interesting though, this is kind of cool, people don't see this a lot. You don't notice it online either. I wonder, I don't know if I'll do anything because of this, but it makes me think. For example, in the last 30 days, I've spoken in Australia, United States 3 times, and then in London. The 1 thing that is different, culturally things are different. It's just fascinating. I remember the first time I spoke in London and I tried to sell. I did my normal pitch that in the States was awesome and it bombed over there. I was like, what in the world? These people hate me. I found out later they did hate me.</p> <p>I remember, this is kind of sad, but after the event was over, I sold a couple, but not like what I normally would have. This is probably 4 or 5 years go. Then I went on this forum later, it was a free event we did, all this stuff. I'm on this forum reading people critiques of the event and all these people were making fun of me. They weren't making fun of my presentation, or anything. They're making fun of me because I was American. Wow! I never thought that that was a thing, it was so weird to me. After that I had friends that told me when they sold to the UK, they had to sell different, they had to speak different, they had to do things different for it to work.</p> <p>I hadn't had the chance to speak in the UK for 5 years, so I never really tested that again. I've spoken twice in Australia since then. Australia was completely the opposite. Australia feels like, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think the people in the UK always like Americans. I think they think we're stuck up. We kind of are. The more cultured I am becoming, the more places I go, the more I realize how annoying Americans can actually be. We are pretty, it's kind of embarrassing looking at it now. That's just how American's are, right? I the UK, if people don't necessarily like us as much, but in Australia it's the opposite. Australians love us. It was really interesting, I was in Australia, anything I said it felt like I was walking on gold. It was a completely different cultural experience. That was kind of just weird to me.</p> <p>This time I spoke in the UK I was very aware of that. It thought if I'm going to be successful with this, I think the wrong approach ... The approach in Australia was almost more like I'm this American authority, let me show you all this cool stuff I did. In the UK the way I transition my presentation this time, I had to kind of make fun of myself more. What do they call it, self-deprecating humor or whatever? I tried to make fun of myself more throughout the presentation. What's funny is in America, even Australia, if you close people, they stand up and they start going to the back, when they get excited and they rush. The UK, none of that. Nobody moved. I'm doing my close and I'm telling them, \"Get up right now, go to the back!\" I'm doing all my stuff that normally get's American's jumping over each other and fighting to get to the back, and nobody budged. They just sat there.</p> <p>I'm so confused, did I not make fun of myself enough? What's happening? Then after the presentation was done, people slowly stood up and walked over and signed up. The promoter told me afterwards, he's like, \"Your close rate was amazing for the UK, just so you know.\" Really? It was way less, it wasn't way less, it did well, but it was less than I thought it was going to be. He's like, \"You're close rate was amazing for the UK audience.\" It's just interesting.</p> <p>When I think about a lot of times I think we craft ourselves messages for all people. As I'm getting more and more deeper into this business, what I'm learning more and more is that I think this is really the power of where Actionetics inside of Click Funnels is going. Changing based on people. This one is making more money, speak to them this way, less money, speak to them here. If they're male speak to them like this, if they're female speak to them like this. Whatever those demographics are. I almost think that if I really want to go deep in this, I don't know if I will, but I might, especially offers that we really focus a lot of time and energy on. I would even change the sales message based on culture, based on geography. Somebody in the UK was watching video sales, I would speak much different than somebody in the United States.</p> <p>Just interesting I thought. One other thing, this I just want to share with you guys, and hopefully it will resonate. I hate this, I've got so many coaching clients who, and I get it, you want to forecast and set goals, and expectations, and things like that. I think it hurts. I always have these, our clients, our friends, or people that I hear are like, \"Okay, webinars going to happen, I'm going to do this ...\" They have numbers built up in their head, \"If I only get this percent, and this happens and dahdahdah.\" All these things they figure out. They do it, and they don't get it, and they're destroyed mentally and physically that destroys them.</p> <p>I'm a big believer in not, not not setting goals. I'm a big goal setter. Not setting expectations of outcome. You can't control those things at first. When I spoke at this event, Dan kept asking, he told me how many sales I did. Dan's the promoter, was like, \"Is that good for you? Bad? What were you expecting?\" I was like I didn't have any expectations coming in. I want, when it's done, for me to be happy with whatever, and if I have expectations, then no matter what I'm not going to be happy. You know what I mean? I didn't have any expectations. If I didn't sell anything, I was coming to try to serve and try to help. When I speak, even I've been doing this forever, I get nervous. Before I speak, I pray and when I pray I pray that I can give value and help serve people to the best of my ability. That's what I'm praying for and I like how many sales I can close, I'm legitimately here to serve people. That's the way I go into it. The people buy, I'm so grateful afterwards that it's awesome.</p> <p>But if I would have thought, think ahead of time, looked at Dan's audience and said, \"My typical audience converts this much.\" Really though through it and really focused on that number, I probably would have been disappointed, because it made less money than it should have, based on if I would have thought through things. I try not to, I just kind of put it out of my head, and don't think about that. Just focus on giving, and serving, and helping. I even told Dan that, I didn't really have any outcomes, I wasn't really hoping for anything. I just come in and serve and hopefully we can get a lot of people into Click Funnels because they need it. I honestly feel like you can't be successful in life without it. I feel like they need it. I want to give that to them.</p> <p>From this, I'm sure people know who I am now. If they enjoyed it, they're going to keep following me. They're going to buy more stuff. A lot of them will ascend up and come in our inner circle, things like that. Good stuff will happen from it. I'm not tying an outcome to it. I can't tell you how many people, over, and over, and over again, in my coaching programs, they have these numbers in their head. When they don't hit it initially they're just destroyed. It's hard to recover. If you go into it with no outcome, with no projected outcomes of your own, you just go and you do it. You try to serve and you see what happens.</p> <p>Then you can take that data and you can look at it, and you can make decisions. If I was to keep speaking in the UK, I would look at the presentation and say what things didn't work. There were a lot of things that didn't work. I could tell, because there was this weird energy when you speak in a room. You can feel it, you can not feel it at times. There are things I would definitely change. Again, I'm not speaking in the UK all the time, so it's not the same for me. My first webinar, not my first webinar, but my first Funnel Hats webinar, I had no idea if it was going to do well or not. I was speaking at Mike Filsaime\u2019s event, and I did it. When people started running back, I was so shocked. Oh, wow!</p> <p>The next one was, oh! Every time I was so excited about what happened. Eventually, after we've done it so many times, we have projected outcomes, and we have things like that. Now we've got something to shoot for. I let the chips fall where they may at first. Then we can look at that, analyze the data, change things. Let that happen a bunch of times before we start making these projections, these models, and tying our happiness outcome to them. If you do, unless you hit it out of the park the first time, it's hard.</p> <p>Most people do webinar the first time, they're not getting 10% close rate. They're not getting 5%, they might be getting 1-2%. That's where we start at. That's what we've got to do a billion times. That's why I've done the Funnel Hacks webinar, in the last 12 months, I would say a conservatively, at least 50 times live. It gets better every single time. It just makes me feel for people who create it, have this vision in their head, launch it, and they don't hit it. They are attaching so much personal emotion to it. I feel for that, so hopefully if nothing else you get from this, stop attaching all these things to you initial work. Just do it from a point that you want to serve, you want to give, you want to help.</p> <p>Let the chips fall where they may. Then take the data, change it tweak it, then keep doing that. Eventually, when you have a model that is working, now you can come back and you can be stressed out about the results. Don't do that now. We have enough stress in our lives. You're building a business, it's fun and it should be an enjoyable process. It's going to be hard at times. It's going to be good at times. It's going to be bad at times. You're going to lose money at times. You're going to make money at times. You're going to be broke sometimes. Sometimes you'll be rich. That's just kind of the process in this game. If you don't have the skin for that, it might not be the right game to play.</p> <p>I'm at the store, I've got to buy my family some food. Some eggs, some banana's. Some stuff for us to eat. I better go. Thanks for listening to my ramblings today. Hope that there is some value in there for you. I appreciate you guys. For those of you who are my new friends in London, thanks for letting me come hang out. I had an awesome time. I appreciate you guys allowing me to serve you. Thank you so much, and I'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "14:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_167.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1447956149, "title": "Episode #166 \u2013 What I Learned This Week From Showing Our Mistakes", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This one was hard for me to share, but I\u2019m so glad I did\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks from his hotel room in London about what happened with Clickfunnels over the last few days and how it almost all fell apart.

Just did a periscope, saying hi to everybody, but I wanted to kind of come in here and shoot an audio for you guys as well because I haven't talked in a while. I've been on the road and we didn't get to do marketing in an airplane or marketing in the Uber, or anything like that, so we're doing it from the hotel room. I just want to share with you guys something that was kind of cool this week, a good lesson, hopefully can benefit you guys as well. As you know, in business unfortunately everything isn't always sunshine and roses. I wish it was.</p> <p>We try to make it that way and we try to make it outwardly look that way to everybody because that's human nature. We don't like people seeing the mistakes or seeing the holes in our armor or things like that. We try to put on a straight face and show that part, which is understandable. That's what leaders, at least in my mind, leaders do. Tony Robins always says \"Leaders see things as they are but not worse than they are,\" and then, \"Leaders see things better than they are and leaders work to achieve that.\" That's the three steps of leadership from Tony Robins and I've always believed that. I've tried to always have that, I try to see things better than they are, I try to work as if we're there already and then we get there.</p> <p>This week is ... Any of our faithful Click Funnels members know, and if you're not a faithful Click Funnel member, come on now. You're listening to Marketing in Your Car everyday and you're not in Click Funnels, this is insane. If I haven't sold you at this point, you're hopeless. When I landed here in the UK, I obviously checked everything to make sure life's good and that there's no issues, and it's blowing up from everyone wanting to kill me, and everything's down. Todd, who's my partner and main developer in Click Funnels texted me saying that we're down and it's not good and said something like, \"If we survive this, then blah blah blah blah blah.\" I'm just like, whoa, I'm checking my bags off and reading this which is not what you want after a 20-hour flight or whatever we'd been on. I had all my kids with us and we had a huge, long ride to get to our hotel, it was just crazy.</p> <p>I get on here and we're trying to figure out things and it was bad. Our database server we were using is called ClearDB, they've been kind of handcuffing us. Been trying to move off them, they wouldn't allow us to, they were kind of holding our data, they would have given it to us but we would have had to have been down for 24-hours which obviously was unacceptable. We just couldn't do it. There was an easy way where we could have transferred over to these Amazon servers but they wouldn't allow us to do it. It was thing we've been struggling with and most of our issues we've had over the last month or so had been because of ClearDB because their service couldn't handle what we were doing and they wouldn't allow us to move over to Amazon which we needed to. Anyway, that was a whole issue, so Todd basically messaged me and says, \"Hey, everything's down. We're trying to restore from backup but it's going really, really, really slow. It's been 48-hours or so and it's still not restored on ClearDB which is crazy.\"</p> <p>He messaged me and says, \"Hey, we're going to call an audible, basically we're going to rebuild the whole thing on Amazon and we're going to race. ClearDB's reboot versus us on this new Amazon thing and whichever one wins is who we'll keep running with.\" Which is not a small task. I know for me and you, we probably don't understand any of that, I didn't, but it's basically rebuilding this whole huge structure and huge new infrastructure and doing that within an hour. My guys did it. It was amazing. I was thinking about this, if I was to go to war with someone, who would I bring with me? I can tell you who, their names. People like this who just figure it out, I'm just so grateful for them. During this process Todd messaged me, \"Okay, it's working. It's already past how far ClearDB is. We're just looking at four, five, or six hours before it's live.\" I'm like, oh man, it's not something I can hide from, and again, here's the leadership in me saying look at things better than they are and move towards that.</p> <p>We're trying to do that but people on Facebook are blowing up and finally I said, \"I just need to tell everyone what's happening.\" It was hard and it was embarrassing, it was frustrating, it was like all these emotions, but I said, \"That's what people need right now. They need some certainty that we know what we're doing and that we're not just goofing off.\" So I made a video in the hotel room, maybe you saw that. I was upset and frustrated and as you could tell in the video, but I just told the story. This is what's happening, I'm more-so upset than you are, I promise you that and kind of shared that with them and told them what sucks and the goods coming out of it. Just asked everyone to wait and hopefully we'll be back soon and posted that. As I'm looking at that post, 161 people have commented on that, 360 people liked it, and of the 161 comments, all of them were positive.</p> <p>People saying 'We're with you, we love you, we care about you, we're here for the long haul, whatever happens we're here we're not leaving,\" and just gave me that assurance I needed to keep moving forward. It was kind of crazy, on my side it's like leadership isn't showing weakness or showing the issues. I can tell you I probably got 20 private messages on Facebook saying \u201cThank you for being a leader like this,\u201d it was backwards from what I thought but it was cool. Yeah, luckily my guys are amazing, they got everything back up and since then, the last two days things have been even faster and better. I just made a video talking about the good news and posted it but what I learned from this and I wanted to share with you guys is when things aren't all sunshine and roses in your business, I think for most of us, our common sense is to hide it, not to share it. To kind of keep it away from people, but my experience from this is the opposite.</p> <p>It's share with your community, let people know and people will respect your transparency, they will respect that you're on the front lines fighting with them and they'll rally with you. It was really, really cool. We were nervous that we were going to see a huge spike in cancellations and refunds and all these things, we didn't. Pretty amazing actually. It was just a good learning experience. So for you guys, I would say, the more open of a dialogue you can open to your community, the better, and I'm going to start doing\u2026in the message thing I said, \u201cHow many of you guys want me to do these fireside chats once a week and just tell you guys the status of where things are in Click Funnels?\u201d I posted that video a few minutes ago and we've already got ten comments, people saying they love the fireside chats and they want to keep them.</p> <p>That is what we are going to do and I'm going to build a better communication and bond with our audience and I think that nothing bad can happen from that. It was a good learning experience for me and I hope that's something you guys can learn from as well, so when you do make mistakes or something screws up or whatever, instead of trying to hide it and show a flawless exterior, just tell people the truth. That's what they want, that's what they need, and it was awesome for us. Hope that helps, I am going to get some sleep ... I'm not getting sleep, who am I kidding? I've got a project I'm working on, I'm really excited, so I told people on Periscope I'm going to bed too, but I'm not.</p> <p>I got about two or three hours in me, I've been working on a book called The Three Funnels. It's not a book, it's like a booklet, it's going to be a free-plus-shipping offer we come out with in December or January that you're going to want.

All right, all right, I've heard your cries. You've said Russell, do not change the name. It may be a lame name but it's your name, so I'm leaning more now towards keeping Marketing In Your Car. It's like one of those cult classics where it's just weird but like, the right people like it right.</p> <p>I think I'm going to keep it. I don't know, we'll see. I'll let you know. I hope everyone's having an amazing time today. Wanted to share with you an experience that happened last night, that was one of those humbling moments that I think was really good.</p> <p>I had this idea, there's this Thai place right down the street from us. It's called Sawadee or something like that. They have these coconuts. They can take a Thai coconut, chop it open, take all the coconut water, and they fry rice in it, and then cut coconut meat, and they put shrimp in it. Then they stuff it back in the coconut and they bring out these huge coconuts full of amazingness and you eat it and it's awesome. I've had it a couple of times.</p> <p>This week I was telling my kids about it. I was like this is like the most amazing thing. I got them all excited. I'm pretty good at selling people on stuff, sold my kids on these coconuts. They were going to be amazing. Last night we took there there, and then Brent on my team, he brought his wife and kids as well, and we all go to this Thai place to get these coconuts. We're so excited. We've told our kids all about it, and they're so excited and so we get there. Pretty much the worse service I've ever had ever. We show up with eleven of us, and there's no big tables, so they say let me seat you on a bigger table. She brings us back and there's a table that has six seats, and she's like, \"Here you go.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Okay so there are eleven of us here.\" She's like, \"Oh so this won't work for you?\" I'm like, \"Well no there's six seats there. There's eleven of us.\" She's like, \"Oh okay hold on.\" We go back to the front, we wait, and she comes back. She sets up two tables, brings us out there, and there's seven seats around this table. She's like, \"Here you guys go.\" My wife's like, \"There's eleven of us. That's seven seats. We need another table.\" My wife was kind of upset right, it was awesome.</p> <p>Finally they bring another table, now there\u2019s enough seats for us. We sit down and start ordering and I'm like, \"I want that coconut thing that's cracked open. It's got the rice and the shrimp and the everything.\" She's like, \"Oh, the whatever?\" I'm like, \"I don't know what it's called. Whatever that is, that's what we want.\" She's like, \"Oh okay.\" I'm like, \"I want three of them because we're going to share them with our kids,\" and it's going to be exciting right.</p> <p>The lady's stressing out, she's can't even like...Anyways, it was just the worst server I've ever had ever. Even in the very beginning when we're like what drinks do you have for the kids, she's like, \"We've got lemonade, Sprite, and root beer.\" My son Dallin is like, \"Cool I want some lemonade.\" She's like, \"We don't have any Lime-aid.\" He's like, \"I want lemonade.\" She's like, \"We don't have Lime-Aid.\" Finally, I'm like, \"Lady, he's asking for lemonade like you said.\" She's like, \"Oh we have lemonade.\" I'm like, no duh. It started off bad.</p> <p>Then she couldn't even hear us taking our orders and then I kept telling her, \"I want the coconut thing that's cracked open, that's got the rice and the thing.\" She's like, \"Oh you mean the whatever.\" I'm like, \"I don't know what it's called. That thing is what we want.\" She's freaking out, \"Well it takes twenty minutes to cook those. Let me put the order in real quick.\" She runs back, puts the orders in, and then comes back, finishes taking our orders, and kind of chaos.</p> <p>Then after awhile, I remembered that one time I had the coconuts, they were really spicy, so I grabbed her and we're like, \"These aren't spicy right? You did the no spice?\" \"Oh yeah we did no spice.\" It's taking forever, the kids are going crazy, and luckily we ordered some sushi for appetizers so the kids were eating sushi so that kind of calmed them all down. Then she brings out the coconuts and she freaking ordered the wrong thing.</p> <p>There's no rice in them, there's no anything. They're coconuts but it's the wrong one, wrong thing. It was super spicy, tasted horrible. It was like, \"This is not what we ordered.\" \"What did you order?\" \"The coconut thing that has the rice and the shrimp in it.\" She's like, \"Oh the this?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" She's like, \"Oh well that's not what you ordered.\" I'm like, \"That's what I asked you for. You told me that this was what it was called. I don't even know what it's called.\"</p> <p>I was lividly mad. The stuff's spicy so our kids can't eat it. It doesn't even taste good. I'm eating it just because I have to and I ordered three of these things and they're freaking huge. It was just bad all around. I was so upset. I was so mad. I was ready to stand up and upturn the table and start throwing things. I was so angry and then my little five year old, Aidan, is sitting next to me and right after the lady drops off the stuff and I'm so mad. The kids can't even eat, so I'm like we're going to freaking McDonald's and eat McDonald's because these coconut things I've been telling them for the last week, we can't even eat because it's the wrong ones and they're spicy. They can't eat them anyway. I was just going off, and I'm nice to the server, but she could tell I was not a happy camper at all.</p> <p>Then my little Aiden, my little four year old, nuzzles his head underneath my arm and looks up at me. He's kind of laying on lap, looks up at me and smiles, says, \"Dad, this is the best night ever, huh?\" I just sat there and I said, \u201che's right\u201d. I'm so concerned about getting this thing perfect and all he wants to do is hang out with me. He doesn't care that the coconut's spicy and it's the wrong thing. He doesn't care about the coconuts at all. He just wanted to hang out with me. I looked at him, and I was just like, I just kind of smiled and I laughed, and it just broke my state completely. I said, \"You're right bud, this is the best night ever.\" It just changed that fast. I think about how many times in my life, and I'm sure you guys are probably the same thing where, we're in the middle of stuff and we're going crazy and all these things are happening and it's not what we planned and we're so frustrated at other people around us who are making the experience less than favorable.</p> <p>We have this vision what we want it to be for for the people we're trying to serve, our family, our client, whatever it is. I'm just grateful for my son, Aidan, who gave me that moment where I realized I was focusing on the worldly stupid things and he was focusing on just being with me. It just changed me and I felt bad, and I was still upset with the lady, but I tipped her well. I was just like, I got to spend time with my kids and it was really, really cool.</p> <p>That is how I went from probably one of the worst experiences at a restaurant ever to the best night of my life, so it was awesome. Love my kids, they're amazing, and I hope that that gives you guys some inspiration, and spend more time with your family. I've said this once, I'll say it again. David O'McKay said that no success can compensate for failure in the home, and it's true and our kids just want us. They just want more time. They just want to be with us, so we should be with them.</p> <p>Anyways, that's what I've got for you guys today. I'm going to head to the office. I'm going to get out early today. I'm going to go back home, and I'm going to surprise Aidan an hour or two early, and we're going to play early and we're going to play hard, and it'll be awesome. That's what I've got for you guys today. Have an amazing day and I'll talk to all you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "07:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_165.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1447092793, "title": "Episode #164 \u2013 Look What My Entrepreneurial ADD Is Forcing Me To Do\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Is it just me or does this happen to you too?</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how he focuses despite having A.D.D. and why he views it as a superpower.</p> <p>Here are three things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell has three computer monitors and why you should too.</li> <li>How A.D.D. contributed to Russell\u2019s losing focus and getting bored with projects he works on.</li> <li>And why he thinks A.D.D. is actually a superpower.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how Russell gets stuff done even though he has A.D.D.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson, and welcome to Marketing in your Car, or Quickies in your Car. Marketing Quickies, I'm still having an identity crisis. I'll figure this out soon. Hey everybody, hope everyone is doing amazing today. I just got back from most of my whirlwind trips around the world. I think I told you guys, two weeks ago I was in New Zealand, Australia, Phoenix all in seven days. From there I had a week home, then I went to Utah. My dad got put in the Utah Wrestling Hall of Fame. Then went to Denver, spoke at a GKIC event. We closed $200,000 in sales, which is always exciting and fun. Then went to Armand Morin\u2019s event out in Phoenix again. The groups a lot smaller and I think I did about $24,000 in sales, something like that, not too bad. $225,000 or so in sales on the week, which is fun.</p> <p>Now I'm back and I've got a week to be with my family and kids, and then we are packing up and flying to London to go have some fun. It's pretty cool. Right now I'm heading to the office to get come stuff done. The kids are all at school and it's a rainy, rainy day. I'm just excited to go and actually sit behind a computer with three monitors and work. I don't know about you, but I can't stand working on a laptop. I can't get stuff done, the screen's so tiny. I'm addicted to having three huge monitors.</p> <p>In fact, I remember the very first time I went and met Rich Shefren, I went in his office and he had three of the thirty inch Mac monitors. I was like, \"Dude, it feels like you're in a space ship!\" He said there is some study that proved that the more desktop space you have, the more productive you are. Of course I had to, because the studies proved that that's how it works, I had to go get some. Anyway, I would never go back. I think one of the best things to do to increase your productivity is buy more monitors. I've given you all permission to get three, not one, not two, three thirty inch monitors, so you can get more stuff done, and you'll love it. If you don't want to get three, at least get two. You can just switch from one to two, it will change your world dramatically. Then when you go to three, you're just like, \"I don't even know how people work on laptops.\" I honestly can't stand it.</p> <p>I haven't gotten hardly anything done in the last two or three weeks, because of that. Today I'm going to go get some stuff done. I've got a huge to-do list, I'm going to pound through it all. I'm really excited actually. I know that's sad, most people are like, you get home from a long trip, you want to take the day off. I feel like I've been taking too many days off. I want to go and get some stuff done, that way I can relax and have some fun when we are in the UK, where I'm taking a legitimate week off. I won't even have, I'll have my laptop, but that's about it.</p> <p>I'm excited. I have a question for you guys. Is it just me, or if all you guys are this way. I'm guessing you guys are like me. You probably all have horrible ADD. For the last, let me walk back, for the last twelve years of my business, this is how my process has been. I get an idea, and I focus on it and make a whole bunch of money, and as soon as it makes a bunch of money, I get bored. Then I go and I want to launch like ten things, and I launch like ten things. Then one or two of those ten things will make money, but then everything else suffers because of it. We never increase our income from it.</p> <p>Then it gets worse, and worse, and worse, and I'm juggling a million things all at once. Then I finally decide to cut everything except the one thing that is making me money. I focus on that and it starts growing and it makes tons of money, everything is awesome again. Then I get bored and I'm like, \"I'm going to launch like twenty new things.\" I launch like twenty new things, and one or two of them actually make any money, but everything else drops down. Then we start losing money, and then I start spiraling down. I get stressed out and then I cut everything again. I focus on one thing and it grows.</p> <p>Have you guys done that before? That's been my pattern for twelve years now. It drives me crazy, but that's how my brain works. For example, right now a year and a half ago we started cutting everything. We cut our supplement. Everything outside of my coaching program, we cut so we could focus on Click Funnels. Guess what happened? Click Funnels grew and it's growing and it's doing amazing now. It is so hard now, because the more successful it is, and the more hands off and more automated it is, the more I want to do more things.</p> <p>It's just hard. I want to have a supplement line I'm designing, I have this really cool real estate thing that I think is the greatest idea of all time. Real Estate slash air b and b thing that I want to do. Then I have all these things I want to do now and it's stressing me out because I know that if I do, everything else will collapse. I keep trying to push them off, and they keep nagging at me. They are these little ideas that are really good ideas, like everyone in and of itself, if we launched it this year, would do between three and five million dollars. I have no doubt in my mind. But at what cost?</p> <p>I don't know what the answer is, you guys. This is my therapy session for the day. I have so much stuff I want to do and I know that if I do, then Click Funnels will, not that it's going to struggle, but my eye will be taking off that ball. I need to focus my eye on that ball. I owe it to my partners, my team, my friends, and to all of you guys who love Click Funnels. There's my conundrum. I'm sure you guys deal with that as well. I'm trying to figure out a happy medium between the two. I don't know what the answer is yet. I'm sure I'll find it eventually.</p> <p>I just wanted to let you guys inside my brain for a little bit. I'm guessing that some of you guys are the same way. Based on this, I would tell you guys this, I'm guessing that most of you, if you are entrepreneurial, you have the same issue. Entrepreneurs are really bad at focusing on one thing. I remember in school, I used to always struggle, teacher would talk and I would say, \"I can't even pay attention to what they are saying.\" I learned that if I would do multiple things, if I tapped my pencil and moved my fingers, and flip a coin in my hand when a teacher is talking, somehow magically I could pay attention. I couldn't just be sitting there quietly with my arms folded like they want you to do. I can't do that.</p> <p>Most entrepreneurs can't. That's the trick, as an entrepreneur, if you're trying to focus and you can't, grab something in your hand. Start tinkering. Start moving. Start drawing. You have to be doing two or three things for you to be able to focus on one. It's weird. It's our super power, though, right? I'm guessing that most of you guys who are entrepreneurs that are listening to this are probably the same way, right? You get excited and you start focusing on a business that starts growing and you want to start tinkering all over the place.</p> <p>What I would say, what I would coach Russell through, if I was coaching me, is just focus on one thing. Find something that you are passionate enough about that you can create new front ends and new things to drive all traffic and leads into that one thing. That's how, for the last twelve months, I've been able to focus on Click Funnels. It wasn't just Click Funnels, it was what other things can I create to bring people into Click Funnels? I was able to use my ADD super power to focus it on and towards that.</p> <p>Just something to kind of help you guys to know that you're not alone. I do the same thing. Even like you would think after twelve years of this, I would be like, \"Oh I can just focus.\" No, I can't. It's impossible. It's in our DNA, it's how our brains are wired up. It's not a bad thing, it's a good thing. It's why we are all crazy successful, because of that. It's just learning to harness that which can be really, really hard. If you are in that phase right now, I would say find something to focus on. What you focus on will grow. Then use your ADD to figure out multiple ways to make that thing grow and that becomes awesome.</p> <p>The only other question, I don't have the answer to, is after you've done that and it's growing through multiple facets, then what? Do you launch a new supplement line or do you just not? These are the voices in my head yelling at me. Appreciate you guys. I hope you don't think I'm that weird. I hope you guys feel the same way, because it's hard. It's really tough. I'm going to go in there and focus today on things I need to do. Then slowly push forward some of those things that I probably shouldn't be doing, but keep me engaged and keep me excited. Keep me waking up in the morning. That's what we've got to do.</p> <p>I appreciate all you guys. Thanks for listening to my rants, my rambles. I hope you get some value out of this. With that said, I'm going to check off. I'll talk to you guys all again very, very soon. Thanks everybody! Talk soon.</p>", "duration": "08:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_164.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1446485001, "title": "Episode #163 \u2013 The Strategy Behind My New Book", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Only listen if you want to hear the thought process inside my head of what we\u2019re doing and why\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the strategy behind his new book.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>The different types of traffic and how to convert them.</li> <li>How to create bait to get the right customer.</li> <li>And how Russell came up with the title for his new book Expert Secrets and what it will focus on.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to get excited for Russell\u2019s new book, which is coming soon.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. All right everybody, I hope you guys are having a great day today. For me it was daylight savings last night, which meant I got to go to bed late, I got to wake up early, and I feel awesome. I think that daylight savings, for those of you guys who take advantage of it, is the greatest thing in the world. Now when I wake up at 5:00 in the morning, my body thinks it's 6. I get to start waking up an hour earlier by not shifting things, and I get an hour more out of each day. I hope you guys are doing that as well because it gives you the chance to just get free time. Then if you stick with that schedule it stays. I'm trying to do the same to my kids, like now trying to put them to bed an hour earlier, and keep them on that schedule and I'll get an hour on that side too. Anyway, I don't know if that makes sense, but that's what I'm trying at least. Because I woke up today and it was like 6 am but it was really 5 am, and it was awesome. So, I got way more stuff done today so, it's kind of fun. We also had a great Halloween, hope you did as well.</p> <p>And, I was just thinking about something that I was going to share with you guys. And if you haven't read the DotComSecrets book yet, this may be a little over your head, but if you have read it, and you should, then this will make perfect sense to you. So, you know in the DotComSecrets book I talk about the secret formula, which is figure out who it is you want to serve, and then create bait that will attract them. Find where they are congregating and put that bait out in front of them, then you can get them as a customer, then you can ascend them up and give them the results you want to give them, right? And so, I talked about, in the book how when we wanted to change who our customers were, we changed our bait. And, how simple, basically, business was, as soon as you figured that out. Like who do you want to be selling stuff to in the future, and be working with. Figure out and identify who that person is, and then just create the bait that will get that person excited, and get them to want to enter your world, join your list, give you money, etcetera, etcetera.</p> <p>And so, you know look at Click Funnels for example, over the last year since we launched it we've been trying out a lot of different bait to get different types of customers in the front door, which has been really really fun. Now, the next part in the DotComSecrets book we talk about is hot traffic versus warm traffic versus cold traffic, right? So hot traffic is like your own list. They love you, they're warm, they'll pretty much buy anything if you just say \u201chey, go buy this thing\u201d, they'll go buy it. So, that's an example of your hot traffic.</p> <p>Then your warm traffic is like people that don't have a relationship with you yet, but they have a relationship with somebody else, like a joint venture partner or friend or, you know, they read a blog or listen to a podcast, whatever. And, the warm traffic is that person giving you an endorsement, saying like \u201cHey, Russell's awesome, go buy his crap.\u201d And then they're going to go buy it, because they have that relationship, right?</p> <p>Then the last is cold traffic, and cold traffic's got no idea who you are, have no relationship, and so it's a little harder to convert them. In fact we did a little two day workshop here, for my Ignite members called Funnel Catcher that went through the details of how to convert cold traffic. It was really fun, it was fun to kind of show people that concept because when you learn how to convert cold traffic it opens up your doors to the world, right? And so, for me my warm market is either a Click Funnels member or else I delete them off my list, right. Like if you haven't bought Click Funnels at this point, and you\u2019re still listening to me. You think\u2026 I mean, you just don't have respect for me or what I'm saying, is kind of my opinion, right\u2026 So my warm market is exhausted. Like they know about click funnels and they're using it, right? My warm market, and we're still going hard and heavy after\u2026 In fact this month we had our best month ever because it's a year in, we're still doing 5 or 6 or 7 webinars a month to our warm audience and getting people into Click Funnels.</p> <p>And now we're trying to look at, how do we go more into cold? And it's funny, because for a long time I kept thinking that my market with cold was small business owners. In fact, when I went to Australia my whole thought process was what's the bait I'm going to create to get the chiropractor and the dentist and the financial planner, all these people to come into Click Funnels. And, I was thinking more and more about it, and I realized what's the big benefit of Click Funnels. It's a person who's building web sites, and who's done it before hired outsourcers and just got so frustrated, when they can figure out that they can do it themselves, that's the big \u201cah ha\u201d. That's our market. And, I'm thinking, like, most dentists probably never edited a web site, never tried, never thought about it. They hired some dude, the guy made a website, they never thought about it again, right?</p> <p>So, for me to show like, here's click funnels, watch this, I can move an image, I can add a count down clock. Like, it means nothing to them, right? So, I kept coming up stuck. We figured out some cool ways to market to those guys, and we're still going to, I'm not saying we're not. I'm just saying that they're not, that that's just a really really cold market. They don't even know there's an issue. They paid 5 grand for their brochure website and they're happy. They don't even know there's a problem yet. And so, I can and we will go after those people. But I was like, one rung up, like a little bit warmer than freezing cold. Like, who would those people be? I started thinking, that obviously our dream people are authors, speakers, consultants, things like that, right? Those are our people who are typically figuring out their own web sites, or they have a small team that are doing it, or whatever. And when they see Click Funnels it's like, mind blowing for them. They're just like, \u201cOh my gosh, I can fire the dude in India, and I can do it all myself.\u201d That's really our market, and I was thinking we can keep going after them, and we are, but how do we create that kind of a customer now? How do we create a new author, or a new expert?</p> <p>It was funny at our Funnel Catcher event, I did an exercise with people, I said this is how you know if your offer will convert to cold traffic. Sorry, they\u2019re doing some construction here on the road. You can probably hear\u2026there\u2019s the jack hammer. Anyway, I said the way you can tell if your offer will convert to cold traffic is, imagine going down to the food court at the mall. There's like a hundred people all eating lunch, going crazy, and if you were to stand up on a chair and yell out, \u201cHey how would you like to learn how to build a sales funnel?\u201d And listen, out of people in the food court, how many people would turn around and raise their hand and say, \u201cYes, me!\u201d? Now, if I walked up to the food court right now here in Boise Idaho and I stood up on a chair and said, \u201cHey, who here wants to learn how to build a sales funnel?\u201d Nobody's going to even pay attention, right? Even if I said, \u201cWho here wants to see my sales funnel that makes $17,947 per day?\u201d Most people still don't know what a sales funnel is, right?</p> <p>You have to change the language patterns. But, if I said, \u201cHey, who here wants a free money making website?\u201d The entire audience would raise their hand, right? So, that's the test to see if it's going to work to cold traffic. So, I started thinking about this, like obviously I can go and target experts that are already there, but who, what bait can I create that's going to get people who aren't already in that world? Like, how do I expand my universe, as opposed to just fishing out of the existing universe, right? And so for me, what we kind of figured out, I had this epiphany, it was literally at dinner last week. At genius network and I'm sitting there talking to Dean Graziosi about his business and infomercials, and about an hour earlier, Rob, we have a product called Expert Secrets and Rob, one of our designers sent me logos for it. And the logos are very similar to the DotComSecrets logo but a little bit different. And all of a sudden there was this \u201cah ha\u201d moment where I was like\u2026that's it, Expert Secrets.</p> <p>I can go in the food court, and every single person in that food court feels like they're an expert at something. And if I can convince them that they can turn that into a business, and then to be able to do that they have to have Click Funnels, now it's a very short gap for me to fill. And the light bulbs went off in my head and that was it, that's my next bait. And so, minutes afterwards I was calling the person that helped me write my first book, I was calling my publisher, I was calling like everybody. And, within like a day and a half we figured out that I'm writing my next book. It's going to be called Expert Secrets, it's going to be kind of cool. It's going to be like the companion book to DotComSecrets, right. DotComSecrets is like, here's how to market and scale any business. Expert Secrets is like, how do we focus on just information style products and businesses.</p> <p>And I was thinking about like you know most people, like Dave Asprey for example, wrote the Bullet Proof Diet, which is the strategy behind it. And the second book is the Bullet Proof Cookbook, which is like the \u201chow to\u201d. You know, here's the guide that goes with it. And this is kind of similar. I feel like DotComSecrets is the overarching strategy, and Expert Secrets is going to be like the practical, like example of that. It's going to be cool. So, we're going to be getting a whole bunch of really cool case studies in the book, of just people in different businesses showing off like what they're doing and how they're doing it. It's going to be awesome. But, it will be a book that will convert to the masses. It'll not just be focused on marketers, like the DotComSecrets book kind of was. It will be focused on the world. And my goal is to help all these people. I'm watching the cars drive by me right now. Like that dude right there has got something he's awesome at that he could share to change the world. So does that person right there, so does that dude, so does that lady. Everyone does, right?</p> <p>We're going to do it initially as a book. I think we're going to try out an infomercial, a bunch of other things and just try to expand our universe and I'm excited. I'm inspired, and I just want to share that with you guys today, because you're probably one of the few groups of people in the world who care, about my rambling thoughts. That's why you're listening in, right? I hope that as I kind of work through my thought process out loud that it helps you guys think through yours. Like, you know, with you're business you're probably targeting hot traffic, and then warm traffic, and you want to transition down to cold, and what do you look at? And then what are you doing where your markets like getting educated so much it's difficult. Like how do you find the right bait to get the right customer, and how do you create bait that will grow your market as opposed to just fishing out of your market, and a whole bunch of stuff.</p> <p>So, hopefully there are a lot of good valuable things in this one for you today. And, I'm excited and you'll see over the next two or three months I'm going to try to get this book done fast because it's bursting out of me now. Now that it's been, now that I've begun and I see the vision, it's moving fast in my head and I'm excited to get it out and share it with you guys and really use this as a tool to expand my world, expand Click Funnels reach and give all these people in all these cars driving by and everywhere in the world the ability to take their god given talents and abilities and information and advice and turn it into businesses. And then give them the platform, the tool, Click Funnels to be able to do that. I'm excited, I'm fired up, I hope you guys are as well, and that's what I got for you today.</p> <p>Outside of that, I think that my marketing quickies, we have this really cool animation intro for the Periscope show that's coming out. Also, so Periscope and Mentions\u2026 So Mentions, right now for me, is catching up on Periscope. Like on how many viewers are showing up and watching. But then mentions gets way more shares afterwards, and a lot more longevity, which is kind of cool. Then Blab, I'm sure you guys have heard of Blab. Blab's like the new one that's like Periscope, but they just launched this new thing now where you can have multiple people on. So I can do like Blab interviews through a Periscope style thing and have like five, four or five people on. Anyway, just fun. Technology is exciting, you guys, it's opening up our world in so many cool and exciting things. But anyway, I'll keep playing with it. I'll keep reporting back what I find. But, so far it's been amazing and that's it. All right guys, appreciate y'all, I'm out of here, have a great day. I'll talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "12:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_163.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1446139613, "title": "Episode #162 \u2013 How Long Is Your Sequence?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I was SHOCKED to see that this guy\u2019s sequence was 190 weeks\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about why he likes the idea of having a longer email sequence and the benefits that could come from it.</p> <p>Here are some cool things that are in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Who showed Russell that having a longer email sequence is actually a great idea.</li> <li>What benefits Russell thinks will come by making his own sequence longer.</li> <li>And how to subscribe to The Marketing Quickies Show</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why your auto responder email sequence could and should be longer.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Or Marketing Quickies. Or Quickies in Your Car. I don't even know anymore. We\u2019re in the middle of a re-brand. I can't figure out what the name is yet, but as of right now, I'm pretty sure we're still Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>Hey Everyone, I hope you guys are having a fantastic day so far today, heading into the office. I've been dragging my feet a little slow. I'm not going to lie. I took yesterday off to hang out with the kids which was just awesome. While I was there in our wrestling room, I got a big old squat rack, I did squats and Romanian dead lifts and box jumps and everything that you can think of to destroy my legs. Today my legs hurt. It's I don't really want to move so I've moved really, really, really slow today but ... Finally in the car, heading in to get a little bit of work done for the day. I'm actually really excited. I haven't had a chance to sit down and work for like a week and a half, so it will be really good. I'm going to share with you guys something that I think was really interesting and good. I've been fighting it internally in my head for the last two days since I heard it. But I think, I think he's right. I'm pretty sure. I might be wrong.</p> <p>It was funny because on the trip, I like ... You know traveling and time zones and all sorts of stuff, I didn't have time to really email my list at all which if you don't email your list, you don't make any money. I found that if I go a week without emailing my list, my open and click through rates drop dramatically. It's crazy. If you're not emailing your list at least once a week, you are kind of screwing yourself over. Honestly, you should be doing at least three or four and probably every day. That's kind of what I found. So I hadn't emailed my list because I landed, I'm tired and I don't know where I'm at. I don't have internet access and, you know, hotel internet access is horrible and just a million other excuses and various reasons why I didn't email my list. That's kind of what was happening.</p> <p>When I was at Joe Polish's event, Brendon Burchard, he's been a friend for a long time. Somebody that I like a lot and look up to. Anyway, he got up and he was talking about some stuff. One of the things he talked about was he asked everyone, he said, \"When someone joins your list, how many emails do they get automatically?\" And then he said, \"I bet you I can judge your income based on how many emails are in that sequence.\" So I was like, \"Okay, I'm going to play with this a little bit.\" Just curious.</p> <p>My sequence is typically seven to ten days and then I move them to a broadcast list, which is the model I talk about in the DotComSecrets book, which I still believe in, by the way. He said for him, he said that when someone joins his list, they go through a sequence of one hundred and ninety weeks. A hundred and ninety weeks. That is, what fifty-two weeks in a year, two years, three years, about four years. He's pre drilled out a four year auto responder sequence. He said, \"The reason why I can seventeen weeks off every single year is because of that one hundred and ninety week email sequence.\" I was like, \"Dang, dude. That's pretty dang cool.\"</p> <p>I'm kind of jealous that I don't have that right now. I've always fought that. I think there's value and power in having emails that are happening in real time based on what you're excited about today, with the atmosphere, with the environment, with what's happening ... You know, kind of tied to that. That's kind of been my belief pattern and I still believe that. At the same time, I also really like the idea of having longer sequences or things that are happening.</p> <p>The other thing he talked about is that sequences ... The whole goal with sequence is to, kind of like when I talk about the value ladder, how you are ascending up your customers, it was kind of something similar where he's talking about ... Oh man, a police cop, or a cop on a motorcycle just drove by and looked at me. Gave me the look. Gave me the eye. Anyway, ascending people up through the sequence so you're giving them each piece they need and helping them to expand their mind and their vision as they're moving through product catalog. I thought that was kind of cool so I started thinking back about all the products I have and what's the sequence I\u2019m introducing to people. Honestly, it's kind of all over the place. I don't really have a super good path that I take people down.</p> <p>I think part of that's because there's products that I know I want to create that I've got partially created that I know would be valuable and need to be in a certain order. Right now they're not so I was like, \"How do we ...\" Anyway, so I think one of the fun things I\u2019m excited to do today is I'm going to go through all the products that we certainly have and the ones that I know that I need to have done for this to kind of work. I'll lay it out and then figure it out. When somebody comes into my world, they join my list for the first time, what's the first logical offer that makes sense? Where's the second and the third? Where are we taking people over a fifty-two week period of time? That's kind of what I've been working on.</p> <p>The cool thing about Actionetics too, which is nice, is you don't have to just go build out a hundred and ninety week sequence. What I'm going to do is build out smaller sequences. I think fourteen day sequences that focus on one topic, so let's just say that we got a product coming out called Trip Wire Secrets. It goes through all the depth and detail of how to create Trip Wire offers. We've got Perfect Webinar Secrets. We've got all these different High Ticket Secrets, so we've got these different products in our product catalog. It's figuring out how can I do a fourteen day sequence around that? What videos can I create? And training and blog posts and articles and all these things so that there's cool, fourteen days worth of content \u00a0that are wrapping around one of our core product lines, right?</p> <p>Build out that fourteen day sequence and that becomes one action funnel, right? Do all of them. What I can do is start daisy chaining them together so when someone first enters my world, whatever product they bought, let's say that they just bought the DotComSecrets book so they'd get a fourteen day sequence about the DotComSecrets book. When that's finished then the action funnel then pushes them to funnel number two which maybe is Trip Wire Secrets and they go through that fourteen day sequence. When that\u2019s done, that pushes them to number three which is maybe Perfect Webinars Secrets. Then, you know, from there it's the next thing and the next thing. Oh, I forgot I was driving a stick shift. I was stopping and totally forgot to put my foot on the clutch. I don't know if you guys heard that. I almost just killed it live on air.</p> <p>Any who, so that's kind of what I'm thinking. I'm not positive I'm going to do that yet, but I think I am. That way, I got these different soap opera sequences that are kind of daisy chained together in an actual process. I still think I'll put people on a broadcast list after the first fourteen days I believe. Anyway, I'm going to play with that a little bit. I'm going to think through it a lot. I will let you guys know what I come up with, but I think that would be kind of cool. That's my plan.</p> <p>I hope that gives you some idea. You can kind of think through that, you know, how long is your sequence? I know that in my brain, I have so much pain associated with auto responder sequences. I hate building them. I hate doing them. I hate everything about it. It causes a lot of pain to think about it for me. Honestly I don't really want to do it, but it's one of those things where I know I need to do something like that. I might block out like a week of time during the holiday seasons coming up and just like say this week is auto responder sequence week and I do not get to have any fun. I just get to go through this pain but by the end of it, if I do, I'll get to do something cool and figure out some cool prize for me if I can make it through a week of sequences which, again, sounds like a lot of work to me. It'll be good though. That's the game plan.</p> <p>Any who, that's what I got for you guys today. I hope you guys are doing awesome. I hope your businesses are growing. I hope you are getting a lot of value out of this. Also, make sure you get on the daily Marketing Quickie Periscopes. People are finding a ton of value in those. They are a lot of fun to do and I'm doing them from all around the world. If you're missing out on those, in real time you're missing out. If you go to the blog, blog.dotcomsecrets.com, there's info there on how to subscribe to the daily periscope or just download the periscope app.</p> <p>Search Russell Brunson and there should be one ... I think there's two. Someone got a fake account under my name. Punks. So there's the fake Russell Brunson account and then there's one called the Marketing Quickies show. Subscribe to that one and everyday you'll get a little chirp on your phone when I jump on live and we'll hang out. I'll drop some value bombs for you guys and it will be a lot of fun. So, anyways, hope I can see you guys over there on that platform as well. I appreciate you all for listening and hanging out. I'll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "09:23", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_162.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1446049198, "title": "Episode #161 \u2013 Marketing Highlights From My Trip To Australia, New Zealand And Phoenix", "author": "", "summary": "<p>All the cool stuff I learned on my journey.</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about some of the highlights of his trip to New Zealand and Australia, including meeting Liz Benney and her family and being able to sell a huge percentage of a room where everyone already has Clickfunnels.</p> <p>Here are some fun highlights to look for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>How Liz Benney found success with the help of Russell and Clickfunnels.</li> <li>How Russell was able to sell to a room full of people who already had Clickfunnels.</li> <li>And how Russell got Sean Stephenson to come speak at the upcoming event.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear those and some other cool things that happened to Russell on his trip.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey everyone. I hope you guys have been doing well. It's been a little while since you've heard from me. Actually you did hear from me once in Australia. I was ranting about that sushi place, so you have heard a little bit from me, but anyway it's like 6:00 in the morning, we are driving to go get passports done for the kids before school, and I just wanted to jump on and say hey. It's been a little bit.</p> <p>Last week has been a crazy whirlwind. We flew last Monday, we flew from Boise and we flew over to New Zealand to go see Liz Benny and her family, and we had a super, just an awesome time. A chance to go see her. Liz joined our coaching program about a year ago and we had a chance to work with her for the last year and she's gone from being a successful social media manager for people and helping a ton of businesses, to taking her skills and expertise and teaching it to other people. She's helped thousands of people now become social media managers. She's put them in business and she's got success stories from people making 40 to 50 grand contracts and just so cool. So cool to see how her and her personality have been able to go out there and literally change the world in her way, and she's just getting started. You guys will hear more from her. It just keeps growing.</p> <p>It was really cool. Actually the last part of the trip I had a dinner with some people, and they're all people that make tens of millions of dollars, and we were talking about just the impact we've had over the last year, and I just kind of shared the story. I said, \"You know, I went to New Zealand and I was sitting in the house that Liz was in, and she was in the process of packing up this house because she's moving to their beautiful new home they just purchased.\"</p> <p>She showed me, she was like, \"This is the chair I was sitting in, this is the computer I was looking at when I saw the ad with your face on it, and I clicked on it and then this is where I filled out the application.\" She's like, \"I spent hours going over the application because I was so nervous and all these different things.\" She was like, \"I put my heart and my soul into it. This is where I applied and then this is where you guys asked me for $25,000\", and she's like, \"We were driving around here and I was saying, \"No, we can't do it. It's too much money and we had saved that money for our future home and all these things.\"</p> <p>Finally she was like, \"We were in this room when we decided to do it, and then we had our first call, and this is where I was sitting, and this is where Kristy and I were sitting when we had our first Skype call, and she's now a year later and done almost a million dollars in sales. We just purchased our dream house and all this good that's come from it\", and it was just I don't know. We get in this business and we think about the dollars, the numbers, and the conversion, and all those kind of things. That trip just gave me a chance to make it more real and to see the end result of what we're doing, why we're really doing it. It was emotional for me, and it was exciting, and it was awesome to see her, and see them, and meet her little kids. They're super cute. Anyway, it was just great.</p> <p>We were only there for like 24 hours and we went and cruised around, made some videos, we went to the place where the filmed Chronicles of Narnia, and we had a quad copter and filmed Liz out in the middle of this huge field where the war was at and the quad copter flying over the top of her. There's going to be some cool videos that come from that I'm sure. Anyway, that was pretty awesome. Yeah, it was just overall it was just a great little trip.</p> <p>From there we flew to Australia. In Australia, we met with a guy named Ian Marsh. He was business partners with a guy named Mal Emory and then he actually bought Mal's business from him. Mal is always called the Dan Kennedy of Australia which is kind of cool. I've known Mal for probably six or seven years now. He interviewed me back in the day for his CD of the month club, and that's how I got to know him. I went and spoke four or five years ago for them. Flew out to the Gold Coast and spoke for him and then this time, so we went out there to that event. They had a smaller group. It was just a really neat group, and I had the chance to share Funnel Hacks and Click Funnels with everybody.</p> <p>It's kind of funny. It's awkward when you're in a room and you're about to sell Click Funnels and you ask, \"Who in here has click funnels?\" Everybody's hand goes up, and then you're like, \"Who in here's ever seen this presentation?\" Half the hands go up. You're like, \"Man, how am I going to convert this audience?\" How am I going to make some money selling? But I ended up selling over 25% of the room. Yeah, over 25% of the room. Which, when you consider who already had click funnels, it was like 150% of the room that I closed, so that's pretty cool.</p> <p>Then later on they wanted me to sell our higher end coaching program, but I felt bad the audience had been sold a lot over the week and I was like, \"You know what? I'm just going to serve and give and just help\", so I did a really cool session. It's the very first session we do inside of our ignite program, and I did that with everybody. I think it turned out really cool. It was awesome.</p> <p>We did that, and then hung out there, jumped in the water, it was freezing cold, and went and saw Sydney, the big, huge bridge, and the opera house, and did that. I got to hang out with one of the coolest people I know. His name's Darren Stevens. He joined our mastermind group this last year, and so he's come to Boise three or four times and had a chance to hang out with him there, which was awesome. If you read the book, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, he's the dude that did all the marketing behind that. It sold like 40 million copies of the book. One of the smartest people I've ever met, so I had an awesome time hanging out with him and getting to know him better, and just really cool, just a great experience.</p> <p>One of the things in my mind I kept thinking about while I was there, I was thinking about a book. I'm like, \"I want to write a book that I can use to target small business owners to get them into click funnels\", right? That was kind of my thought process. The whole time I'm in Australia, I'm trying to think through that and I couldn't get the right angle, the right hook, so I kind of just that uneasy feeling when you're trying to create something, but you're not sure what it is and you're not sure of the right angle or direction, things like that.</p> <p>Anyway, that was kind of happening. Then the next day after we finished hanging out with Ian and Darren and all those guys, then ... Oh and it was funny. We were out filming on the back patio in Australia, the hotel, filming some testimonials and all of a sudden this guy comes out and he's like, \"Are you Russell Brunson?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, who are you?\" He's like, \"Dude, I'm a Click Funnels member. We have a dog training business\", and he's like, \"I love Click Funnels.\" He's like, \"This is so random. I was here at my buddy's wedding. I look out on the back porch and Russell freaking Brunson's sitting there.\" Which was pretty cool. Anyway that was cool.</p> <p>Then we flew to Phoenix for Joe Polish's 25K group, which was really cool. It's interesting, I almost joined his group four years ago and I went to the initial meeting, and I'm like, I'm not super good at networking. I always kind of struggle with that. I usually go to events more for the content. Honestly, and if Joe hears this, I'll feel bad, but the content wasn't ground, earth-shattering. That's what I remember four years ago, and so I didn't join back then.</p> <p>This is now four years later, I decided let's join again. I went to the event. It was kind of similar. The content was good. There was nothing amazing, but the network of people he put in the room was amazing. Again, I'm not a very good networker, so I don't think I really benefited from it last time, but this time I brought one of my friends, Dave Woodward. He's on our team. He's a really good networker, so he came with me and we kind of used that together to tag team and to network. That turned out awesome.</p> <p>I probably will from this point forward be a genius network member. Just the people in the room were amazing. So many cool people. People that in different markets, I would have only have dreams about getting to know that I became friends with and it was awesome. He's done a good job there. I did hear a couple presentations that were inspiring, and got one and maybe two speakers from there that are going to come speak at funnel hacking live, which is exciting.</p> <p>Some of you guys may know Shawn Stevenson, he's this little short guy. If you search Shawn Stevenson in Google, it's someone who I've looked up to for a long time, and I had a chance to hear him speak. Then afterwards his wife came up to me. She's like, \"Russell\", she's like, \"We love click funnels.\" I'm like, \"You do?\" I'm like, \"I love you guys\", and I was so excited, and so I'm like, \"What would it take to get Shawn to come speak at our event?\" She's like, \"A little bit of money.\" I'm like, \"Done, let's do it\", so that's going to be awesome.</p> <p>I'm going to pause this because I'm driving the car behind my kids and they just voxed me, so give me second to check out what they just said.</p> <p>All right. I'm back from listening to my kids. They were singing me songs on Voxer. So stinking cute, I love them. I hope it recorded that because I came back and that clip was closed, so crossing my fingers you guys didn't lose the first half of my message.</p> <p>Anyway, so Shawn Stevenson, who is the man, is going to come speaking at the event for sure. This other dude that, it was really cool, he gave a cool talk on us entrepreneurs, and about how weird we are, and how it's normal, and how we're not alone, and it's cool. I think I'm going to ask him if he wants to kind of come speak. I'm not real quite sure the tangibles from his presentation yet, but I got chills like five times. As an entrepreneur, I was just like, \"Oh, this guy gets me.\" Anyway it was cool.</p> <p>Anyway, there was some really good things. I just, those of you guys who know me and how I teach at my events, everything is very tangible and you leave with like 80 pages of notes, where this one I really didn't leave with any notes at all, but I left with feelings. I guess that's more, that was probably more so feelings of how do I change things, how do I focus more on family, focus more on, the one thing Joe said that was cool was like, \"Multiplication through subtraction.\" How to do more by cutting things out. I think it was more of a week, two days of reflection for me of like what I can do different as opposed to here's cool stuff I could do. Which I guess is good. It's backwards from what I'm used to, and kind of what I typically like, but anyway. There you go. It was good though. I appreciated it and Joe's a class act. I like him a lot, so yeah. There you go on that.</p> <p>I did that for two days and then last night flew home, and I'm in the airport, we're hanging out eating dinner, me and Dave, and all the sudden this guy comes up to me, he's like, \"Excuse me, are you Russell Brunson?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"I've got your book in my backpack. I'm flying home right now.\" I was like, \"Were you at the genius network?\" He's like, \"No, what's that?\" I'm like, \"So you're just randomly flying through the airport and you just saw me?\" He's like, \"Yeah, I got your book.\" He's like, \"I'm improving. I'm drinking my keytones.\" We were literally drinking keytones right when he was there.</p> <p>It was just awesome, so did that, jumped on my plane, flew home, get in an Uber on the way home and on the drive home the Uber dude was like, he was like, \"I'm just driving Uber while I build my business.\" I'm like, \"Oh yeah? What's your business?\" He's like, \"Oh, I'm creating an online membership site teaching people how to whatever.\" I was like, \"Are you serious?\" I was like, \"Dude, that is my world. That's all I know, and that's the only thing I know how to do.\" He's like, \"What?\" It was just, so I totally sold Uber dude some Click Funnels, which was pretty awesome and he was so excited, so anyway it was a great week. A lot of just cool things came from it.</p> <p>I did a couple Periscopes on the road. If you guys missed them, I did one with Liz in the coffee shop where she kind of built her business, which was cool. I did one, where was the other one I did? Oh, I did one with Darren Stevens which was awesome. He told the strategy how he sells usually on average, about $80,000 worth of sales from his book before he even starts printing his book. Which was like the coolest ninja strategy on earth, so that was cool. Then I did a Periscope from Phoenix talking about all the cool things that Tony Robbins taught. Tony Robbins spoke at the event, which was cool. Tony Robbins spoke and it was awesome, and so I kind of shared all the highlights from Tony's presentation, and also John Paul Mitchell. I guess his name's Austin, it's not Mitchell. John Paul Dejoria or whatever, he spoke too, which is kind of cool how he became a billionaire. That was pretty sweet.</p> <p>Anyway, if you missed any of those Periscopes, go check them out. Go to blog.dotcomsecrets.com and those periscopes should be listed in there probably about the same spot that this podcast is, but go watch those, they were awesome. If you\u2019re not on my Periscopes, you need to get on them. Cool stuff's happening everyday I'm doing Periscopes, dropping some bombs, dropping some gold, and I promise I will make it worth your while for you guys to come and hang out on those.</p> <p>There you go. I'm almost to the passport place, still pitch black outside, totally tired and jet-lagged, and my body doesn't know what time of day it is, or night time, or anything, but that's okay because I'm home, and I'm with my kids and my wife, and this morning it was just so fun. At the airport I found these little minion tic tacs, so I brought them all home minion tic tacs. I woke them up this morning and gave them minion tic tacs. Every single one of them were all drowsy and they look up and they see the minions and they say, \"Oh cool dad.\" It was just the best $2.00 I ever spent. Anyway I'm rambling. I'm out of here. Appreciate you guys. Have an amazing day, and we'll talk soon.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to a beautiful, rainy, Australian Marketing In Your Car. All right guys. I'm not actually in a car now. I'm walking. This is my mode of transportation for the next three days. So, we're considering this the car.</p> <p>I'm here with Brandon and we're in Australia filming some really cool stuff. We just wanted some sushi. We walked by this sushi place. It looks amazing. It's called Sushi-A-Go. S-U-S ... Sushi-A-Go? A-Go?</p> <p>Anyway, just walked by. It's lunch time. We just flew here from New Zealand so we haven't eaten yet today. So, we're starving. We walked by and the sign says, \"Opens at 11:30am.\" So, it's like 11:25. Let's walk up the block a little bit. Then, we turn back around. Because we come down ... It's 11:28 when we get back. So, we're two minutes, technically, early. We open the door. We walk in to the fine establishment. There's a bunch of actual Chinese people rolling sushi. Which you know it means it's going to be good. It's not like in Boise where you get the white dudes rolling sushi. Or, the Mexican guys rolling sushi. This is legit sushi people making sushi. And, I can see the ocean from here. You now it's not flown in from across the world. This is going to be the good stuff.</p> <p>Two minutes early and we walk in. The lady stops us at the door and says, \"We're not open yet.\" We're like, \"Yeah, it opens in two minutes.\" And she say, \"Yes.\" She looks at her watch and says, \"You're right.\" So, okay, cool. I said, \"We'll stand here for two minutes.\" She said, \"No, you need to leave.\" So, she just pushed us out the door.</p> <p>Oh, okay. So, she pushed us out the door. She just walked back out and now she's allowing us in. Is that insane? So, my question for her and for you is where are the freaking entrepreneurs? The entrepreneur in the business would have been out here five minutes early. Probably an hour early hustling up business. Running around handing out flyers. Talking about how his sushi is actually legit sushi and not like crap sushi. He would have been out here selling it. Where the employee just pushed us out the door two minutes early because they were not ready yet to service us. Which is just insane to me.</p> <p>For all you guys, this is a lesson. You need to be better entrepreneurs and train your staff to be entrepreneurs. I guarantee entrepreneurs wouldn't have pushed us out two minutes early because they didn't want to work yet. Anyway, they opened the door and now we\u2019re going to go and have some legitimate sushi. Actually, I'm going to pause this podcast. I've never done this before. I'm going to pause it and we're going to come eat. Then, I'm going to follow up to let you know if it was worth it. I'm sure you guys are curious now. So, I'm going to pause it. We will meet back after lunch.</p> <p>All right. We just got out of Sushi-A-Go's. I don't know. What did you think Brandon?</p> <p>Brandon: It was pretty .... Actually, it was par.</p> <p>It was par. So, they have the sushi belt that goes around. The dudes were cutting sushi. It was all right. This one part they had these ... I think it was salmon. Then dude brought us a big old blow torch and was like, woosh, blow torching all the salmon, which was really sweet. Then put on the stuff. Had this really good like smokey flavor. It was pretty good.</p> <p>What's interesting ... This is another interesting cultural thing. Here in Australia, they don't tip. Because of that, the service sucks. The lady brought us out a water. The water cup was the size of one sushi roll. Usually when I eat sushi, I get really thirsty. I'm usually downing like six or seven large glasses of water. She gave me a little cup. Literally, it was probably ...</p> <p>Brandon: Like a shot glass.</p> <p>Like a little bit bigger than a shot glass of water. I had to keep asking her to fill it back up. I'm going to go find some water because I'm kind of dehydrated. Anyway, that's been our Australia trip so far. I\u2019m sure will send you guys more. Just wanted to give you guys a glimpse of what we are doing. Is that Randy?</p> <p>Brandon: No.</p> <p>Oh, it looks like him.</p> <p>Brandon: It totally does.</p> <p>Weird. Anyway, we lost one of our ... One of the people in our party. We're trying to find him here in the streets of Australia with no internet access or anything. I appreciate you guys. Have an amazing day. I will message you guys again soon. Thanks everybody!</p>", "duration": "04:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_160.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1445289230, "title": "Episode #159 \u2013 Mastering The Fine Art Of Procrastination", "author": "", "summary": "<p>If you\u2019ve ever thought that procrastinating was bad\u2026listen to this now.</p> <p>In this episode Russell talks about mastering the fine art of procrastination.

All right, so the title of this podcast is one that I think is going to get met with some opposition, so it's Mastering the Fine Art of Procrastination. We've always been told throughout our lives that we shouldn't be procrastinating, like, \"Don't procrastinate. Don't procrastinate.\" We should be planning ahead and preparing and all these things. I agree to that to a point, but I also think that procrastination, if done correctly, will increase your productivity and help you to focus on just those things that are actually important. That is the title of this podcast.</p> <p>One of the reasons why is, in about 6 hours from now I am boarding a plane to fly on a weeklong trip to New Zealand, Australia, and then Phoenix. It was funny because I had people on Friday at the office like, \"Hey, so you started packing yet?\" I'm like, \"No.\" They're like, \"Oh, ho, ho, like you're probably going to wait until Sunday to pack huh?\" I'm like, \"No, I'm going to wait until Monday to pack. I'm not leaving until Monday.\" Some of you guys are probably thinking, \"You probably packed this morning before you head into the office, right Russell?\" I'm like, \"No! My flight doesn't leave for 6 hours, why would I start packing right now?\"</p> <p>Okay, there's some law, and I don't know who\u2019s the law is, Parato or some dude, I don't think its Prato though, some dude. He's got a law that basically says, \"However much time you have to complete something, somehow magically, you will fill all that time up.\" This is the problem with planners, they will say, \"Hey, I'm leaving on a trip in a month,\" and so for an entire month they will start packing. They waste so much time and energy and effort on the packing process that somehow they fill up the entire time with packing, and then they've wasted all that time. I want to do the opposite. I know that to pack, if I focus really, really hard, I'm looking at maybe 30 minutes. If I started packing on Friday, I'm looking at like probably 30-40 minutes on Friday and 30-40 minutes on Saturday, and 30-40 minutes on Sunday. Then today is when I'm actually flying out, I'm going to sit down and spend another 30 minutes making sure I have everything, right.</p> <p>I could have just done that once, but because I was planning I felt this desire to fill up space and time with all this crap that doesn't even matter. This is probably why I struggled at school because it was always my philosophy in school where in school I think there's ... I think it is good to study a head of time, I probably would have remembered things better if I did. I did graduate from college, so my mom is proud of that. This is what I did. This is how I graduated college. All the entire semester long I would focus on wrestling and on dating girls and then we'd have final week. My first year was at BYU and they have this really cool thing called the testing center, and you could schedule out your finals any day you want. I'd like, Monday is my math final, Tuesday is science, Wednesday is whatever and I would take the final at the very end of the day.</p> <p>What I would do is on those days I'd wake up at like 6:00 in the morning, I would go down in the basement of my dorms and there was these little tiny room, and I'd lock myself in the room, I'd read the entire book in a day. Then I would go in and take the test. While all this cool stuff was on the top of my head, I would take the test and then 3 minutes later it was gone. I just deleted it, didn't need it anymore. Boom, gone and I graduated that way. Okay. Again, I say that with a caveat knowing that had I been trying to learn something that I needed to know, that's not the right way to do it, but to pass a test that is the right way to do it. Now, I could have studied for the entire semester and wasted who knows how many hours, where instead I was wrestling and focusing on girls where I think college, most people's minds should be.</p> <p>I don't know, that's maybe my opinion, maybe it's misguided, but I think it's true. One of my friends the other day came over to the wrestling at the wrestling room and he was talking about cutting weight. He cuts weight over a 2-3 week period of time, which I think is insane, because now for 2 or 3 weeks your body is going through this stress and this pain and this anxiety and all of the mental things that come with not eating. When I cut weight, I was losing 20-25 pounds every single week, week in and week out for an entire college and high school career. At first, I would spend a week trying to cut weight and when I found out I was miserable and angry and hungry and thirsty for a week. I figured out that if I wait 24 hours from match, start my weight cutting, I would kill myself for 24 hours and it sucked. It was so much pain. I was thirsty. I was hungry. I was tired. I was angry, but I only felt those feelings for 24 hours as opposed to an entire week. Then when I got on the mat, I'd eat and I was back to normal and I could compete because for an entire week I felt good. I felt strong. I felt energy. I felt amazing.</p> <p>For me, I think that there is a place and a time for procrastination. I think a lot of you guys plan so much that nothing ever gets done. I would say stop planning, figure out the least possible time it's going to take to do something, set a launch date and go because when you do that ... It's interesting, when we launched ClickFunnels or any of the things that we've rolled out, anything in the last, man, 12 years of doing this, we always pick a date, like this is our launch date. For us, we send out packages to our joint venture partners. We're letting the world know so that that way that date is hard coded, you can't change it even if you wanted to. That's step 1. Now that date's hard coded and I don't push it out 6 months, I push it out 3 weeks so that I have this pressure, this timeline that makes me get things done.</p> <p>It's funny, we've had launches where we push things out 3 months, and then like 3 weeks, and then 3 days, and somehow magically everything gets done no matter what. I'm like, \"How come this one took 3 days instead of 3 months?\" That's because I allowed 3 months for it. Somehow you are able to fill up time with all this crap because the time is there. Again, that's that one dudes law, some old dude, I think he's dead now. That was his law, however much time you have, you're going to fill it up with crap. If you understand how to master procrastination, use it as a tool, you can reverse engineer how much time you think it actually is going to take, set the hard deadline, and then just do those things you have to get done.</p> <p>It's funny, in every one of our launches, we get down to crunch time, it's an hour before launch and we start cutting things, \"Hey, can't get that done. Can't get that done. Can't get that done.\" Boom, and then we end up with the minimum viable product that we need to actually make money, and wow, holy cow, we actually make money. Where otherwise, if I had have pushed that out 6 months, we keep adding things, and changing things, and tweaking things, and modifying things and waiting for it to be perfect and we never make any money. What I'm doing for you guys is twofold, one is I'm giving you guys the a-okay that it's okay to procrastinate because I know that for your entire life you've been told that it's a bad, evil, horrible thing. That's gift number one.</p> <p>Number two is you only are allowed to have that gift if you use it correctly because if you do use it correctly, you will be able to leverage it to get so much more stuff done. In fact, one of my major projects for my personal self is to start mastering procrastination on a daily basis. Right now, I go into the office and I work 8 hours a day because that's how people do it and you go in there and you work all day. I just do that because ... It's funny because I always have stuff to do, I never run out. I'm not like the typical ... Anyway, I won't make fun of employees, but typical employees who come in and they work, they hang out, they talk. Not for me, I'm like the second I walk in the door, to the second I'm out, it's hard core, 100% the entire time. I'm filling up my time, but what interesting is that I fill up that time because the time's there.</p> <p>For example, today, my flight leaves in 6 hours. I'm headed to the office at 10:00, 11, 12, 1. I've got 2 hours and I've got a 30 minute call with our coaching client's rep, so I've got 2 1/2 hours. In the next 2 1/2 hours, I will get done as much, if not more, than I would in a typical 8 hour day. For me, I'm thinking, how do I start mastering this procrastination better? What if, instead of working 8 hour days, instead of coming in at 9:00 in the morning, what if I came in at 3:00 in the afternoon. I still leave at the exact same time, but magically I've got less time, so therefore I get the exact same amount of stuff done. It's really weird how that works. I hope that helps. I hope that it helps you see my mindset of how things work.</p> <p>For those of you guys who are planners, those of you guys who are probably A students in school who would study for test for months on end, this is probably going to make you feel really anxious and nervous and you're going to hate it. For those of you guys who are entrepreneurs, who are the B and C and maybe D students, or some of you guys probably didn't go, this will probably be a gift in thinking, \"Wow, it's actually okay to procrastinate especially when I use it as a super power.\" There is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Now, procrastinating just to push things off until ma\u00f1ana and then keep pushing it forever is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about setting a hard date and then procrastinating things so that you can just get the most out of every single hour.</p> <p>That's the game plan. I am getting in the office 2 hours to rock and roll. When that's done, I've got 30 minutes to do my call, heading home and then I will start my pack. 30 minutes after my pack is done, my kids will be home, and I will play with my kids one last time before I jump on a plane. That, my friends, is the right way to procrastinate. All right, hope you guys have an amazing day. I'm going be broadcasting to you guys from around the world over the next week, so I'll say, \"Hi,\" from New Zealand, from Australia, and Phoenix. I know that's not very exotic, but that's the last place my trip takes me this week. It'll be fun. I should be on Periscope. I should be on podcast. I'm going to be having some fun with you guys, showing you guys the world. Tune in and I will talk to you guys all again soon.

Good morning. This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>What's up? What's up, everybody? I hope you guys are having an awesome time today. I am ... I was at the office late last night. I've been pulling a lot of late nighters lately. I've got some magic stuff happening. Anyway, building out some really cool things inside of ClickFunnels and I was trying to get it all done before I head on my worldwide sprint over the next thirty days. Trying to get some stuff done last night and now I'm up and I'm heading to the office and just excited about some cool things. We've got five new funnels should be rolling live today which means this week we have rolled out I think eight funnels this week so far, which is exciting.</p> <p>Some guys are thinking, \"Russell, how in the world are you able to roll out eight funnels in a week?\" A couple of things. First off, I have a lot of stuff that's we did in the past that's still amazing that I want to sell but we just haven't because I haven't just finished the process. I'm sure a lot of you guys get this way. You get a bunch of projects and they're all get 75% done and they never all get all the way done. Right? I'm guilty of that. I hate to admit that but I have that problem. My entrepreneurial ADD just slows things down to a screeching halt sometimes.</p> <p>With that, I am trying to always focus but then get a process to still get these things done because there's value in them and I don't want to think a lot through them so I'm trying to get things placed out there. Stuff like that. That's been kind of my process. Over the last two weeks or so, I've been trying to figure out how do I systemize this so that we can move things through this funnel fast. I did a funnelhacker.tv episode with Trey Lewellen and he was talking about how his team, they're trying to launch a funnel a week. I'm like, \"Sweet.\" We need to be doing at least a funnel a week if not more than that. Like different front-end funnels to get people into your programs, right? I was like if I do that, that's me building a funnel a week and I'm like, \"That's a lot, right?\" I started figuring out how do I create a system to make this possible.</p> <p>First thing I did, I started looking at the funnel process. What part do I like the best? There's one piece that I love that gets me fired up that I just want to spend all day on it. Then there's like eight out of ten pieces that I don't love, that I don't want to be doing. For my first thought was that I need to hire a funnel assistant. Someone who knows ClickFunnels and does funnels and who can do things that I don't like to do and can finish projects ... I can be a starter and he can be a finisher on things. I hired my first funnel assistant. He came, flew out to Boise the last three days and we sat next to each other and it was awesome. We were able to work super fast. I got things to the point that I like to get them to and then I could hand them off to him and he was able to run through and finalize them which was awesome. That was really, really super cool.</p> <p>Next was actually building out a process. I used a project management software called Trello. I actually did a Periscope the other day on it. I think I called it ... If you go to blog.dotcomsecrets.com you can go look at all the archives of our Periscopes. What the Periscope was called something like my project management funnel and so it kind of showed what I built out in a space like a funnel or a first steps idea phase. I drop all my crazy ideas there. They can just live there. They don't have to progress. I can just put them there so they're out of my mind and they're somewhere. Excuse me. That's step number one.</p> <p>When I'm ready to start moving forward with an idea, then I move it from project, from the idea block, over to the branding. I got this guy named Rob who is the best designer I have ever seen. He does all branding. Logo packs, design, all that kind of stuff which I love so he gets that finished. Then from there bumps over to the next thing in Trello, the next part of the funnel, which is what I like to do. Taking the logo and building out the initial page structure, design, layout, et cetera. I go build out the initial structure and when I'm done then in each funnel, there's like a dozen other pages you have to do that I hate doing those parts.</p> <p>I move over and Jimmy grabs it. He's my funnel assistant. He runs the next piece. From there, it gets moved over to somebody who does the mobile optimization. From there, it goes over to somebody who does testing and then it goes live. It's this really cool process now. This week was all about systemizing it, testing it, just beating on it. I've been doing that, running people through this. We ran eight funnels through it in like four days. It's working and it's exciting and now I've got a framework that I can move very, very quickly on. That's really exciting.</p> <p>The next phase I'm going to start building out, hopefully while I'm on my trips, is the traffic. Now the funnel is done, now what happens to it? It all goes into a new Trello board, a new funnel. This is our traffic funnel. Here's the process and here's what we got to do and here's all the pieces to execute on that and start driving traffic into the front of these funnels. Building a funnel is cool but if no one is coming to it or seeing it then it sucks. Right? There's no purpose so we're trying to do both sides of that. That will be my next big project. It's kind of fun. It's exciting. I wanted to kind of just let you guys know behind the scenes of what I'm doing and how I'm doing and some of the reasoning and hopefully that kind of helps you guys a little bit. That's kind of the process that I'm doing and it's working. So far it's working really, really good.</p> <p>It's funny. People are always saying, \"Russell, how do you get so much stuff done?\" Now I'm thinking like, \"Man, you guys haven't seen anything yet. Now imagine when I've got this process in place what we'll be able to get done.\" It's going to be exciting and inspiring and cool. That is kind of what's happening. Also, I wanted to give you guys an update on Periscope. For those who haven't been following, you should go follow my Periscope show. If you just go to the blog, blog ... Oh, crap. I just killed the car. Darn stick shift. I'm at a green arrow and I just killed the car. I'm sure the people behind me are so mad like, \"Why is this dude talking on his phone and then he kills his car and now we're all going to miss ...\" Oh, good. The guy made the light. I thought I was going to make him miss the light. That would've made me feel like a real jerk. All right. Okay. Back. Off my shiny object.</p> <p>If you go to blog.dotcomsecrets.com and see any of our Periscopes, I think there is info on how to subscribe. You should be getting on those for a couple of reason. One is they're fun. Number two, I'm learning so much in the process and you guys are kind of seeing it. I'm seeing how to engage the audience by figuring out what topics, what headlines get people to respond, get them to show up. Which ones don't. I'm finding out which thoughts and ideas are share worthy, where people are actually sharing the videos afterwards. It's been fascinating all the cool stuff I'm learning from it.</p> <p>One thing we started doing is ... Facebook has got a platform that's kind of like Periscope called Mentions. I know there's another one call Blab. We haven't started using Blab yet but we started with Mentions so Mentions I think you have to have 30,000 followers and then you can apply to get a verified account where now you're an official celebrity. I got that done. Now I'm an official celebrity. They gave me in Mentions thing, so now when I do my Periscope, I've got two phones. I've got my Mention phone and my Periscope phone and I kind of have them play with each other and talk to each other. It's kind of fun.</p> <p>What's interesting is I get way more engagement live on Periscope. More people are engaging, talking, commenting. All that kind of stuff. When it ends, it kind of just ends there. It doesn't move forward whereas the Mentions one, I get way less engagement live but then when it's done, it posts on your Facebook page and from there, even the ones that we haven't\u2026 most of them now we've been boosting them. You spend ten or fifteen bucks to push them out there but a lot of them we didn't and if my message is right on, people are sharing them. I think the last one had forty shares. I never had anyone share anything of mine on Facebook which was awesome. People were sharing it, liking it, commenting. It's causing tons of engagement so the Mentions side on that, it's the long tail is way better. The blend of those two has been really, really, really cool. Really exciting.</p> <p>Anywho. Just some updates on what's happening. I got to the office. I'm going to go in and have some fun today. Appreciate you guys. Have an amazing day. Get some work done and we'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "08:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_158.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1444328119, "title": "Episode #157 \u2013 Guess Who Called Me Today\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>One of the top marketing guru\u2019s in the history of planet earth called me today and offered me this\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about receiving a call from Jay Abraham and what he learned from him over the years.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>How Russell is using what he learned from Jay Abraham in Clickfunnels.</li> <li>And what it was like to talk to Jay Abraham on the phone and how he talked Russell into taking his family to the UK.</li> </ul> <p>So listen Below to find out how Russell got a free trip to the UK.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. I am really excited. First, I\u2019ve got to give you some intro music\u2026</p> <p>All right. Welcome to the Marketing In Your Car Podcast. If you're a first time listener, this is probably not going to make much sense to you, but if you are a faithful, I'm excited and I just want to talk to you guys because you are my people. You listen, you care, and something cool happened to me over the last 24 hours. If you were to ask: \u201cWho were the top two marketing consultants on planet earth?\u201d Not like new internet dues like me. Marketing direct response dudes. There's two that are in my mind are the guys. Can you guys guess? I'll give you a hint. One of them wrote the forward to my book. Yes, you're right, Dan Kennedy, that's kind of cool. Who's the other one? Who's the other person who I would put up in the top two of all time, of the history of the world, I think even more so than a lot of the big names who have passed on?</p> <p>The second person is Jay Abraham. How many of you guys guessed Jay Abraham? I'm sure some of you guys did. I have been a huge Jay Abraham fan for pretty much my entire marketing career. When I first got started, someone wanted me to promote one of his products. They sent me this huge box of Jay Abraham stuff. If I was to buy all that stuff, it would have been probably 10, 15 grand. I had it all and I went through it all, and it was amazing, just amazing stuff. Because I have been a fan for a long time. In fact, I look at ClickFunnels, one of the core principles of our growth right now. I learned from Jay Abraham. This is what he talked about was, he says there are only three ways to grow a business. Number one is get new customers. Number two is get those customers to spend more money. Number three, get them to buy more often. Only three ways to grow a business. You can't do it any other way.</p> <p>To grow your company, it's got to be one of those three ways. More customers, get those customers to buy more, and get those customers to buy more often, or spend more, and to buy more often. There you go. That's huge. ClickFunnel's goal of year one was customer acquisition, which is the first way to grow a business. For year number two is ascension. We are trying to get all of our customers to spend more money. We're trying to get everyone to extend from a $97 a month level to a $300 a month level. That's why we gave Actionetics and BackPack and made this thing amazing because we want people ascend and to upgrade. We're focusing on growth strategy number two from Jay Abraham this whole year. That's my number one focus this year is ascension so you guys will start seeing that a lot. There you go.</p> <p>Even today, we are talking Jay Abraham, and quoting him, and implementing what I learned from him all those years ago. The guy is a legend and just amazing. I get a call from Rich Schefren. He's like, \"Hey man, Jay Abraham wants to talk to you.\" I'm like, \"All right.\" He's like, \"Here's his number. Text him and set up a time to call.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" I text Jay Abraham. I'm freaking out. This is like texting Michael Jordan if you're a basketball player. I text Jay Abraham trying to act cool. I'm like, \"Hey Jay, Rich told me to give you a call. Let me know when's good.\" He's like, \"Call me right now.\" I call him up super nervous, but I'm trying to be all cool Russell.</p> <p>I'm being all cool and we're talking and he said, \"Hey, we never met in person. Right?\" I'm like, \"No, I've been to some of your events and stuff but I never actually met you.\" He was like, \"I didn't think so, but he's like, I keep hearing about you. People keep talking about you. Rich talked about you and talked about you and talked about you're with ClickFunnels, which is amazing. Then this other guy, one of my clients that we're doing these big events, he does these big events in the UK. I asked him who he wanted to be a speaker on his stage and he only gave me one name. He said it was you.\" He was like, \"I don't know you, but I feel like I should and I wanted to introduce myself and say Hi.\" I'm like, \"Well, I've been a huge fan of yours for a long time. I'm very aware of who you are.\" He's like, \"Oh, thank you.\" We start talking and he basically asked if I could come speak at this event out in the UK in less than a month from now.</p> <p>Those of you who are my faithful followers know, for me just to drop everything and travel across the world is not easy. I got a beautiful wife, five amazing kids who are in school. One that's just a newborn. It's just not easy. I nicely declined and then gave him an excuse of why I couldn't make it. \"I'd love to go but it's short notice and my wife, I've got five kids, and there's just no way I could leave them for a week.\" Jay, who is amazing at closing deals, comes back and says, \"Well, how about we do this. When I was younger, I took my family to the UK in the wintertime and we had an amazing time. I was speaking and I brought them and it was so great.\" And like sold me on this whole experience. I'm like, \"Oh, that sounds cool.\"</p> <p>He's like, \"What if we did this. What if I cover your flights, and your wife's flights, and all your kid flights. Put you guys in business class. Put your kids in coach. We will fly you guys there. You can spend a week. We'll cover your hotel the whole time you're there. You'll live in luxury and we'll give you spending cash as well. Then you can come speak and sell to a group of 1200 entrepreneurs who are most of them are InfusionFoft users. You can sell ClickFunnels to them and keep half the money. I was like, \"You're telling me, you're going to fly me, and my wife, and my kids, and my entire family out there. You're going to pay for everything. Plus, you'll give us spending money so we can blow some money while we're there. Plus, I get to sell.\"</p> <p>Just so you guys know, right now I think the worst I've closed the ClickFunnels pitch in front of a live audience. Well, that's not true, not the worst. The very first time I did it. The very first time I ever did the presentation, I closed 38%. The second time I did 48%. The third time I did 93%. If I screw it up and I only close 50% of the room at 1200 people, that's 600 people times a grand. That'll be $600,000. I get half that. It would be $300,000. And you can say basically he's paying me $300,000 to come and speak. I was like, \"How do you say no to that?\" I'm like, \"Let me call my wife and I'll get back to you.\" I had to go and call my wife and pitch her on it. Luckily she was closed by the irresistible offer as well, and so we're going to London, we're going to UK, and I'm excited.</p> <p>Anyway, it's just super cool. No real reason to tell you guys for the podcast other than I'm excited. I hope you're excited. Maybe you got a tip or two out of Jay's Three Ways to Grow a Business. It's pretty cool. I'm excited. I'm on cloud nine. I feel like a rock star. It's like Michael Jordan calling you like, \"Hey, man, we want you to play basketball for the Bulls. Are you in?\" And you're like, I can't do that. He's like, \"How about this, you can move into my house and you and your family can live here while you're playing for the Bulls.\" That's what it feels like. I don't know if that analogy makes sense. I'm not really basketball guy. I am a Michael Jordan guy though. That is one dude who I would love to meet.</p> <p>Actually I should do like a success telesummit just with the only goal of getting Michael Jordan on it. How awesome would that be, just coordinate some really cool event just so you can have Michael Jordan be a part of it so you can talk to him? I might actually try to pull that off because that guy is amazing. There you go you guys. I am heading home to go play with the kids. I hope you guys are having a good time. I know I am excited right now. I'm a little tired because the next 30 days I am going to Australia and now the UK. Actually, this is my travel plan for the next 30 days, which is insane. Then I'm taking six months off. New Zealand, Australia, Arizona, Utah, Denver, Arizona, Phoenix I think, and then the UK. Then we have Thanksgiving right after that. It's nuts, but it will be fun. Helping the world know about ClickFunnels because it's important. That's how much I believe in our mission and what we're doing.</p> <p>I hope you guys believe in what you're selling. If not, start selling something different. If you do, go out there and share your message with the world because you can change people's lives. I believe it. Hopefully I am showing you guys out there how I perform and what I'm doing. All right, with that said, I'm out of here guys. I appreciate you all. Have an amazing day. We will talk soon. Bye guys.</p>", "duration": "08:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_157.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1444064095, "title": "Episode #156 \u2013 The Marketing Quickies Podcast?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Whatcha think about a re-brand\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about his Ignite group and the Inner Circle group and how those and other Mastermind groups have helped his business. He also shares his idea for re-branding Marketing in Your Car, or co-branding with Marketing Quickies.</p> <p>Here are some cool things in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>How Russell used Mastermind groups to make more money and why he started his own.</li> <li>How Russell is thinking of re-branding the Marketing In Your Car Podcast</li> <li>And hear some fun stats of how many active members there are on Clickfunnels.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear about the possible future of this podcast.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, we are at day 6 of my 6 day event and I don't know how I am able to keep my eyes open. In fact, I am kind of struggling, I'm not going to lie. But it has been an amazing experience; it's been really interesting. For those who are just listening the first time, I've got a group called Ignite, that people pay about $12,000 to be a part of and then we've got a group called the Inner Circle, they'll pay $25,000 to be a part of, and the Inner Circle's grown a lot over the last year. In fact, we had to split it into two groups this time because I just couldn't hold it all in one group. That's kind of what- what's been going down, but it's been really fun.</p> <p>Monday and Tuesday we had our first Inner Circle meeting. It's kind fun, like we split them up into groups and we don't really think too much through it, and it was interesting that first group everyone just fit right. It was weird, like literally half of the group were vegetarians which was interesting because we had brought in lunch and we didn't have a vegetarian lunch, so we kind of blew it there. But half of the people were vegetarians and then they're just like, all their businesses kind of fit together and the second half of the group there wasn't a single vegetarian in the room, everyone's super high energy, a lot of ... Anyway, it was just weird. It just worked perfect, like the way that the personalities fit in a Mastermind A, Mastermind B, which is interesting.</p> <p>Then in the middle on Tuesday/Wednesday we did more of a big event called an Ignite event where I taught on stage for 2 days and we did a big hang-out, everybody got to hang out and get to hang out with each other. It was pretty cool, that's kind of what we did and we had a good time and this is the last day of the last Mastermind so I'm heading in right now and it's going to be awesome.</p> <p>What's cool about this ... It's funny when I got into this business I wanted- I joined my first Mastermind group and it was Bill Glazer's and it was awesome, I was in that group for 6 or 7 years, and just it- it took me from being a 6-figure year business to 7 and then to 8 and it was amazing. I really ... It was one of the major things that was responsible for my growth and I just love Mastermind groups.</p> <p>Later, Bill Glazer, he kind of retired. He sold his business off and I didn't decide to keep going with it, with the GKIC Mastermind group. I tried to find another one, I went to a lot of different groups, I'm not going to mention them by names but I went to a bunch of them and I couldn't find any of them that I felt like I was getting the value I needed and wanted out of it. I always felt like I was one of the smartest guys in the room, which I just- I don't like that. That's not the point of those things. Finally, I was like, \"You know what? Screw it, let's make our own,\" so we went out and built our own.</p> <p>I tell you what, the last few days have been amazing. There's people that are in those rooms that are brilliant that are bringing in all these different ideas. In fact, a whole bunch of things that I'm changing my business based on the group, and I'm just grateful to have that group for myself and for them and I feel almost guilty getting paid to facilitate a group like this with the caliber people that are in it. It's amazing, so there you go.</p> <p>Now one of the things I've been thinking about, and I want to get your guys' opinion on this, I have no idea how you can respond back to me on this but if you can I need to figure out a better channel to respond to Marketing in Your Car stuff. When I started this podcast, whatever, 2, 3, or 4- I can't even remember how long I've been doing this for now. Since I started driving. You know I called it Marketing in Your Car because that was my first idea, I had that idea the first time I heard about podcasts. It was kind of cool, and the concept's cool, and I'm not going to change the concept, I'm still going to do this while I drive because just- my life's so much easier.</p> <p>But from like a branding standpoint, it's not really the coolest thing. Like, \"Hey, go listen to Russell's Marketing in Your Car podcast,\" and it's kind of weird, right? My jingle- I'm not going to lie, my first jingle was pretty bad; next one's not too much better. I was like, \"I want like a freaking sweet brand.\" I want something where you're searching iTunes and you see it and you're like, \"Oh, I got to join that thing,\" and I don't think Marketing in Your Car is really it.</p> <p>I'm thinking about doing a re-brand, and I've been thinking like if I'm going to do it, how I'm going to do it. I've kind of gotten an execution plan if I'm going to do it. Which don't worry on your side, you won't have to do or change or move anything. You just keep doing what you're doing and you'll keep getting it all. I've been trying to think of a couple names and ... Anyway, when I started my Periscope channel the first 10 periscopes is me just randomly talking about stuff and some of them went really long. Which Periscope I'm kind of finding the shorter the better.</p> <p>One day I did this thing- I'll tell you, I didn't ... The name's not my own, I didn't come up with it. When I first got started in this business there's this guy named Andrew Fox, and he had a product called- Andrew Fox and Lee Benson- and they had a product called Marketing Quickies. They were just like, almost like quick marketing ideas. I always thought that was kind of cool and... \u00a0Anyway, I thought it was cool so one of my marketing- or one of the periscopes I just called it a marketing quickie and, \"Hey, here's a marketing quickie,\" and I jumped on it, did a quick 5-minute thing and our response rate and our share rate and everything from that thing was through the roof. I'm like, \"All right, that's kind the concept, we're going to call this the 'Marketing Quickie Show'\" and each time it'll be me sharing a quick marketing idea or tip or thing, right?</p> <p>Which honestly it's kind of like what Marketing in Your Car is like, it's me sharing a cool thing. I was thinking, \"What if we co-brand these things together and we called it the Marketing Quickie Show,\" where it's like, \"Hey, you get quickies in your car, quickies in the office, sometimes it's on iPod's and then it's on periscope and it's these cool, random marketing ideas or thoughts or just Russell's random thing of the day and it just comes in his head,\" right?</p> <p>Anyway, I was kind of excited about that and then I started mentioning to some people- and I kind of thought this but maybe most people won't, but just the sexual side of quickies and quickies in your car and marketing quickies and ... And I don't know if me, Russell the clean-cut Mormon kid, if that's a good branding or bad branding- I don't even know. I don't know, but definitely thinking about doing some kind of re-brand on the podcast but then co-branding with the periscope and blending those 2 things together so that these things are together.</p> <p>I don't know, what do you think? Is Marketing Quickies cool? Is it stupid? Is it a little too innuendo? Or, I don't even know how to ... Anyway, I don't know. That's my thought process right now, so this may be branded in the near future to something different but I don't know yet. We will see but I wanted to kind of just share that with you guys. Because you guys are my faithful, you are the ones who are listening to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>I had ... One of the guys yesterday was like, \"Yeah, like I heard people talk about it 3 or 4 times but I never like, was inspired enough to like, to go listen to it.\" Because it wasn't, it was just Marketing in Your Car, and then after I got into this and then I loved it and I went back I listened to all of the old episodes and it was amazing, but it wasn't something that sucked you in. I get that, it was a branding idea from 1998 that I had, or whenever podcasts first came out. Maybe it was 2002, I don't know. Yeah, so there you go.</p> <p>In fact, the reason why I did call it Marketing in Your Car when I did launch it, cause I had the idea a long time ago, some dude wrote a jingle for me, it sounded like the 1970's for the first hundred episodes. I never used it for 5 or 6 years, and I did launch it and I'm like, \"Aw, I\u2019ve already got a jingle that's done! Let's just do that,\" so I started recording them. Then my brother, I had him go find the jingle and then I was like, \"Oh yeah, it sounds like this is like a 1970's sitcom.\" I was like, \"You know what? It's done, screw it, let\u2019s just run with it.\" That's kind of how- why we stuck with that direction. Anyway, there you go.</p> <p>But that's kind of what going on in my head right now. I hope you guys are having fun in your business right now. There's so much fun stuff happening, like Click Funnels, we just passed 10,000 active members which is crazy, and by 10,000 active members, I\u2019m not giving you stats, like some companies drive me crazy. One company I won\u2019t mention is like, \"Oh, we have 80- we have 80,000 customers,\" and then when you did deeper, it turns out they've had 80,000 people take their trial, but they have 200 people that are actual members, right? We've had 60 or 70 thousand people take our trial but we have 10,000 active people who have made it passed the re-bill and are continuing to be re-billed.</p> <p>We are now a legit software company, right? In fact, we had someone make us our first offer to buy us which was kind of cool. I'm not interested because I'm having way too much fun but it was flattering and it was crazy big which was kind of cool, so that's exciting but don't worry guys, we're not going anywhere. We've got a lot more envisioned, we are- we've got to finish before we even contemplate anything like that, so no worries on that side.</p> <p>I remember at the Funnel Hacking event someone asked that, \"Are you guys going to go public or sell out, or what's your plan?\" I was like, \"Screw that, I'm having so much fun!\" This is my future, I don't want to do anything else. Nothing else is nearly as fun as this. Anyway, it was still flattering, you got to ask, right? It's like if a really cute girl comes up to you and- and you got to know ... Anyway, there you go. I don't even know why I brought that analogy, that's a stupid analogy. It's probably because I'm so tired, and you guys ... Sometimes you get the worst thoughts because I'm so tired, so I apologize for that.</p> <p>I'm actually running a little bit late to the Mastermind group, I hope that these guys can forgive me but it was just hard to get out of the door this morning. My little daughter is so stinking cute and I just didn't want to leave, so there you go.</p> <p>Anyway, with that said you guys I'm trying to ramble and I don't want these to be the rambling show, these are quickie shows, right? Maybe. Appreciate you guys listening, I hope that you have an amazing day. Go do something good, go change someone's life, and get your message out there to the world.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to midnight Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, so I am two days into my six day event. I've been doing a lot of events lately. I need to stop this. I need to get back to just working hard. Literally, I'm kind of getting, not burned out, but just ... I guess, stop doing events. We did a five day event for this certification in Boise and now six days. Our high end Mastermind group, our Inner Circle grew so big that we had to split it into two groups.</p> <p>Then we have our $12,000 program, Ignite, and then we did an event in Boise for them as well. I kind of like bundle them all together. Monday, Tuesday, we had a Mastermind. Wednesday, Thursday, we had the Ignite event and then Friday and Saturday, we have the next Inner Circle. Kind of a crazy week, but the first two days, it's always interesting ... This is me getting vulnerable, and it's almost one in the morning and I'm tired, so maybe I'll listen to this later and be like, \"Why in the world am I sharing all this\"? You guys are getting it because you are here listening when I'm talking.</p> <p>Anyway, it's funny because I'm sure all you guys get this, at a point where you get some burn out in your business. Right now, I'm kind of feeling that a little bit. I think partially it's just because the last twelve months since we launched Click Funnels, we've been running fast and trying to grow and scale, a company, which luckily has been working. That's exciting, right? That's a big thumbs up. Then cut off all the other businesses so we're shutting things down.</p> <p>The only business we really have besides Click Funnels right now, that's live and active is the DotComSecrets business, which it has a bunch of employees and you know there's things happening there as well. Our high end coaching, things like that. It seems like recently, coaching has exploded, which takes a lot more time, and seminars, and trying to speak to sell Click Funnels and this-and-that. Thing after thing after thing, it just getting a lot.</p> <p>Right now, from this week, and then I have two weeks off, and then I'm going to Australia for a week, then I got three speaking gigs in a week. Then after that, I've got a two or three month break, which is going to be really, really nice. It's just kind of chaotic, right? A lot traveling, a lot of time away from my family and I honestly, all I want to do is be at home in my wrestling room playing with my kids.</p> <p>I'm trying to get through this backlog of commitments and then we're going to really be restructuring things. We are trying to protect my time a lot more after the first week of November. So part of me, coming to this coaching, which is like, do I want to keep doing that? Do we just shut down DotComSecrets and focus on Click Funnels, that's on us, where the big opportunity is.</p> <p>Monday when I was driving to the Mastermind, I Voxed Liz, a lot of you guys know Liz. I said, \"Hey, what would be your thoughts if I did stop doing the coaching stuff?\" I was curious, and she messaged back this really great thing about the impact I had on her life and anyway, it just made me feel really good. Then we started the Mastermind and honestly, I was nervous at first because there was a lot of new faces in the group. I hope everyone gets along. I hope that everyone is providing value, and I just want to make it an amazing experience for the group. We did it day one and day two, and it's been kind of hard because I'm also planning for the events happening the next two days.</p> <p>I pull an eight hour day with the Mastermind, then I go back to the office for six or seven hours working on presentations. And then all day mastermind and I just got done spending eight more hours working on presentations for tomorrow. I was just tired, worn out, and beat up. It was amazing at the end of the Mastermind today, I had everyone go through and say, \"What was your biggest ah ha\"? It was awesome. Just seeing people who came in on Monday and within 48 hours, I completely transformed, not just their businesses in a lot of situations, but their lives.</p> <p>We had one guy, an older gentleman, started bawling his eyes out when he was sharing his take away. Then we had someone else who it completely changed the trajectory of his life, moving forward. For me to have a chance to be part of that, to have facilitated that and to be around that is so neat. I remember I got back to the office and I had all this stuff. I was stressed out and overwhelmed at all these things and I got a Vox from this dude named Noah, in our group, and he left me the coolest Vox, thanking me for the experience and all these kind of things. I'm sitting there tired and I just want to go home. I'm worn out and he was inspired that I was putting this much effort into the event the next day.</p> <p>It just made me so grateful for that. I think that it's interesting; I get a lot of value personally, out of that. Out of the helping and the serving and seeing people's lives and businesses affected in that way. It's just interesting. It's funny, after all the stress and headache, the tiredness, almost trying to figure out, should we just stop doing this? What's the plan after a day like that? I was like, you know what? What we are doing is good. It's worth it. It isn't just me selling something to make money, but it's people having life changing effects because of it which is ... I think, one of the main reasons most of us get into business, especially a coaching type business.</p> <p>With that said, I'm two days into a four day event. I'm sure I'll message you guys again throughout the week telling you the ups and the downs. I'm sure there will be some of those as we make it all through it. I'm just excited. I really enjoy this. I love the chance it gives me to share, grow, and to think. To try to think bigger than I normally do. To try to inspire and bring new things. I'm just going to say, for you guys, whatever business it is you're in, I would try to add some kind of coaching component to it just because when you do you start making connections and you start seeing ... I don't know how to explain it.</p> <p>I've talked about it in different podcasts. When I was in high school, my senior year, they had me start coaching at wrestling camps. I remember trying to break down moves for people and learning and really starting to figure out why these things work. I could do the move but I started realizing why the move worked. When you understand that and you're conscious of it, you can change things and you can make things better and execute things better.</p> <p>I think a big part of that was for me, when we were putting this event together and we're calling it Funnel Catcher. It was kind of walking through the content promotion strategy that we're starting in our business. I really had ... To be able to get the information, to be able to share it the next two days with everybody. We had to test a lot of things and we had to try a lot of thing. I had to learn a lot of things. I had to think through things. I had to try to figure out why does this work or why isn't this working? How could this work, potentially on this network and that? It just made me think at a different level than I would if I was just in my business the whole time.</p> <p>I am grateful for that. It's pretty cool. What's cool is that we have the presentations over the next two days and it's going to be a good framework for the entrepreneurs who are at the event, to take it and to run with, but it also has forced me to build a foundation as well. Where we would go for something, we're kind of onsey, twosey doing to here is the framework in a defined way.</p> <p>Anyway, it's pretty exciting. I don't know if my ramblings meant anything or mattered tonight, but hopefully it did. Hopefully you guys feel that in your business sometimes, where you're stressed, you're overwhelmed, you're tired and you just want to give up sometimes even, but after you do finish through and execute, you see the fruits of it and how it can affect people. That's the recharge. That's what gets you going again. It keeps you excited. That's it! I am home. I have got a whopping five hours of sleep I got to get tonight before I'm on stage tomorrow and I'm on stage the whole day, so I'm going to get some sleep. I will be ready in the morning to deliver and serve.</p> <p>For all of you guys who are in Ignite or Inner Circle, I'm excited to see you guys in the morning and hopefully, what I bring tomorrow will help transform you and your businesses and get you to where you want to be. I appreciate everybody for listening and we will talk to you all again very, very soon. Thanks guys.</p>", "duration": "09:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_155.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1443022219, "title": "Episode #154 \u2013 Why I Love/Hate Product Launches", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Early morning, sleep deprived ramblings, the morning of product launch day.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about product launches and how much work it was before Clickfunnels.

It is product launch day.</p> <p>Hey everyone, welcome to Marketing in Your Car. Today is product launch day. Yes, you heard me right. Today, ClickFunnels 2.0 is going live, which means it's 6 in the morning and I'm driving to the office. I was up last night until after 1:30. I want to talk about a couple things.</p> <p>First off, product launches, I forgot how hard they are. The last time I did a ... well, let me rewind. My business, for a long time, for probably 5 years or so, was based off of a product launch model, which was horrible. I don't think I realized how horrible it was until I moved to one that's not product launch. I was like, \"Wow! That's way better.\" This was our old model, is every quarter we had to launch a product. We get as many people as possible to promote for us, and we get them all on board. They all promote, we make a bunch of money, we get a whole bunch of people to join our list, and for the next three months we would have to then repay favors to everyone who promoted for us. We promote all these other things, repay favors, by the end of three months, our list was kind of dead from promoting other people's stuff. Then lo and behold, we had to do another product launch. Everyone that we had promoted owed us favors, so they promoted.</p> <p>That was the cycle. Four times a year, we\u2019d do a product launch, and I forgot how much work it is. I forgot the stress and the headaches, and all the little things. Obviously, that was pre ClickFunnels, so now it's way easier. Back then, it was like, I don't know how we survived it, but we did somehow, luckily. We survived it, we thrived through it, and now we're here. Anyway, it's kind of interesting to me. I'm so grateful to not be in a difficult product launch business. We did a product launch earlier this year with my book, and then we're doing this one for ClickFunnels 2.0, which is two in a year, which is way too much. I think I'm retiring from the product launch business. I'm going to be focusing on growing a company the good old fashioned way instead. We're doing this because we can, and we think it'll be fun. It'll give us a big surge of energy, and customers, and excitement.</p> <p>It's kind of interesting, at our live event we promoted the dream car contest, which is exciting. We promoted Actionetics and Backpack. In that little room of 600 people, everyone was going nuts, but then the rest of the world doesn't know what's happening, so it's kind of like, we needed to make some noise and get everyone else excited too. That's kind of what this is about. This obviously isn't like a typical product launch. It's not just us doing a new product, it's ClickFunnels, but now we're also releasing Backpack and Actionetics inside of it. It's exciting. That's kind of what's happening today. One secret I learned from product launches is never have your product launch go live at 9 a.m. I used to do that all the time. We'd pull all-nighters, 9 a.m.\u00a0 we'd go live, and there would always be issues. We set it for 4 Eastern, that way I've got until 2 o'clock my time. I could go crazy, past lunch, and then we open it all up. I've learned that, and hopefully you guys, if you ever do product launches, that will be a good little tip for you as well.</p> <p>Dang, \u00a0I had something really cool to share with you. I'm trying to remember what it is now. Well, I think it had to do with the transitioning of a company from a product launch, over to a sustainable business. I was listening to a podcast with Ryan Lee. Ryan is one of the coolest dudes. I don't think I've ever really told him that, but I really just like him. Anyway, he launched his podcast called the Freedom Show. It's really good. It's kind of like Marketing in Your Car, just little ten minute things. Ryan is just fun. I like him a lot.</p> <p>One of his guests he had on there was one of my friends, Mike Lovich. Mike was talking about a concept that I thought was kind of cool. He said that when he launched his business, he was out there trying to hustle and nobody ever promoted him. Ryan, I guess, was the first person to ever promote him. Ryan promoted him, he made some money, and he's like, \"That was house money now.\" He made 2 or 3 thousand dollars. He's like, \"Now it's the house money I'm gambling with. Then I went out, and I learned how to buy ads, do media, and do all these other things that kind of go with that.\"</p> <p>That was his big secret. I think about that, you know, the main reason I like product launches is because of this increased excitement and energy and surge of people caring about what you're doing. It's still probably one of the best ways to launch a business. It's hard initially, because a lot of times you don't have partners, you don't have things like that, and it's hard. If you really launch it, do the initial product launch with one person. If you find one person who believes in what you're doing, pay them 100% commission, or 200%. Whatever it takes to get them engaged and involved.</p> <p>Do this initial push which causes momentum. Momentum is good because, even if it's just a little bit of momentum, one dude buys your thing, that's momentum. That's like, oh my gosh. Things are moving forward. Now we can start running instead of walking. There's all this momentum that starts going forward. I think a lot of times it's that initial surge. When you do start making money from that, the key. This is the hard part for a lot of us entrepreneurs who like to spend money on dumb things. You got to reinvest that money. There's a point that you can take money out, but it's not at first.</p> <p>I look at our supplement business, it's funny. People are always like, \"Oh, I wish I was in the supplement business. You're making like 20 grand a day.\" I'm like, yeah but we didn't pull money out of that business for like a year and a half. Every penny we made went back into either inventory or ads. It was kind of interesting. A business like that, you have to scale it. The time you start making a lot of money is almost when the business dies. It's not necessarily that way. We built this one better.</p> <p>The first time I ever remember seeing that, these guys were selling a website on Flippa. It was back in the acai berry days. It was a free plus shipping, scammy acai offer. They were explaining their metrics. They were like, \"Yeah, the way it works, we scaled it up. We got it to the point where it's doing 100 grand a month, or 500 grand a month,\" or whatever it was. He's like, \"We're buying media. We're not making any money, and then we stop buying media and we just live off the recurrent as it dwindles down to nothing.\" That was the whole model. At that point, they sell it on Flippa.</p> <p>They were kind of showing, they'd done the cycle over and over again where basically that's what they were doing is that you know, they got to a point where it was making half a million dollars a month but were not making any money and then they stop buying ads and then that recurring of half a million dollars a month comes in and then next month is 300 thousand and 200 thousand then 100 then 0 and they only make their money when the business is dying. Which kind of sucks, right? We won't make money until we decide to kill our business. That's how a lot of these guys work and Neuracel wasn't that way. We were profitable earlier but it still took a while. It was ... we weren't able to pull money out until we decided to stop growing, if that makes sense. We got to a point where we were doing about half a million dollars a month and then we stopped growing it because we wanted to take some money out. We sat there ... we could have kept growing it but then we would have had to kept reinvesting the profits in inventory and advertising.</p> <p>So it's kind of ... I hate business like that where you can't ... you know where you grow and you ... or where you profit when you stop growing, which isn't much fun. I don't know why I went on that rant. Probably because I had like 3 hours of sleep last night. It's been thing after thing ... but anyway, the moral of that story was, when you do a business, when you do a product launch, you get that momentum, is reinvest that money. Reinvest it back in and get to the point now where you can pull profits out. Make a little money, you pull it out, you just killed the goose that could lay golden eggs. All right.</p> <p>Now I remembered what my moral of the story was, kind of. I think ... some smart dude, I don't know which guy it was. It was either Parato or Occam or some dude who said something famous. I would probably know this like 3 hours from now but this early, I really have no idea. But he said something and I'm sure someone out there is just shaking their head, thinking, Russell, you should know this guy's name.</p> <p>Anyway, he basically said that like when you have a task, right, all the ... or you have a deadline. Somehow magically, all of the like the amount of work will grow to expand to fill that task up, right? Fill that allotted time up. It\u2019s funny, because we have been working on this product launch forever, we had all these things pre-done like months in advance. We were ... it's just crazy. No matter what you do, at least in my experience, maybe other people are better than me, no matter what you do though, you're always ... all the stuff you have to get done for this product launch, does not get done until the second it goes live. It's insane how that works. It's literally insane how that works.</p> <p>We spent so much time and effort testing everything and then now still we were up until 1 o'clock last night. I'm up this morning at 5. You know, and we're testing and trying and everyone's going to be up and then ... what's interesting and this is what's kind of cool. As you get closer and closer to the deadline, you always have this list of all this stuff you want to get done and as you look at the clock, okay, there's 3 hours left, there's 2 hours left, there's 1 hour left, there's 30 minutes left, there's 5 minutes left. You start cutting things. You're like, \"That can't happen. That's impossible. That's impossible. Eventually come out with what's left, which is the little pieces that basically the ... you usually start trimming off all the nice to haves and you end up left with the half to haves. After the launch starts, then you go back to adding in all the other things that you try to get it finalized.</p> <p>But it's interesting is that ... that's one of my favorite reasons to have a launch is it forces you to get done all the must haves, right? And to trim out all the should haves or want to haves or whatever you want to call them. Most people ... most entrepreneurs, they never get their thing live because they spend years trying to get it perfect. Like I said, if you don't have a deadline, you don't have something happening, somehow magically all time will get filled up with stuff that you need to get done and it just never gets done so that's one nice thing about a deadline like this. It's do or die. You don't have any choice because you know, in 4 hours from now, people are promoting whether it's live or not and if it's not live, then they don't promote, we just lost on huge opportunities, you know, hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars.</p> <p>Anyway, hopefully you guys got a little value out of today. If not, I apologize it's the lack of sleep and everything that we got from the circumstances but regardless I hope that from this you got the fact that having a product launch business model is no fun but having a product launch to force you to get stuff done and to give you initial momentum, which then can be turned into cash flow and everything else you need to be able to start scaling your company in an actual growth-type business as opposed to a product launch business is good. There's a time and a place so thank you Jeff Walker for giving us a product launch and everybody thinks that that's a business, you're not listening to Jeff. Anyway, I'm at the office guys. Appreciate you all. Have an awesome day. Hopefully when you watch this, ClickFunnels will be live and will be bug free or at least as close to that as humanly possible. Love you guys. Thanks everybody, have an awesome day and talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "12:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_154.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1442870812, "title": "Episode #153 \u2013 Clickfunnels 2.0: The Future", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A glimpse behind the vision of what Clickfunnels is becoming.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the new updates to Clickfunnels and future updates that will come to make Clickfunnels better and better.</p> <p>Here are a few things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Find out some of the new features coming out on Clickfunnels.</li> <li>Hear about some of the future features that will be coming eventually.</li> <li>And find out what Russell\u2019s prediction is for how many people in the industry will eventually be using Clickfunnels.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out some cool Clickfunnels features that you will soon be able to enjoy.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car!</p> <p>All right, so that intro's a little weird, I'm not going to lie, but I got have some kind of pattern interrupt. I say the same thing every morning, so there you go. I hope you guys are doing amazing today. It is Monday as of when I'm recording this. I know maybe, who knows when you're listening to this. Monday I'm recording it and on Wednesday we start our pre-launch for Click Funnels 2.0, which I am insanely excited by, and nervous, and everything all wrapped up into one. It's crazy, like I'm sure any of you guys that have been listening for a while know a lot of the stories but we launched Click Funnels about a year ago and in that year it's grown like nothing I've ever dreamt of. People are adopting it and it's so exciting. We didn't want to sit on our, what do they say? Sit on your laurels or sit back and just sit there, we wanted to continue to improve, and make this thing better, and make it what I would have dreamt of.</p> <p>It's funny, I think it was ... What's his name? Henry Ford or something; I think I might have mentioned this in another podcast, too, but he said something like, \"If I would have asked my customers what I wanted, they would have told me they wanted a faster horse.\" I felt like when we first came out with Click Funnels that's what people thought it was. It's like, \"Oh, it's like LeadPages, you can move things around.\" We're like, \"No, that's a piece of it, that's not the vision; the vision is so much bigger.\" The vision that I know Todd and Dylan and I had when we first launched the company was so much bigger. The question was not like, \"How do we make a better LeadPages, or better Unbounce, or whatever you want to say?\" At the time when we launched Click Funnels was it was in the midst. Todd was coding Click Funnels while we were launching Neuracel. The Neuracel project, obviously, as you guys know did really well but, man, it took a lot of people, and time, and effort, and every little change was like a nightmare.</p> <p>For me, when I was building this, like my dream is where I can just not have to have all these people here doing this stuff. Where I can just log in, and drag, and drop, and move things. At first, it was funny because we had the vision from day one that it wasn't just going to be one software program. It was 3 things, it was Click Funnels, Backpack, and Actionetics. In fact we owned Actionetics, Todd started developing that way before Click Funnels was even a dream. It's been a long, long, long time in the making and most people don't know that. They think it's, \"Oh, we just added these new things.\"\u00a0 It's like, \"No, Todd spent 5 or 6 years building Actionetics the first time around and then having to re-code it to bring it into Click Funnels.\" It was very well thought through and thought out. The vision, in fact, we had explainer videos done for both of those before we ever launched Click Funnels.</p> <p>It's not something where we're just trying to, \"Oh what should we do?\" It's been part of the vision from day one. In fact, for me, and I know for Todd and Dylan, I think, that it's been very frustrating to like, \"Everyone's loving Click Funnels.\" It's like, \"Yeah, but it's not done yet, it's not complete, it's not what we know it's going to be.\" We know what the vision is and that's what we're so excited share with you and with everybody and it wasn't quite there yet. What's exciting about this launch is that this will be, the complete product, will be released during this launch. You guys will have access to Click Funnels, Backpack, and Actionetics. We're calling it the Etison Suite. Etison's the name of our company by the way. Etison, E-T-I-S-O-N, it's like Thomas Edison and Tesla mixed together, so it's Etison. It's the full Etison Suite.</p> <p>What makes me nervous is releasing 2 new huge ... An affiliate platform and basically an email auto-responder that does a million things more, at one time is scary. I know that at first we've had to do, on purpose, we can't launch all the features at once because it would just be a nightmare, so we're rolling out with minimum viable product. Not so much that other things aren't done but because we need to make sure that's perfect. People will get in there and we'll start seeing the little bugs, and tweaks, and changes we need to make. We'll scramble as quick as we can to make those things more and more solid. From there, over the next year or 2 years, 3 years we'll keep adding and building upon those things. The nice thing on our side that I'm excited for is that the product will be done. It won't be like, \"Okay, what's the next thing we're going to build? It's like, \"That is the product, that is the vision.\" Now, it's like how do we take that, make it more stable, make it faster, make better?</p> <p>In fact Todd did updates this weekend where, and this is kind of geeky-nerdy, and probably doesn\u2019t make sense to all of us, including me, but the pages load-time went from 500 milliseconds to 1/20 of that or something like that. Like .15 or something, so you guys probably didn't notice that but this weekend your page loads went up 5 times faster because of little things he's doing like that. That's the vision that, moving forward over the next 12 months is just making things faster, better, stronger, more reliable, and incrementally adding little things. As opposed to like right now we're tripling what the product is. So that\u2019s exciting. The only other big thing that's coming out is the Market Place, which we have a different dev team building that out and it's almost done, as well. When that's done, on our side it's going to be now just making that better, and better, and better as opposed to building out new things.</p> <p>I'm excited and I know you're probably excited and just wanted to share it with you guys. That was it, nothing else to really share other than that's where we're at. I hope for you and your company it's the same way. Getting feedback from people is one thing, but I hope you have a vision of what you're trying to accomplish and where you're trying to go. A vision that's bigger than most people can even contemplate because that's where greatness, I think, comes from is really knowing where you want to be. Typically, it's you want to get there for your own reasons, your own business. It's interesting I was talking to Jason O'Neil, one of our inner circle members who's crushing it right now and it's just fun. He built this software program and he said something that was really cool to me, he said, \"All it is I built exactly what I wanted and now everybody's buying it.\" I think he said he's up to 30 grand a month in recurring from this software and it's just like it's awesome. I'm so proud of him, it's so fun to see.</p> <p>That's what it is he built it for himself and by doing that it's become something everybody else is adopting. Same thing, Click Funnels, we built it for ourselves. We built it because we didn't want to have another Neuracel where it took us 2 months to launch and then a year of optimizations. It could have been done in a weekend and that's what we've done. Anyway, I hope you guys love it all, I hope that you're patient as you get it because there are going to be little hiccups, and issues, and little things. It won't be perfect at first, but it will be perfect soon and that's the game plan, the goal. I foresee that in the future, in a year from now, the majority of people in our market will be using it for everything. For email, for their affiliate programs, for their pages, their shopping cart.</p> <p>I've seen the future of where they're going. I've seen the dashboards like some of the new Click Funnels dashboards that won't be immediately, but as we keep developing this into more and more of full blown CRM you'll be able to see ... Oh, it's just exciting, it's awesome. The visibility you'll be able to get from your customers which was never possible before now. I tried for 12 years to be able to see an accurate lifetime value of one of my customers and it was impossible. Where now, with Click Funnels it will be just one of the stats you see; which is the power of having everything in the same ecosystem. We're able to see everything, able to see what emails they open, what pages in the funnel they hit, how often they hit it, how long they were there when they hit. It's just, it's amazing. Appreciate you guys, appreciate you believing in the vision, appreciate you being part of it, and we'll keep making it better and better for you.</p> <p>Like I said, just as it comes out, just know there's going to be little hiccups at first. We know it, you should hopefully now know it. Be forgiving, enjoy the process with us and in a year from now you look back thinking, \"Wow, I cannot believe what's been accomplished in the last 12 months.\" That's what we're saying and other people are saying about Click Funnels in the first 12 months. We're just going to keep on trying to make it better. Appreciate all you guys. Have an amazing day and we will talk soon.</p>", "duration": "09:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_153.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1442850904, "title": "Episode #152 \u2013 What Shania Twain Taught Me About Being Relevant", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to stay relevant in your market consistently year-in and year-out.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about Shania Twain and what she taught him about remaining relevant.

I appreciate you guys, I'm heading home from the office right now and had a long day. We have a thing called \u201cDecade In A Day\u201d we do for all of our inner circle members where they come in and we get to do a full day consult. Well, an hour long consult with them but with eight people throughout the day, so it's eight hours.</p> <p>I'm a little bit fried, and I'm heading home right now to go to the Boise state game. We've got a cute little handicap kid we're taking with us, so we've got to get there early to get him into the stadium and it's a lot of work, but it's going to be a lot of fun. Really excited for that, hopefully my energy level will stay up because I am beat right now.</p> <p>I wanted to talk to you guys about something interesting I learned from Shania Twain. Now, I need to admit first off I'm a huge Shania Twain fan, had a crush on her since I was eighteen years old. I was actually at my senior year in high school, we went to a wrestling tournament and the wrestling tournament was out in Florida, and our parents didn't come with us, it was a whole bunch of wrestlers. I can\u2019t believe our poor coaches took us on that. We went there, we're all in a hotel room, jammed with like twenty wrestlers in one hotel room. Anyway, MTV was cool back then, I don't think it is anymore, but it might be for young kids, but I don't think it's cool. Definitely back than it was still cool, and so every morning they'd turn it on and every morning this song came on from this beautiful girl, named Shania Twain. It was the song \u201cLooks Like We Made It\u201d.</p> <p>I fell in love with Shania back then, and it's been awesome ever since. Anyway, fast forward and it was ... it was interesting, went to her concert and it was fun, we had a great time. What was weird to me is like this was the first time I had ever seen her live in person, and my distinct thought in my head was like \u201cHey, it looks like Shania Twains mom!\u201d, that's what it felt like.</p> <p>I'm like, oh, I'm not eighteen years old anymore, she's no longer thirty years old or whatever she was back then. We're all getting older, it's different, and I think that they were saying it's Shanias last tour ever and all of this stuff we were reading online. Even though the first time I had heard about her was 1998, I guess she had been touring and doing stuff since 1992.</p> <p>So, from 1992 until today, which is, I don't even know how many years that is, twenty years? That's a long time right? A long, long time. It's interesting that people hear Shania Twain\u2019s coming to town and they still pack the house with tons of people, it was really really cool. Maybe start thinking about the question that I think is important for me, specifically, and for you and for everyone who is trying to sell stuff, and the question is, \u201cHow do we remain relevant?\u201d</p> <p>It's interesting, I got started in this business twelve years ago, and in that time I could list off pages and pages of people who came in who were the hot stuff in the couple different markets that I have been in. They come in with a lot of energy, a lot of fanfare, and they come in and it's like \u201cwow, these guys are amazing\u201d. Within a year, year and a half, two years, these guys disappear and they're no longer relevant.</p> <p>Okay, you see it with celebrities all the time as well. I remember I had a guy write a sales letter for me a couple years ago, and one of the case studies that he talks about, and we had it hand sketched and it was like, \u201cthis is hotter than the tickets to a Justin Bieber concert\u201d or something. We never launched that sales video and in the future I was always going to.</p> <p>Now look at like, Justin Biebers whole career is dead and I'm like crap, I can never use that sales video because that's no longer relevant, he's no longer relevant, the whole concept. If I do ever launch that sales video I've got to re-sketch it with someone else who is cool, which I thought was kind of funny. I should just post the hand sketch out of this Justin Bieber because it\u2019s funny ... anyway, that's a good question\u2026 How do you stay relevant?</p> <p>I've been grateful that in the twelve years I've been in this business, one that you guys would be familiar with, I've been in a lot of businesses. One that my face is on the front of it, how do you stay relevant? It's scary because I've gone through session or seasons, whatever you want to call them in my life, in my career, where I wasn't anymore.</p> <p>I felt that, one minute you're the hottest thing on earth, the next minute nobody cares. You work really hard and all of a sudden you become relevant again, then it goes away and it's like man, how do you do that, how do you stay that way? It's funny, I had a talk, call, whatever you want to call it. Mike Filsaime, one of my closest marketing buddies, one of the first guys I met when I got online, he came to Boise a couple years ago and spent a couple days here just talking about business and stuff. I asked him, he was doing \u00a0the marketers cruise every year, and I was like, \"Why do you still do that man? You don't make any money, it's a week away of your life.\"</p> <p>He said, \"The real reason I do it, is to stay relevant. That's what keeps me in the mind of my customers, my JV partners, my prospects all the time.\" He's like, \"If I stop doing that there's a chance that I would slip and not be relevant anymore.\"</p> <p>That's the first time I had ever thought about it, like \u201cWow that's interesting. How do you stay relevant?\u201d That's the question I don't know if I can answer today on this podcast, but I might give you some hints or some ideas of things I've thought through, things that I think have helped me in the times that I've been able to stay relevant. I hope I can continue to stay relevant for a long time. Until I'm ready to disappear into the night, which is going to happen you guys, mark my words. One day Russell will disappear and, I'll keep doing the marketing in your car because I love you, but the rest of the world will not know I exist.</p> <p>A couple things, first off I think a big part of it is you've got to be a ferocious learner. Not only does whatever market you're in change a lot, even if things don't change a lot in your market which is true with some things... People that are in that market, their cycle, the things that are happening, things that are hot, things that are exciting. If you ... I remember in the internet marketing space for a long time, membership sites was the thing, it was the hot topic. I luckily came in and rode that wave, I came out with a concept called micro-continuity about that time, and it blew up and made insane amounts of money. I was super relevant than, but then the buzz and excitement of membership sites went away.</p> <p>I had to transition away from micro-continuity, that product if I launched it today would not do a fraction of what it did when we launched it. I hit it at a time it was hot. One of my very first products I had success with was a public domain thing. For whatever reason public domain, one or two years into my career became this hot topic and everyone was talking about it. Yanik Silver is launching products ... all of these other things were happening; I was like, \"Huh.\"</p> <p>All these people talking about public domain, I'm going to make a public domain membership site. It came out and it just the right timing and it worked. It was relevant, it kept me focused. I think that if I was in a veracious, I don't know how to say that word ... learning all the time and seeing what the trends are, and learning and trying to be the top of my game so that whatever was hot and relevant, that I was in that conversation. I understood it, I could keep up with it, and I could help expand those conversations and take the concept of like membership sites or recurring, and how could I make this better? What can I do, how can I expand that thought or that concept?</p> <p>I think that's one really big thing. I think that ... that kind of leads to another thing is like, being prolific. Again, how do you teach being prolific right? It's hard, it's not something that you can just teach I don't think. It's understanding, I have this thing called the prolific index, some of you guys may have seen it. In the middle it's like the sane zone, this is like when you go to high school and they teach you about the four food groups, like that's in the middle.</p> <p>Then on both ends, I call it the crazy zone. The crazy zone is like where people are crazy, like, \"Hey liposuction, you should just chop off your fat and you'll lose weight that way,\" right? Somewhere between the crazy and the boring mid zone, is the prolific zone. This is where like, for me I think I talk about guys like Dave Asprey, I hung out with last week. Putting butter in your coffee to lose weight, that's the prolific zone. It's not mainstream where no one's going to give you money, it's not crazy where people are going to think you're insane, but in between there.</p> <p>That's the sweet spot, that's where you've got to be living, that's where you've got to be thinking. I have friends that are amazing at helping people lose weight, but they are so mainstream that it's hard for them to get a message out because their message is the same as everybody else's message. If you want your message to grow and to expand and to be shared and to go viral, whatever you want to call that, it's gotta fall in between there, it cannot be in the boring zone or the crazy zone. It's got to be in the prolific.</p> <p>Even if you don't believe in the crazier part of the things, you've got to find the things you do and you've got to tell stories, and create things so that becomes exciting. That's the key, that's a big key to it. The next thing I think is ... I don't know, there are so many things. I think it's being relevant not just to customers, but to partners. How do you serve people that potentially extend your message?</p> <p>I've spent a lot of time, especially over the last twelve months trying to put a lot of time and energy into building relationships with other people who I feel are very relevant, so that I can ride on their coat tails or I can leverage some of those things as well. Learning how to speak, learning how to sell, learning how to be good on camera so that people are excited. This periscope thing for me has been evolving a lot lately, it's been interesting to me.</p> <p>I love my podcasts, I love this, but it's hard for me to grow this audience. It grows organically, and luckily there's a lot of word of mouth from you guys, who I appreciate it. Sharing this with other people, in fact, if you like this episode, share it, please. It's hard for me to inherently promote, there's not good tools to build your podcast right? There are things you can do but it's not as easy, where as with periscope I've got a lot more things, a lot more tools to use to grow that following.</p> <p>Its growing, not super fast but right now we're average about three or four hundred people are watching my webinar, or watching my periscopes when they're live, which has been awesome. Then another five or six hundred, so almost a thousand people are watching each one which is cool, but then evolving and I'm figuring ... these first ones are fifteen to twenty minutes long, they're good but I was losing people really fast.</p> <p>I did it a couple days ago, I called it a marketing quickie and I shared it, and it was awesome. Engagement, sharing, everything was way better. Now, when getting my platform now, so I've done three in a row, it's called marketing quickies, like quick five minute long periscopes.</p> <p>They're fast, they're awesome, and I'm taking that and I can push it. It's growing, and I think that finding something like that and then being very consistent is key as well.</p> <p>Anyway, there's a lot of little things. I don't know if I know the answer, but what wanted to kind of start the conversation and get you guys thinking and running that through your heads. I think that's important, because just because you're making money today, you might not be making money tomorrow. Be grateful for what you have right now, be grateful for whatever platform you have, because it can go away.</p> <p>I've seen mine go up and down throughout the years, and I'm very aware of that, and I'm very grateful for what I do have, and I want to stress for you guys that you understand that, and be grateful for it. Do things to stay relevant, that's a big key. Again, I have friends who thought they would be forever, and now I watch them and most of them ... they're not doing what they were doing five, ten years ago, and that's a big deal. Hope that helps, hope that helps at least get your thoughts in that direction, and yeah. I'm tried, I'm beat up, I'm going to go home, go to the football game and have some fun.</p> <p>Thanks you guys, I appreciate you, and I'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "12:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_152.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1442267208, "title": "Episode #151 \u2013 Positioning And Posturing", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to change your sales process that\u2019ll allow you to 10x your prices with half the effort.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about getting quotes on construction projects and the frustration that comes with waiting.

This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, I just finished a near flawless morning routine, it was exciting. I woke up on time, I studied my scriptures, which, for me, is a big thing. Then, I did my supplements. I'm trying to process how to stack them to make me feel the best. When I just down a million supplements at once, I don't feel like I'm taking over the world. I tried something where first thing in the morning, I get apple cider vinegar lemon shot, which is horrible, it's really painful. Then, do my keto OS right then, along with my On It supplements. Then, do my study, then doing my morning workout. It was super dark this morning, it's crazy. A week ago, when I was running, it was light. Now, it's dark, so I did this stuff inside my wrestling room, which was fun.</p> <p>Did a killer workout for an hour, did cardio really hard for 20 minutes or so, then switched over to weights, body weight stuff and heavyweight stuff, which was really fun. Then, came back in and did bone broth, this green drink thing, and my bulletproof hot chocolate stuff, along with the rest of my vitamins. Anyway, feeling good like that, breaking them up like that and then doing the stack that way. Anyway, feeling really, really good. Liking that, so I'm going to keep tweaking and testing that and try to keep perfecting this thing, which will be fun. Now, I am heading into the office. I had a thought today, as I was looking at vendors and how people have been working with me on different project in the home and things like that. I wanted to hopefully save some of you guys from yourself, that's my goal for today's message.</p> <p>This is what's been happening. I call a contractor or whatever, have them come out here. I'm like, \"This is what I want to have happen.\" I'm all excited, I have all this energy, and I'm showing them everything. They're like, \"Oh, cool, cool, cool. All right, we're going to go home and build out a quote for you, and we'll get back to you.\" My excitement level drops a little bit, like, \"Okay.\" Then, they go home. Honestly, like a week, two weeks, three weeks later, they come back with a quote for me. They email me the quote in a state where I'm not longer pumped up, excited, and fired up. They email it to me, and it sits in my inbox. I look at it just really devoid of emotion, it's got a whole bunch of things that mean a lot to them, but means zero to me. I'm looking over these things, and it's so uninspiring.</p> <p>So far, three or four people that have sent me these quotes back, I haven't even responded back to them. What's funny is that when I don't respond back to them, none of them ever follow up again. They just don't, that's the end of it, and they lose my business. It's crazy to me because some of these projects are really big projects that could make or break a company sometimes, I would think. A couple things I want to do is first off, I want to walk you guys through the process of if you are doing quotes, how do them right. Then, I'm going to walk through the process of how to actually do them better. Here's how to do them right. When I am in the peak excitement level and I am going crazy, that's the time you want to get me to commit. You don't want to get me to commit three weeks later when I'm out of state, right? The biggest thing about sales is 90 percent of it's creating the emotions so that when you ask them for money, they say yes. When someone has you over to their home, they're excited, and they're going crazy, that's the time you want them to commit. That's step number one.</p> <p>Again, most times, you're not going to know what it is right now, but man I would lock them in right now. I'd say, \"Look, this project's going to be pretty big, it's going to be 20, 30,000 or whatever, could be potentially. I'm going to go find those things out for you, but I want to lock this in today. I know you're excited, I'm excited. How soon would you like us to come out?\" For me, I kept telling the guy, the most recent guy, I kept telling him, \"My biggest concern in life is urgency, I want this done yesterday. I don't really care how much it costs, I just want it done.\" With that, it took him three weeks to get me a quote back, which is ridiculous.</p> <p>I wanted it done in three weeks, so right then, he should've said, \"Hey, how about this? Let's lock this in, and say it's going to be a lot. Let's just say the first $10,000, because you know it's going to be more than that, right?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" \"Okay, let's lock this in while you're excited and I'm excited. First $10,000, that means my guys will come out next Wednesday, and we're going to start this process. It's going to take me a while to figure out exactly what it's going to cost, but it's at least 10 grand. Let's lock down 10 grand, you pay ten grand right now. We'll get started, and I'll have the rest of the quote for you later on. I guarantee it won't go over 50,000, or 40,000.\"</p> <p>Or, ask me what's my max budget, and I can say, \"I'm looking probably 40, 50 grand.\" \"Okay, cool. We'll make sure we don't go over that. Let's lock in 10 grand right now and let's get started.\" Now, you've got me as a client. Now, you sold me and got my credit card at the peak of emotional impact. I'm pumped up, I'm excited, I'm fired up, right? Not three weeks later after I'm annoyed that I still haven't heard back from you. That's step number one, step number two is getting money now, it's way better than getting money later. Lock in, get some money now, and figure out the rest of it later. You don't have to have 100 percent perfect quote, you just find out what their max budget is and tell them you guarantee it'll come in underneath that.</p> <p>Then, go back to work and spent your week, two weeks, or three weeks, whatever it takes, figuring that out, but get the process started. The biggest things that can cause people to cancel, refund, or whatever is that the process never gets started. They're sitting around waiting forever. We had someone come in and do blinds, it took them eight weeks to get the blinds installed, just ridiculous. We didn't hear back from the once. During that eight week period of time when I'm nervous, I'm waiting, I'm excited, I'm losing this, I'm getting frustrated, you should be calling telling me the status. That gap is when you go to be really treating them right. Those are some things if you're doing quotes that I would really think about.</p> <p>Now, I want to shift it around and tell you guys a better way to do it. The better way to do it is don't do quotes. When doing quotes, suddenly, you are in a business now of comparison shopping. In fact, the guy that sent me the most recent quote, on the top of it, it had this big disclaimer, like, \"If you send this quote to other people, we will bill you $250\" or something stupid like that. You know what happens is you get a bill, I forward it to three other people, and they try to beat it. As soon as you give them a quote, they're going to go comparison shop. It's the dumbest thing in the world, you don't want people comparison shopping, you want to flip it around and you want to position and posture the right way.</p> <p>The way we do it is we position ourselves as the best, the most expensive, the hands-down best alternative on earth. One of my mentors, Dan Kennedy, said, \"If you can't be the cheapest option, there's no strategic advantage in being the second cheapest.\" Which is a huge, important thing. I'm dropping a piece of gold for you guys right now when you understand this. If you can't be the cheapest option, there's no strategic advantage in being the second cheapest. If you can't be the cheapest, you need to be the most expensive. Position yourself as the most expensive, like we are the most expensive shop in town, but we do it the best. Go after the premium market, because again, either go after the cheapest, or the premium, but don't be in the middle.</p> <p>Pick the premium, then strategically position yourself in a spot where you are not easy to work with. It's hard to get to you, they have to apply, and you change the whole process. That's why my coaching program is application only. We don't go out there and beg people to buy from us, we make them apply, we put them through a process to position and posture ourselves at the top of it. The top of the market, not the low price leader, or the second-to-low-price leader. If you can't be the lowest, then you got to be the most expensive. We position ourselves that way, we make people apply. When they apply, now it changes the whole thing. No longer am I coming out and giving you a quote, you got the control in your hands, they're applying and asking to work with you.</p> <p>Now, that control is magically in your hands. You can increase prices, you can demand things, you change how the playing field is. A funny example, we had someone apply to join my Inner Circle program. They were talking to one of my sales guys, and they asked the sales guy, \"Hey, can you send me a proposal for what this is going to look like?\" My sales guy started laughing out loud, and that guy's like, \"What?\" He said, \"We don't do proposals here, Russell doesn't wear shoes at the office. If you're looking for a proposal, you're not the right fit for this program.\" The guy apologized, \"Oh, I'm so sorry. No, no, no, here's my credit card number.\" Completely just changed the thing. You have to understand that if you position yourself right and you posture the sell right, it puts all the power back in your hands, not in their hands, which is the the key.</p> <p>If you put it in their hands, where you're sending them a quote and then you're waiting to hear back from them, you lost everything. You lost all your strategic advantage; you lost your ability to price things the way that makes sense. You lost everything, and it just changes everything. I hope that gives you guys some ideas, and this is going for any kind of business. I see way too often people that are sending out quotes, they're putting out bid sheets and all sorts of stuff like that. I think it's the dumbest way on earth to do business, all you're doing is asking yourself ... You're doing all the work, putting in all the effort, then have someone go and price shop you.</p> <p>Unless you do it correctly, which is really hard to do the right way, and most of you guys won't do it the right way, I kind of mentioned earlier, then don't do it. Flip it around, make it where you are the high end leader. You're the most expensive, you're so busy that you cannot and will not take on everyone. They have to apply and jump through hoops and they have to prove to you why they should work with you. When you do it that way, everything else changes. Now, you're in the driver's seat, and now you can run your business the way that you want to do it, as opposed to doing the way your customers want to, which is a big key that I want to instill upon you.</p> <p>Obviously, we love our customers. We want to serve them at the highest way possible, but we also do it on our terms, not on their terms, which is key. As soon as you do it on their terms, your customers will eat you alive if you allow them to. It's funny because some of the support guys on our team, what they always wanted to do is, \"Hey, let's go ask our customers what they want in a software program.\" There's a, I think it's a Henry Ford or someone, quote, he said, \"I didn't ask my customers what they wanted because they would've told me they wanted a faster horse. We went out and built a car.\" Same thing with us, we always say, \"No. If we asked our customers what they wanted, they would've told us they wanted a cheaper version of lead pages.\" That's not what we're doing, we're trying to change the world here. We are the innovators, we're the thinkers, we're the ones that are thinking outside the box.</p> <p>We love feedback, and we appreciate it, but at the same time, we're building what we know is right. We've got the foresight, and we know where we want to go. It's the same thing for you. Love, respect, and treat your customers the best you can, but you've got the set the policies, you've got to set the ground rules for how someone works with you. If you don't set those rules, they will set them, and I promise it won't be favorable for you, in the long run. It won't make for a business relationship for you or for them, honestly. You're going to resent them, and you're not going to be able to serve them at the level that they need to be served at. Whereas, if you do it the right way, it'll change everything.</p> <p>Hopefully, this helps some of you guys. I remember when I first got started in this business, one of the first guys I got turned on to is a guy named Dan Kennedy, who I've mentioned a couple times. I went through all his training, which has probably skewed my thoughts a lot. I went through his time management courses, everything. He's way worse than me, but he was very strict about those kind of things. If you want to message Dan Kennedy, you can't call him, you can't email him, you fax him. Actually, you don't even fax him, you fax his assistant.</p> <p>Once a week, his assistant collects his faxes, puts them in a FedEx box, FedEx's them to him. He then gets those FedEx's, once a week opens them up and hand writes the responses to them. Then, puts them back in a FedEx box and then back to his assistant, who then gets them, then faxes them back to you. It's two to three week long process to get a response from Dan Kennedy. Some of you guys are like, \"That's ridiculous! Why should I do that? It's so annoying!\" Then, you're like, \"Man, Dan Kennedy's the man. Look how are it is to get to him, I got to pay a lot more.\" It's just interesting. I don't go as far as Dan, but I definitely do set my own rules, as should you guys as well.</p> <p>Anyway, hope that helps a little bit. Thanks for letting me vent, share, and hopefully inspire you guys and give you some ideas on how you can run your business and how you can protect your own time as well.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing In Your Car or Marketing In My Car or something like that.</p> <p>Hey, everyone. So, I was wondering today. How many of you guys actually listen while you\u2019re in your car? Maybe it\u2019s just me. Maybe I\u2019m the dude in the car and you guys are all marketing at your house or in your office. I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>But anyway, I appreciate you guys been on today. Hope things are going amazing for you and your companies. And I\u2019ve got a bunch of fun stuff to talk to you about. Last night or not \u2013 it was actually Sunday, I was sitting around after church thinking about stuff and I started mapping out ideas for cool things I want to share with you guys. So I\u2019ve got a list of cool stuff to share with you guys. So, that\u2019s my game plan for the next few days.</p> <p>Today, what I want to share or talk to you guys about a little bit, and hopefully this will help you guys when you\u2019re thinking about positioning your products and your services and even your brand as a whole. And kind of the back story behind this, most of you guys at this point know that I\u2019m a wrestler. I wrestled through high school. I was a state champ. I took second place in the country. I was an all-American, ended up wrestling at BYU until they cut the wrestling program that went to Boise State and I became one of the top \u2013 I think the highest I was ranked was 14th so top 14 wrestlers in the country. And I trained for Olympics for a little while. In fact, we built a whole Olympic Training Center.</p> <p>Anyway, recently I built my own wrestling room at my backyard. So I\u2019m obsessed with it to say the least. But anyways, it has been fun. As I built my own wrestling room, I\u2019ve been working with my kids. Teaching them wrestling\u2026. I got some jiu-jitsu guys coming over, teaching them some wrestling and it has been really fun. So it was kind of fun because it has kind of given me a chance to kind of re-remember a lot of the fundamentals of wrestling, of things that we take for granted because we just do them instinctively. But you start trying to break it down for someone else like, \u201cOh, this is why you do that and this is how you do that,\u201d and things like that.</p> <p>So in wrestling, one of the really interesting things when you\u2019re wrestling someone, if you guys watched a wrestling match before, people come out and they come like head to head typically and it looks like the heads are smashed together and they\u2019re trying to punch each other in the face, trying to get in on each other\u2019s legs, right?</p> <p>So from the outside looking at it, you probably don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. You\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d But if you look at what the goal of a wrestler is, like when we\u2019re getting in there and we\u2019re tying up, and we have our head to head and we\u2019re pushing and pulling and moving people around, our entire goal of that is we\u2019re trying to get an angle. OK? We\u2019re trying to get somebody to step so that we\u2019ve now got an angle we can attack them from.</p> <p>I know that it\u2019s very difficult if not impossible for me just to shoot directly like through somebody. It\u2019s really hard. The way that if I want to take somebody down, I\u2019ve got to move and move and move until I can get them take a little step and then I can take an angle. And as soon as I got an angle, instead of going head to head, I\u2019m going to head to like me going through their ear type thing. I have an angle. Now, it opens up the whole world to me. Now, I can actually get it on their legs. I can take them down. But it\u2019s a hundred percent \u2013 it all requires me getting an angle like if I want to takedown on somebody, it\u2019s just how it works.</p> <p>And so, I was thinking about that as I was showing my kids, like I was showing Bowen, one of my twins, like we\u2019ve been doing like these things where he pushed and we\u2019re doing inside control and trying to like get in good position, I told him how like I just want him to push and pull. I was like, \u201cWatch. When you pull right here, what happens is I step and then check it out. Now, we\u2019re not head to head. Now, you\u2019ve got a little angle on me. Now, it opens up a shot where you can actually get on my leg and you can take me down.\u201d</p> <p>And so for wrestling, that\u2019s the whole point is I\u2019m in there beating the trash out of the other dude\u2019s head trying to move him all with a hope that I can get a little bit of an angle. And as soon as I get that angle, as soon as it opens up, boom! Takedown\u2019s there and I can score.</p> <p>All right. So there is the metaphor. So, how does that relate to business? OK? So in business, I see so many people where when they say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to be in this business or this market.\u201d They pick what they want it to be. And then I think part of it is a disservice that I\u2019ve done because I talk a lot about funnel hacking. So they say, \u201cOK, this guy has got this.\u201d And they go and they make the exact same thing.</p> <p>Now, what just happened now that you got this new business? You\u2019ve just stepped up and you\u2019re head to head with someone. You got the exact same product, exact same offer, exact same everything as these guys. OK? And that\u2019s going to make it difficult. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t be successful. OK?</p> <p>There are some people \u2013 like for example, this week is actually the world tournament in Las Vegas for wrestling and there\u2019s an Olympic champ named Jordan Burroughs who has got the best double leg I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. And he can just plow through everybody like he\u2019s so dominant. Like this dude does box jumps higher than his head. He\u2019s got the strongest legs and hips and he just can plow through anybody. He doesn\u2019t even need an angle. Just boom! He\u2019s just taken you out, right?</p> <p>But for average humans and the majority of people, we got to have an angle, right? And so, the same thing for you, if you go head to head with someone, you have the exact same thing and you funnel hack them exactly, what just happened? Now, you\u2019re going up against someone else who if you funnel hack someone well, you\u2019re going to get some perfect competition and you can\u2019t \u2013 this could be hard for you to score to make money.</p> <p>And so, what I want you guys thinking about a little bit is the angle. What\u2019s your angle? What makes what you do different than what everybody else is doing? Okay? When I\u2019m funnel hacking someone, I\u2019m looking for a process. I\u2019m looking for price points. I\u2019m looking for things like that. I\u2019m looking for layout. But as soon as I figure that out, my next goal is how do I make mine different or better or more unique or what\u2019s my angle? What makes me \u2013 why is there a purpose for me to exist in this market that I\u2019m stepping into?</p> <p>I got a friend. His name is Mike Lovitch and Mike is one of the smartest dudes I\u2019ve ever met. He owns a company called RealDose and a bunch of other things. He owned a company called Hypnosis Network. I think he may still own that. I don\u2019t know. But he was the one when we trying to create weight loss offer back in the day and I was doing what I kind of do. I was like, \u201cOK, here\u2019s one that\u2019s successful. Let\u2019s model it.\u201d</p> <p>And he kind of made this really good point to me. He said, \u201cEvery market is kind of like its own little ecosystem.\u201d And if you look at an ecosystem, there\u2019s like \u2013 let\u2019s say it\u2019s weight loss. There is Mike Geary, he owns The Truth About Abs. Then over here is so and so and they own high fat. And over here, so and so, they own low fat. And over here is \u2013 you see these ecosystems, this little world. And if you come in and you got exact same thing with somebody else, suddenly, you\u2019re competing with them and if they\u2019ve got a bunch of partners, now you\u2019re competition to everybody, and nobody is going to let you in the cool kids\u2019 crowd.</p> <p>If you can come in and look around, look at the ecosystem and see where everybody is at and then figure out what\u2019s not being served? What\u2019s the message or the thing or the product or the service that nobody else has done or at least nobody else has done well? And that\u2019s how you find your angle. There you get it and you find that spot. And now, you look at all these other people in your ecosystem. Instead of you becoming head on head and direct competitors with them, because you\u2019ve got an angle, now you\u2019ve opened up partnerships with all of them.</p> <p>So, all of your potential competitors all become your potential partners. And that\u2019s a big key with this. So I want you guys thinking about that today, just really figuring out like what\u2019s your reason for existence in your ecosphere? The market you picked, where are you different? Why should someone care that you exist? And if you can\u2019t answer that, you need to start thinking about it more because right now, you\u2019re going head to head like I would in a wrestling match.</p> <p>And until I find that angle, I got to push and pull and move and just grind this guy until I can get a little bit of an angle, find my spot in the ecosystem and then boom. As soon as I do that, that\u2019s when growth explodes. That\u2019s when you start having tons of success very, very quickly is by finding that angle, finding the difference in your world, in your ecosystem, in your market and then blowing that up and exploiting it. That\u2019s where you have success quickly.</p> <p>So I want you guys thinking about that because I think it\u2019s really kind of the next evolution of funnel hacking. It\u2019s not just \u2013 funnel hacking is all about finding all those pieces, the proven success road model. Then the second step is now you coming back and saying, \u201cNow, OK. What\u2019s my angle? What makes me different than everybody else? Why should I exist?\u201d That\u2019s what you really got to start thinking about.</p> <p>So, I want to put that in your head today. I was thinking about when we launched ClickFunnels, out there in the market, there was a bunch of other people doing stuff similar. We had LeadPages, we had OptimizePress, we had Unbound and a bunch of different things.</p> <p>And so \u2013 in fact, our initial thing when we first started, Todd, my business partner in ClickFunnels, he was like, \u201cOh, we can clone ClickFunnels in a weekend. Like that\u2019s the easiest. Like I can literally, in a weekend we can have our LeadPages. We can literally clone LeadPages in a weekend and we could be going head to head with them.\u201d OK, that\u2019s cool.</p> <p>But now, we are like direct competitors like there\u2019s no differentiation. There\u2019s no \u2013 all these other things we missed. How do we \u2013 like what\u2019s our angle? What makes us different? What do we want to be? What do we want to be different? How do we \u2013 how can we serve this market better than anyone else has in a different way? And now, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 from those questions and from that conversation is where ClickFunnels was born.</p> <p>So that is my question for you. I want you to look around your ecosphere, the market that you\u2019re in or the market that you want to be in and let me know why you exist, why people should care about you. What\u2019s your angle? What\u2019s different? Because as soon as you figure that out, as soon as you figure out than angle, as long as it is a good angle, sometimes I get an angle on somebody that puts me in bad position then they take me down. That\u2019s not good either. You don\u2019t want a bad angle. As soon as you get the right angle, that\u2019s when you can score, that\u2019s when you can start growing your company quickly.</p> <p>And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same in most sports. I always think wrestling is the best, and it is. But I think most sports, I played football for a while. I played basketball. Like all those sports are the same thing, it\u2019s all about angles. Like if you don\u2019t have the angle, you\u2019re going straight on, it\u2019s hard to compete. But as soon as you figure out the angle, it changes everything.</p> <p>So, that\u2019s the message. That\u2019s the moral for today. Start thinking through that because that\u2019s going to help you guys to grow and differentiate yourself from everybody else.</p> <p>All right. With that said, I am almost to the office. I\u2019ve got an amazing day today. We got some cool stuff happening. I\u2019m working on the ClickFunnels 2.0 re-launch which is turning out so exciting, so amazing. I\u2019ve spent all night last night building out new affiliate center for ClickFunnels inside of ClickFunnels, which is exciting. If you guys haven\u2019t used the backpack plugin inside of ClickFunnels, it\u2019s pretty awesome. So we built out a whole affiliate center.</p> <p>And this weekend, I also went and I built out all my autoresponder sequences inside of Actionetics for all the DotComSecrets side of the business. Then today and tomorrow, I\u2019ll be building them out inside of the ClickFunnels side. So, pretty exciting. I\u2019m having a lot of fun with it. I\u2019m excited to be able to share Actionetics with you guys because it is amazing.</p> <p>If you ever look in the emails that have come out over the last three days from me, those are all ClickFunnels emails. And look how amazing they look, except for an iMac or was it Apple Mail? Apple Mail, out formatting is off. But everywhere else, we look amazing. So we\u2019ll get there. But I think you guys are excited to be able to play with it and see it. And you\u2019ll see how we\u2019ve taken the concept of autoresponders and then got our angle on like why is ours different, why is it better, how does our tool help you dominate people more than anybody else\u2019s?</p> <p>So you will see, my friends, you will see. Anyway, that\u2019s it for today you guys. Have an awesome day. Go out there figure out your angle and let\u2019s make some more money, serve some more people and have an awesome day.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day. I have a lot of cool stuff happening over here. It\u2019s been keeping me busy all day and all night and haven\u2019t had a ton of chance to share stuff with you guys so I want to jump on here.</p> <p>I\u2019m having a lot of fun with periscope though lately which has been really, really cool. And so, if you guys aren\u2019t periscoping yet, go do it, and if you\u2019re not following my periscope yet, now is the time. If you go to blog.dotcomsecrets.com, you can get all the old episodes of all my periscopes, all the Marketing In Your Car podcasts, everything good is there. So go check it out.</p> <p>All right. So for today, I had a really cool question that I wanted to kind of try to answer. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s like super easy to answer and maybe I\u2019ll do a follow-up podcast like this one time when my wife is in the car with me. Someone asked today on Facebook and said, \u201cRussell, how in the world you do all the stuff you\u2019re doing and you\u2019re wife still loves you?\u201d which is a good question.</p> <p>And again, it would definitely be good for her to chime in on this because she doesn\u2019t or maybe who knows. But I want to kind of share from my perspective some stuff because it\u2019s hard. I want to preface it by saying a quote from a guy named David O. McKay and he said that no success can compensate for failure in the home. And I do believe that. And so first and foremost before anything else, always remember that.</p> <p>That should be something we all print out and hang on our wall at the office so that we remember what the goal is, right? I\u2019ve seen people who have lost their marriages because of business, because they\u2019re trying to achieve this thing and because of that they miss out on their family and their spouse and all these other things. And so, that\u2019d be kind of a big initial thing to really make sure you have your priorities because that\u2019s the most important.</p> <p>I had a friend recently who was having some marital issues because of his business and he said, \u201cHow in the world does Collette let you do all this stuff all the time?\u201d And talked about how like they were having real, real struggles to the point where like this may not last forever. And I told him, I said, \u201cMan, if I were you, I\u2019d quit business then, because business is stupid. It doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s just this thing that we do to keep us busy throughout the day. The only thing that really matters is our family, is our wife, our spouses, and things like that.\u201d I\u2019m a big believer in that.</p> <p>So like if there ever a time that business comes between your family, you got to walk away from the business. I\u2019d rather go bankrupt than go through a divorce. That\u2019s like how I feel about it. And so, just know that that\u2019s the driving force.</p> <p>Now with that, like now that we\u2019ve got some ground rules. We know what\u2019s the most important thing is now and where our boundaries and how do we create boundaries that everyone is going to be OK with. So for me, this is a lot of learning and a lot of unhappy wife moments that have kind of brought me to this spot now, where I feel like we\u2019re really in a good spot where things are happening.</p> <p>And so, I want to kind of share some of the insights that I\u2019ve got. So maybe I\u2019ll have Collette come on some time and share some of her insights because they\u2019re probably the opposite of what mine are.</p> <p>But one of them is, depending on where you are in your life right now, is picking the right spouse. I\u2019m a big believer in you can only be as successful as your spouse will allow you to be.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got friends who are great entrepreneurs who flat out, their spouses weren\u2019t OK with the time away. And because of that, they had to quit and not do what they wanted to do. And so, a lot of it is in the selection of your spouse ahead of time.</p> <p>Now, that\u2019s not everything, which is good because I don\u2019t think my wife by default right out of the gate was probably that way. In fact, we had early on had a lot of issues where I think I drove her nuts but she \u2013 I did pick an amazing woman. I told her and I believe this deeply that if I had married any of the other girls that I dated in my past, I don\u2019t think that this company and what I do would have been possible. It wouldn\u2019t have.</p> <p>She was the only one that I could have married that would have made it so that I could \u2013 she was the only one that was like OK with me gambling and risking time and energy and money on crazy ideas and not tear me down because of it. And just be OK like, \u201cHey, if we\u2019re broke, I don\u2019t really care. I just want to hang out with you.\u201d That was kind of her attitude. That was a big part.</p> <p>Another big thing for me is she has to be aware of my schedule. I used to be at the point where I\u2019d be working and all of a sudden it would like 8:00 o\u2019clock and then I call her, \u201cOh, sorry I\u2019m late. I\u2019m going to be pulling an all-nighter tonight,\u201d which wass really, really bad. But if I tell her in advance, far enough in advance like if I say, \u201cHey, later \u2013 next week, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Todd and Dylan are flying to town. We\u2019re going to have a hack-a-thon, you\u2019re not going to see me those nights.\u201d And as long as she knows that in advance so she could prepare for it, she is usually OK with that. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t love it but she is OK with that.</p> <p>I also try to be very particular on those days when I\u2019m gone a lot like all the guys are going out to eat, I\u2019m not going to go out to eat with them. I\u2019m going to race home and try to spend an hour or two with her and the kids just showing that I\u2019m there and that I care and because that\u2019s important. That\u2019s key. If everything is just focused on the business is not a good thing for anyone. So that\u2019s a big part of it.</p> <p>Another big part for me and I know this doesn\u2019t work in all relationships. A lot of people, their spouses are intimately involved in the business, some aren\u2019t. With me, my wife is not intimately involved with it. And I think that honestly, that has kind of served me as a good thing where she \u2013 it\u2019s separate. Like there\u2019s a big separation from the two. And so, I\u2019m able to kind of run the business the way that I see fit and she runs the home the way she sees fit.</p> <p>And because of that, we kind of each \u2013 like we have our roles in it. And as long as I don\u2019t do anything stupid that affects what she is doing, she is pretty much fine with most things. Even when our business had ups and downs, one thing that I tried to remain consistent is I needed to have her \u2013 for her to have certainty. And certainty is such an important thing for most people especially women.</p> <p>And so, everything else \u2013 my entire world was collapsing around me. I was firing people left and right. I was doing whatever I could to save it, I was working all those times but I was very consistent to make sure that it didn\u2019t affect her, which isn\u2019t always possible but I make sure that she was making the same amount \u2013 has consistently like I didn\u2019t want to lose that. And that was a big thing for her. And so, she didn\u2019t feel the brunt of a lot of that which made it OK. That was a big thing.</p> <p>I think another big part for spouses is like having belief and faith that the sacrifice you\u2019re putting is going to be worth it. And I think you are really making sure that it\u2019s something that they want as well. I think that some of the issues my wife and I had earlier on in our marriage were about that where I had these goals. I was trying to get stuff. And she \u2013 and one day I came home and I was like stressed and she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013 like those things don\u2019t matter to me. I just want you to come home and be with us and with the kids. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p> <p>And when I understood that. I was like, \u201cWow! I\u2019m doing these things\u2026\u201d I feel like in my head, \u201cI\u2019m doing this thing for you and for the family.\u201d And the reality is you\u2019re doing it for the most part for yourself if you\u2019re completely honest. And so, just being very aware of that making sure that you\u2019re doing things for the family and not just for yourself is a big piece of that.</p> <p>So anyway, those are a couple of different ideas that hopefully will help a little bit. Obviously, it\u2019s not everything. There are a lot more things. But hopefully, that kind of gets you thinking in the right direction. I\u2019ll do a follow-up on this next time I\u2019m driving with my wife and get her feedback from her corner and see what she says as well.</p> <p>So, I\u2019m at my daughter\u2019s soccer practice now and I\u2019m watching her. She is amazing this year. She has been really fun to see. So, I\u2019m going to watch her for a while and then I will get back home for dinner.</p> <p>So I appreciate you guys listening in. I hope you got something of value for today. And we will talk to you guys all again soon.

This is Russell Brunson and I want to welcome you to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey, everyone. I hope you have been having an amazing time. We\u2019ve been pumping a lot of content and having fun with it. I hope you guys have been enjoying it. If you haven\u2019t seen it and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat are you talking about, Russell? All I know about is your podcast,\u201d go to blog.dotcomsecrets.com and you will start seeing all this stuff.</p> <p>We got Periscopes happening during the days. We got Marketing in Your Car in the morning. We got cool blog posts. We got a whole bunch of value we\u2019re giving out to the world because we want to change your life, your company, your business and help you touch more people. So that\u2019s kind of our game plan and we\u2019re having fun doing it.</p> <p>And today, I want to talk about, \u201cRussell, why are you doing all this content? What is the point? What\u2019s the purpose? Why in the world are you doing this?\u201d And I had a conversation with one of my friends last night. He was over wrestling in the wrestling room. So as you know, I just built my own wrestling room at my house. So we were wrestling. We\u2019re having a good time. And we\u2019ve been talking about stuff afterwards.</p> <p>And he runs an Amazon business and he just got the Amazon slap. And I was kind of joking about the slaps that I had gone through since I got started 12 years ago. The initial Google slap crumbled almost everyone I knew. Then you got like 18 different SEO Google slaps, Facebook slaps, merchant account slaps. I\u2019ve been through quite a few slaps in my day. So now when they happen, I\u2019m just like, \u201cYeah, all right. What\u2019s the next thing?\u201d</p> <p>So this year, like we were killing it with Facebook stuff and then boom! We got the Facebook slap. And we are still doing well with Facebook but it\u2019s not like it was pre January. So, it\u2019s just kind of those things that most people, it happens and they freak out and they run away because it\u2019s like the whole world is coming to an end.</p> <p>But for me, because I\u2019ve been on the cycle enough times, it\u2019s kind of like sitting in the ocean, the waves go up and down and up and down and there\u2019s the ups and the downs and you\u2019re just going to ride the wave and not give up and keep your eyes open for like what\u2019s the next trend. What\u2019s the next thing happening? Where do we need to be focusing our time, energy, and all that kind of stuff?</p> <p>And I really think, and I\u2019ve kind of mentioned this before but, I think that the future of marketing online is\u2026 and I hate saying this because my friend, Justin Brook has been telling me this years and I keep telling him, I just keep teasing him. But unfortunately, he is right. I look at what the advertising platforms want. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to look at because we want to be leveraging their audiences and we look at what they want.</p> <p>Now what we want is we want to drive people to registration pages and opt-in pages and things like that, right? That\u2019s our goal. Their goal is not to allow us to do that. Their goal is to deliver an amazing experience to their audience. They want us paying to show their people amazing content, which is funny. Anyway, it\u2019s just kind of funny.</p> <p>So right now with Facebook, we\u2019ve seen that. We\u2019ve seen that with other networks like Google, like \u2013 and you see the kind of the more native advertising networks nowadays which are all like you\u2019re driving to content, to articles, and things like that. And I believe that within a year from now, not everywhere but for most places, it would be very, very difficult to drive directly to a registration page. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the model anymore.</p> <p>I think what the model would be is we have to find our voice. This comes back to everything I talked about in the DotComSecrets book, creating your attractive character, figuring out your voice, learning how to communicate with your audience, and putting those messages out there and finding kind of your style and then becoming a prolific content writer or if you\u2019re not a writer, it can be videos, it can be Periscope, it could be audio, it could podcasts. You do whatever you want.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t think that most people should do like 50 different platforms. I\u2019m just doing a lot because I\u2019ve got a big team so I\u2019m able to do more than most people. But for most of you guys, like you should pick a platform and say, \u201cI\u2019m a video guy. I\u2019m an audio guy.\u201d Whatever you are, pick that thing and start producing consistent amazing content and then use that content as a tool to wrap people back to your core offer. So push people to your registration pages, you push people to your opt-in forms, your applications, whatever it may be because that\u2019s where they will allow you to buy ads.</p> <p>I believe that \u2013 my guess is that within a year from now, it will be next to impossible to get anything approved in Google unless it\u2019s you promoting a blog post. That\u2019s it. I think that\u2019s the future.</p> <p>And so knowing that now, man, like why in the world would I wait until that happens? Now is the time to jump on that. And so, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it. And so my goal on my side is I\u2019m trying to do three blog posts a week and three podcasts and then a Periscope five days a week. And it has given me the ability to create stuff and touch people in different ways. But the cool thing is, not only am I just doing that to put it out there\u2026 like I\u2019m adding content to the blog which is one thing, but now I\u2019ve got the ability to take that content and promote it out through a lot of places.</p> <p>If you look at the way we structure our blog, when I do my blog posts I have this really cool sketches, similar to these sketches that were inside the DotComSecrets book. Now, I can leverage these sketches on Facebook, I can put them on Instagram, Twitter, all these things like that. Now, I\u2019m finding each of the platforms like how they want to accept content and then I\u2019m using the content I\u2019m putting out there in that way, if that makes sense.</p> <p>I read about kind of this concept a little bit in Gary Vaynerchuk\u2019s book, I think it\u2019s Punch, Punch, Jab or Jab, Jab, Punch or I don\u2019t know, something like that. But he talked about looking at \u2013 what does Facebook want? What does Instagram want? What do all these different networks want? You got to figure out what they want and you got to tweak your content to match that and then put it out there. And then when the content is in that native platform and you\u2019re able to promote it and drive traffic and all those kinds of things and you get people to then raise their hand and click and listen and participate and then eventually come and push them to what you really want them to do.</p> <p>And so for me, I\u2019m looking at \u2013 I think in the future is I will never be able to promote a webinar registration page. But I will promote amazing content which will drive people to opt in and then my entire opt-in sequence where we push people to the webinar registration. Like in my mind, that\u2019s the future. That\u2019s where everything is going. And so now, not tomorrow, not six months from now, now is the time to start that path. And we have started it. We\u2019re moving forward and that\u2019s where our focus, our energy, and our money and our time is going into.</p> <p>So, it\u2019s interesting. If you listen to some of the past podcasts, I talked about funnel stacking. If you look at my business, I\u2019ve got my book funnel which then leads to my webinar funnel which leads to my high ticket funnel. I\u2019m stacking multiple funnels together. But I look this content thing as like a pre-funnel.</p> <p>In fact, I have this little diagram, I\u2019ll probably have a blog post about it soon, but it looks like\u2026 I have my little value ladder but then it drops one step down from the value ladder and it\u2019s like one rung lower then where most people normally start, and that\u2019s the content site. That\u2019s putting those things out there to then get people in and then start sending them up through your value ladder.</p> <p>So, that\u2019s kind of cool. A good cast study of it is, yesterday I did a Periscope during the middle of the day\u2026 talking about the new coaching application funnel I just built out and how I\u2019m kind of excited it was done and how we are giving away $25,000 to somebody for building out their breakeven funnel, and I kind of just talked about that...</p> <p>In Periscope, I clicked the button.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never put it on a Periscope. I didn\u2019t even know how people find out about my thing. I think it\u2019s Twitter-based but I\u2019m not positive. Yeah, probably.</p> <p>So anyway, so I had a hundred people show up on Periscope which was awesome. And then I started talking and I just showed the application form on my phone. Next thing we knew, we got about ten applications almost instantly, which for me we average about between $1,300 and $1,400 per application. So I just made $13,000 with me doing a really quick Periscope post.</p> <p>But then I took that video and we then put it on Facebook and then started promoting it. And then this morning, we got another around 10, 15, 20 applications from that and it was me promoting a Periscope, which then led back to my other offerings. So it was kind of interesting I think.</p> <p>And again, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. So create cool content. Inside the content, you push people back to the front of your value ladders into the, whatever you want to call them, the welcome gates, entry gates, the step one into entering your world. And that\u2019s kind of how it works.</p> <p>So anyway, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. That\u2019s what I think you guys should be doing. And hopefully, that will help give you guys a glimpse into what I believe the future is and where we\u2019re putting our time, our energy, and our money and our effort because I\u2019ve been doing this rollercoaster ride for a long time and I think that\u2019s where the shift will be for the next two or three years. And so, I want to be there first and I want you guys to be there first as well.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I got. Hope you guys had an amazing time. By the way, if you would like to be one of our \u2013 if you like to have the chance to win the $25,000 with our funnel build out contest, go to DotComSecretsIgnite.com.

This is Russell Brunson and we are back to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right, all right. Before you make fun of me, I\u2019m not riding my bike today. It was really hard. It took me 25 minutes to get to the office and then on the way home I wasn\u2019t recording. So I was just cranking as fast as I could. It took me 18 minutes to get back home. So it was quite a workout and today, my legs are sore. Old Man Brunson is taking the easy way. So I\u2019m driving today.</p> <p>All right. So I think the last two podcasts, I\u2019ve kind of gone on little rants because I wanted to go on little rants. Today I\u2019m waking up in a good mood and so I am going to \u2013 not go on a rant. We\u2019re going to have some fun.</p> <p>So I do want to \u2013 hopefully give you something that will give you some value that I\u2019ve been thinking about and I want you to understand and hopefully every business owner who\u2019s listening to this understand that right now, like you\u2019re doing your business. You\u2019re doing your job. You\u2019re doing what you\u2019re good at and my guess is that you\u2019re making some money and you\u2019re excited and you\u2019re like this is awesome and \u2013 but the problem is that if you were to stop for a second and stop looking at what you\u2019re doing and look up and then look around really quick, there are piles of cash all around you that you just have to go grab and pick up and that would be your money as well. It\u2019s just sitting there. It\u2019s just like boom, there\u2019s cash.</p> <p>But you\u2019re not grabbing it because you\u2019re so focused on doing the thing. So let me give you some real world examples that happened to me this week so you can kind of understand this. So the first one was our lawn guys and we got \u2013 we moved into our new house. We got a ridiculously oversized yard, we\u2019re on five acres and like two of the acres is kind of like a field but three of the acres are our home and all this stuff and grass.</p> <p>So these guys come once a week and they mow it and it takes two guys like three hours to mow, plus a bunch of dudes doing like the edging and stuff, right? And next \u2013 like next two are the same thing but like two acres of our thing is unfinished. It\u2019s kind of like just whatever field and because of that, like the field grows and it\u2019s like a nightmare and it\u2019s like all these weeds, right? So my wife was like, \u201cHey, can you guys mow that?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no you wouldn\u2019t want us to mow that. You should just go get a field mower and do it yourself,\u201d and we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want to do it ourselves. Like we hire lawn people so they do it for us,\u201d and these guys are like no, like just \u2013 like just go to \u2013 whatever the rental place. You can rent something like for a hundred bucks and you can do it.</p> <p>So first time, I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know what? That will be fun. I will just whatever. It would be good for me to like do some manual labor.\u201d So I go down to Tate\u2019s Rental and I rent the thing for 100 bucks. I bring it back. I spend three hours. I mow the whole lawn and we had a good time and it was nice, right?</p> <p>So now, a month and a half later, weeds are as high as me again and guess what I do not want to do. I don\u2019t want to do it again. I want to pay someone. In fact, I would love to pay the people that we hire to do my lawn to do my field right next door and I was thinking about like what I would be willing to pay for that. I think like conservatively, I would pay an extra $1000 a month to have these guys do that.</p> <p>Once a month they come and just knock out the field, right? So I was thinking like how much profit would that be for them. So it\u2019s like if they have to go rent because they don\u2019t have a field mower which is their excuse why they don\u2019t want to do it, right? We don\u2019t have a field mower.</p> <p>So they would have to go to Tate\u2019s like I did and rent it for $100. So one-tenth of the profit going to fulfillment cost. They have to pay someone for three hours of work to do it. So you\u2019re looking at \u2013 they probably pay their guys 12 bucks an hour so they pay them $10, $20, $30, $36. So you\u2019re in $136 and from that, you\u2019re going to make 800 and whatever. I can\u2019t do math while I\u2019m driving. I don\u2019t want to get in a wreck that way. Whatever that difference is, almost 900 bucks in pure profit just by picking up the cash that\u2019s sitting there, right?</p> <p>But instead they told me like, \u201cNo, you should just do it. No, go do it. Go do it.\u201d All right. So there\u2019s example number one but it gets worse because they\u2019re not the only ones. Almost every company is doing this.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve ranted before about our pool companies which we\u2019re trying to get to come help us, right? I think pool companies are the worst. I don\u2019t know. Anyway, so the pool dude is at our house and my wife is like, \u201cHey, our slide is not right. We want to pay someone to come and fix this. Do you guys do that?\u201d</p> <p>And the guy is like, \u201cYeah, we could do that but all you got to do is go to the store and buy some Epoxy and just slap it on there and it will be fine.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want to do that. Can we hire you guys to do that?\u201d The guy is like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s really easy. Just go and get some Epoxy and you can slap it on the thing,\u201d and he\u2019s trying to explain to her how to do it. So after three times of her asking if we can give him money, and he rejecting us, telling us how we can do it ourselves, but we don\u2019t want to do it ourselves. We got no desire to do it ourselves. We want to give somebody money to do it. Why don\u2019t you like money? After three times, she quit bugging him because she can tell like he\u2019s getting annoyed because we can\u2019t figure out how to do it ourselves. OK?</p> <p>Your company is a pool company. We give you money every week to come and clean our pool. We would love to give you money to do this as well. Money is just sitting there. They could just pick it up, they\u2019re not.</p> <p>Okay. Now, they come once a week and clean our pools, right? So then I come home from the office the other day. There\u2019s a big note on the door because we weren\u2019t there and it says, \u201cHey, so we were cleaning your pool and we noticed that the filters are dirty and they\u2019re probably old. So you need to go pick up some new filters and install them. That way, it will keep the pool cleaner.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, does anyone see an issue here? You\u2019re the freaking pool company! You should be the ones going and getting the filters and putting them in and charging me for it! I would love to give you money. Do you think I have any idea first off where the pool filters are in the pool, second off, where to buy the pool filters, third off, how to like unscrew the thing and install the things? Like no! I want to give you money. You are the pool company. I hired you to do pool things for me.</p> <p>I want you just to take care of it and bill me for it. But instead there\u2019s a big stack of money that you could just take. You explain to me in a handwritten note how I should go and change the filters. Come on!</p> <p>Anyway, those are like three crazy examples. I still can\u2019t even fathom. Like, if the entrepreneur in these companies knew what their employees were doing, they would roll over in their graves, right?</p> <p>If they\u2019re alive, they would shoot themselves and then roll over in their graves because they would be so upset at how much money they can make if their stupid employees would just grab it. Like just take it. It\u2019s right there.</p> <p>All right. Man, this turned into a rant too. Maybe this is the Russell Rant Show. Anyway, I\u2019m hoping that this is a benefit to you because I promise you, in your business right now, you as the entrepreneur or the employees on your team are probably leaving money, stacks of cash that people would love to give you and in fact they probably tried to give it to you and your employees have told them no or maybe you\u2019ve done it.</p> <p>Maybe you\u2019re like, \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t do stuff like that.\u201d Someone hires you to build a funnel and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, can you write copy for me?\u201d I don\u2019t write copy. I\u2019m above copy.</p> <p>Okay, maybe you should charge them for copy and find a copywriter to do it and make some money on the spread. How many places are you just leaving stacks of cash? So I want to encourage you guys over this next week while you\u2019re doing what you do to pay the bills, to slow down and stop. Look around and just look around all the piles of cash that\u2019s sitting there and be like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s one right there.\u201d</p> <p>These people would probably love to give me more money if I help serve them a little bit more. OK? People always get upset \u2013 not always but there are people who get upset about upsells and trying to ascend people up through their funnel and I don\u2019t get that.</p> <p>If you think about it, if you\u2019re providing more value for your customers, your customers will be ecstatic to give you more money. Okay? I went to the dentist and he told me that my teeth were crooked. I need a retainer. I was ecstatic to give him money because it meant that my teeth were going to get clean. It wasn\u2019t that I was annoyed that he was trying to sell me something. He was giving me more value. OK? And I promise you guys that there are things you can do in your business right now to give your customer more value and they will give you big old fat stacks of cash.</p> <p>The cool thing about that kind of cash is that kind of cash is all profit. Okay? Because you don\u2019t have to go pay for an ad. You don\u2019t have to go drive new people. You don\u2019t have to convince them or sell them or anything. All you have to do is be smart enough to look and see it and then be like, \u201cHey, you want me to help you there?\u201d Yes, that would be fantastic. I would love for you to help me there. You want me to help you there? Yes! And it becomes really easy.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my gift for you guys this week is for you to pause, step back, look around at all the piles of cash sitting around you and just go take them. They want you to take them. They\u2019re begging you to take them.</p> <p>My wife and I are so upset these guys won\u2019t take our money. We\u2019re trying to find other people to take our money because the people we hired to take our money won\u2019t take our money. That\u2019s the reality of the world we live in. They want you to take their money. So just take it. OK? You\u2019re doing yourself a favor. You\u2019re doing them a favor and the whole world will be more happy because of it.</p> <p>All right. There you go guys. I\u2019m at the office. I appreciate you guys. Have a fantastic day. Look for the piles of cash. Because they\u2019re there just waiting for you to pick them up. I appreciate you guys and talk soon.</p>", "duration": "09:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_147.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1440617489, "title": "Episode #146 \u2013 Don\u2019t Sell To Broke People", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This is the FIRST marketing on your bike podcast! \ud83d\ude42</p> <p>On today\u2019s special episode Russell rides his bike to work and talks about why you shouldn\u2019t sell to people who are broke.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to the first ever Marketing On Your Bike. Yes, you guys, today I am riding my bike to the office and doing our podcast at the same time. Hopefully, the wind is not too loud.</p> <p>Hi, everyone. So, I\u2019m excited for today. I\u2019ve been wanting to ride my bike to the office for as long as I had a bike which has been like a week. So it\u2019s happening today. I have no idea how long it\u2019s going to take to get there but we\u2019re going to find out here in a minute.</p> <p>My wife is convinced that I\u2019m going to die today. In fact, she had all the kids gave me a hug and a kiss before I left because she thought I was going to be dead. Mostly, because I don\u2019t want to wear a helmet and I\u2019m sure that some of you guys out there are \u2013 whoa! I\u2019m out of shape already. Some of you guys are very safety conscious people. But from my house to the office is one street, one long street and it\u2019s all back roads.</p> <p>And so, I don\u2019t want to wear a helmet. I am not going to lie. So if I die, that\u2019s why you guys will be witnessed to that. So anyway, I\u2019m not wearing a helmet today. I\u2019ll see how bad it is and maybe I will wear it tomorrow but yeah. This is harder than I thought it was going to be, to talk while riding while carrying a backpack of stuff. But it\u2019s all good.</p> <p>Okay, so today, a couple of things, last night I did a podcast. I was talking about Periscope and how excited I was and how I\u2019m going to post in that platform. And then literally an hour later, we got approved by Facebook for their Facebook Mentions Product. Did you guys see that? My wife just drove by. She\u2019s dropping the kids off. She said, \u201cNo texting while you\u2019re biking.\u201d Oh man, she thinks I\u2019m crazy.</p> <p>Anyway, so I got home and I got approved in the Facebook\u2019s Mentions Program which means according to Facebook, I am officially a celebrity. So with their Mention Program, you can use their \u2013 I guess you get like a blue checkmark saying that you\u2019re a celebrity. And then on top of that, you also get to use their platform where you\u2019re... it\u2019s kind of Periscope but for Facebook.</p> <p>So, I now got access to that, which my Facebook following is way more larger and more prominent than my Twitter following. So anyway, I\u2019m going to try some things on that too and we\u2019ll kind of see what happens between Mention and Periscope and it will be fun.</p> <p>So today, my message for you guys is that\u2026 I\u2019ve got to figure out how to pause this so I don\u2019t die at the light up here\u2026 Anyway, my message for you guys today is, don\u2019t sell things to broke people. And that\u2019s it. You guys can take that and you gain today what you needed to know. No. Hold on. I\u2019m switching hands with the phone. One second here.</p> <p>All right. So, it\u2019s funny. If you look at my business, if you read the DotComSecrets book, you know about this. I talked about how a few years ago, I realized I was not in love with my current clients. And the real reason why is we were selling stuff to people who are broke. We were in the how to start a business online business and we were selling \u2013 we were helping start a business. And our typical package is almost $5,000. And we sold a lot. We sold tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of that.</p> <p>But the problem was like most of these of people who are were coming to us like they didn\u2019t have money to start a business. And as you know and I know, business is not some make believe thing. It\u2019s something you have to build and create and it takes money and capital and time and energy and work. Weird\u2026you have to work.</p> <p>In fact, I remember at one of my events back then, there were these guys there. And two older guys and we were talking about everything and they\u2019re in the office in Boise. And basically I told them what they had to do. I\u2019m like, \u201cGuys, you have to create something. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d And the guy literally told me, \u201cWell, I got into this to get rich quick. And if I have to make something, I don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d This was what the guy told me. I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re only here to get rich quick and if you can\u2019t then you don\u2019t want to try.\u201d I was just like blown away.</p> <p>So, that was my reality for four, five years. And then we shut the call center down. We stopped selling high end coaching and we kind of walked away from that. And then when I wrote \u2013 in the DotComSecrets book, I talked about this, how like I realized my biggest problem was\u2026 it was like my dream customer... I was getting the wrong customers, customers I didn\u2019t want. And people first of all couldn\u2019t afford. But then the people who can\u2019t afford it \u2013 what I found like there\u2019s a reason why they can\u2019t afford it typically. And then obviously, there is an exception to every rule. People have hard times. There\u2019s a lot of stuff like that.</p> <p>But the vast majority of people who can\u2019t afford to invest in your program, they can\u2019t afford to invest in your program because of something outside of just like, \u201cI need to make more money or whatever.\u201d Like typically, they are struggling with a whole bunch of stuff. They got other underlying issues that got them there typically. Like these guys from the event who basically didn\u2019t want to make money. Let\u2019s just get rich quick. We don\u2019t want to work that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.</p> <p>Anyway, so when we did re-launch our coaching program two years ago, we jacked up the prices. It started at $8,000. We raised it to $10,000 then we raised it to $12,000. That\u2019s our lowest right now. Then we have our $25,000 and then we have our $100,000. And what happened by raising our prices is it naturally weeded out all the people who couldn\u2019t afford it. And what was really interesting to me is that when I did that, all of my headaches disappeared almost, not all of them. But I think 99% of my problem clients couldn\u2019t afford it and they were gone.</p> <p>And it was amazing. Like last year\u2019s coaching event, amazing. Most of my coaching clients have me on Voxer so they can ask me questions. And they are like good people who have businesses, who are successful, who are trying to grow them and scale them.</p> <p>And so, that was my reality. And I was just like, \u201cMan, people are amazing. Everyone works hard. Everyone gets it.\u201d It\u2019s funny. I think we had two refunds in the last two years from our coaching program and both of them we from people who joined at the $12,000 level and had to have payment plans. They couldn\u2019t afford it. And I\u2019m about to have a talk with my sales guys today because I kind of have of this re-awakening and re-epiphany that if someone can\u2019t write a check to join the coaching program flat out, no payments, they can\u2019t write a check, they\u2019re not a good fit for the program. And I\u2019m recommending for you guys the same thing. If someone can\u2019t afford to pay you like don\u2019t sell to broke people.</p> <p>So again, I\u2019ve forgotten this lesson. We did our funnel hacking event earlier this year. And we wanted to sell certification program and give people the ability to learn ClickFunnels but also learn how to go and sell ClickFunnels and make a lot of money as a certified funnel consultant, right?</p> <p>And so, when we did it, we decided like I wanted a lot of people here so we can have a good community and stuff like that, so let\u2019s lower the prices from our typical $12,000 and let\u2019s give people access for I think it was like $3,500 bucks for one person or five grand for two. So, at $3,500 if you \u2013 whatever.</p> <p>And then because I love these people so much and I want to serve them in the best way possible, OK, let\u2019s do this for a week. And in that week, we\u2019ll teach them everything. We\u2019ll teach them funnel strategy, how to use ClickFunnels, how to sell ClickFunnels. Let\u2019s bring our top salespeople in and let\u2019s bring people that do our videos and showing them how we our video. Let\u2019s show them everything we got and let\u2019s serve these guys at the highest level possible.</p> <p>And so, we sold certification program, a bunch of people come in. And again for the most part, amazing experience.</p> <p>Then this morning, I get a Facebook message from one of the guys who was there and this guy \u2013 his comment illustrates exactly what I\u2019m talking about like why you should not sell to broke people. And again, it comes back to they\u2019re broke for a reason. That\u2019s honestly my opinion.</p> <p>So, in the Facebook message, he thanks me for the event, tells me it was great and then explained why he\u2019s not going to ask for a refund, which is like day one, wrong mindset. Anyway, so it was like from step one like his mind is wrong. He\u2019s trying to convince himself why he shouldn\u2019t ask for a refund. This is why he\u2019s not successful in life\u2026like flat out. So there\u2019s number one.</p> <p>And then he goes on to say that three of the days were amazing and life-changing and so awesome for him but two days were a complete waste of his time and that\u2019s why he wanted to ask for his money back because two of the days, we weren\u2019t entertaining enough for him or whatever.</p> <p>And one of the days he complained about by the way was sales. So I had my top sales guy, someone who in the first quarter of this year, so from January to March, sold $1.2 million worth of funnel services. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a human being on earth who sold more funnel stuff than this guy. He came and he spoke for three and a half hours showing our sales scripts, doing live training, closing people live in front of the whole room, and showing how he generated $1.2 million in three months selling funnel services for me. OK. It\u2019s probably something I should teach in a funnel certification program, wouldn\u2019t you think? Trying to teach people how to be funnel consultants?</p> <p>Now, I want to caveat this with, most of the people in the room got it. They\u2019re not morons. They saw the value. In fact, one of the guys who is in the $12,000 program, he came. He has done like two or three calls with Robbie and then went through it again. He said, \u201cMan, every time I do this, I get more value, more insight.\u201d He said, \u201cThat was so valuable for me, to come and hear Robbie do it again live. I\u2019ve probably seen that presentation ten times or variation of it and done three or four calls with Robbie and still like \u2013 that alone was worth the trip.\u201d</p> <p>So this guy tells me \u2013 so, this is the guy that Facebooks me, \u201cRussell, I\u2019m broke. I couldn\u2019t afford the $3,000, let alone, a week from my family. But I made the sacrifice and I came and then I wasted half a day listening to some guy talking about sales. I didn\u2019t come here to learn sales. I came here to learn to be funnel consultant.\u201d And I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I hope he listens to my podcast because this is for you if you are listening because you got to fix your brain. This is why you\u2019re not having success right now in life \u2013 in any area of your life. It\u2019s all tied back to the same thing.</p> <p>The reason why $3,000 is hard for you, it be might be expensive and all stuff for you is because you don\u2019t know how to sell. Do you not understand that? That session was specifically created for you. OK? If you can\u2019t afford the $3,000 to be here and you\u2019re complaining about the sales section, that\u2019s why you\u2019re struggling in life because you don\u2019t know how to sell. It\u2019s the only thing that matters in this whole game.</p> <p>You actually building the funnel does not matter\u2026 like you can hire someone for a couple of hundred bucks to build the funnel. You being able to sell it is the only thing that matters. OK?</p> <p>Now, I want to talk to you about another guy who is in the certification program in the same room and listening to the same presentations, but someone who has been successful all aspects of his life, has multimillion dollar business, was in the room because \u2013 and again, someone who doesn\u2019t want to necessarily build funnels but he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in that room for a week because I know that Russell is going to be dropping tons of hints and gold and bombs and things that I can use in tons of different areas of my life. I have no idea where. I understand that some sessions are not going to be for me but there are going to be some gold nuggets there.\u201d</p> <p>So this guy sitting in the session, someone who did not want \u2013 who has a whole team who sells, everything, still shows up, still participates and gets value out of every session, little things for him or people on his team or for whatever. And he also understands that sometimes some sessions aren\u2019t for you. And instead of whining and complaining, realizing that there are hundred other people in the room that we are also trying to serve beside you. You\u2019re not the only person on earth.</p> <p>So he gets it. He goes through the training, comes back and on Tuesday, posted on a Facebook group how based on one thing that he learned from Robbie\u2019s presentation, he called someone up and sold a $12,000 funnel. Boom! Three X\u2019d his money instantly because why? First off, he was there to try to figure out like the one or two little nuggets he needed to amplify what he was doing.</p> <p>Second off, he paid attention every session. Even though he may not have wanted to listen to the sales session, he paid attention. And then holy crap! There\u2019s some value there.</p> <p>And then third off, he went home and instead of spending an hour Facebooking me the reason why he wasn\u2019t going to ask for a refund, he freaking picked up the phone and sold somebody like we taught you.</p> <p>Anyway, it blows my mind sometimes and it kind of re-reminding me the reason why we don\u2019t sell to broke people. This guy I believed had to do payment plan to come in and all that stuff. And I get that. And there\u2019s a time and a place. But for me and my company, I don\u2019t want to deal with people like that. I want to deal with people who get it. I look at my $12,000 clients. They\u2019re easy to work with. They work hard. They don\u2019t complain. They are moving forward and they\u2019re using us as a guide to give them ideas and tips and move in the right way.</p> <p>People come in at $5,000 or $3,000, they\u2019re basically, at least in my world, expecting you to hand them a business in a box that prints out cash as oppose to, \u201cTeach me how to build a business that will print out cash.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s just a big reminder to me. When we do certification program next year, we\u2019ll probably going to, I don\u2019t know, three, four, five times the price. Have a smaller group to weed out the tire kickers and weed out people who are broke and only focus on the higher level people because I look at the few complainers we had and all of them are broke. That\u2019s it. That was the only commonality in them is they were broke.</p> <p>And again, while there are some people that \u2013 there are circumstances in life that caused people to do that. And nine times out of ten, from my experience, I\u2019ve been doing this for 12 years now, is that the people who are broke, they are broke because their minds are broke. Their mindsets wrong. They are making decisions and doing things and approaching life the wrong way. And until they fix that, never going to be successful, OK?</p> <p>Until this dude can sit in the room and listen to a guy who did $1.2 million in funnel sales in three months and say, \u201cMan, there is value there for me. I\u2019m going to listen to him and I\u2019m going to go and freaking apply what I learned,\u201d as opposed to messaging me and trying to convince me or try to explain why he\u2019s not going to ask for a refund. And until he can change his mindset, he will never be successful.</p> <p>My bet, I\u2019m prophesying, I\u2019ll get a message from him sometime in the next 30 days after he had not picked up the phone, he has not sold a funnel, he hasn\u2019t done a single thing we taught him, has not listened or applied, which is probably the pattern in most of his life, I\u2019ll get a message from him in the next 30 days asking for a refund because now it\u2019s going to be my fault he did not success as opposed to him paying attention, taking ownership for himself, which is again, another commonality between people who are successful and those who aren\u2019t.</p> <p>So, for you guys listening, whoa! I\u2019m out of breath. This is hard to ride a bike and talk on the phone and not get killed at the same time. But I\u2019m impressed I\u2019ve been doing this so far.</p> <p>So here\u2019s the value for everyone listening in. OK? If you are broke right now, that\u2019s OK. But the reason why you\u2019re probably broke, my guess is that you look for external reasons to figure out why you\u2019re broke. This guy is looking for external reasons. You need to look internally. It\u2019s you. I couldn\u2019t say it any nicer. It\u2019s not me. It\u2019s you. OK? You got to understand that.</p> <p>Until you take ownership of yourself, until you quit trying to make these mistakes, until you stop spending an hour writing an email trying to convince or explain to me why you\u2019re not asking for a refund and freaking do that work, get out there, pick up the phone and start dialing. Do the process that I showed you like eight times in Boise. Go find someone you can serve, work for them for free, build a funnel, blow their minds with it, with the value you can provide someone then take that case study, showing what you did, how you served someone, what the results were you got from them, and then find other business owners like them and then sell that process to them. That\u2019s how you become a millionaire.</p> <p>And if something breaks in the process, you can\u2019t look external for somebody to blame. The only person to blame is yourself. It\u2019s you, not them. The process is simple. Guys, if you want to sum what the whole certification event was, that\u2019s what it was. Find the market you want to be in. So I want serve chiropractors. Find a local chiropractor that you believe in what he does and work for free. Blow his mind. Build out a funnel. Try all those traffic strategies. Work on this list, setup Facebook ads and everything. Build a funnel. Get that thing working and you\u2019re working for free.</p> <p>After you\u2019ve done that, now you\u2019ve got a proven model that works then you go to every other chiropractor in town and sell that for $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 and you become rich overnight. That\u2019s it. How do you think Robbie sold $1.2 million in funnel services in the first three months of the year this year? It\u2019s pretty simple.</p> <p>What we did, first off, I worked for free Drew Canole and we had success there. And then I got some clients like Liz and a bunch of people. We had results there that blew their minds. And we got tons and tons of proof and case studies now. And now, when people come, they see the results and they want that for themselves. And it\u2019s not hard to sell now. OK?</p> <p>But my guess is it has been\u2026 not even a week since the funnel services has been done. And if you guys haven\u2019t \u2013 those who were there, if you have not made at least one phone call, you\u2019re not following my process. If you don\u2019t have someone that you are working for for free right now then it\u2019s only on you. It\u2019s not on anybody else. So hopefully guys, you\u2019re listening to this. You\u2019re listening to my message. Hopefully, the guy who Facebooked me, and my guess is one of two things is going to happen. One is, he\u2019s going to get offended and he\u2019ll ask me for a refund anyway, which is fine.</p> <p>Or number two, is then take it to heart and realized, \u201cMan, it\u2019s me. Not them. Maybe I\u2019m the one that\u2019s keeping me back. Maybe it\u2019s my fault I\u2019m not successful.\u201d And maybe he\u2019s going to change his mind. Maybe he\u2019s going to change his ways. Maybe he will figure out that he needs to listen to what I say and do what I say and apply it and then he\u2019ll be successfully.</p> <p>Anyway, there\u2019s my rant. I love you guys. I know that you guys are doers on my\u2026 that are listening to this. And if you\u2019ve been struggling up to this point, just try to look internal at yourself, figure out what you are doing and what you are not doing and that\u2019s holding you back and you got to change it because you\u2019re not going to have success, you\u2019re not going to make any amounts of money until you change yourself. OK?</p> <p>If I look consistently, people pay me $12,000, $25,000 and $100,000. We\u2019re giving the same thing. The difference is their mindset. They get it. They understand that what we provide is a piece and what they provide is the rest. They get off their butt and implement it. Until they do, they\u2019re not going to have success.</p> <p>So, I hope that helps. And maybe actually, one more kind of story. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been riding for. It\u2019s going to be like 3-hour podcast for all I know. One other story I want to share with you.</p> <p>So there was a guy that joined our\u2026 at the funnel hacking event, who joined our $25k Group. The guy is awesome like one of my favorite people so far. And it\u2019s funny because he jumps on Voxer, he\u2019s like, \u201cHey Russell, what do you think about this?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, I love it.\u201d He said, \u201cCool!\u201d And he goes and works on it. Three days later he messaged me, \u201cOK, I tried that. Facebook shut me down. So I tried this. I tried this. I tried this. Nothing is working. I\u2019ve been trying this. What do you think about that?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cCool! But change this.\u201d And then he goes back. And he\u2019s working his butt off.</p> <p>He is taking personal responsibility. He realizes that his success relies on him and he\u2019s using us as a guide to make sure that we got feedback like, \u201cYes, this is right. No, this is wrong. Change this. Try this. We\u2019ve tried this over here, try that.\u201d And he\u2019s using it that way.</p> <p>And this dude is like since the funnel hacking event to now, now he\u2019s more than made his money back and now he\u2019s like, \u201cHow do we grow this? How do we 10 X? How do we get it to a million, to two million, to ten million dollars?\u201d And he\u2019s going to get it because he takes personal responsibility and he\u2019s not sitting around and waiting. He\u2019s moving forward, moving forward and using the training and the people and the resources we give them as checks and balances to make sure things are working right. And that\u2019s why that dude is going to be a multimillionaire very, very soon.</p> <p>So those of you guys who are listening, I hope that helps. I probably offended some of you. If I offended you, that means it\u2019s probably an issue with you to be all honest. Hold on. I\u2019m crossing the street. In fact, that\u2019s a really good test as if I\u2019m talking to you directly. If this offended you in any way that means this is your issue.</p> <p>And I hope that you can look at me as a coach and a friend and as a mentor and someone who cares about your success. And don\u2019t get offended and do exactly what this dude probably did who Facebooked me last night. Don\u2019t try to look for other excuses and other reasons why you\u2019re not successful because if you\u2019re offended by this, it\u2019s you. It\u2019s you, my friend. And until you fix you, it\u2019s going to be hard for success in any area of your life.</p> <p>So, hope that helps. Appreciate you guys. Love you guys. I\u2019m here to serve and to give and help and inspire and change you guys. I hope you get that. I hope you see my passion and my commitment because when all said and done like I\u2019m fine. My business is fine. Everything is good. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not doing this for my health. I\u2019m riding my bike for my health. But all these things that I do is to serve you guys because I care. I didn\u2019t make a ton of money off the certification program. My goal is to get people using ClickFunnels. That\u2019s where I make my money to help people use our tool better.</p> <p>And a certification program is a way for us to serve and we served our freaking butts off. I was there for five days and my entire staff was there for five days. The two co-founders of ClickFunnels, Thursday night, pulled all-nighters, they did not go to bed. They\u2019re helping and serving. They\u2019re not doing that because it\u2019s some external thing. We\u2019re doing that because we care about you guys. If you get any other coaching program in our industry, they go to bed at 6:00 o\u2019clock at night. They leave. We were there serving because we care and we want you guys to be successful.</p> <p>So, I hope you understand that. I hope you feel that. We\u2019re here for you guys. And that\u2019s about it for today. I\u2019m out and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "23:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_146.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1440607317, "title": "Episode #145 \u2013 My Thoughts On The Event + My Secret Strategy With Periscope", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I want to give you a quick recap of what happened during the certification and I want to show you what happened the very first time I accidentally Periscoped.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the event and what some of the best parts were and why it was so amazing.

This is Russell and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right. So I\u2019m excited for today and for everything and for so much fun stuff. So I guess my call today with you guys, I got a couple of things to talk to you about and we need to discuss. So first is I feel bad. I was going to vox you guys\u2026or not vox you guys, I was going to give you some messages during the certification event last week but it went so crazy and it was amazing and I just ran out of time and I had people \u2013 I was driving around in the mornings and anyway, needless to say, it was a smashing success. Of the 120 people there, everyone had an amazing time except for four people which I was going to do a whole podcast about \u2013 I was going to call it \"The Anatomy of a Loser\" but I thought I\u2019m just going to focus on the good.</p> <p>Four people didn\u2019t\u2026 one of them went through all four days. The last day he showed up and said he got zero value from the entire week so far and wanted a complete refund which basically means he\u2019s a stone cold unethical liar because I had other people crying saying it changed their whole life and it was amazing.</p> <p>I was going to break down why I don\u2019t like this person now. Actually you guys want to know why? Well, I want to keep this positive but anyway, it\u2019s funny because the guy left and he said, \u201cHey, do you mind if I stay the last day.\u201d No, you freaking are refunding. We\u2019ve supported you, my entire team has been working with you. We have been here literally until 4 or 5 o\u2019clock in the morning every single morning helping you. Of course he didn\u2019t show up for those which is kind of funny. He skipped all the night sessions and didn\u2019t do the homework assignments or any of the other projects and he wants a refund. Then has the nerve to say, \u201cI got zero value from this. I\u2019m going to try to make some more money. That way I can invest in Russell\u2019s higher ticket programs later on.\u201d</p> <p>My response was: \u201cNo, we do not allow losers into our higher end programs.\u201d People who, freaking, will use your time for four of the five days of the event and then the last day come and ask for a refund after they didn\u2019t do the assignment, which we pulled an all-nighter on Thursday and people loved that. That was the best part. That was annoying.</p> <p>The other person is one of my friends. He sent three people from his team, three women and I will \u2013 anyway, they didn\u2019t show up for the last three days and they went home and told Perry that it was a complete waste of their time. They didn\u2019t show up for the last three days. So outside those four people who I will deem losers and I shouldn\u2019t say it. That\u2019s not nice. But that\u2019s how I feel. It was really upsetting. That you can go through and have this amazing experience\u2026 we have literally \u2013 I had people coming to me crying at the end about the experience. We help people build out entire businesses and they had a chance to work with the clients.</p> <p>It was, as a whole, one of the best events we\u2019ve ever done. I just had 4 people of 120 that are coming with that attitude and by the way happened to be the four people who didn\u2019t freaking show up and do the work and it\u2019s just \u2013 anyway, that\u2019s how life is, right?</p> <p>So there you go and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t honestly message you guys because I was frustrated by those people. I didn\u2019t want that to cloud it. Now you guys got the cloud but now the cloud is gone. Everything else was amazing. It was awesome. We had \u2013 my favorite part of it was on Thursday. We brought in three business owners and I consulted those businesses in front of them and kind of mapped out funnels and then all those guys, we got done like 6 o\u2019clock at night. They had to go out and pull an all-nighter and they got to pick which one of the three funnels they like the most.</p> <p>We had a chiropractor, someone who owns a certification program and someone who\u2019s doing survival info products. So they got to see my map of the funnel and then they can make up their own if they wanted and they had to create the entire thing, all the pages, all the funnel, all the sequences and literally people \u2013 some people didn\u2019t go to bed. They pulled all-nighters. They worked the whole thing and then the next day on Friday, everyone who had killed themselves building funnels, they had everyone kind of vote and we picked the top three in each category and the top three got to present it for the entire group and for that business owner and then the business owner picked who they thought was the best and they won a $1000 cash prize. We had big old stacks of $1 bills.</p> <p>It was so much fun and it was amazing. I can\u2019t even tell you like some of these people what they built, how amazing it was. They built funnels and had ideas and concepts I never even dreamt of and it was just \u2013 gall, it was amazing! And then obviously salt that off with the dude who comes back and said that he didn\u2019t learn anything. Oh, how did the hack-a-thon go for you last night? I went to bed. Well, you missed the most important part. So yeah, it makes sense that it didn\u2019t have any value for you. Anyway, just makes me laugh.</p> <p>It was interesting. I went to Tony Robbins\u2019 'Date with Destiny' which is Tony is the best on earth. It\u2019s a five or six-day event and in the last day he does a session. He was like, \u201cWho here has not had a breakthrough in the last five days?\u201d and sure enough like 20 people raised their hands and it was kind of awesome. Tony went through and just made them all look like idiots in a nice way or basically like help them see they had breakthroughs but they just weren\u2019t intelligent enough to notice it, right?</p> <p>Anyhoo, so there\u2019s my rant. It\u2019s over. Let\u2019s focus on the positive. So this is what I\u2019m talking about today because this is something that I think is\u00a0 crazy exciting and I feel like I\u2019ve missed the boat on some things and I don\u2019t want to miss the boat on this. I don\u2019t want you to miss the boat on this. So a couple of things.</p> <p>First off, a lot of you guys know Gary Vaynerchuk and I watched him as he grew Wine Library TV from nothing to this huge thing and his whole thing was like \u201cI do a video every day. I\u2019m consistent. Every day I do a video.\u201d Alright\u2026</p> <p>I thought that was kind of cool and I think my big takeaway from that was consistency, consistency. And then I heard a little while ago that there\u2019s a guy, I think you guys know him, his name is Eric Worre. And he \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is true, this is my understanding what I heard happened but he was kind of a good guy, making money but not like the biggest name on earth and he went and he hired Gary Vaynerchuk and Gary basically said make a video every day. Be consistent.</p> <p>So he did and now five years later, he has done a video every day for five years and he has got \u2013 he does these live events where he gets 10,000 people signing up. He did a webinar last month with Tony Robbins. He had over 100,000 people register and it\u2019s insane. Eric Worre is a smart dude, genius, really nice guy but I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s the most charismatic leader in the world. I wouldn\u2019t have \u2013 you might be watching his videos and like OK. But I was like \u201chow has this dude got so many people that follow him?\u201d and it\u2019s consistency, right.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to do that with Marketing in Your Car. This is the most consistent I\u2019ve ever been with a content publishing platform and I like it but it\u2019s kind of like it\u2019s delayed publishing. I record it. You might listen to this a week from now or two weeks from now or six weeks from now. One thing I do like about podcasts that has been really interesting is that I\u2019ve done, like I don\u2019t know, 150 episodes or something for the last like three years and people will come and they join Marketing in Your Car and then they go on these binges. Like one of my coaching clients, one of like the coolest people I\u2019ve met this year. His name is Noah.</p> <p>He was just messing with me. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, man.\u201d Him and his wife, they\u2019re amazing coaches and entrepreneurs and they drive around the country in like an RV and they just work from wherever they\u2019re at, right? Which is super cool and he said \u2013 he said, \u201cI went on the Marketing in Your Car binge and listened to like half of the episodes in three days,\u201d which is cool. It\u2019s funny. If you look at our stats, that\u2019s what happens. People come in, listen to one to two episodes and they like it and they binge and they go through the entire like last three years of my life.</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of cool because \u2013 anyway, so I like that part of it. It\u2019s kind of cool. But one thing that I don\u2019t like is just it\u2019s not instant, right? Not instant like if I want to send you a message, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re going to get it right away. Like we did \u2013 a couple of weeks ago, I did the whole like \u2013 my number one entrepreneur supplement. I wanted to kind of test this. If I send this out, how many responses do I get? How long does it come? What\u2019s interesting is I got a lot better response from that than I had assumed I would which is cool but there has been a long drag on it. There\u2019s this drag that I\u2019m still getting people coming in now and I will probably get those people coming in for the rest of my life. It\u2019s kind of interesting. How there\u2019s that drag\u2026</p> <p>So there\u2019s that. I remember when Twitter first came out. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t get it. I remember hanging out with Frank Kern. We were doing a project together and so I flew out to his offices and we talked about Twitter and he\u2019s like, \u201cThe coolest thing is I tweet and wherever I tweet, within like five minutes, there\u2019s a thousand visitors go to wherever I just tweet about.\u201d I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of cool. It would be nice to be able to get 1000 clicks anytime you wanted just by tweeting something, right?\u201d And obviously Twitter kind of came and went and most of those guys don\u2019t tweet or twit or whatever you call it. They don\u2019t do that anymore, right?</p> <p>But conceptually, I said that\u2019s really cool. So I started getting Twitter and I got all excited. By that point, like nobody cared and I\u2019m assuming people still tweet or twit, whatever you call it. But I don\u2019t even know. So I kind of missed that platform.</p> <p>Now Periscope, so this is my entrance into Periscope, right? So that has been happening for the last like month or so and I keep seeing different people popping on it and the first time I was \u2013 I downloaded the app and somebody was like, \u201cHey, you should Periscope.\u201d And I\u2019m like; I don\u2019t know what that means. Downloaded the app, I found it was hooked to Twitter, so I integrated it with my Twitter account, or whatever.</p> <p>Anyway, one day I\u2019m driving around. My phone bleeps and I look down and it\u2019s one of my friends, Stacy Highland, and she\u2019s like \u2013 it said Stacy is starting \u2013 she\u2019s \u2013 whatever, she\u2019s Periscoping live. I was like I don\u2019t know what that means.</p> <p>So I clicked on it and it popped up and instantly I\u2019m talking \u2013 I\u2019m watching her talk and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, hey Russell just logged in,\u201d and she said, \u201cHow is it going?\u201d and I\u2019m driving around in Boise for the next like five, ten minutes and she\u2019s just like sharing this really great training and then it ended. I was like that was the coolest thing. I just \u2013 my phone beeped. I clicked the button. I\u2019m watching her stream live and then she\u2019s done and I was like there\u2019s this instant thing where I could push \u2013 where she pushed content to me. I didn\u2019t even know how it popped on my phone honestly.</p> <p>So that was kind of cool. So then I was like OK, I want to figure this Periscope thing out but I hadn\u2019t had time yet. Now, fast forward like a month later or a couple of weeks later, which is yesterday actually, I was working on Actionetics. I was building out my email sequence in there and I was editing the footer in my email to have like here\u2019s my Twitter following and my Facebook and all those things and I was like I\u2019m going to add my Periscope thing. I don\u2019t even know what my Periscope thing is.</p> <p>So I opened my phone app and I\u2019m clicking around and also accidentally clicked the button for like to publish and I click on this thing and within like \u2013 within a minute, I had 50 people. I didn\u2019t even know who these people are and how they found out about it. I don\u2019t even know.</p> <p>I hooked this up to Twitter, so maybe they saw me tweet it because I think Periscope tweeted it out. Anyway, 50 people are on and we were just hanging out and talking and sharing some cool stuff and that fast I had this instant like direct channel to people instantly and I could \u2013 I had their focus and their interest and it was awesome. Then when it was done, I think that Twitter stores it for like a day and then it kills the video.</p> <p>So I sent it to my brother. I\u2019m like hey, every time I do the Periscope, you got to grab it. We\u2019re going to turn it into a video. That way I can post it on my blog and I can now start doing all the other stuff. But I\u2019m like, this is now a platform where I could publish daily where \u2013 so what I\u2019m going to do now is every day at the end of the day, when I get \u2013 I\u2019m doing Marketing in Your Car usually when I\u2019m driving to the office or driving home but typically I\u2019m driving to the office and I\u2019m sharing my thoughts for the day and just cool ideas and then I\u2019m going to start using Periscope when the day is over. Hey guys, this is what I did today and I will just kind of show off the cool stuff I\u2019m doing and just use it as kind of an over the shoulder - like this is what I\u2019m doing today. This is what I got done. This is what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s exciting. Just share with people and see what you\u2019re actually doing.</p> <p>I also want to use it as a way to amplify my content. So like I\u2019m trying to get to a point where I\u2019m doing like a blog post every \u2013 a couple of times a week or we\u2019re doing \u2013 everything we\u2019re doing and it would be cool like to use Periscope. Hey guys, I just wrote a blog post. This is what it\u2019s about. If you like that, go over there and comment. I\u2019m using this as a tool to live stream \u2013 in live real time to go get people to go comment on my post and my Facebook thing or whatever it is. I don\u2019t know yet.</p> <p>But that\u2019s kind of the concept. So I\u2019m excited for it. If you are a Periscoper, come check me out. Come \u2013 I think you just got to go to Periscope. You just go in there and you search for @russellbrunson. And then my brother is storing them all on our blog which is blog.dotcomsecrets.com. We haven\u2019t really launched that yet but its happening and all the Marketing in Your Car are there along with the transcripts. A bunch of cool stuff is happening over the blog soon.</p> <p>So anyway, I\u2019m excited. I think Periscope is cool. I think that you guys should all start looking at it. That\u2019s one of my big initiatives I\u2019m going to be doing. I will try to do a Periscope a day and hopefully in five years from now, I will be like Eric Worre and have events with 10,000 people at it and I can get 100,000 people show up on webinars.</p> <p>So that\u2019s my goal and hopefully you guys use this as a platform too because I know it\u2019s here. I know there\u2019s going to be a ton of competition. Facebook is coming out with one, a bunch of them are coming out with one. The reality is it does not matter which one you use. Just pick a platform and stick with it because that\u2019s the key is just being consistent. So I picked my platform. I don\u2019t care which other one comes out. I\u2019m focusing there and we\u2019re going to start growing this thing out and come hang out with me on Periscope. Thanks everyone.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to a Saturday edition of Marketing in Your Car</p> <p>Hey everyone. I\u2019m messaging you today as I\u2019m out running errands. So I won\u2019t end at the office I\u2019ll end somewhere else. Who knows where? It could be anywhere. But just had some cool ideas and thoughts and wanted to just hang out with you guys. I miss you!</p> <p>So first off, I wanted to say that if you\u2019re listening to this, it means the update worked which I think it worked anyway. We were able to move from the old RSS feed in iTunes to the new one and I just saw today that the new image was up so we have a new image which is pretty sweet.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about getting a new theme song too. My first theme song was written like in the 80\u2019s. Those who listened to the first hundred episodes would know. The next one is like I just basically wanted a new one really quick, so I found a little jingle on Audio Jungle, hired a dude on some voiceover site and boom, we had the current intro which is good but it\u2019s not amazing, right? So I\u2019m thinking about getting an amazing one done since we\u2019re still doing this like three or four years later. Might as well make an awesome intro. So that\u2019s kind of my thought. So yeah, I think I\u2019m going to do that. So I\u2019m excited for that.</p> <p>Okay, so what have I got for you guys today? What do I have for you today? That is the question. I\u2019m actually excited. This is \u2013 it\u2019s Saturday today and on Monday, we will have a little over a hundred people from around the world here in Boise, Idaho and we are doing the first ever ClickFunnels certification program and it\u2019s something when we first put it together, I was excited for but I didn\u2019t know what to do. OK. I will be honest. I was excited to sell it. That gets me excited. That\u2019s what fires me up. I love figuring out the pitch and the hook and the angle on how to present it and all that kind of stuff.</p> <p>Some of you guys were at the Funnel Hacking event so you saw me pitch it. I used the Perfect Webinar script to a T. I did not deviate from it. In fact, I had people afterwards who bought, who were just like, \u201cI was watching it and I knew exactly it was going to happen every single slide and I still had to buy.\u201d</p> <p>So it works in case you\u2019re wondering. If don\u2019t have the Perfect Webinar yet, go to PerfectWebinarSecrets.com and go get the free script. It\u2019s like $4.95, we ship you out the script and the DVD and then you get digital access as well. But yeah, so that\u2019s that and we did it and we sold over a hundred people into it, anywhere from $3500 to $5000.</p> <p>So it was awesome. So that\u2019s exciting from the sales stance. Then we have like \u2013 how to make this so this is like an amazing experience for people. We don\u2019t want to just be like this dumb thing. So we\u2019re trying to figure out a way to make this just amazing. I think we did. It\u2019s going to be fun to see but I will kind of walk you through this because for those who are coming, you have an idea what\u2019s happening and for those who aren\u2019t, you will see what\u2019s going to happen next year. I think we will try this once a year.</p> <p>So it will be incentive for you to come next year when we do it and then \u2013 or if you do it in your certification program, just kind of an idea. So the one thing that I didn\u2019t want to do is I didn\u2019t want to make this like all the other crappy certification programs that are out there on the market. Most of them, it\u2019s like you log on, you watch like an hour-long video, you take a quiz and then you get certified. It\u2019s just like embarrassing and not real and fake. We want to make a legitimate like cool certification program.</p> <p>So this one is five days which I don\u2019t know why I said five days but I thought it sounded cool in writing the pitch and then I was like, \u201cFive days? What are we going to talk about for five days?\u201d But actually it worked out good. We\u2019re actually like really going to be close on time now. The way it\u2019s going to work is they\u2019re going to come in on Monday and from \u2013 we have a couple of different rooms. This one room, it looks like a college classroom or it\u2019s like a whole bunch of like stadium seating type thing. So I get to come in and teach in there which would be awesome for like three hours.</p> <p>I will be teaching the whole intro there and they go to lunch. They come back from lunch and then we got three breakout rooms that\u2019ll hold about 40 people each. So everyone will go to the breakout rooms and then they\u2019re going to be on their laptops and their computers actually doing what it is that we just taught them.</p> <p>Then before they can leave that day, they\u2019ve got to pass off to make sure that they have all the skill sets for that section of the certification program and so that would be day one. They did day two. I teach in the morning then we break out after lunch and maybe they will work on a thing. They create the thing and then they get to come through and get passed off.</p> <p>We do the same thing with teaching \u2013 first off teaching how to use ClickFunnels, then teaching high ticket sales or teaching how to create videos, how to write copy, how to do the offer, how to do ascension, how to \u2013 different funnel psychology and strategy and actionetics, a whole bunch of just cool things all wrapped into one. It\u2019s going to be awesome.</p> <p>That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Then on Thursday after lunch we\u2019re bringing in \u2013 actually during lunch, we\u2019re going to be working lunch, because \u2013 just to make enough time. I have three business owners coming in and they\u2019re going to each of these groups of 40 and the business owners are going to say, \u201cThis is my business,\u201d and they\u2019re going to kind of walk them through it and they\u2019re going to let \u2013 it would be kind of like the show The Apprentice when they start working with a business. The business owner comes in and they get to interview the business owner and ask him a bunch of questions and they got to go and do the task, right? It\u2019s the same kind of thing. There will be multiple groups. There might be five groups in each of these rooms who would be doing it. They\u2019re going to be competing.</p> <p>So they\u2019ll go - all of them will interview the business owners. \u201cOK. What do you do?\u201d I got three really cool business owners all in very unique different businesses coming in and they will go and they will interview him and then figure out what kind of funnel they\u2019re going to build and then they go back and they\u2019ve got from noon until 4:30. So they\u2019ve got about almost five hours to go and record the person, video, edit the videos, create the funnel, create the sequence, integrate the autoresponder. Like the whole kit and caboodle has to be built out in four hours and then it\u2019s basically those three business owners and there will be like five groups for each business owner.</p> <p>So that business owner will get a pick from the five groups. Who did the best job? And then we will bring everyone together back in the main room and then we will have our own vote and then the winner will get a big prize and then what we\u2019re going to do \u2013 because in my world, we don\u2019t just work for a little while and then we go to bed. In my world, when you got something that needs to get done, you get it done. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.</p> <p>So as soon as that part is over, then we\u2019re going to go and we\u2019re going to do an actual hackathon where it would be like 5 o\u2019clock at night and we\u2019re going to hand out a business to \u2013 we will break down into groups of threes. It would be smaller groups and basically we will hand out a business profile and then say you\u2019ve got from now until 3 o\u2019clock this morning to go and create this.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to give each a pack of Ignite which is our \u2013 one of our supplements. It keeps you awake and they get a go and pull an all-nighter to create this funnel for this fictitious business and the winner is going to win something amazing and it will be cool. They can pull an all-nighter. It\u2019s going to be awesome. The next day, everyone has a chance to present theirs and the winner will get some awesome prize.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s going to be amazing. So it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s not a seminar. It\u2019s an actual workshop which I\u2019m so excited for them. It\u2019s going to be fun to see how the whole thing goes and I think it\u2019s going to be amazing and I\u2019m really excited for everyone who\u2019s coming to go through this experience and I think that what they\u2019re going to leave with is going to be amazing. It will transform people\u2019s lives on both sides. It could transform their own, cause I think that funnel consultants can and should be making six figures a year. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a stretch by any \u2013 like at all \u2013 I think this should be pretty simple to do.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the one side and the second side is that when you create good funnels for people and they\u2019re able to get more clients into their companies, it serves them, that business owner, plus it serves their end clients. So it\u2019s kind of a three-pronged approach and I\u2019m just grateful to be able to help facilitate it and be part of it. So I\u2019m excited. It\u2019s going to be fun. I\u2019m at my destination now.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to check off and I will probably message you guys throughout the certification this week. I got a long drive into downtown Boise every day. So I will share the cool stuffs happening, the insights, other cool stuff. Oh, and maybe I will tell you a little bit about Actionetics. I got to play with it all week last week and it is amazing!</p> <p>You guys think ClickFunnels is a game changer. Just wait until you see Actionetics. Anyway, I\u2019m out. Talk to you guys soon. Have an awesome day.</p>", "duration": "08:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_144.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1439566260, "title": "Episode #143 \u2013 !?!

What happened to Marketing in Your Car? Alright I\u2019ll tell you. This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey, everyone! So, if you\u2019re listening to this episode it means one of two things; one you like listening to Marketing in Your Car and number two, you\u2019re wondering what happened to Marketing in Your Car? Did it end? Why are there no new updates on iTunes? Why am I not getting any more episodes, right? Well, I\u2019ve got good news for you, and I\u2019ve got great news for you. Good news for you is I am still doing Marketing in Your Car. It\u2019s not gone anywhere, it\u2019s not changed. The only thing that happened is we\u2019re moving it from one blog RSS feed to a different one. And the last time we did that about 30% of our listeners no longer got updates on their phone or on their\u2026 however they get iTunes\u2026 or, however they get the podcast. And for 70%, it didn\u2019t affect them, so for you, if you have an episode that\u2019s after this one, you\u2019re probably fine. But if you are looking and you keep seeing this episode and there\u2019s no new episode beside this one you are all wondering, \u201cRussell where in the world is Marketing in Your Car I want a new episode?\u201d What you probably have to do is download or unsubscribe and then re-subscribe or something like that. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what people had to do last time and they were able to get it back. So, yeah, so that\u2019s about it, so nothing to freak out about. Do not worry but if this is the only episode you\u2019re seeing in your feed it means it might have been some weird thing that iTunes did and you guys have to like unsubscribe and re-subscribe or tinker around a little bit and then I will be back in your ear during my morning drive. So I just wanted to give you guys that.</p> <p>And some of you guys maybe thinking, \u201cRussell why in the world are you moving your RSS feed to your thingy and blah, blah, blah\u201d and actually and \u201cWhy have you done this twice now Russell?\u201d Well the real reason is\u2026 I keep trying to become a good content marketer and it\u2019s kind of hard, like you got to be consistent. In fact, the one thing I have been consistent with ever in content marketing is this podcast which has been really fun. So initially I had on DotComSecrets.com which eventually we wanted to turn into a Clickfunnels, like I wanted to build the whole thing in Clickfunnels, so I had to move the blog. So I moved the podcast over to marketinginyourcar.com and then started getting every single episode transcribed, which, a lot of you guys probably don\u2019t even know about. The problem with that is it\u2019s now only on marketingyourcar.com and nobody\u2019s ever actually been to that site I don\u2019t think, maybe they have.</p> <p>And so right now if you\u2019ve listened to the past episodes recently we had hired Neil Patel for a day and he got me all pumped up again about blogging so we got a new blog setup that\u2019s going up right now. It may or not be live when you see this but it\u2019s at blog.dotcomsecrets.com, and on there it will be a couple of things. First of Marketing in Your Car episodes and transcripts will all show up there. So all the goodness of me driving and hanging out with you guys will all be there which is kind of fun. Also, funnelhacker.tv, for a little while I had that also as an iTunes thing but I think I\u2019m just going to strip it out and just make it just a YouTube channel. I am getting too many publishing, too many ways and things which is just confusing to me and everybody so I am just going to simplify things. So, that\u2019s going to become in just a pure YouTube channel and that also be pulled into blog.dotcomsecrets.com. And then, you guys will be amazed, you\u2019ll be excited to hear but I\u2019m going to start blogging. And I never wanted to do it for a long time because I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t like \u2013 like how do you blog? You know, like I know how to blog\u2026 but how do you make it interesting? How do you make it so you\u2019re not just like every other person?</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of big brands and big people recently who blog and all their stuff just looks like everybody else\u2019s, and I don\u2019t want to do something if it\u2019s going to be a \u201cme too\u201d which I\u2019m sure you probably notice about me. I like figuring ways to innovate and making these better and cooler and all that kind of fun stuff, so finally it came to me, 12 years in this business and I finally figured out how to blog for me. And it\u2019s all about finding my style and my tone, and my voice and those kinds of things. And so what am I going to do for blogging which I am really excited about is kind of similar to the DotComSecrets book which if you bought the book you\u2019re awesome if not then why are you even listening to this? Seriously? Go to dotcomsecretsbook.com and get it for free.</p> <p>But in the book, as you remember, there\u2019s tons of like \u2013 every one of the core concepts that we do I kind of hand sketch them out because I am a very visual learner. If you came to my office and we had a conversation I\u2019d be in front of a whiteboard the whole time, so I thought if I\u2019m blogging that\u2019s how I should blog. That\u2019s my voice, that\u2019s how I speak, that\u2019s how I share. So what I am doing is my goal is three times a week to blog and every blog post will have a sketch out image like that talking about a concept along with the article and hopefully some cool case studies and images and its going to be really fun so that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>So soon this will be the home of all my content. It will be at blog.dotcomsecrets.com. So some of you may think, \u201cRussell why in the world are you on the Clickfunnels blog? We noticed you also launched a blog at Clickfunnels. Yes, there\u2019s blog.clickfunnels.com. But one big core thing with Clickfunnels that I wanted to do that it\u2019s different than DotComSecrets. As you know DotComSecrets is my voice and me and my face all those kind of things which is fun because you get popular and you get easier to do deals and there\u2019s a bunch of benefits that come from like a guru \u2013based business but there\u2019s a bunch of negatives too. You can\u2019t sell a business like that very easily and a bunch of other things. And so what I wanted to do with Clickfunnels is we\u2019re trying to build a company that is not based on me. And so if you look at how I try to have things structured, it\u2019s not a 100% perfect but we\u2019re trying to structure it where Russell Brunson of DotComSecrets is like an affiliate. A super affiliate, the biggest fan of Clickfunnels in the world because we are. But my voice and my everything will be heard there primarily whereas Clickfunnels.com is a software company and I am sure I will guest blog on that blog but the core voicing for messaging can\u2019t be me otherwise it\u2019s not a sellable asset in the future. So if you look at right now, we got Steven, you guys heard from a couple of episodes back who is our head content developer. He\u2019ll be doing a blog post a day and that\u2019s kind of a full time job for him. And we\u2019ll probably bring in other guest bloggers and things like that and I am sure that I will be a guest blogger in the future. But supporting that we have multiple voices not just mine because that\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to grow a business that will someday sell. Not that we want to sell it, in fact I don\u2019t want to sell it. I had a lot of arguments about this with my partners.</p> <p>We may someday when we\u2019re bored but that\u2019s like 50 years from now. So as of right now \u2013 in fact it\u2019s funny at the Funnelhacking event someone asked that question they said you know, \u201cInfusionsoft went public\u2026\u201d and this and that \u201cLead Pages is taking our money, what\u2019s your guys\u2019 plan?\u201d And I was like \u2013 I told them I said, \u201cFor the last 12 years I have been working towards like my dream business and this is it.\u201d And I was like \u201cIf we will sell the business and I woke up tomorrow I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with my life. I wake up tomorrow I want to do Clickfunnels. So as far I\u2019m concerned I am not selling now or ever.\u201d And I got a standing ovation for that so, apparently that resonates with some of you all which is cool.</p> <p>So anyway, that\u2019s kind of where it\u2019s at. So as far as some value for you guys think about some of the stuff I talked about, if you were building a guru brand find one central spot to communicate and try to make it more simple, that\u2019s one big strategy I am focusing on right now. And if you are building a secondary company that is not guru-based you can still use your guru to be the fuel source for it initially like we\u2019re doing with Clickfunnels but long-term there are big benefits of not branding yourself all over the place. Like my face is not all over \u2013 oh crap, actually the new version is. It\u2019s out converting the other one, dang it. So my face is currently on the new Clickfunnels sales letter, but that\u2019s just because it\u2019s out converting it. But you know what I am saying, I\u2019m not saying like, yeah anyway hope that helps.</p> <p>All right cool. Well I appreciate you guys. Again if this is the last podcast in your feed just go refresh it or re-download it or re-subscribe to whatever it is to make sure you don\u2019t miss on any future episodes because I have some crazy, cool, amazing fun, exciting awesome stuff for you guys coming up in the very, very, very near future. And that\u2019s what I got. Thanks everybody and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "09:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_143.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1439325342, "title": "Episode #142 \u2013 Behind The Scenes Of My Hour With Tony Robbins", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What REALLY happened during the 60 minutes we had with Tony\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell tells the story of his hour with Tony Robbins and all the juicy details leading up to it.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Find out how Russell was able to get an hour with Tony Robbins.</li> <li>Hear about all the tense moments Russell and his team experienced while waiting for Tony to arrive</li> <li>And find out what Tony thinks about Clickfunnels</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear all the amazing details behind the scenes of Russell\u2019s hour with Tony Robbins.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everyone, and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right, all right, so everyone keeps asking me. I've been getting hit up all over Facebook and Voxer and everything to hear the story what happened this weekend with Tony Robbins.</p> <p>And so I thought instead of me telling the same story a million times, I'd just tell it once here. So that's the game plan. So you guys have a chance to hear what really happened.</p> <p>If you haven't seen the pictures yet, this weekend we had a chance to go and film Tony Robbins, which was super cool. So kind of the backstory behind it. A little while ago, you may or may not remember, he launched his new book called: Money. I'm blanking on the subtitle of course, but it's basically a wealth investing book about how to invest your money to make a whole bunch of money.</p> <p>And he went through and interviewed like 50 of the world's wealthiest self-made billionaires and found out how they did it and wrote a whole book on it.</p> <p>When the book launched about 10 months ago, he sent me a preview copy and told me what was going to happen. I was like, \"I'm really good at this whole book funnel thing. Let me help you with it.\" I showed him some cool tips and tricks and things we were doing.</p> <p>He got all excited. He said, \"Here's my team that's doing it. Can you get with them and help them do it?\" So I called his team up and his team was not like an internal team. It was a team he had hired to do this who had never actually done an info product funnel in the past.</p> <p>And was very threatened by the fact that I was willing to help him for free because they were getting paid a lot of money to do it. So they fought me tooth and nail on everything. We actually built the entire funnel in Click Funnels and it was a million times better than theirs and they still wouldn't use it, it was just nuts.</p> <p>And Tony was like, \"I'm so busy speaking everywhere. You've got to coordinate with these guys.\" And they shut me down. So eventually I just gave up and quit trying.</p> <p>I was like, \"I tried to help, but if I can't help, then I can't help.\" So fast forward to like six months later, Tony gets a hold of me and calls me on the phone.</p> <p>I think I might have emailed him my book results and said, \"Hey, here's what we do with our book. I thought that was pretty cool. If you ever want me to help you with it again, let me know.\" And like a month later he called me up so we had a call and I just walked him through the things I thought they did right and the things I thought they did wrong, and some simple tweaks and changes.</p> <p>And it kind of ended there. I didn't hear back from him for a little while. And then like a month or two later I guess he let go of that old team and was going to bring it all in-house.</p> <p>He said, \"We're bringing it all in-house. We're going to redo this thing, do it the right way, kind of the way you mentioned. Do you want to coordinate with my team and work with them? That would be awesome.\"</p> <p>So I get on a call with their team. And this is kind of a newer marketing team that has just been assembled and they're in charge of this whole thing and none of them had ever done it before.</p> <p>And so they got on a call with me and I kind of consulted them through how to do it. And then you could tell by the sound of their voices they were like, \"Well, okay, good luck. We have to go figure this out now.\"</p> <p>At the very end I was like, \"If you want, I'd be willing to do it for you guys. It would be really fun for us.\"</p> <p>They were like, \"How much are you going to charge?\"</p> <p>\"I'll do it for free.\"</p> <p>They're like, \"What?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, pretty much my whole goal in life is to make Tony Robbins think I'm cool, so I'm going to do it for free to make him think I'm cool.\"</p> <p>And they were really relieved on the other end. They were like, \"Are you serious? That would be amazing.\" They got so excited.</p> <p>I said, \"The only thing is if we're going to do this, we're going to have to redo the videos, because the offering is wrong and the sequencing is wrong. Almost everything is wrong in this funnel. We've got to redo it all. So you've got to coordinate time for me to go film with Tony so we can re-film the whole thing.\"</p> <p>They were like, \"Okay, we'll take care of that.\"</p> <p>So that was about a month ago. So for the last month we've been figuring out the right offer, the right sequencing, the right upsells, downsells, the order form bumps, all kinds of things with his team. And then we had to find time to film with Tony.</p> <p>So we were hoping to go out and film at his house, and that almost happened. But then Tony was doing Business Mastery in Vegas this weekend and they were like, \"How about instead of coming to his house you go and film him during Business Mastery.\"</p> <p>I was like, \"Oh, crap. All right, fine.\" Because that would have been really cool to go to his house. But this was almost as cool. So that was kind of the backstory leading up to this.</p> <p>So then that was this weekend. So this weekend we were flying out. So we woke up Saturday night. So Saturday night, they told us what hotel he was in, which was not where the event was at, by the way. I found out later.</p> <p>And it was in these towers. So they were like, \"If you can get a room in the towers and film there, that would be really cool.\"</p> <p>So we called and we ordered a suite at the towers suite. This is funny, the cheapest suites are $2,500 a night. I was like, \"Oh, crap.\" So we got one suite for one night so we could do this whole thing.</p> <p>So we booked a suite. So we get there. When we got to Vegas the suite wasn't ready yet so I texted Tony's people like, \"Hey, our suite's not ready yet. We're set up. Can we come to the event and see what's happening?\"</p> <p>That's when they told us, \"Sure, it's over at the Cosmo.\" So we jumped in a taxi, drove over to the Cosmo and got there at the event and they gave us little name badges that said we were staff so we could come in and do whatever we wanted, which was kind of cool.</p> <p>So we came in, we sat in the back. And then I just watched Tony onstage for like two hours. Which if you've never seen Tony onstage, it's like amazing. I could sit there and watch that for days and not even get bored.</p> <p>So I watched Tony onstage for two hours, which was really, really cool. Then we got a call from the place saying our suite was done. So we had to jump out and leave and go back and get the suite all ready.</p> <p>So we went and got the suite all ready. When we first walked in, for $2,500 I thought we were going to have this amazing suite with this huge view and everything. We walk in and it's this really gold, busy, nasty, I don't know. It was a really ugly room to be honest.</p> <p>And then our view overlooked the dead part of Vegas where there was nothing there. I was like, \"Are you kidding me?\" So we spent an hour getting lights set up and equipment and stuff. We couldn't find a view that looked good outside. All the views did not look good.</p> <p>I was like, \"Aw, dang it.\" So finally we found this one spot from one of the bedrooms that actually looked over this kind of cool area and it looked really cool. So we set up everything in this one bedroom.</p> <p>So everything was kind of going good, putting things together. Then I get a text from his assistant that says, \"Hey, do you mind lowering the room temperature in the rooms to at least 63 degrees?\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"All right.\" So we go and crank all the air conditioners in all the rooms down to get it down to 63. So it's like blowing freezing cold air in there, we're all getting stuff set up and ready.</p> <p>And then all the sudden there's a doorbell at the suite. Ding dong! And we go and answer it and it's the head of Tony's marketing team who's been helping us with this project. So he came in and was talking with us and we were talking for like an hour and he was the one communicating with the team.</p> <p>Then he gets a text, \"Okay, Tony is still onstage.\" I think he was supposed to be there at 5:00 in our room. So we get everything ready by 5:00. We were ready for it to happen.</p> <p>And at 5:00 he gets a text like, \"Tony's still onstage for 10 or 15 minutes.\" Which in Tony time probably means another hour or two hours. And so we started talking to him and waiting and every 20 or 30 minutes he gets a text like, \"Tony's still onstage.\"</p> <p>Okay. And so this whole time you can imagine our nerves are building up and I've got this lump in my stomach and I'm sweating cold sweat because it's freezing cold in the room and I'm nervous and I'm shaking and I can't stop shaking because it's so cold and I'm so nervous.</p> <p>It's just crazy. So finally we're waiting, we're waiting. And finally the text that Tony has left the hotel and is coming towards us. We're all excited, going crazy. So we're getting ready. And 15-20 minutes later all of the sudden the doorbell rings at the door.</p> <p>And of course in my mind I'm like, \"Tony's here!\" I'm going crazy. I had some people in there and I was like, \"Record this with your iPhone. I want to capture every cool thing that happens.\"</p> <p>So they got their iPhones out to record. I go to answer the door and it's a lady and she's like, \"I'm here to drop off stuff for Tony.\" She had like a green drink and then some makeup, some powder for hair and makeup type things.</p> <p>So she came and dropped it off in the room and she left. \"Okay, that was not Tony. But calm back down, relax.\" We're trying to be all cool and not act like little groupies or whatever.</p> <p>And then a few minutes later the doorbell rings again. So we run over to the door and this man comes in. He's got a headset thing on and he comes and shakes my hand really strong. This dude just let me know that if he wanted to crush my hand he could have.</p> <p>He like shook my hand and I was like, \"Wow.\" He whispers really quietly, talking to me.</p> <p>He's like, \"I'm security. I need to do a sweep of the hotel.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Sure, come on in.\"</p> <p>So he came in and sweeps all the rooms, does an interior sweep or whatever. I don't know, to see if there's weapons or bombs or superfans. I don't know what he's doing. So he's coming in and we're like, \"This is so legit.\"</p> <p>He's got security guards sweeping the premise before he comes in. Then the guy says, \"We're clear.\" So the guy leaves.</p> <p>So we get a text from Tony's people again saying he's in the hotel. He's upstairs prepping with the scripts. I wrote the scripts for all of the upsells and stuff, so he's prepping on the scripts, trying to prepare himself for it.</p> <p>So we're waiting, waiting and a few minutes later the doorbell rings. I'm like, \"Oh no, it's Tony!\" So we're getting all excited again. The cameras are out and it's the security guard.</p> <p>He's like, \"Tony will be down in 10 minutes.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Okay, you could have just told me that.\" Anyway, so we're waiting 10 more minutes. Then the doorbell rings again, everyone gets excited, we come out and it's not Tony.</p> <p>It's the security guard again. He's like, \"He's coming down the elevator.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Why do you have to tell me that? Why can't you just wait outside the door until he's here? You're freaking us out.\"</p> <p>Then we close the door and we're waiting, like \"He's in the elevator. He could be here any second now. We're just going crazy and all of the sudden we hear three, four, probably five people coming down the hall.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Oh man, here it is.\" I open the door and there's like Tony's whole entourage around him and then he comes in and he's just bigger than life as always.</p> <p>He comes in and he's like, \"Russell, so good to see you. Thanks for taking on this project.\" He gives me a hug, which we got the whole thing on tape, which was kind of cool on one of the iPhones.</p> <p>He gives me a hug and then says, \"What's the plan? What are we doing?\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"We're filming back over here.\" And we were like over an hour past when we were supposed to start, and he had a hard deadline of an hour. So we had like exactly an hour block now.</p> <p>First we had two but then we cut it down to an hour. So we're like, \"Okay, we got to move fast.\"</p> <p>So we move him back over to the room, get him all set up, microphones set up, do sound test. And he's sitting there in his head rehearsing the scripts and stuff. And I'm like awkwardly sitting there like, \"Do I say anything? Do I not? This is Tony Robbins. I don't want to mess with his flow.\"</p> <p>And finally he broke out of state and came to me and started asking me questions about my wife, my kids and my family and business and it was really cool. We kind of had a moment there just to reconnect, which was fun.</p> <p>Then he said, \"Okay, let's get started.\" So I kind of prepped him on script number one. He had three or four of his content team, who are these girls and they come and like do all the content stuff and they prep things for him. So he was asking questions and they were looking up all the answers for different things he was going to be talking about in the scripts to get exact numbers and stats and details and stuff.</p> <p>So they were looking things up and feeding him lines and everything. Then boom, we start recording. We got the first video done. Then we did the upsell video, then the second upsell video. And then we did a video for the coaching application for his high-ticket sales process.</p> <p>And then we were kind of done and we wrapped up. And so he's pulling the mic off and I'm like, \"Do you mind if I show you something really quick?\"</p> <p>He's like, \"Sure.\"</p> <p>So we had in the other room our laptops setup because we were building his funnel out in Click Funnels. He had heard about Click Funnels but I wanted to show it to him. I knew he hadn't actually seen it. I was like, \"Hey, check this out.\"</p> <p>So I showed him Click Funnels and he was like, \"Wow, this software looks amazing.\" Which we were just like, me and Dylan Jones, one of my Click Funnels partners, we were going nuts jumping around like, \"He thinks it's amazing.\"</p> <p>And then I showed him my book funnel. I was like, \"This is how it works. You see page-by-page how the stats are. You see the numbers and you see everything.\"</p> <p>He was like, \"This is amazing. This is more visibility than I had in my book launch.\"</p> <p>I was like, \"Yeah, that's why we use Click Funnels. It's amazing.\"</p> <p>And then he saw one of our stats, which was how many people filled out step one of the order form, but not step two. We had like 90,000 leads and then from that we had like 26,000 sold.</p> <p>He's like, \"Why is that number there?\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Well a lot of people fill in step one but they never fill in step two.\"</p> <p>He's like, \"We need to make a video to talk to those people.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"All right.\" So we ran back in the room, re-miked up, got everything ready. And then clicked record, and recorded him saying, \"Hey, I saw you filled out step one but not step two. What's the matter? You need to go get your credit card.\"</p> <p>It was really fun. We made a fun video there. We did that and then came back out and we showed him Click Funnels again, showed him the rest of the pages, showed him the pages we had started building for him.</p> <p>And he was really excited and then he said he had to go obviously. He gave me a hug and just basically thanked us for working on this project and said if I ever need anything that he's here for me, which was cool.</p> <p>He said that I'm one of the few internet marketers he trusts, which was cool. And then walked out the door and he was gone. It was 7:11 when he left, so he was there for almost exactly an hour.</p> <p>And when he left, we all were like, \"Ah\u2026\"</p> <p>We were stressing out so bad from everything. The room was freezing cold so we cranked the heat back up and we just sat there for like 10 minutes talking about how cool that was.</p> <p>And then we were like, \"We haven't eaten all day. We are starving.\" So we went down and ate and just talked for the rest of the day about how cool everything was. So that was the experience. It was amazing.</p> <p>We're just honored to be a part of it and to have a chance to help Tony and help him get his message and everything he's doing out to the world. We're just so grateful for him for allowing us to have that experience.</p> <p>Because it was so awesome for everyone who was involved and it was so exciting. So that is what happened. Now you guys know. And now hopefully our goal is to have this new funnel up and live by the end of the month.</p> <p>You guys have a chance to see it. So you should go buy the book and support him and support what he is doing, because it is amazing. All right, guys, that's all I got.</p> <p>I'm at the office, time to go work. Have some more fun and we'll talk to you guys soon!</p>", "duration": "14:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_142.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1438976778, "title": "Episode #141 \u2013 What\u2019s My #1 Supplement Of All Time\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Get secret access to, what Russell considers, the #1 supplement for entrepreneurs.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about a tool he\u2019s used the last few months to help his performance.

This is Russell and I want to welcome you to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right, everyone. So this is a special episode. I think this is the first episode that I'm going to tell you, you need to buy something. Usually I us this just as an outlet for me to talk about cool stuff and share stories and whatever.</p> <p>But I've never sold you guys anything, and I don't really want to sell this to you either. This will make more sense in a minute, but this is a tool that I've been using for the last two or three months that has given me a crazy performance increase and it's something that's not even live yet.</p> <p>You'll probably hear about it in like six months or so, but there's a little gap in the window right now that I can let you guys in. I think there's enough value that I'm sharing with you guys who are my faithful Marketing in Your Car listeners. It's not even something that I'm sharing with my list right now and probably never will.</p> <p>Maybe I will, but I'm not for sure because there's a reason. Okay, let me step back. This is the reason: it's a network marketing program. I had sworn of network marketing programs forever. I'm never going to do one again for a lot of reasons.</p> <p>But these guys sent me this product. I took it and the results that have come from it have been nothing short of amazing. And so because of that, I want you guys on it, not because I want you in MLM, because I don't care. Not because I want you to build a team, because I'm not building a team. None of that crap.</p> <p>Just because you need it. And so for some of you guys that's going to be enough I know because you'll take my word for it. Some of you guys might need a little more story, so I will give you a little more backstory.</p> <p>A lot of you guys know that I take on average anywhere from 40-60 different supplements every morning, mostly because I really enjoy taking supplements and the different effects that different ones give me. Some give me more energy, some give me more focus, some give me more different things.</p> <p>I'm very particular about what I put in my body. I test everything, I see what works and then things I like I stick with. So I'm also very much someone who is not big with synthetic things. I like clean, natural stuff like that.</p> <p>That's some of the premise. With that I always have friends who are like, \"Of all the 60 things you can take, what would be the best one?\" And it's hard because it depends on you. There's so many different variables and aspects.</p> <p>What are you looking for? Are you looking for more energy? More focus? More clarity? More endurance? More creativity? There are so many different things, so it's hard for me to just say, \"Take this one or this one.\"</p> <p>That is until now. There's one thing I've been taking that I would say if I was to get rid of everything and just take one thing each day, it would be this. In fact, over the last week or so it's all I have been taking. I've cut back most of my stuff.</p> <p>Because I want to feel the benefits of it isolated from everything else. So there's the nerdy chemical Russell talking. So there's the first part of the story.</p> <p>Second part of the story, some of you guys may have been following or have watched some of the bulletproof movement. Dave Asprey has become a friend and someone who is a hyper Click Funnels user. In fact, all of their pages outside the Wordpress blog now are built inside of Click Funnels, which is exciting.</p> <p>He introduced the whole concept of bulletproof coffee. It blew up. It went huge. It's been all over the news. It's been everywhere. He wrote a really good book called: The Bulletproof Diet.</p> <p>And I've got one problem with it though: I'm a Mormon. I don't drink coffee. So I could never use it. But I kept seeing all my friends having these dramatic, amazing experiences with bulletproof coffee.</p> <p>And so eventually I went and studied it to see how it works, and then I made a Mormon version of bulletproof coffee, which is kind of closer to bulletproof hot chocolate. Only it didn't taste very good.</p> <p>Anyway, I went back and forth and eventually over a four- or five-month period of time I figured out a way to make it amazing and I loved it. I loved all the effects the came from it. I love the clarity and mental focus and all these things. There's a whole study and a whole bunch of stuff behind high fat diets.</p> <p>In fact if you've listened to my podcast for the last couple years, you've probably heard me talk a little bit about some of those things. But from a \u201cmental ability to dominate my competitors\u201d standpoint, I say it with a laugh.</p> <p>But really, for me to be able to wake up and go to work and have mental clarity for an eight-hour day, the bulletproof Mormon version, the bulletproof hot chocolate, whatever you want to call it, it helped me more than anything, any of the supplements or the things that I take.</p> <p>The one problem is that unlike a lot of people, I never lost weight on it. In fact, the opposite came true. Earlier this year in January I was actually 222 pounds, the heaviest I had ever been in my life. I got my bodyfat measured and I was 25.9 percent which is also the highest it had ever been. I was depressed.</p> <p>Because I'm loving this bulletproof coffee concept. Everyone I know is losing weight on it except for me. I'm blowing up and getting fatter and fatter and fatter, even though I love all the external benefits that came from it.</p> <p>So I ended up stopping it because no matter how good it made me feel I couldn\u2019t keep gaining weight for all the obvious reasons. So I went back to more of a traditional bodybuilding diet, started losing some weight slowly and that's kind of where I was at.</p> <p>And then one day my friend sent me this thing in the mail. He said, \"Hey, I know you're doing the whole bulletproof thing.\"</p> <p>I said, \"No, I'm not doing it anymore because I'm getting fat.\"</p> <p>He's like, \"Well try this, man.\" He sent me like a week's worth of these sample packs and said, \"Try this out for a week. Go back on a high-fat diet, do everything you did before and just see what happens.\"</p> <p>And so I'm like, \"All right.\" I went back for a week, started taking these things. And two things happened. First off, this stuff tastes like candy. Not kidding. It tastes like somebody put a popsicle in a cup, melted it and you get to drink it. So that was awesome first off.</p> <p>The first time I took it was a Sunday. I was about to head out to church and hadn't eaten breakfast yet, so I downed the stuff really quickly because he had sent it to me. Then I had a busy day at church. I didn't get home until like 4:00 in the afternoon.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t eaten anything all day. When I got home my wife is making dinner and she's like, \"You hungry?\"</p> <p>I was like, \"I'm not. How am I not hungry? I should be starving right now. I'm not even tired.\" Usually if I don't eat during the day I'm tired.</p> <p>I was just like, \"I feel amazing. I've got energy. I feel full. I don't know what's happening. Oh wait, I took that thing this morning.\"</p> <p>Literally, one sample and I was sold. I called the guy up and I was like, \"Ship me as much as you can.\"</p> <p>He said, \"I can't. We're sold out.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"What do you mean you're sold out?\"</p> <p>He said, \"We're pre-launching right now. We only have X amount and it's gone.\"</p> <p>I was like, \"Dude, I need some.\" It took him about a month for him to ship me out a month's worth. So I had four or five weeks where I remembered what it was like but I couldn't get it.</p> <p>So I finally get the stuff. I start taking it again and it's amazing. I feel the same stuff but even more so than when I was doing bulletproof stuff. It's amazing. There's no fat in this stuff, so you get all the benefits and the clarity and the focus and all those things without the fats.</p> <p>You can do the high fat diet if you want. You don\u2019t have to. I was doing it. What was awesome is I got the benefits from it, but then what was cool for me is I started losing weight. And I found out later it's because this stuff lowers your blood sugar levels and gets of all your cravings.</p> <p>A whole bunch of really good things. I looked at my weight. I went from the end of January at 222 pounds to now, just by using this magic stuff, I am right now 196. So I am down a lot of pounds. 26, 28 pounds, something like that.</p> <p>And my bodyfat percentage is well below 20 percent now and it's plummeting. And I\u2019m not really doing much different. I was working out consistently before and working out consistently now. All I did was I just added this stuff and I'm able to get more done. More focus, more energy and I'm losing weight.</p> <p>So I am a big fan of it. I'm not trying to sell you on MLM. I just think you need it. You're an entrepreneur. You're trying to make money, you're trying to be successful. This is a tool you need.</p> <p>I gave it to my dad. He's addicted to it now. Half of the Click Funnels team is on it. The other half, I don't know if they're waiting for it, but eventually they will.</p> <p>So I just wanted to let you guys know about it. Right now it is sold out again. It's so funny. You can only buy it behind the scenes. It's really hard to get right now. Even with that, they're averaging $35,000 in sales a day.</p> <p>It's nuts. And so I ordered six boxes a month ago and so far one of those six boxes have come. The other ones are still on backorder. So to get it is hard, but it's going to get harder. I want you guys getting this ASAP.</p> <p>It's probably going to go live in two or three months to the public. That point is just two or three months away. If I was you, I wouldn't want to wait. I went nuts waiting six weeks. In fact, I'm nuts right now.</p> <p>I've got my kids on it right now. There's a version that has a little bit of caffeine and a version that's caffeine free. All my kids are on it, my wife is on it. And my kids are downing it so fast I'm almost out of it again.</p> <p>So anyway, I just wanted to let you guys in because this is a tool you guys need. If you're entrepreneurs, if you're high-performance, if you want to be more successful, you need this.</p> <p>So if you're interested, this is what you've got to do. Again, I feel stupid because this is not an MLM pitch. It's going to cost you $350 for month one. That will give you all the MLM crap, the info kit and all those kind of things that I don't really care about.</p> <p>But the cool this is you get basically two months' worth of product that first month. And after that I think it's $100 or $150 a month to keep getting it, which is totally worth it, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>So what I recommend doing is spend $350. You get the stuff that will give you enough for two months' worth. Just try it out and just see what happens. I promise you guys you're going to lose weight, you're going to feel better, you're going to be amazing. I can't even explain it.</p> <p>So if you have questions and you want me to answer a bunch of questions about it, sorry I'm not the kind of person that's going to do that because I'm not building MLM. I\u2019m not into that kind of stuff. I'm not recruiting you. I'm not doing anything.</p> <p>I'm saying if you trust my opinion on supplements as someone who takes 50-60 supplements a day, if you trust my opinion on it and you want to achieve more in a shorter period of time and you're in, you say, \"I trust Russell, I'm in.\" Then I've got a secret thing planned out for you guys.</p> <p>It is for Marketing in Your Car people. I haven't set up the page yet but I'll set it up tonight. If you got to RussellBrunson.com/ what should we call it? We'll call it insider.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.RussellBrunson.com/insider\">www.RussellBrunson.com/insider</a>. Go there and I'll have a little form. All you have to do on that form is put your name and your email address and say, \"I'm in.\"</p> <p>When you fill that out it's going to send me an email. I'm going to manually go into my back office and I'm going to type in your email address. It's going to send you an invite and then you have 24 hours to go and spend $350 for the first kit.</p> <p>That's it. You'll get the stuff. And if you don't think it's freaking amazing, then you're crazy. If you do think it's amazing, then I get it. The other thing I'm going to put on that page is I was so inspired and loved the product so much that one night after I took it I sat down and I wrote an explainer video script for these guys.</p> <p>And it's not done being animated yet, but the script and the sketch is there so I'll put it on the page. It will help you understand why the product works. So if nothing else, just go read that script. You'll be like, \"That's pretty cool,\" and you'll see that video when it comes out in a couple months.</p> <p>That way you'll get kind of the gist of what it is. If you're in, just name, email and you're in. I expect if you fill that form out, you need to sign up in 24 hours because your invitation will expire and that's going to be your one shot.</p> <p>I'm not selling you anything. I\u2019m not looking for fence sitters. If you're interested in testing it out, test it out. I promise you guys will love it. So that's the game plan.</p> <p>Again, what did I say? <a href=\"http://www.RussellBrunson.com/insider\">www.RussellBrunson.com/insider</a>\u00a0and I'll have a form there tonight. My brother should post the podcast tomorrow so we'll see these coming in.</p> <p>This is a very limited thing. When the site goes live, it will pull away. One of the things I'll give you as a bonus, for anyone who signs up, what's today's date? I'm looking at my phone right now. Today's date is the 6th of August.</p> <p>How about this, my anniversary is August 10th. So if you have ordered by August 10th through that link that I send you guys, I should get your address. If not, I'll ask for it. I will ship you out a box of our Ignite supplement.</p> <p>It's a pre-workout drink that tastes amazing. It gives you tons of energy and it's something we use when we're doing our hackathons. Don\u2019t take it every day, but take it whenever you need extra energy to make it through a long all-nighter trying to get some stuff done.</p> <p>I'll send you guys a free box of that. That expires August 10th, so if you guys are listening to the podcast on August 12th or any time in the future, you can't get that bonus. But that one is good till the 10th. I'll just get your address and I'll ship you out a box of that for free as a gift for trusting me.</p> <p>And I promise you guys will love it. So that's the game plan. That's all I've got. So I apologize for pitching you guys. I don\u2019t normally do this. It's been 150 episodes and I've never done that. But it's something that you guys want and you need. I will make money if you sign up, but that's not why I'm doing this.</p> <p>I'm doing this because of how much more money you guys will make when you have more focus, mental clarity and the weight loss that you guys want. So that's the game plan. I appreciate you guys. Have an awesome day. You can go to <a href=\"http://www.RussellBrunson.com/insider\">www.RussellBrunson.com/insider</a>\u00a0and let me know if you're in. All right, thanks guys.</p>", "duration": "13:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_141.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1438623741, "title": "Episode #140 \u2013 Do You Ever Take A Break?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The answer may shock you\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how he is able to take breaks and spend enough time with his wife and kids and yet still meet deadlines.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Hear how Russell was able to pass his classes and get on the honor roll at BYU after barely graduating from high school.</li> <li>Find out how he was able to take what he learned on how to pass classes in college and apply it to his business.</li> <li>And hear how he is able to meet deadlines and still spend a ton of quality time with his family.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how Russell is able to have a successful business life without sacrificing his family life.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hi everybody, welcome to today. I hope it\u2019s been amazing for you. I\u2019ve been having an awesome morning routine. I\u2019m working on trying to perfect my morning routine, making it a consistent part of my day and trying to figure out what things I like and things I don\u2019t like, and a whole bunch of really fun stuff like that.</p> <p>I had a good one today. I had a really fun, woke up early in the morning with Nora about 6:30 and then played with her while I was getting my supplements ready, and she fell asleep and went out to the new wrestling room and worked out, and then I got back from there, went and woke up all my kids and jumped in the pool and swam.</p> <p>Anyway, it was amazing. I\u2019m really liking the new morning routine and trying to get it perfected because I might - I may have just bought <a href=\"http://www.WhatsYourMorningRoutine.com\">WhatsYourMorningRoutine.com</a>. I may be making a video here in the near future showing it. I\u2019m trying to perfect it right now because what I have found is that what you do in the morning is kind of what the rest of your day is going to be like.</p> <p>How do we perfect that? I\u2019m excited. Anyway I had a really cool question this weekend from a friend and a listener. I thought it was something that\u2019s probably good to touch upon. His question was, \u201cRussell, do you ever take a break or are you always working? Are you home for a little bit and then try to sneak back out to go back to the office and things like that?\u201d</p> <p>I thought that was a good question that I wanted to address for a couple of reasons. First off, I don\u2019t want you guys thinking that all I do is work even though I do a lot of work. Second off, I want to kind of just address what the purpose of our whole reason why we got in this business is for.</p> <p>That\u2019s my game plan for today\u2019s message. The question is, \u201cDo I ever take a break?\u201d The answer is yes. In fact, I try to take more breaks than I do all-nighters -- a lot more of them. You know, I\u2019m a big believer - in fact, I spoke this weekend at one of my friend\u2019s events.</p> <p>One of the people asked me a question like, \u201cRussell, how do you get so much stuff done?\u201d and I kind of told him, \u201cYou know, the way I get lots of stuff done is probably kind of messed up compared to how the rest of the world gets things done.\u201d</p> <p>I talked about when I was in college, you guys know I really struggled in college but I remember I had this I think engineering or some kind of class. I remember in that class they talked about a concept called JIT production -- just in time production -- where you get everything done just in time for things to be done.</p> <p>I remember when we talked about that, it made sense to me. I remember thinking about as a student, I always struggled with, \u201cHey, you\u2019re going to have finals at the end of the semester.\u201d A lot of my friends who were really good students would be good at every night, they would study for 20 or 30 minutes.</p> <p>By the time the final came, they knew the information and they would pass the test. I could never do that. I tried. In fact, I guess that\u2019s why I think I hated high school was I was always trying to study. \u201cJust study so you know all this stuff better,\u201d but it seems so pointless. Why am I - anyway, it just drove me crazy.</p> <p>I remember my first year in college, I went to BYU. I shouldn\u2019t have been at BYU for a lot of reasons but the main one was I wasn\u2019t an academic smart kid. In fact, I applied for BYU and I got a letter back saying, \u201cSorry Russell, you\u2019re not smart enough to attend our university.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cOh, that sucks,\u201d and then two weeks later, I was at the high school national tournament. I ended up taking second in the country, came in All American, and when I was there, all these coaches started, \u201cHey, we want you to come to ASU, we want you to come here,\u201d all these places.</p> <p>Then I remember that day I saw the BYU coach. He said, \u201cHey, we want you to come to BYU.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I applied and failed.\u201d He laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we take care of our athletes.\u201d The next week, I got a letter from BYU saying, \u201cCongratulations, we reevaluated your application and you\u2019re in!\u201d</p> <p>I ended up going to BYU. I was there and school was not a little bit harder, it was a lot harder, way over my head. I had to really work hard and focus to be able to just pass whereas high school I could just do what I needed to do, and I would pass. This is like just to get a passing grade, I had to work really hard.</p> <p>BYU, they have a testing center. What happens is final weeks, everything shuts down and you can pick whenever you want to take your finals. I\u2019m taking my math final Monday, my science final Tuesday, and whatever that is.</p> <p>What I would do is I would schedule my test so Monday night at 8 PM, I\u2019m taking the math test. I wake up super early Monday morning, and I lock myself in the basement. I would read the entire math book in a day so everything is in my head.</p> <p>Then I would go take the test, and pass it. Then the next day, \u201cOkay, today is science,\u201d and I would wake up super early, study for 18 hours, learn everything, read the entire manual again and jump in and take the science test and pass. I would do that through all my tests.</p> <p>It gave me the ability to compress what most people were doing over six, eight, ten weeks, whatever and get it done in a day and still be able to pass. I actually got really good grades at BYU. I actually even made -- you guys will be proud of me -- the honors list.</p> <p>I was on the athletic honors board which was pretty cool since I never got over a 3.0 in high school, and got a 3.4 at BYU and I was on the board of the smart athletes, smart student athletes which is still funny to me.</p> <p>Anyway, I was looking at my business and it\u2019s very similar. I don\u2019t plan things well. We have our certification program coming up in two weeks. Everyone is like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the plan? What\u2019s happening? We need a schedule. We need dates and times, all this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cDo you guys honestly think I\u2019ve started preparing it yet? That would be foolish of me.\u201d If I started preparing now, a couple things would happen. First off, I\u2019d get scope creep. It would getting bigger and bigger, and I would somehow magically fill all of the time it would take for the next two weeks.</p> <p>Nothing else would get done. That by the way is why most entrepreneurs are failing in life because you try to plan things out six weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks in advance. Because of that, you spend so much time doing all the stupid stuff that doesn\u2019t matter, you never have success.</p> <p>Whereas for me I say, \u201cOkay, the certification program is this date.\u201d I back up to how long I think it\u2019s going to get that done. For me, it\u2019s about two days of planning and preparation. I know the two days prior to the certification program starting, I\u2019m going to start working on it.</p> <p>During that two days, I\u2019m going to call my wife and she will know ahead of time -- plenty of time, two weeks in advance -- that I will not be home these two nights. I\u2019m going to be pulling all-nighters, whatever it takes to get this stuff done, and she\u2019ll be okay with that. Now this is a lesson for the men.</p> <p>If you call your wife at six PM the night of and say, \u201cHey hun, I got to pull an all-nighter tonight,\u201d she will resent you and be upset and angry. You tell her two weeks in advance, she\u2019s cool with it, not a big deal.</p> <p>That\u2019s what I do. I tell her two weeks in advance what\u2019s going to happen. Then I get in there and lock myself down. I don\u2019t leave until it\u2019s finished. Now most of the time you guys hear from me are during times like that when I\u2019m in crunch time and I\u2019m pulling all-nighters because that\u2019s when it\u2019s really fun to talk to you and share stories.</p> <p>That\u2019s what\u2019s happening but that is not an all the time type thing. They\u2019re very finite periods of planned crunch time. It\u2019s just like me going to college. I\u2019m locking myself in the room and reading the entire exam book so that when I take the exam, I\u2019m prepared.</p> <p>That\u2019s how I work on my life. In between those times, I have a lot of things that are happening but I\u2019m very big on deadlines. I know that this is due on this date, and then I backdate what I need to get done, and then if it\u2019s going to be one of those things where I know it\u2019s going to be a lot of extra time, then I know it\u2019s going to be an all-nighter or whatever, I just plan that ahead of time.</p> <p>But most of the time I don\u2019t. Most of the time, my goal -- and I\u2019m not perfect at this but I\u2019m trying to. I\u2019m getting better at it is that I try really big to be present wherever I\u2019m at. For example, this week my goal is I\u2019m working -- it\u2019s 10:30 right now. I woke up this morning and did my morning routine, hung out with my kids, had some fun, hitting the office now, 10:30.</p> <p>I will be leaving the office at five o\u2019clock today. On my drive home, I\u2019ll talk to some of my coaching clients to get that done. When I get to my house, I will turn my phones off. I will leave them in the car, and I will be present for my wife and my kids.</p> <p>That will be my break. That night, I will come home, we\u2019re going to goof off and have some fun, jump on the trampoline with them, have dinner. We might go on a walk, put the kids to bed. I\u2019ll hang out with my wife. We may watch TV, whatever it\u2019s going to be but I\u2019m present and there with them in that time.</p> <p>That\u2019s my break. The reason why my wife is okay with me saying, \u201cHey, these two days, I\u2019m not coming home because I need to get stuff done,\u201d because the other days, she knows that I\u2019m there and I\u2019m present and I\u2019m hanging out with them.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to make those times as amazing as possible. That\u2019s kind of how I do it. Yes, I do take brakes as often as possible. In fact, everyday I\u2019m trying to take a break from five or six o\u2019clock at night until midnight.</p> <p>Some of my friends always tease me, \u201cRussell, how in the world do you do all this stuff plus have time to watch all these shows and all this other stuff?\u201d That\u2019s why because I know that when it\u2019s time to get crap done, I get crap done and when it\u2019s time to have fun and just be present, I make that time and I try to protect it and guard it as much as I can.</p> <p>Again, I\u2019m not perfect. If you ask my wife, she\u2019ll say, \u201cI know Russell sneaks out. He checks his phone sometimes,\u201d and I\u2019m not perfect by any stretch but I\u2019m trying to be and I\u2019m getting better at it. While you guys hear a lot of the crazy all-nighters and those kind of things, that\u2019s not the majority of my time.</p> <p>If it was, I would burn out and crash, and be really tired, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to have a functioning life and family, and kids, and everything else that\u2019s really the reason why we got in this business. I tell entrepreneurs all the time that one of the biggest challenges they\u2019re going to have is not becoming success.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to be when you become successful, you\u2019ll become so addicted to the process that a lot of times, you will give up the main reason why you got into this. You know, people get in because they want time freedom, more time with their wife or kids, or their family, whatever it is.</p> <p>They become so addicted with it that they give up their wife and kids and their family, and they keep doing it. I\u2019ve been in that spot in my life before and in my business before. I\u2019m trying to make up for those things now and make changes, and try not to have that.</p> <p>I just want to stress for you guys that this whole business, this game is fun. It\u2019s too much fun sometimes but it\u2019s not the point. I think that sometimes we think it\u2019s the point. I had a friend recently who was having some marital issues and was struggling.</p> <p>It was an issue between the business and their spouse. I just said, \u201cLook, this business is a game. It\u2019s stupid. It has no real purpose whatsoever outside of something to entertain us. Your family is the only thing that really matters.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a famous prophet in our church and he said, \u201cNo success can compensate for failure in the homes,\u201d David O. McKay. I\u2019m a big believer in that. In fact, one of my close friends and mentors, David Fry, every time he speaks on stage, he says that.</p> <p>He says, \u201cBefore I get started ,I want to talk about something important.\u201d He says, \u201cNo success can compensate for failure in the home.\u201d It\u2019s true. Business success, this stuff is all stupid. It\u2019s a game. It doesn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>When we die, it\u2019s gone. The only thing that really matters is our relationships, our family, what we do with our spouses, how we treat our kids, and who we help them to become. Don\u2019t forget that part. Don\u2019t get so obsessed with the journey and the money, and the joy outside that we forget about the reason why we actually got in this business, the reason why we actually do what we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Hope that helps you guys a little bit. If you haven\u2019t take a vacation for awhile, schedule one in. Block out the time. I was listening to Garrett J White, the master coach and mentor, friend, and a really cool guy. The message he keeps sharing over and over again is talking about if you want to have it all, you got to schedule things.</p> <p>You got to schedule time for your wife and for your kids. You need to have date night once a week and all these kinds of things. It was just really kind of refreshing, the message for me this morning as I was thinking, \u201cYes, I\u2019m moving towards that direction of having more fun.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, my wife and I had an amazing date last week. You know, normally when we\u2019d have a date, we\u2019d wait two or three weeks before our next date. This morning, after I listened to Garrett, I walked into the house.</p> <p>This is after I got out of the pool with the kids. I said, \u201cCollette, we got a date tomorrow.\u201d She said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you. Just bring your swimming suit. It\u2019s going to be amazing.\u201d That\u2019s the game plan.</p> <p>Once a week, a bunch of other cool stuff; anyway, appreciate you guys. I\u2019m at the office, going to put in a full day and then go home and take a break and be with the kids, be with my wife because that is why we do what we do.</p> <p>I hope you guys have a great day today and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "13:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_140.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1438358104, "title": "Episode #139 \u2013 What The Hack-A-Thon Means To You", "author": "", "summary": "<p>All the cool stuff you\u2019re going to get inside of Clickfunnels because of this month\u2019s hack-a-thon.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks with a special guest, Steven Asketsos, who is here all the way from Australia for the hack-a-thon.</p> <p>Here are a few fun things you\u2019ll here in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What kinds of things are happening with the hack-a-thon.</li> <li>And some cool things that have changed with Clickfunnels.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how Steven feels about the hack-a-thon and the Clickfunnels changes.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Russell Brunson: Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson.</p> <p>Steven Asketsos: And this is Steven Asketsos.</p> <p>Russell: And we are here in an exciting Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Russell: Hey everyone, so we have been in the middle of a hack-a-thon as you guys know. I\u2019ve done some podcasts on the way home. I\u2019m here today because one of our newest additions to Click Funnels, we flew him here from Australia and he\u2019s been hanging out for his first hack-a-thon.</p> <p>I want to get in his own words what it\u2019s been like to be on the inside. Do you want to tell everyone what it\u2019s been like?</p> <p>Steven: Yes, it\u2019s been pretty crazy. I flew up 32 hours to meet these guys and I don\u2019t know what I was getting myself into but I got here in the end I think with four different airplane flights, went through five airports but I got here at midnight.</p> <p>First day was awesome. We\u2019re just smashing our work. Russell introduced me to the team. I met Dillon, Winter, Todd, Ryan - absolutely awesome team, finally get to see how Click Funnels has been so successful.</p> <p>It\u2019s been awesome to work with everyone, and we\u2019ve been smashing it. We\u2019ve been hustling it out till four AM every night and really putting the hard hours in. I think you guys are going to be really pumped to see what\u2019s going to come out in the next few weeks. We got some really cool things planned.</p> <p>Russell: Awesome. Talk about day two, what happened because we had a special guest come hang out with us.</p> <p>Steven: Yes, that\u2019s right. On day two, we had Mr. Neil Patell join us. I\u2019m sure you guys are familiar with Neil with KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg, and Hello Bar, and I think there are a few other companies he\u2019s founded with Quick Sprout and whatnot but oh gosh, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.</p> <p>Russell: We\u2019re off-roading it.</p> <p>Steven: Off-roading in a new car - only Russell would do this. Anyway, Neil came down and he shared some epic, epic takeaways with us from what he\u2019s doing in his own companies, how we can grow our company. Yes, he\u2019s been killing it on the content marketing side.</p> <p>He just dropped absolutely golden nuggets. Hopefully you guys are going to see the awesome blog posts come and see some of the value that\u2019s going to come onto the blog side of things as well.</p> <p>Russell: Yes, it\u2019s going to be awesome. Steven joined the team to help us with all the content stuff so we thought we should hire the man Neil Patel to come in and coach us on that so that we could do it right. It was good.</p> <p>I think we were going in a good direction but he helped steer us, \u201cThis is the perfect way to do it.\u201d It\u2019s been fun to see what you\u2019re able to do with this as your baby in the company now, some exciting stuff. The last five minutes before we just jumped in the car, basically Dillon got excited and wanted to launch everything he\u2019s been working on for the last year, all in one month.</p> <p>We filmed a video. You guys will probably see it on Facebook or through email or somewhere. We are basically launching pretty much everything, all the rest of the stuff in August. That means first off, there\u2019s a brand new UI that\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>It looks like a whole new company. It\u2019s simpler. It\u2019s stripped out, all this kind of stuff. It\u2019s awesome, a new homepage, the new site which I spent the whole week building which I think I\u2019m proud of it.</p> <p>Steven:\u00a0 Yes, it\u2019s pretty good.</p> <p>Russell: I\u2019m not going to lie. That\u2019s kind of cool. Then we\u2019ve got Backpack is going live so everyone will have the affiliate program inside their accounts here in August. The dream car contest is going live so you can win the Corvette I\u2019m driving in or whatever car you want.</p> <p>Actionetics which I thought was going to be another two months before it\u2019s coming out is now happening this month, and we got accounts yesterday. It\u2019s nuts.</p> <p>Steven: It\u2019s crazy. People are going to be blown away.</p> <p>Russell: Yes, I feel bad for every other auto responder company on planet earth literally. Yes, it\u2019s amazing. Imagine editing emails in the Click Funnels email editor.</p> <p>Steven: Oh, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It\u2019s actually like - I don\u2019t want to swear but it is absolutely amazing. To do something so easily, I personally was telling Russell this earlier, about half an hour ago. I hate emails.</p> <p>I hate making them, I hate sending them but as soon as I logged into this, it was pretty amazing. It felt like I was at home. It felt like I was finally able to just dive deep in and everything was just done for me the way I like it.</p> <p>I think you can\u2019t get much better than that. I think you guys are going to have a lot of fun creating emails, the same way that when you first jumped into Click Funnels and you started playing around with funnels, and you were just locked in there for three hours and you didn\u2019t come out of your bedroom or you didn\u2019t see your kids, or you didn\u2019t see your wife and you got yelled at, you would be the same with your email editor.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to be a rollercoaster ride. I can\u2019t wait to see it come out.</p> <p>Russell: Anyway, you guys are going to love it. We just wanted to give you a quick update because the end of the hack-a-thon is here. It\u2019s like two or three or four in the morning, dropping Steven off at the hotel and just wanted to say hey to everybody.</p> <p>He has been listening to Marketing in Your Car since day one, and now he\u2019s on officially Marketing in Your Car which is exciting. So I appreciate you guys, thanks for listening. Thank you for being here.</p> <p>Steven: Thank you for listening guys and it\u2019s been awesome, thanks Russell.</p> <p>Russell: All right, we\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "05:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_139.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1438186281, "title": "Episode #138 \u2013 Hanging Out With Neil Patel \u2013 Part 2", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My afterthoughts from our \u201cconsult day\u201d with the LEGENDARY Neil Patel\u2026</p> <p>On this second part episode Russell talks about working with Neil Patel and what some of the cool things he got from him are.</p> <p>Here are some interesting you\u2019ll hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What the biggest internal benefit of working with Neil is.</li> <li>What the biggest external benefit of working with Neil is.</li> <li>And find out what the differences are between how Russell does things, and how Neil does things and why both ways are awesome.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear some of the cool things Russell got from Neil Patel to help him see his business through a new and different lens.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone! This is Russell, and welcome to Neil Patel Part Two of Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone! So I just finished our one-day consult with Neil, and it was pretty awesome. So we had a good time, and it\u2019s kind of reconfirmed to me the power in what we kind of talked about in yesterday\u2019s podcast. So if you haven\u2019t listened to that one, yeah, pause this one, go back to that one, and then come back.</p> <p>So I was talking about, you know, how to compress like a decade worth of experience into a day, and hiring people who are amazing, and paying them to have them come and do that with you in your company and get a new set of eyes on what you\u2019re doing. So we had Neil come out today, and I suppose you don\u2019t know Neil Patel.</p> <p>You can go see Google and he\u2019s all over the place, but it\u2019s been interesting because one of the big jokes was like everything that we do to grow a company, everything he does is completely opposite. And they\u2019re both really, really good, but both of us focus on one and not the other.</p> <p>So I had a chance today just to pick his brain on what he\u2019s doing and how he\u2019s doing it, and really figuring out how we could take those concepts and build them into a system of what we\u2019re doing, and hopefully use that to dramatically grow and increase all of our revenues and everything.</p> <p>And so it was exciting, and it was fun to see. Not that it\u2019s simple, because it\u2019s not, but just to see simplicity of like, \u201cThis is what I actually do day by day, like, this is the process, this is how I do it, this is why I do it, this is\u2026\u201d and showing us that and like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s doable!\u201d</p> <p>Like I can actually do that. It\u2019s not that difficult, and so anyway, it was exciting and it was cool from that standpoint. So that\u2019s kind of like the core benefit, right? That\u2019s like the main reason why I wanted to do it, but there\u2019s a lot of like really cool external benefits that come from experiencing this as well.</p> <p>And it\u2019s funny, I look at some of the companies that hired us and me to come out and do more one-on-one consulting stuff, and I haven\u2019t done a ton of them, but the ones I\u2019ve done, I have noticed similar things.</p> <p>Like one of them is, is you build a really solid relationship with that person, it\u2019s like I feel like Neil and I and our team are like, we\u2019re close friends now, which is kind of cool. Where there are things that we\u2019ve kind of figured out from being here that I\u2019m going to help him with in his company.</p> <p>He\u2019s going to be helping us with ours, and now it\u2019s kind of like this really cool mutual ability to work together, which wouldn\u2019t have been there. Or at least, it wasn\u2019t there before. I mean, not that we couldn\u2019t have done it through other methods or other means, but it\u2019s kind of like what I mentioned.</p> <p>You know the whole concept of either working your way in or buying your way in, and it really speeds up the process if you go and buy your way in a lot of times, right? So that was like one thing that was really cool, we got from everything.</p> <p>It is that, another cool thing is, everyone\u2019s got different connections. There are all sorts of connections and he asked the people that we don\u2019t, and so he was making introductions and connecting us to all these different people and resources we need to get where we needed to go, which was really cool.</p> <p>He also like he took it like, my goals and my focus for our company, versus like what Neil\u2019s -- they\u2019re very different, like paths where we\u2019re trying to go, and there\u2019s definitely pros and cons of each of them, but he was able to kind of help me and us see why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, and the value that we can get from looking at that and modeling it.</p> <p>You know, we may not have the same end goal, but looking at what he looks like, for example, what\u2019s interesting with ourselves, our company, what we\u2019re focusing on is revenue, right? Like how much money can we pull out and put in the bank? But that\u2019s what we look at, but his goal is the opposite.</p> <p>He\u2019s trying to get mass user base and then sell for a huge multiple down the road, like that\u2019s kind of his angle, what he\u2019s trying to do on his, and so his goal is less, like \u201cI don\u2019t really want or need profit, I just need more customers and more customers and more customers.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s the side that he\u2019s really focusing on hard, and so it\u2019s kind of interesting because you see, you know, you see those two different variations and it\u2019s like, well, how can we do what we\u2019re doing to stay profitable and then but also add what he\u2019s doing just to amass the user, you know, increase the user?</p> <p>Like how can we do it profitably? And anyway, it just gives you a whole different perspective on how to look at your business and what you\u2019re doing, and all those kinds of things, which is fun. So I really enjoyed that.</p> <p>What else was cool? A lot of cool things\u2026 Oh, the other cool thing, which was kind of interesting, like seeing how he and the really successful software companies are\u2026</p> <p>You know, like their actual funnel, how do they generate traffic virtually, upsell the lead, like the whole process and path, and looking at different steps, I think, in that funnel that I haven\u2019t really -- or we in our team haven\u2019t really focused that closely on.</p> <p>One of the big things he said is like, \u201cYou guys have more traffic than you need. You just need to fill a couple of these holes.\u201d Which is funny because like that\u2019s almost word for word what I would have told someone. I was consulting, but because it\u2019s my own business like I didn\u2019t see that.</p> <p>Like we\u2019re trying to focus on jamming more people in, as opposed to filling holes at the same time, and it\u2019s just fun having a new set of eyes and looking at conversion points and what we\u2019re doing, what we\u2019re doing right, what we\u2019re doing wrong.</p> <p>And in fact, we set up a bunch of split tests while we were there, and it\u2019s going to be fun to see kind of what the winners end up being, next day or so.</p> <p>Anyway, it was really, really cool to get a new perspective, meet a cool person and look at our company, our business, our future through a different set of eyes, through different lenses. I think it\u2019s something that was really valuable for me and for our team, which should be valuable for you guys as well.</p> <p>So not saying you need hire Neil or me or anyone, but I would say look at your company, look at your business, look at your life. It might be a relationship, it might be weight loss, it might be whatever it is, but you can go and spend the next 10 years trying to get to where you\u2019re trying to get to, or you can find someone who\u2019s gone that path.</p> <p>Find out what it costs for a day of their time, hire them, fly them out, and just get them to look at what you\u2019re doing, and I promise you will shave off years and years of time by kind of making those little tweaks.</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of, I guess on my side, just some of my advice and some of my thoughts after going through that process today, and it was really, really cool.</p> <p>So I\u2019m heading home now to go play with the kids, going to go jump in the pool and have a good time, and then I\u2019m probably going to head back in a little later tonight.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got, I think I told you guys yesterday, our whole team is here for a Hack-A-Thon, and so we are working our butts off, and it\u2019s been really, really fun, and so they\u2019re there at the office. They\u2019re working right now, and I\u2019m going to go play with the kids for a bit, and then head back in and\u2026</p> <p>Man, I totally almost got in a wreck right there. If you wondered why I was like speaking slow for a second, it\u2019s because this new car, the Corvette that I\u2019m driving -- which is the car given away for our Dream Car Contest -- it\u2019s a stick shift and I\u2019m getting used to driving a stick again, and so I\u2019ve got my phone.</p> <p>When I\u2019m recording this on my left hand, I\u2019m trying to shift and steer with my right hand, and I totally just almost\u2026 Anyway, it would have been awesome, but we survived it. You and I, we\u2019re all here together.</p> <p>All right, guys. Anyway, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m at, but I will leave you with that for today. I hope you guys are having an amazing time, learning a lot of stuff and growing your companies, and with that, I will say goodbye.</p> <p>We\u2019ll talk to you guys soon. Thanks, everyone!</p>", "duration": "07:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_138.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1438104551, "title": "Episode #137 \u2013 Hanging Out With Neil Patel \u2013 Part 1", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My thoughts the night before I have a chance to pick Neil Patel\u2019s brain for an entire day.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how he hired Neil Patel to help him see his business through a different lens.

This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to Marketing In Your Car!</p> <p>Everyone, so I am heading home from the office today. We had a good time. The hack-a-thon officially begun. We\u2019ve got all of our developers and partners and friends here in Boise, and we are going crazy this week getting some new big, fun things rolled out in ClickFunnels, which is going to be exciting. You guys will see some new UI tweaks this week coming out. You\u2019re going to see, hopefully next week we\u2019ll be launching Backpack to the world, and I can start using Actionetics tomorrow.</p> <p>So a lot of fun stuff is happening there and things that you guys are going to love, so good stuff\u2019s happening there, and I want to talk to you about something, though, that I am excited for.</p> <p>So tomorrow Neil Patel from QuickSprout.com and from NeilPatel.com and from what other sites does he own? From Kissmetrics.com and CrazyEgg.com and a whole bunch of other ones.</p> <p>Anyway, we hired Neil to come and do a one-day consult with us, which is kind of exciting. He\u2019s going to come and tomorrow we are going to lock down and just pick his brain for as much as we can and get some good ideas from a conversion standpoint on our site, from marketing, from trying to figure out how to implement his content strategy to a bunch of other things.</p> <p>And I wanted to tell you guys that for a couple of reasons. One is I\u2019m exited, and number two is that what we are doing is we are shortcutting.</p> <p>We\u2019ve a program that I called Decade In A Day, and I got that name from Tony Robbins, who talked about why he loves books.</p> <p>He says, you know, you\u2019ll take an author. He spends a decade of his life learning a concept, and you have a chance to go, and in a day, read and get a compressed version of all that and instantly get a decade worth of information in a day.</p> <p>And so, we created a program called Decade In A Day, which has been a really fun process, but I\u2019m kind of doing that right now with Neil. You know, I\u2019ve studied his stuff. I\u2019ve looked at his thing, trying to figure out what he\u2019s doing, trying to reverse engineer, and we were adding things into what we\u2019re doing, but we just haven\u2019t done it 100 percent.</p> <p>I mean, probably not even 90, not even 10 percent, and I think the big part of it is just, you know, one is there\u2019s still like these little unknowns or exactly how little pieces of what he does works.</p> <p>But then, there\u2019s also like there\u2019s something about that financial investment, so we paid Neil $25,000 for the day. We flew him out and everything to beautiful Boise, Idaho, and now we\u2019ve got 25-grand on the line, like now we are way more like they actually implement it.</p> <p>In fact, after we basically agreed to pay him, then I was like, \u201cWell, what do we need to make this happen? Will we need somebody to be in charge of the blog and the content and all these kinds of things?\u2019</p> <p>So we hired a new person on our team to focus on that, and we started doing a bunch of other things to get ready for this experience now that it\u2019s happening tomorrow.</p> <p>And now that it\u2019s happening, he\u2019s flying out here, and in a day we\u2019re going to compress a decade worth of his information. Ideas and thoughts into our company into ClickFunnels and then from there we\u2019ll see how fast we can implement it.</p> <p>But now that we\u2019ve made that financial investment, now we\u2019ve got the people and the resources and things in place to be able to implement it. Now we\u2019re actually going to run with it. Whereas, again, I\u2019ve been reading Neil\u2019s stuff for three or four years and honestly haven\u2019t implemented much of it.</p> <p>And part of it is because we haven\u2019t put a big enough investment in, and part of it is just it\u2019s always fun to have this processer. This thing where someone comes and you kind of get a brain dump and then you have the fuel you need to run forward.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening tomorrow and I think it\u2019s cool, and I just wanted to kind of talk to you guys about it for a couple reasons: One is two weeks ago I had somebody that, with me, they read the DotCom Secrets book and then they said, \u201cHey Russell\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It actually his name is Tim Schmidt. The guy\u2019s awesome like probably one of the coolest people I think I\u2019ve ever met in my life. And he called us up and said, \u201cRussell, I want you to come and train my staff for two days and pay this $100,000 to come and do it.</p> <p>And it was the same kind of concept where he basically wanted to compress a decade of my time into two days and jam it into his staff and give them all this -- everything we\u2019ve been doing -- and giving it a very focused, finite period of time.</p> <p>But now, he\u2019s got 20 or so of his team members, all on the same page, all speaking the same language, all running the same direction. And you know, for me, I thought, if someone like Tim is going to do that for me, like I need to be willing to do that for me and my company and for what we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>And so Neil was kind of the first person we did that with, and we\u2019re going to, I think, continue to do this where we find people like where are we struggling and where are we weak. Or where do we want to go? Who\u2019s already been there, and then try to spend the next two or three years running there.</p> <p>Like let\u2019s hire that person and bring him in for a day, or for two days or whatever it is. Let\u2019s get the information out of their brain, implement it into our company, and run with it and see how much faster that we can make these huge leaps and bounds in our company.</p> <p>I think I\u2019ve shared this story once on a podcast. It could have been two or three years ago. I have no idea now, so for those of you guys who are just getting into Marketing In Your Car, you should go back through and listen to all the old ones so you can find the story because it was really good.</p> <p>But there was a guy when I first got started in this business. I remember I went to Armand\u2019s Big Seminar, and I met this guy and he was telling me about all these different seminars and mastermind groups and all these things he was going to, and then when he was at the event he signed up and he signed up for like all these people\u2019s back and packaged them.</p> <p>Like \u201cDude, how do have so much money? Like I would love to do all these things, but I can't afford, you know, 10-grand here, 20-grand here, 5-grand here, and I\u2019m like how in the world did you do this?\u201d</p> <p>And he said, \u201cOh, well, I got a little list of people, and everyone on my list they want to learn this stuff.\u201d And he said, \u201cIn my experience there\u2019s two ways to get to the top.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cYou can work your way in, or you can buy your way in. You know, I\u2019m a big believer in just buying my way in.\u201d He\u2019s like \u201cI don\u2019t want to go and work for the next five years to try to learn what Armand knows and this guy knows and this guy knows.</p> <p>He says I just want to buy my way in and buy myself into the top. And he said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have any money for that, so I went to my little list and I kind of explained to them my concept and my process and how I like to buy my way in.\u201d</p> <p>And I told them, \u201cHere\u2019s the mastermind groups and events I\u2019m going to go to. Obviously, you guys all can't go, too, because it\u2019s really, really expensive. But if everyone will throw in some money, I\u2019ll then go attend all these and then bring back the information and share with you guys what I learned.\u201d</p> <p>Again, I can't remember the numbers. It\u2019s been like almost 12 years ago that I met this guy, but he told me, I believe, at that time, he said he had 14 people paying $10,000 for him to go join all these mastermind groups.</p> <p>So he got $140,000 in cash and he went to join all these groups, learn as much as he could, and he came back to this group that paid him $10,000 each and just shared with them what he learned from all these other groups.</p> <p>And I was like, first off, that\u2019s brilliant. Second off, like that\u2019s I think something that too much of us don\u2019t do is, you know, again you can work your way in and spend years trying to get to a certain spot, or find who\u2019s already there and just pay them to get you to that spot really, really quickly.</p> <p>So I\u2019m excited! Like I said, I had a great time with Tim and his company doing that and giving them two days of my life to hopefully help change the trajectory of their business.</p> <p>I\u2019m excited tomorrow to have Neil come, and hopefully, change the trajectory of our business and help us get the things done that we\u2019re not doing that we want to be doing -- and excited in the future to see who our next person we will hire, to kind of bring out and go through this experience and this process within.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty cool and exciting, so for you guys think about that: It\u2019s time to find who is where you want to be and pay them some money to get a compressed day with them and get there quick.</p> <p>So hope that helps! That\u2019s about it. It\u2019s my wife\u2019s birthday today. I\u2019m heading home to take her out on a hot date and I\u2019m excited. So that is what I am doing, and I am out of here.</p> <p>I will talk to you guys all again another day.</p> <p>Thanks everyone!</p>", "duration": "08:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_137.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1438103499, "title": "Episode #136 \u2013 How To Sell Your Customer Exactly What They Want", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My big \u201cah-ha\u201d from my vacation so far\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s special vacation episode Russell talks about a cool tool that will help tell you exactly what your customers want.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Find out what tool Russell found that will tell you exactly what your customer wants.</li> <li>Hear why Russell took so long before he has implemented this tool.</li> <li>And hear Russell explain why this one super simple tool is so effective.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear about this simple tool that Russell is excited to put some effort into.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone!

So it\u2019s been interesting.</p> <p>Obviously you guys all know my whole philosophy with funnel hacking and like looking at what\u2019s working and modeling and all those kinds of things, right?</p> <p>And so it\u2019s been interesting watching as like some people we work with like their businesses are super easy, and we\u2019re just like boom-boom-boom, money starts coming, and starts flowing in, right?</p> <p>Other ones are more difficult, and so there\u2019s a couple of people we\u2019re working with. They\u2019ve been a little more\u2026 taken a little longer to like get traction and get things working and so it\u2019s caused me to really start digging deeper, which is good.</p> <p>It always, it\u2019s like the episode we did if you have someone\u2019s back about the rubber band, right? Like if you\u2019re not stretching, you\u2019re useless, and if you, yeah.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of where it\u2019s been happening, is I had to stretch myself and try to figure out, like how do we expand this and how do we -- some of these people who aren\u2019t having success for whatever reason -- what do we do?</p> <p>And so it\u2019s been kind of interesting. I\u2019ve been looking a lot, and unfortunately on this, for some reason I\u2019ve been looking but not doing, which is never a good thing. But I\u2019ve been looking a lot at surveys.</p> <p>In fact, I think the first time I really realized the power of what surveys were doing was about a year and a half ago in our mastermind group. There was a guy named Glenn Ledwell and he was showing me, he was showing the group a bunch of his sales funnels.</p> <p>And what he found was that by adding these little surveys before a sales funnel, like instantly it would double his sales. And that sounds like a dumb thing, but it was true. Like he had a VSL and then he drove traffic to it and then he added this little quiz thing and doubled how much money he was making, just by adding this little like quiz.</p> <p>And then he\u2019d show me thing after thing after thing, and then anyway I was just like \u201cWow!\u201d So I started learning about it then and got excited, but then I never implemented it.</p> <p>In fact, I even recorded a whole bunch of videos and all these things to do it and I feel like I kind of overdid what I was trying to do is because that I never actually launched it, but yeah. So it kind of had a sample where I kind of tested it, right? Or started building it but I never finished it because it got too complicated, too complex.</p> <p>Then fast forward about six or eight months later, I got an email from Ben Settle, Andre Chaperon, Ryan Levesque and Jack Born talking about a mastermind group that they were doing called The Ocean\u2019s Four Mastermind. And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s cool. I\u2019ll go to that.\u201d</p> <p>So I went to it and it was on Valentine\u2019s Day last year and my wife wanted to destroy me for not being here for Valentine\u2019s Day, but you know in marketing college, you got to be there.</p> <p>So I went to hang out with these guys in Vegas and it was interesting because I knew, I was very familiar with three of the guys but I didn\u2019t know Ryan Levesque at the time, and he kind of, like in all honesty if you\u2019re in the mastermind, he kind of ran the whole thing.</p> <p>Like the other guys are there to kind of put in their two cents, but Ryan was definitely the host, the facilitator, and he was dropping bombs of gold the whole time, and he kept talking about some of his clients that he was using these surveys for.</p> <p>And a couple of them that I remember off the top of my head, I know there\u2019s more, but one was www.FuzzyYellowBalls.com and one was www.RevolutionGolf.com.</p> <p>And he started talking about his surveys and what they had done with the surveys and how much revenue and how much increased leads and just the whole thing, and I was like, \u201cDang!\u201d</p> <p>And so I kind of looked into those things back then. I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to do surveys,\u201d and then of course I once again didn\u2019t for whatever reasons, right? As entrepreneurs, we\u2019re having success in a couple of areas so we just keep doing that.</p> <p>And despite the fact that I\u2019m usually pretty good running with things, I just didn\u2019t for whatever reason. And yeah, and so then just recently over the last two or three, one of my clients has been kind of struggling and sort of funnel hacking some people.</p> <p>And what we found is that the people in his market that were winning were using, I think they were actually clients of Ryan Levesque\u2019s, and we\u2019re using all-survey funnels to try to look in closer at that, and I started going through them and started really seeing the power of it.</p> <p>And I knew that Ryan had written a book called \u201cAsk\u201d which is about like doing these surveys, and so I bought the book and I\u2019ve actually been reading it for the last day on the trip, so kind of just catching up.</p> <p>The book, if you guys do get the book, it takes about a hundred pages to get into the whole methodology. He spends the first hundred telling his whole story and it\u2019s a good story, but it takes awhile to get into like what you got the book for, you know?</p> <p>So I kind of get that part right now, and so anyway, but it\u2019s been interesting to see that. But one of the big like \u201cAha\u2019s\u201d I had, well, lets step back for one more thing.</p> <p>Right before I left on this trip I saw some Facebook posts from someone that was like the ten best landing pages of the year, and one of the landing pages I saw and I was like, \u201cAh, it looks so cool!\u201d</p> <p>And so I wanted to go to FunnelHacker, so I went to the page and I went and had a search, because they didn\u2019t give the URL of this, it had an image of. So I had a search a bunch of keywords that were on the image, so I found the page and then I went through there.</p> <p>And again they had a survey funnel. It was really cool and there was like one that was awesome looking. It had the little images next to each thing you were selecting and it was just amazing.</p> <p>So anyways, that\u2019s kind of like all these, like a perfect storm of like three things happening the week before I left for my vacation. I\u2019m like \u201cOkay, this week I\u2019m going to be focusing on surveys.\u201d When I get back, we\u2019re going to finally just do it, because I\u2019ve been procrastinating it forever. Now it\u2019s time.</p> <p>And so as I\u2019ve been reading through Ryan\u2019s book and then thinking about this and all this stuff, I started to just getting like crazy excited about the possibilities of it.</p> <p>One of the things that Ryan talked about in the book -- I think it was even on the cover of the book maybe -- but he was talking about delivering the exact sales message to the person coming to your website, the exact message they need to hear, right?</p> <p>The exact thing that\u2019s going to sell them, and basically the concepts, when it comes into the survey and you have five or six questions in the survey, they give you the ability to figure out who they are, right?</p> <p>Question one could be: \u201cAre you a man or a woman?\u201d</p> <p>Number two: \u201cAre you underweight, overweight, 200 lbs overweight, whatever,\u201d right? If you add that and then, \u201cWhat diets have you tried in the past?\u201d</p> <p>If you got that, I\u2019m like, you know, you go through a bunch of surveys and at the end of it, you know like, okay, based on whatever, this is the person. That they are a man who is 47, he\u2019s struggling with this, you know?</p> <p>And now that you know that, the sales video can speak directly to what their issue is as opposed to being more, you know typically sales videos you have to be broader because you\u2019re trying to like encompass everybody, where here you can really shrink it down.</p> <p>It\u2019s similar to what you can do on a sales call, you know, and so in a sales call you\u2019re talking to somebody, you can figure out really quick like what\u2019s important to them and then you just speak to that, and this kind of gives you the same ability to do that.</p> <p>So anyway, it\u2019s exciting and so, what I did right before I left is I funnel hacked www.FuzzyYellowBalls.com funnel, and I went into their Quiz Funnel. So I went through an opt-in five or six times with different answers, different things to see, and sure enough there\u2019s different videos.</p> <p>I think that, based on what I think -- I could be wrong -- but I think there\u2019s nine different sales videos based on what I had chose. Then again that could be 50 for all I know.</p> <p>But the ones that I was able to get to from my path, I think I figured out about nine of them, and it would be worth it for you guys to go and go funnel hack them just because it\u2019s kind of cool to see the process, right? And it\u2019s just a really simple survey.</p> <p>That part was actually way less complex than I thought it was going to be. That part was way more simple, but then based on what they had answered, boom! There\u2019s a video at the end that\u2019s delivered to it to speak directly to them.</p> <p>Plus there\u2019s a whole email follow-up sequence delivered to them, answering, you know, giving them -- the emails are feeding stuff that they had mentioned during the surveys, so you get very granular and you can figure out exactly who and how you\u2019re speaking to somebody.</p> <p>So anyway, for me it was really, really cool and got me, it\u2019s gotten me really excited. In fact, there\u2019s four or five projects I\u2019m working on, some that are in my core businesses and some that are not, that I\u2019m really excited to kind of test this concept with and just see based on, you know, a couple of my early thoughts.</p> <p>You know, if like mentioned that some of the results of my friend showed. By putting a survey in front of anything, they were more than doubling conversions on the next step.</p> <p>I mean, if that\u2019s the case and we add these things from our webinars and our sales videos and our free-plus-shipping offers and all these different things, like if it was to double conversions, which are already pretty dang strong, I can imagine what will come from that.</p> <p>So it\u2019s definitely worth putting in the effort to explore and to test out. I\u2019m sure that if this does work for me, I will be bragging and talking and sharing a whole bunch of stuff about it with you guys here in the very near future.</p> <p>Right now I want to try it because I think I see the vision now and I see why it\u2019s no longer like, \u201cI need to try that,\u201d but it\u2019s a \u201cI must try that.\u201d Tony Robbins talks about when you got to change your should\u2019s to must\u2019s. You know, and so I think for me it\u2019s gone from a \u201cshould\u201d to definitely a \u201cmust,\u201d and so I\u2019m excited to kind of see.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about also kind of building up my own survey software just because like the one that I saw the other day that had the images was amazing and there\u2019s no, I couldn\u2019t find any software that did it that way, so I may make a version similar to that.</p> <p>I was thinking about if I do do that, I\u2019ll probably just give it to all the DCS labs\u2019 monthly members for free. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to do it or not, but if I am, then you should go to www.DCSLabsMonthly.com and get it. Become a member, subscribe, because you get not only all the other cool stuff you get, you also get that software.</p> <p>If we decide to make it, we may not. Who knows, we will see. If we do, it\u2019ll be something where you can create and embed the stuff and then from there it would go directly into, it would go directly into or embed into your ClickFunnels pages because it\u2019s, I\u2019d only do it if I could do it inside of ClickFunnels.</p> <p>So anyway, that\u2019s kind of the exciting, fun thing that I\u2019m thinking about that I thought I\u2019d share with you guys and wanted to get you guys to start thinking about as well because I think that it is going to be the future where things are going, is instead of delivering up a one-size-fits-all sales message.</p> <p>Take that someone through process. Find out exactly who they are, what\u2019s important to them, what they\u2019re struggling with, and then deliver a message based on that.</p> <p>I think if we can do that, we\u2019re going to get a lot closer to serving our customers to the level that they want, that they need us at, as opposed to us trying to jam down our message and hope that the hot points that we\u2019re focusing on will help them.</p> <p>So that is my game plan, I\u2019m excited and as I get some cool results, I will return to report back to you guys to hear, and hopefully share some cool stuff.</p> <p>So that\u2019s it. I\u2019m at the Kauai, about to buy some water and eggs and milk and hopefully all milk, because we don\u2019t drink our own milk, and actually I got a funny story. I\u2019ll tell you that before we go.</p> <p>So back in the day we used to drink tons of milk, like our kids would drink three gallons twice a week, so I was buying tons of milk, and then at a Tony Robbins event, he talked about how bad milk was for you, and I was like, \u201cAre you kidding me? I thought milk does a body good! I\u2019ve been learning that my whole life.\u201d</p> <p>Turns out a bunch of good marketers like me wrote a slogan like that and we all believe it! So kind of realizing that milk\u2019s not really the best thing in the world for us, we were trying to break our kids of it, and so one of our first things we did is we started calling it \u201cdisgusting milk.\u201d</p> <p>Like \u201cThis is disgusting milk. Do you want almond milk or do you want disgusting milk?\u201d So we had both of them for awhile and then eventually we got them all wanting almond milk instead of disgusting milk, because it sounds disgusting, right?</p> <p>So it was like probably a year, year and a half later, so my kids had only had almond milk for like over a year and we always were like tease and call it cow milk, disgusting milk. In fact, they still today call it cow milk.</p> <p>But anyway, this is actually on the same vacation probably three years ago. We were here, and of course, no one else in my family drinks almond milk. They all think that we\u2019re like the hippy freaks who do, right?</p> <p>And so anyway, we\u2019re here, the family are eating, and my mom is making breakfast for everybody and she\u2019s got, you know, cow milk, and so my kids go over and they\u2019re drinking the cow milk and I see them just drinking a lot of it, right?</p> <p>Then Beau, one of my twins comes over, and he was probably five or six at the time, he looks at me and he says, \u201cDaddy, I had some disgusting milk and it sure was good!\u201d [Laughter] So anyway, pretty funny.</p> <p>All right, well I\u2019m into the Kauai to buy some cool stuff, and I appreciate you guys for listening, hope you had an amazing time and I\u2019m sure, hopefully, throughout this trip I\u2019ll send you some more info and my brother will get it all posted up before too long and hopefully you guys can get some value from all this stuff.</p> <p>So that\u2019s it guys! Thanks so much for everything and we will talk soon.</p>", "duration": "12:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_136.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1436287499, "title": "Episode #135 \u2013 A Little Bit Of Advice After The Firework War\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The real secret to building an audience\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the firework war and his injuries.

Good news, I survived the firework war. Now we\u2019re back for another Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, so yes good news is that I survived the firework war, bad news is I have a lot of flesh wounds. I ripped my finger off almost, there\u2019s a hole in my arm. One in my forearm, one of my bicep. I have a huge burn on my neck. Other than that I am here, still talking. Actually heading to there now. We are filming a little documentary of us. I am going to do a little interview in front of the set up.</p> <p>Hopefully in a week or so from now you guys will see a really cool video showing and documenting that whole thing. It\u2019ll be a lot of fun. Today, what I want to talk to you guys about today, today was kind of fun. Not today actually, a couple days ago I was listening to some podcasts and there was on the Tim Fare show that was awesome. It asked the title of it was something like, How Do You Build Your Audience. That was interesting. I wanted to hear what he has to say about that. It was one of his podcasts. It wasn\u2019t a normal podcasts. He was just doing Q&amp;A back and forth.</p> <p>That was one of the questions. First he talked about, why do you do a podcast? What\u2019s the purpose behind it? He said something kind of interesting, and I had a conversation the other night with one of my friends, BJ Wright about this concept. It said, when you have a goal or want to do something, just ask yourself three why\u2019s. I want to make a million dollars. Why? Because I want to buy my dream house. Why? Because it will make people think I\u2019m awesome. Why? You ask three why\u2019s and suddenly after three or four why\u2019s you get to a point where you are like, I\u2019m already doing what I want to do.</p> <p>There\u2019s a story, I\u2019ll probably slaughter this story, but it was about a guy, business man who went to this little fishing village. He sees this guy in the river fishing, pulling fish in. He goes to the guy, and says \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The guy says, \u201cI\u2019m pulling fish for my family to eat.\u201d He says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you build a business? Why don\u2019t you hire 10, 20, or 30 people to pull in fish for you, and start shipping out fish and making money?\u201d The fisherman said, \u201cWell, why would I do that?\u201d \u201cBecause then you can make lots of money. You can travel the world, and you can do a whole a bunch of things.\u201d Why would I do that?\u201d \u201cBecause eventually someday you can sell your business and make tons of money and retire a multi-millionaire.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy do I want to do that?\u201d He said, \u201cYou can retire to this small fishing village, and spend your day lazy, being in the water fishing.\u201d The guy looks at him, \u201cI\u2019m already doing that. Why do I have to do all those other things?\u201d</p> <p>It was asking yourself at least three whys to get to the reason behind the reason what you\u2019re doing, which is interesting in and of itself. That was the first thing. Then he started digging deeper. He said, \u201cIf you want to build an audience, this is how he did it when he started building The Four Hour Work Week.\u201d The first step in it, I agree completely, figure out what subcultures do you belong to. A lot of times, I am the internet marketing guy. What are the subcultures you belong to in the marketing area? Is it weight loss or marketing or business or dentistry or chiropracting, whatever business it is you\u2019re in? What are the subcultures?</p> <p>There\u2019s obviously a culture, there\u2019s like the coreness, but what are the subcultures? I was thinking about myself. Obviously I belong in the whole internet marketing subculture. We\u2019re starting to get more and more into the bio-hacking subculture. We\u2019re getting more into different subcultures. Take three or four subcultures that you belong to, that you\u2019re confident, you\u2019re following that things belong to. That\u2019s the first step. The second step is for each subcultures, find the three most popular blogs, three biggest Twitter accounts, three biggest Facebook groups. Find those things\u2026three or so of the core places where the majority of those potential prospects are in for each subculture.</p> <p>Figure out exactly where those are, you have the nine or twelve places where your audience is. Now, you address the market to those places. You develop strategies to do that. I started thinking about that, how smart that is. How you could really, pretty much any business, any marketing that you want to go into, if you want an audience and want to develop a list, that\u2019s it. One thing he said that was interesting, he said, When we launched The Four Hour Work Week, he said, \u201cPeople came out everywhere, just because it was the place that everybody was at.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t have a big marketing campaign or budget to make these huge waves, and have a whole bunch of presence everywhere because he was in the best spots. Few, when he started thinking about this more, and with my team as well, what subcultures do we belong to? Where are our target audiences and where are they hanging out, what are those things? After we identified, these are the four or five that we can serve. Then you can start digging deeper. Now that we know where those are, where are the three or five influential places that these audiences are at?</p> <p>The Facebook platform, the Twitter platform, You Tube, what are the big channels, big following, list owners. You start strategic marketing to those people. I thought it was pretty awesome. I recommend and finding that podcast if you can. On Tim\u2019s site, and start following it. That\u2019s basically marketing 101. You guys have heard me talk before in the past, this is an easy way to get that quickly. Hope that helps. I am there. I\u2019m about to get out of the car and fill the voice over for our documentary of firework war version two.</p> <p>It totally has no purpose other than I think it would be fun. It does have a purpose. Here\u2019s how many that know what that purpose is, because it\u2019s backwards from what makes logical sense. Has 100% to do with the character thing\u2026I\u2019m sharing this people, I\u2019m posting on Facebook. I can\u2019t tell you the kind of messages I\u2019ve been getting, customers, students and friends and family.</p> <p>It seems like a pointless, strange thing. Russell why are you putting all this effort into making a video on a firework war? Because we\u2019re trying to bring in our target audience into the craziness of my life. If done correctly, then hopefully you guys will want to learn more. That\u2019s the game plan. I hope you guys have fun with your business as well. I will talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "07:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_135.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1436208071, "title": "Episode #134 \u2013 The Pre-Game Show Before My Firework War", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What I learned about calculated risk after having three people shoot thousands of dollars worth of fireworks at my head\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the firework war he is driving to.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right, guys and gals, tonight is a special night and I am bringing you along on the journey because you are special to me. You guys listen to me every single day, so because of that you get in on a part of my life that most people do not get to know about.</p> <p>Today as I record this it is the Fourth of July. It is 9:46 P.M. and I am currently heading to our second annual Firework War. Some of you guys may be thinking, \u201cWhat is a firework war?\u201d</p> <p>Well, what is a firework war? Imagine the most immature men that you know, people like me and the people I like hanging out with, and imagine that we go to one of our friend\u2019s house who has a huge basketball court. We bring a bunch of pallets, obstacle courses, and a bunch of things, and we play three-on-three fireworks where we are shooting 400 roman candles and thousands of bottle rockets.</p> <p>We also have the big bottle rockets, like the actual rocket heads. We have mortars; we have firecrackers; we have fountains; we have all sorts of stuff. We have enough stuff that we will be blowing things up for at least an hour, maybe two.</p> <p>We spent at least double what we spent last year on it and it is insane. My wife is convinced I am going to die; my kids say I am going to die, but I am not going to die. I didn\u2019t die last year. Last year we did have a few casualties. This is what makes me laugh because the guy kind of deserved this.</p> <p>If you were going to a firework war and you knew the whole point of the game was to shoot fireworks at each other point-blank, not far away, but like point-blank fireworks, you would think you would wear long sleeves and pants, right? But, no, this dude wore short sleeves and shorts. Halfway through the firework war he got hit right in the arm with one of the big bottle rocket things and it totally put him out. It popped a blood vessel or something and it was spewing out blood. Luckily for us, the guy who has the house where we do the firework war, his dad is a doctor, so we had medical supervision on staff during the war. We had it wrapped it up and he was fine.</p> <p>At first we had these fountains and we thought they were going to be dumb, so we didn\u2019t use them. Then we found out if you light a fountain, they run for five minutes sometimes. We would light them and lob them over to the other guys\u2019 side. One of them landed inside the box of fireworks and started setting off all of these other fireworks.</p> <p>We were just thrashing these guys and they got so upset that the one guy picked up a mortar. Before we were shooting mortars in the air just for fun, just to kind of scare people and stuff like that. But he picked up a mortar, turned it at us, and shot it, and the kick-back from the mortar came back and smacked him in the collar-bone and actually shattered his collar-bone. He had to head to the ER. After he headed to the ER, we pulled somebody from the audience in and we continued the war. It was awesome!</p> <p>That is what we are doing right now and it is going to be awesome. I am ten minutes away from it and I am excited. We have been working all week going to get all the fireworks. We mapped it out way better this year than last year. We realized which ones were our favorite kinds of fireworks and which ones were kind of lame. From that we got the right ones which is awesome.</p> <p>The guys with whom I am playing have spent all day today setting up all of the obstacle courses. In fact, they did it in the middle of the obstacle course where we were kind of fighting. It is not an obstacle course. There are barriers and stuff so that when we are advancing and trying to attack them and they are trying to attack us, we are kind of safe. We have barriers and things we can hide behind.</p> <p>In the middle of it, he took about $300 worth of fireworks and set them up all around this thing. We bought a bunch of this long fuse and with it we wrapped everything around. At the end for the grand finale, we are going to light that fuse and all lay on the ground and watch as $300 worth of fireworks go \u201cpop-pop-pop-pop!\u201d It is going to be amazing.</p> <p>Another cool thing he does is to stream music, so we have music happening. There is a bleacher so that friends and family can come to watch. It is pretty intense. This is what is happening tonight and it is crazy.</p> <p>Somebody has to be thinking, \u201cRussell, why would you go and shoot fireworks at your friends?\u201d like that is the stupidest thing in the world. There is a reason, not that it is a good reason. Hopefully, this will be the little nugget of value I will drop on you guys tonight before I go get fireworks shot at me.</p> <p>For me it is assessing risk, right? My wife says, \u201cWhat if you die?\u201d and I say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to die.\u201d Worst-case scenario based on last year is that I shatter my collar-bone. We know that was because of a mortar, so this year I am not shooting mortars at people. Boom! That possibility goes to almost zero, right?</p> <p>Number two, you might get hit in the arm with something, so I wore long sleeves. I\u2019m smart enough to cover that one, so the risk drops even lower. We have goggles and everything. Worst-case scenario, my hands might get burnt. In fact, I am betting they will get burnt tonight. They just do; that is part of fireworks.</p> <p>That is the worst-case scenario. I cannot think of anything worse that could happen. For me, it is all about calculated risk. I am looking at something and saying, \u201cWhat is the calculated risk in this thing?\u201d Best-case scenario, we have an amazing time and it is awesome. Worst-case scenario, I burn my hands. I can deal with that, so it is okay. I can take the risk.</p> <p>The same thing happens in business. When I get into business, I look at calculated risk. If this thing bombs, what is the worst-case scenario? If it is not that bad, I just do it. A lot of us do not think about what the calculated risks are. We just know there are things that make you nervous or keep you from moving forward and all of that kind of stuff, and you don\u2019t.</p> <p>However, you want to sit down and say, \u201cWhat is the actual risk? If I do this and it doesn\u2019t work, what is the worst-case scenario?\u201d After you figure out the worst-case scenario, you have to be okay with it. If you are okay with it, you can run forward.</p> <p>I did a whole podcast, probably about 100 episodes ago, talking about the worst-case scenario. The title probably was \u201cWorst-case Scenario,\u201d so, if you are interested in how I deal with that and how I use it as a tool to move forward quickly in business and in life and everything I want to accomplish, go back and listen to that podcast.</p> <p>For tonight, worst-case scenario is that I am going to have an amazing time. We actually do have someone who is coming to film the whole thing, so I will have video footage. He is going to make a war documentary, so he is probably going to post that online somewhere. Make sure you are on my email list and make sure you check it out because it will be amazing.</p> <p>That\u2019s it, you guys. I am signing off. I am about to go blow someone up and I am excited. I appreciate you guys listening in. Have an awesome Fourth of July. If you are not in America, whatever you are celebrating this weekend, celebrate and have a good time. I will talk to you guys next week when we are back at the office.</p>", "duration": "07:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_134.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1435596836, "title": "Episode #133 \u2013 What\u2019s The Difference Between An Employee And An Entrepreneur?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What I learned this weekend from hustlers on Craigslist.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the difference between entrepreneurs and employees.He tells of some recent experiences where he realized that he no longer wanted to work with employees and only wanted to work with entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What made it obvious that a dude at Tate\u2019s Rental was an employee and not an entrepreneur.</li> <li>What Russell had to do to get a pool guy out to his house to fix his pool by the 4th of July.</li> <li>And how you can go from being an employee to entrepreneur or even an intrepreneur.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how you can be more than just an employee.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right, so I want to make that welcome a little more dramatic than normal. I hope that was all right and sounded cool. I'll keep testing out different tonality on our intro.</p> <p>Anyway, hope you guys are doing awesome today. So I have something to discuss with you that's important, very important, for you who are business owners and for you who may be employees.</p> <p>So my question for you is, how can you tell the difference between an entrepreneur and an employee?</p> <p>Now by looking at them you might say, \"I can't tell by looking at someone if they're an entrepreneur or an employee.\" But it does not take much to figure out who they are.</p> <p>Let me give you some examples of what happened to me over the last week. I'll show you how simple this is to figure out. Who's the entrepreneur and who's the employee?</p> <p>For example, last week I had Rob come out and he's painting. We have a detached garage and he's painting this huge wrestling mural inside of it. It turned out amazing.</p> <p>But there's part of it, because it's a really tall garage, where we had to get one of these scissor lifts, that's what they call them, so he could get up to the top and paint the top.</p> <p>So we went to a place called Tate's Rents, and they rent all sorts of stuff. So we're at Tate's and we walk in and we're like, \"Oh, there it is, that thing right there.\" That's what he needed.</p> <p>So we pull in, we go talk to the guy at the desk. And we're like, \"Hey, we're here to rent one of those lifts that go up really big.\"</p> <p>He's like, \"I don't have anything like that.\"</p> <p>We're like, \"Are you sure? Because I'm pretty sure we saw one right out there?\"</p> <p>He's like, \"What, the scissor lift?\"</p> <p>We're like, \"Yeah, the scissor lift. That's what we need.\"</p> <p>He's like, \"Yeah, we've got one of those.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Cool. I want to rent that.\"</p> <p>He's like, \"Well, we don't really have the trailer for that scissor lift, so sorry I can't rent it to you. I don't have a trailer.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Really?\" I look out the window and there's like 18 trailers. I'm like, \"Can we put it on one of those trailers out there?\"</p> <p>He looks at me kind of annoyed like, \"Yeah, I guess we could.\" He pushes a button and we go talk to the guys outside. \"Hey, guys, get the scissor lift and put it on the trailer.\"</p> <p>He's like angry at me that I wanted to rent something. He was trying so hard to not allow them to give me money because he didn't want to annoy himself. Which all he had to do was click a little button and say, \"Pick this up,\" and somebody else had to go out and grab it.</p> <p>All he had to do was push a button and tell people what to get. But he did not want me to do it because it was going to take time and effort or brain power or something to do it.</p> <p>So my question to you: is that man an entrepreneur or an employee? Okay, obviously you can tell he is a hardcore employee.</p> <p>Had that been an entrepreneur, and even if the scissor lift had not been there, he would have said, \"You know what? That's a good question. We don't have a scissor lift here, but hold on. Let me find one somewhere in Boise.\" And he would start calling every single place because he wants to make money.</p> <p>That's what entrepreneurs do: we figure out a way to make crap happened. That's what would have happened if that guy had been an entrepreneur, right?</p> <p>Another example, so our pool has nine issues we need to fix. I counted them. So I call pool company A and I'm like, \"Hey, we got this pool. My goal is I'm probably going to be spending $20,000-30,000 over the next seven days to get this pool fixed up. I would love to get you guys out here to fix it.\"</p> <p>The person on the line is like, \"Our guys are all busy, so no one can come out this week or next week. But in three weeks we can come out and have someone look at it and give you a quote.\"</p> <p>Three weeks. I was like, \"Nope.\"</p> <p>So I hang up the phone. I was talking to an employee. I didn't want to deal with him. So I called the next place. This place is like a high-end pool place here in Boise.</p> <p>So I called them up and I'm like, \"Hey, in the next seven days I'm going to be dropping $20,000-30,000 on my pool. I need some help. Can you send someone out here today to give me a quote?\"</p> <p>\"Oh, well we're about two and a half, three weeks out before we can send someone out to give you a quote.\"</p> <p>At that point it was going to be another three or four weeks for them to fix it. I was like, \"Are you kidding me? I want the pool fixed today.\"</p> <p>The lady is like, \"We can't. The first opening for the guy to give you a quote is three weeks away.\"</p> <p>So this time I'm like, \"Maybe everyone is going to be busy. Maybe I should just book it and I'll cancel it if I need to.\"</p> <p>So I book it and I call around again. Same thing. This guy's like, \"I can be out there in two weeks,\" so I got all excited. Two weeks later he didn't show up, so I got really mad.</p> <p>The earlier guy was supposed to show up. He had texted me. So I called him twice, texted him three times trying to ask him some questions. He didn't respond back to any of them.</p> <p>Finally the day of his appointment he texts me, \"Okay, I'm coming out to see your stuff.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"No, dude. I texted you and I emailed you and you never responded back. So you are officially fired. I'm not working with you. I won't work with people who won't respond to me. It's ridiculous.\"</p> <p>So then the third guy comes out. I give him a list of nine things to fix. He shows up at our house, doesn't knock on the door or anything. He goes in the backyard, fixes one of the nine things and then goes home. Never communicated, never talked to us, never told us, never anything. Just fixed one of nine things and left.</p> <p>So at this point I am infuriated, as you can probably tell. I have been trying to get crap done. I was like, \"You know what? I've got to quit dealing with employees. I've got to find someone who's hustling, someone who is an entrepreneur who wants to make money.\"</p> <p>So I post on Craigslist this ad that says, \"$1,000 cash bonus for the first person who responds and can help me fix my pool before the fourth of July.\"</p> <p>And then the ad goes on to say, \"The fourth of July I am trying to have a pool party. There are nine things broken on my pool. I have tried the three biggest pool companies in Boise to come out and nobody can make time for me.\"</p> <p>I said, \"I'm trying to drop $20,000-30,000 in the next seven days to fix this pool. And for whoever will help me spend this money I will give you, on top of whatever you charge me hourly, you can charge me whatever you want, I don't even care, I will pay you an extra $1,000 just to show up here and get the crap done because I am so sick of waiting on regular pool people.\"</p> <p>So I post that out there. This was like 11:00 at night. 3:00 in the morning the first entrepreneur responds saying, \"I can do it. I will be there.\"</p> <p>Two hours later, the next entrepreneur responds. All through the night. From like 3:00 in the morning to like 7:00 AM, all the entrepreneurs who are hungry, who are up working their butts off, are responding to my ad, telling me why they're the best person, selling me on why I should pick them over everybody else.</p> <p>And then all day long for the next two days I'm getting messages from entrepreneur after entrepreneur after entrepreneur. \"I can do it. I'll drop everything.\"</p> <p>\"For $1,000 I will call in sick to my day job and I will be there and I will make sure this happens.\"</p> <p>It was amazing. I was like, \"These are the kind of people I want to work with.\"</p> <p>I want to work with entrepreneurs who will work nights and weekends to hustle to make some extra money. All these pool companies, I told these guys, \"I will pay double what your hourly rate is typically if you can just send somebody out today or tomorrow or tonight or 3:00 in the morning.\" And no one would do it.</p> <p>And finally on Craigslist I found some hardcore entrepreneurs who are hustling, who are looking for money. So this one dude now comes every morning at 6:00 AM before his other job. He's been working his butt off for some extra cash.</p> <p>And when he was done, you know what he told me? He said, \"What else can I do? Can I take your garbage to the dump? Can I mow your lawn? I noticed this.\" All these other things he noticed about my house that I could use his help with.</p> <p>I'm like, \"Heck yeah, man.\" He starts cleaning stuff up, he starts earning money like an entrepreneur.</p> <p>I'm like, \"That guy I have respect for.\"</p> <p>And then the one guy couldn't do everything. We had a concrete slide that needed to be redone. So finally I get this dude who's like, \"I'm a concrete guy. I can fix your slide for you.\"</p> <p>So he comes out, busts his butt in 109-degree weather, cleans the whole thing all up. Then he gets so excited. He's like, \"Man, this is cool. I want to take ownership of this project. I want this to be the most amazing thing in the world for you.\"</p> <p>He goes home that night, spends like four hours watching YouTube videos to figure out the best way to seal and do my slide the right way. Comes back, \"Hey, man, it's going to cost you a little extra. This is why it's important and what it's going to do for you.\"</p> <p>He had a job he was supposed to be at this weekend. He cancelled his job because there was a better opportunity for him to make more money for me. He spent two and a half days, three days, working his butt off to get this slide done in time.</p> <p>That man is an entrepreneur. So that's the difference, you guys, between an employee and an entrepreneur. You can always tell in a heartbeat. If you walk into a restaurant three minutes before closing time and they're like, \"Oh, sorry, we're closed,\" that's the employee.</p> <p>If you walk in and the guy's like, \"Hey, come on in. We want to make this an amazing experience for you,\" and he serves you and treats you well, that's probably the entrepreneur of the business.</p> <p>So a lot of times when I get bad service I just ask, \"Who's the entrepreneur here in the company? Because I don\u2019t want to deal with employees who are going to whine about doing their freaking job.\"</p> <p>I want to deal with entrepreneurs who are going to bust their butts, who are going to figure out ways to make this happen, who are going to make some money. That's the kind of person I want to work with.</p> <p>So that's it, guys. So my question for you is, which one are you? Are you an employee or an entrepreneur?</p> <p>If you're an employee, you'd better fix it quick. Because if you're an employee, you're going to stay that way for the rest of your life.</p> <p>Even if you're being entrepreneurial inside of another company, it's different. We call those people intropreneurs, who are able to exert their entrepreneurship inside of their company.</p> <p>I look at my company and I've got some people who work for me who are intropreneurs and some who are employees. The intropreneurs make more money. I give them raises all the time.</p> <p>They're the ones who are out there figuring out what to do and finding ways to make things better. The employees are the ones who do what they're asked to do. They do a good job of it and that's why they have jobs, but they're not making way more money because they're just doing what I asked them and not figuring out what they can do.</p> <p>That's the difference and it's time for you guys to figure out which one you are. If you are an employee, you probably should stop listening to this podcast. If you're an entrepreneur, you're in the right spot. This is where we love and embrace your type.</p> <p>From now on, I'm no longer hiring crappy companies. Craigslist will be my spot to find people to fix my stuff, because that's where the entrepreneurs are hustling, looking form more money, looking for more jobs, looking for more opportunities to serve. And that is where I will be putting my money.</p> <p>Have an awesome day, you guys. And I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "10:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_133.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1434642408, "title": "Episode #132 \u2013 Recap Of Our First Ever \u201cHack-A-Thon\u201d", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What happens behind the scenes when people come to Boise and let Russell hack their funnel\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s special episode of Marketing In Your CORVETTE Russell talks about how you can win a Corvette.

This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to Marketing in Your Corvette.</p> <p>Hey, guys. Yes this is a special Marketing in Your Car, because today I am in my brand new Corvette. There's kind of a story behind this, because I'm not the kind of guy who just goes and buys new cars.</p> <p>In fact, I've had the same car for like eight years, or seven years now. Anyway, a long time.</p> <p>But at the Funnel Hacking event we launched our dream car contest, which my goal in the next year is to give away 100 cars to people like you. You deserve one and you need one. So that's kind of the game plan.</p> <p>To kind of show off, we got a new Corvette and had it there at the event to show everybody what could be their dream car. Because a Corvette is kind of like my dream car.</p> <p>Anyway, we had it shipped back from the event and I'm in it right now driving and this is the first podcast in the new car. And I've got to tell you, this car is awesome.</p> <p>I'm not that big of a car guy, but this one is really, really cool. So I'm excited because I'm going to be hopefully giving away a ton of these over the next 12 months. In fact, next week our goal is to launch the dream car contest.</p> <p>We kind of soft launched it at the event, but we were just going to reveal and open up and let everyone see it. We added this really cool element inside Click Funnels just for our affiliate program.</p> <p>You see this little car, and as you get more and more members, the little care will move across until boom, you hit the goal and you get the car. It's pretty awesome. You should see that next week in your affiliate panel, as long as I am able to get it all done in time.</p> <p>So that's the game plan there. Anyway, today I just wanted to talk about something really cool that happened. I had an idea for a program we wanted to put together a little while ago. In fact, I think I mentioned it on the podcast.</p> <p>We thought it would be cool to create something we're going to call a hack-a-thon where we've got people coming out to Boise and we spend three days just building out their sales funnels for them. So we're trying to build out a webinar funnel and a high-ticket funnel.</p> <p>And at first we had the idea, we got excited and we started selling it. We sold three people and then I was like, \"You know what, let's just stop and make sure this is a good idea before we sell anyone else.\"</p> <p>We kind of stopped. And then today, the last three days, we had some people in town and we did it, and it was awesome. We had a good time and basically what we did is day one, first we just kind of sat down and had everyone define what they're doing, where they're at and where they want to go.</p> <p>We went through everyone's business to get a good idea of that. That was the first half of the day. Then we went to lunch and after lunch came back and I worked one of them and focused on rebuilding his entire webinar, as well as his webinar funnel.</p> <p>We found a bunch of little holes and mistakes and got things fixed. That was day one. And then the other two people went and they met with the guy who runs all our Facebook ads, and then they met with our guy on my team who does all of our Dream 100 affiliates, those type of things.</p> <p>So that was kind of day one. Then day two, everyone rotated around. So I spent the next half a day working on the next group's webinar and the funnels for that.</p> <p>And then the last day I did the other person's. Then today we went out and had one of video guys go and film and capture all the videos we need for the high-ticket funnels, for the webinar funnels. And they turned out amazing.</p> <p>In fact, I'm beat up. We did that all day today and I'm tired. It was awesome. So we created it and the goal was to get two funnels, a high-ticket and a webinar funnel for each person.</p> <p>And I thought we could get it done in three days, and we probably could have. But there's a lot of moving parts involved. So they're all like probably 80 percent done and so I\u2019m kind of waiting to get the video editing done.</p> <p>Next week I'm going to get them all finalized and next week we're doing kind of a big reveal, giving them their funnels and showing them off and giving them their Facebook ads and let everyone have a chance to go out and execute on them and see what happens.</p> <p>So it's kind of exciting as a whole to put it all together. It was a really fun process. Who knows if we'll do it again in the future? It was a lot of work.</p> <p>Part of it is I'm still in the process of moving my house. I would go there for eight hours a day and then I'd go home and we'd go to the old house and we'd spend six hours cleaning house back and forth. That on top of all the kids and everything else.</p> <p>I think I'm just worn out from all those different things happening at the same time. We'll see if we do it again in the future. But right now the goal is to get these guys up and running and really successful.</p> <p>It was a lot of fun and I enjoyed it. So what I was thinking for you guys to hopefully add some value to your day today, is think about whatever it is that you are teaching people to do.</p> <p>Every one of you guys has got different businesses and things like that. Obviously you can teach it, you can do different variations. But I encourage you guys to sit back and think about creating a version where someone goes out and you get to do your magic.</p> <p>Because I know a lot of us teach our magic. We teach what we do to have success. But what if you went and just applied your magic for someone and did it for them?</p> <p>I'm not a big fan of creating done-for-you type services typically. But if you have the opportunity to do something like that. For us, we charged $25,000 for somebody to come to this. I think if we did it in the future we would probably charge more.</p> <p>Because I don\u2019t think I want more people. We want a smaller group, so we probably would charge more. So charging a lot for it, but then you really give somebody a cool experience.</p> <p>What was cool is the group that was here, the common theme among them is that they all are very much like me. They're kind of impatient. I want things done now.</p> <p>So they were willing to pay more to get it done quickly, as opposed to joining our Inner Circle group. Inner Circle is good, but I don't want to spend next year working on it. I want to get it done now.</p> <p>So they wanted stuff done now. So they were willing to pay extra, pay more for that. So just for you guys, think about that. There's a segment of your audience who wants things done faster. They want to have whatever the result is now.</p> <p>They don't want to wait for six months or a year or whatever it's going to take. So there's a premium there for everyone. What's cool is, I don't know about you, but I don\u2019t typically have a chance to work this close to anybody ever.</p> <p>And so it was really neat just to have a chance to connect with each of these people who came on that level. And really see what you're doing and how you can affect people. It was awesome.</p> <p>I recommend looking at that and testing something out. Test out something and offer it to your list or your customer base. Just say, \"Hey, this is what we normally do. We normally teach you guys this stuff, but how would you like to come out and spend a lot of time with me and I'll help you do this?\"</p> <p>Just see what happens. It's an amazing experience on their side. It's amazing on your side. You'll get connection with people you don't get any other way.</p> <p>It was awesome. So there's my tidbit for today. Other than that, I appreciate you. Next week is going to be a fun week. We're going to be rolling out new affiliate programs, dream car contest, a couple other cools things.</p> <p>If you're watching what we're doing, I think you're really going to enjoy it. I hope you're having fun marketing your businesses as well, and go get your dream car. Just plan on getting it, because I'm paying for it if you guys are a part of the contest.</p> <p>And if you get this one, I recommend getting a Corvette. I'm not a car guy, so I don't really know what it is. It's blue, it's awesome. It just looks cool. If this is the one you want, just let us know and it can be yours. This car could be your car.</p> <p>All right guys, I'm out here for the day. I appreciate you all and we will talk soon.</p>", "duration": "08:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_132.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1434127036, "title": "Episode #131 \u2013 A Tale Of Three Salesmen", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Let me share with you three different stories that happened today\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about his experience with three different salesmen and the reason it was so different which each of them.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>What aspects of Russell\u2019s experience with buying a Love Sac made it a great experience.</li> <li>Why buying a fridge with money burning a hole in his pocket didn\u2019t go well.</li> <li>And finally why Russell\u2019s carpet cleaner does a good job, but still isn\u2019t as successful as he could be.</li> </ul> <p>Listen below to find out what made each experience with these salesmen so different.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson and I want to welcome you to a late night Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey guys and gals. It's been a while since we've done a late night one. But I'm actually heading home from the new house. I'm heading over from my new house to the new office and then heading back to the old house.</p> <p>Anyway, it's been a fun-filled day of running errands and getting things set up and all of those things happening during a move, while packing boxes and shipping things and packing. I'm a little beat up.</p> <p>Anyway, I just left the house and going back to the office to get one more quick thing done. Because I'm in the office this whole week it's like one of those little things that have to get done and haven't gotten done yet. They tend to happen late at night or else they just don't fit in anywhere.</p> <p>We'll make it work, right. But today is interesting. I had a chance to work with a lot of different types of people, different businesses. Really interesting how different people responded.</p> <p>I just want to share some with you because I think there's things to be learned from all of them.</p> <p>The first business I interacted with today was a company called Love Sac. You may have heard of them. They make big bean bags and these couches they call sactionals and a bunch of things like that. I've always wanted some Love Sacs, so we had a whole bunch we were going to order.</p> <p>So I went and found them online, found ones I like and then the little support agent popped on the side asked if he could help. I was like, \"Okay,\" so I asked him a couple questions.</p> <p>Support side was amazing. He came through and answered my questions. It was actually yesterday that I talked to him the first time. He figured out my questions. He actually went online and basically when I told him found a whole bunch of different variations and options and sent me different prebuilt couches that would fit what I told him.</p> <p>Truly amazing experience. He gave me his personal cell phone number if I had any questions. Just an awesome experience. So this morning I was ready to go buy. I called and was going to order.</p> <p>I called him and said, \"I'm going to order. Just making sure that's fine.\" So he said, \"No problem.\"</p> <p>I asked him how long it would take to get them to me and he said it would be six weeks. I was like, \"I don't want to wait six weeks. Is there any way you can get them to me in two weeks?\" Because I'm kind of an impatient entrepreneur.</p> <p>He says, \"Let me find out.\" So he gets off the phone and who knows what he does, probably calls a bunch of people.</p> <p>He calls me 30 minutes later and he's like, \"We can't get them in two weeks, but what we can do is ship you one couch so you can have it in time for your party you're trying to do in two weeks. And then when it's done you can ship it back to us and I'll ship you the new one. We'll be making the new one but we'll just basically give you a loaner you can use during the time.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Really?\" I was like, \"I don't know if I'll ship it back. I never do those kind of things.\"</p> <p>He says, \"I'll set a notification on my calendar so I remember on July 5 to call you back and make sure you get it shipped back.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Dude, this is insane.\"</p> <p>I was like, \"I don't think I want to do that.\"</p> <p>He was like, \"How about this? We'll ship you this and we'll ship you out covers and then you can change the covers to the color you want.\" He was totally doing everything possible to make sure I could have a great experience.</p> <p>And then when I went to go buy he was like, \"Oh, by the way, use this coupon code to save $1,000.\"</p> <p>I put in the coupon code, boom, saves me $1,000. Then I ended up buying another Love Sac so it put me back to zero. I didn't actually save any money, but I got an extra Love Sac out of it.</p> <p>So amazing experience. All around A+++. This guy did amazing. So that's something hopefully you can learn for your business and your customers. I was just like, \"I wish all my customer support agents were like that.</p> <p>We try. I think we have the best support team in the industry, but it was above and beyond. It was really impressive. So there was that. Also I screwed it up and put in the wrong shipping address. So he went and fixed all that for me. Just awesome.</p> <p>The next experience, I wanted to buy a Sub Zero fridge. I hear they're the best and they're amazing. I get all excited and I want one today. I don\u2019t want one tomorrow. I don't want one a week from now. I want it today.</p> <p>So I find out there's a place close to use that sells them. So I drive down there and I get there and they're like, \"Hey, how's it going?\"</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \"Good. I'm here to by a Sub Zero fridge.\"</p> <p>She's like, \"Okay, well come back here to the showroom and I'll send back a consultant.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"All right.\" So I'm going back there, walking around the showroom, looking for probably 15 minutes at fridges, which there's only like 10 fridges in the whole place. I'm like spending three minutes at each fridge.</p> <p>And I'm kind of anxious because I have money burning a hole in my pocket. So this lady comes up to me. She's like, \"Hey, sorry, I'm the only consultant here. I'm about to leave for an appointment on the other side of town and the other person is gone. I don\u2019t have time for you right now. But if you write down your name and number I can get back in touch with you.\"</p> <p>I was like, \"I'm here because I want to buy a fridge today. I want to leave today with a fridge.\"</p> <p>She's like, \"What kind do you want?\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Sub Zero.\"</p> <p>She's like, \"That's going to be a minimum of 10 grand. I don't want you to have sticker shock. That's probably going to be outside of your budget.\"</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \"What are you talking about? You're blowing me off. I\u2019m telling you all these buyer questions. I\u2019m trying to write you a check for 10 grand and you're telling me I probably can't afford it.\"</p> <p>And then I\u2019m trying to ask her a question and she's like, \"I'm in a rush. I've got to go.\"</p> <p>I have all these notes that I was trying to ask her. So she photocopies the notes and then says, \"Either me or someone on my team will call you tomorrow.\" The she scurried off and left.</p> <p>I'm sitting there in the store with nothing like, \"Are you kidding me?\" If somebody comes to your store with money burning a hole in their pocket, where's the entrepreneur? Where's the salesperson that wants my money?</p> <p>I was so frustrated I drove across to another place and bought a fridge right there. If she calls me tomorrow I'm going to say, \"You know what, I told you I was going to buy it right then and I did buy it right then. I bought it five minutes later across the street at your competitors.\"</p> <p>So there's salesperson number two who just doesn't care and just lost a huge commission because they weren't paying attention. So busy getting to the other appointment that she's not looking at the cash sitting right in front of her. If there's cash there, pick it up.</p> <p>Anyway, it just drives me crazy. There was that one. And then a third person. This guy I've got a lot of compassion for. He's the guy who's cleaning the carpets in our house. So he came in today at 8:00 and he left at 11:30. He put in a 16-hour day today cleaning carpets, busting his butt.</p> <p>He did an amazing job. I was really impressed. He's coming back tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM to finish up the project. Just an awesome guy.</p> <p>What's funny is that I actually did a podcast about him probably a year ago. Some of you guys may have heard it. It wasn't a Groupon, it was a City Smart. It's similar to a Groupon we bought from him.</p> <p>He came to do our carpets. And since then we've had him do it three times. Four then. Then we decided to have him do it this time. And I remember last time we had a conversation with him he was talking about how bad of a deal Groupons and Living Social and things were for him, because he always lost money and all these things.</p> <p>I feel bad because this guy is working so hard and he's spinning his wheels. I don't think he's noticed the fact that I bought a Groupon and since that Groupon we've probably spent $3,000-4,000 in carpet cleaning with him since then.</p> <p>I don't think he realizes that it's landed him customers. He's totally missed that part of it. And so today he asked me, \"What do you do for a living?\"</p> <p>In fact I had three different people today who came to the house for different projects ask me what I did for a living, which made me laugh. They see a punk kid in a T-shirt and shorts and flip-flops and a big house and they're like, \"What in the world?\" It was kind of funny.</p> <p>Anyway, he asked me, \"What do you do for a living?\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"I'm an entrepreneur.\" I kind of talked about what I do.</p> <p>He's like, \"I'm an entrepreneur, but I'm not good at it. I can never make money or sales or anything.\"</p> <p>It made me laugh. One of my friends and someone I respect is a guy named Joe Polish. Joe was a carpet cleaner for years. I actually bought his carpet cleaning course and went through it because I wanted to learn what he was teaching his carpet cleaners.</p> <p>So this is probably five or six years ago. That's how much of a nerd I am in marketing. I study marketing in other industries, just like it applies to what I'm doing.</p> <p>So anyway I\u2019m studying all of Joe Polish's stuff about carpet cleaning. Really good things. So I understand how to run a carpet cleaning business and how to get sales.</p> <p>So every time he's come to my house to do our carpets, I always ask him the same buyer question. I\u2019m like, \"Hey, how much would it cost to have you come back every three months and just spot check and re-clean things up?\"</p> <p>Because one of the big things Joe Polish teaches is like, \"Hey, customers are good, but you can put them on continuity and they'll come back every three months and they're worth four times as much money to you,\" and all these things.</p> <p>So I'd ask him and he'd be like, \"I don't really do anything like that, but you can just call me in three months if you want me to come back.\"</p> <p>Anyway, I asked him again tonight. I was like, \"What would it take for you every three months to just show up here? I don't think about it, just clean carpets. Every three months you're here like clockwork.\"</p> <p>He said, \"I don't really do that. Call me in three months.\"</p> <p>So tonight after he was talking about how he's struggling in his business and stuff, I was trying to have some compassion on him and see if I can help him.</p> <p>I said, \"Have you ever heard of Joe Polish before?\"</p> <p>He's like, \"Yeah, I've got his stuff, Piranha Marketing.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Have you gone through it?\"</p> <p>He's like, \"Yeah, I've gone through it all.\"</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \"That stuff's really good, man. Have you studied? Have you looked at it?\"</p> <p>He's like, \"You know, I've gone through it. But whatever.\" Whatever the reason. \"I'm just a one-man band. I've got no time to do all those kind of things and everything.\"</p> <p>I feel so much compassion for this man, because he's trying, he's working hard, he's busting his butt. He's trying to do the best, but he's missing the basic marketing principles, the basic things that could exponentially grow.</p> <p>The sad thing is he has them. He bought them and they're probably sitting there on his desk. I'd be shocked if he's gone through past the intro CD. Just the questions I've asked him of things that are in the course, I've gone through it so I know what he needs to be doing to maximize his revenues.</p> <p>But he isn't and wasn't. My heart just goes out to him. So I just wanted to share that with you because there's such different experiences. One that was just 100 percent spot-on perfect. One that was 100 percent spot-off horrible, and one who's trying and working but just doesn\u2019t understand it.</p> <p>He understands his craft. He's awesome at what he does. I don't want to say he's oblivious because that doesn\u2019t sound right. He's oblivious to the marketing principles that make his type of a business grow and expand.</p> <p>I wanted to tell him. For all you guys out there who are funnel hackers, I wanted to be like, \"Man, you just got to funnel hack, like what Joe's doing. Funnel hack what all these people are doing.\"</p> <p>That's the process in any business. If I was a dentist, I'd go find the richest dentist on earth and I'd funnel hack him. I'd figure out what in the world he's doing, what his people are saying when someone comes to the front door, what he's doing to generate lead. I would be doing that like crazy.</p> <p>If I was carpet cleaning, whatever business I was in, the first thing I would do is funnel hack every single person. Figure out exactly what they're doing.</p> <p>So anyway, I'm going to see you tomorrow. I might talk to you a little bit about it. I just got to the new office and the alarm is going off. I've got to remember my password.</p> <p>You guys are in for a live show. Boom, got the password right. So anyway, I said tomorrow I'm going to pull him aside and try to share some of these things and help him to understand.</p> <p>Because he's close. He's got the hard work, but hard work with the right knowledge and information, when you have that correct, then that's when everything exponentially grows. That's where he could get results that he wants without putting in more effort; actually putting in less effort.</p> <p>He could achieve a lot more with it, but it's just about understanding the core marketing principles. For you guys, hopefully you learned something from those three different people I interacted with today.</p> <p>Hopefully you'll think a little bit more about what you're doing and focus more on the marketing and the sales principles. Funnel hack your competitors, online, offline, wherever you're at. Because those are the principles you need to grow and be successful in this or any business.</p> <p>Okay, I've got some projects to do. I've got to bust them out. I appreciate you guys listening in. Have an awesome day and I will talk to you again very soon.</p>", "duration": "13:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_131.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1433974239, "title": "Episode #130 \u2013 The Correct Way To Set Your Daily Habbits", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The secret I learned from an old course I found on eBay.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about loving the work you do can make it hard to get what you wanted in the first place and that\u2019s why having a set schedule is so important.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things you will hear on this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why loving what you do and getting addicted to work can actually keep you from other enjoyable things.</li> <li>And why having a set schedule will help you not overdo work so you can enjoy the other parts of life.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why having a set schedule will help you avoid becoming a workaholic.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everybody. This is Russell and I want to welcome you to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey, everyone. So I was in the office today for two hours and about 27 minutes getting some stuff done as quickly as I could and then racing back to the house to go play some more.</p> <p>We were playing and goofing off and having so much fun last night. My kids are there swimming and I'm not. I've just got to get home because I'm going crazy. I don't want to be working today.</p> <p>I'm driving home and I started thinking like, I don't know about you, but I really, really enjoy what I do. Like too much so I think.</p> <p>Like when I\u2019m at home I'm thinking about going to work and things like that. And on my vacations I just want to get back to work. It's kind of this obsession. Hopefully you guys as entrepreneurs feel that.</p> <p>It's funny, I was listening to podcast from Jason Moffat the other day and he was talking about how if he sold his business he would be done. He'd never work again. He'd just do cool stuff.</p> <p>I was like, \"Not me, man. I just want to keep working and working.\" And for the last two or three days I've been like, \"That's kind of sad.\"</p> <p>It's like a means to an end. What are we trying to do? Most of us get into this business because we're trying to accomplish something or do something and then when we get there we have so much fun in the process that we just keep doing it. Which is good. It's good that we enjoy what we do.</p> <p>But it's also like, if you're not careful it will consume your entire existence. I don't know about you guys, but I love eBay. I only go to eBay about once every five or six months, because every time I do I end up blowing a couple thousand bucks.</p> <p>I do the same thing when I go to eBay. All I do is I search like every old guru's name I can think of. Like Jay Conrad Levinson, Jay Abraham, Dan Kennedy, Chet Holmes, Tony Robbins. Old school direct mail boot camps.</p> <p>I try to buy old courses on eBay because you can always find the good old stuff there, like tons of stuff. One time I found this tape set, and it was Jay Conrad Levinson and Jay Abraham and Chet Holmes. It was called Guerilla Vs Gorilla.</p> <p>Anyway, I bought the tape set. I tried to find it online like a digital version. They don\u2019t have it anywhere. So I bought this tape set and I bought this thing on Amazon where you can put a tape in and it will record to an MP3.</p> <p>So I had my brother go take all the tapes and record all the MP3 and then change it to an audiobook format. That's the format I like listening to my stuff in. I was going to put it on my phone so I could listen to it for however long it took me to listen to it.</p> <p>So I was listening to it and it was really cool, just these two guys' different teaching strategies. Jay Conrad Levinson is like boom, boom, boom! Dropping bombs of gold, thing after thing after thing. Just rapid-fire insane bombs of gold.</p> <p>And then Jay Abraham is more like the strategic stuff. Anyway, Chet Holmes came with a practical application. It was amazing. In fact, I should go find whoever owns the rights to that and beg them and buy it from them. Because it was one of the best products I've ever gone through. It was insane.</p> <p>So anyway, going through this whole training, one of the things I remember, one of the bombs of gold that Jay Conrad dropped that was just so valuable, he was talking about our habits.</p> <p>He said a lot of times entrepreneurs get into business and they work 100-hour weeks so they can get to the point where they can work like four-hour workweeks, like Tim Ferris's four-hour work week or whatever your goal is.</p> <p>He said the thing is when you create a habit it's hard to break it. The problem is that you do that, but you get into this habit of working 10, 12, 14 hours a day and after five years of doing that trying to get to this goal, but the time you actually could do it you have such an engrained habit that you can't ever leave.</p> <p>It was interesting. He said basically if you want to be successful with that concept from day one, if you want to live a four-hour-a-day work life, you have to set that from day one. Otherwise you create the wrong habit and you'll never be able to get back to it.</p> <p>He said if that's your habit from day one, then you'll stick with that. And you'll adapt and get all the same stuff done that you needed to, the bigger and smaller type formant.</p> <p>Anyway, I thought it was kind of interesting. So I'm kind of using this new moving process and everything as an experiment where I'm going to try to set my actual dream schedule now.</p> <p>Because when you move it's like you're shifting and you're shaking up all of these habits. Suddenly I'm waking up in a different bed. I'm looking out a different window. I'm ordering different food. All those kind of things.</p> <p>So my wife and I as we're moving in, we're buying different food or buying the food we want for our new habits. I'm really excited about, I read a blog post from Preston Ely a little while ago who is one of my favorite people/writers in the world.</p> <p>It's amazing. If you search Preston Ely and then something like daily routine. Actually I think it's Warriorinaire, like millionaire and warrior put together. Like morning routine or something like that. It's the coolest blog post.</p> <p>I probably read that at least 50 times. It's him minute-by-minute, what he does in his morning routine. I keep reading his, and Tim Ferris is always interviewing people like, \"What's your morning routine?\" and all these kinds of things.</p> <p>I don't want to just have a morning routine out of me just kind of bumping into one. I want to craft one perfectly. In fact, I even bought a domain name called WhatsYourMorningRoutine.com. When I get mine mastered I'm going to make a whole video showing it off.</p> <p>I'm trying to create that right now and trying to create my work schedule, my workout schedule and my fun schedule. I want to have time with my kids and make this new pattern today.</p> <p>Because I don't want to set it six months from now when I have more time. I want to set it today. Because like Jay Conrad Levinson said, I need to make that pattern happen today and really solidify it so that moving forward it's there. I've always got it.</p> <p>So that's kind of my goal with what I'm going to be doing. I\u2019m excited for it. I just wanted to sort of give that to you guys. Hopefully it will give you permission to stop what you're doing.</p> <p>Maybe you're not moving like we are, but do the same kind of thing. Shift your bed. Turn your bed around. Go through your covers, throw out all the crap and re-buy a bunch of stuff. Or do something to just radically shift your perspective on everything.</p> <p>The way you wake up in the morning, what you do, and actually crafting a morning routine, crafting a blueprint, crafting how you eat. Consciously designing these things so they can become the pattern. They can become the habit.</p> <p>That way, if you follow it for the next month, two months, three months, it becomes the pattern. And if you're following that pattern the right way, it will just change everything for you. You'll be able to stick to something and it will just make everything more awesome.</p> <p>That's what I\u2019m doing. I'm excited for it. I hope you guys will try it out as well. I'm giving you permission to do it. So just do it.</p> <p>Talk to your spouse or significant other and say, \"We're throwing all this stuff away. We're doing this. We're moving this.\" And just design it by choice, as opposed to what you're doing right now by default, and then watch the results that come.</p> <p>Anyway, I am officially at the new house.

This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a very excited Russell today. And I'll tell you why in a second here on Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>All right, so I want to tell you guys really quick and just let you know that I just got the keys to my new house. Woo-hoo! Oh man, I just want to celebrate with you guys, because this has been, you have no idea how long this has been in the making.</p> <p>So for those of you who don't know me, I am not a car person at all. I got the Ferrari, I was like, \"Eh.\" I got other cars, I was like, \"Eh.\" Cars mean nothing to me.</p> <p>The only dream I've ever wanted is like my dream house. I just have wanted it forever. And a couple years ago we almost bought one, and then we had some company issues. If you've listened to past podcasts you've heard the stories of the ups and the downs and all that sort of stuff.</p> <p>We had actually had this amazing house we had basically purchased, put down all this earnest money and we lost it all. It went away and we never got to actually live in it.</p> <p>And then the company collapsed. Long story short, rebuilt it. For me for the last eight years I've been working towards my dream house, getting my dream house. That's my one tangible worldly thing that really drives me.</p> <p>I hate that it does, because I'm a big believer in being driven by passion and people and helping and all these other things, and money is like how we keep score. But the one worldly thing that has been a driving force for me for a long, long, long time.</p> <p>In fact, all my friends and partners and people who work with me are scared that I'll never show up at the office again now that we've got it.</p> <p>So we found this house two years ago. It's amazing and I have been looking at it every day for two years, trying to get to it and trying to get it.</p> <p>When you get a\u00a0 big house, the monthly payment is not the big issue. It's like the down payment. To get a super, jumbo loan they want you to have like 20 percent down, plus like 10 percent in your bank account. You have to have a lot of money just in cash to be able to go and get that.</p> <p>So we were working and saving and doing a whole bunch of stuff. We found the dream house about two years ago, and finally we've been working through how to get it and how to time it with when school gets out and kids and all these things.</p> <p>And then the people who owned the house have been complete nightmares. The most annoying people I've ever worked with in my life. I hope they listen to this so they can know how annoying they are. They've just been a nightmare.</p> <p>Even last night, we packed a huge moving truck last night, and we signed yesterday, we put a down payment down. Everything is done. We just have to wait for it to get funded or whatever.</p> <p>I messaged them like, \"Hey, do you mind if we swing over and drop off some stuff in the garage so we can reload this truck again?\"</p> <p>And she wrote back and said no. Who does that? I'm giving you millions and millions of dollars here in less than 12 hours and you won't even be cool for one second. Anyway, super annoying.</p> <p>But, I just got the message. I was at work trying to get some stuff done and I just got the message that the house is funded. It's officially ours. They'll come and drop the key off.</p> <p>And so I am blowing the rest of the day, blowing work, blowing everything, heading home, grabbing the kids. We're going to head over to the house and we're going to jump in the pool.</p> <p>I don't care if it's freezing cold, if it needs to be heated, if it's dirty. I don't even care. We are jumping in the pool and we are having a blast. I'm so excited right now, as you guys can probably tell.</p> <p>What I wanted to, I'm trying to think of how I can provide value besides just me being excited for you guys. Hopefully my excitement gets you guys excited.</p> <p>Second thing is, I had a teacher at Boise State, my finance teacher. It's funny because everyone looks at business different ways, right? Some people are like, \"The goal of a business is to create jobs.\"</p> <p>And some people say, \"The goal of a business is to provide value to the customer,\" or whatever.</p> <p>His approach was, \"The only goal of a business is to provide wealth for the business owner. That's it.\" Everything else kind of just happens. It happens to create value for other people and all that.</p> <p>The only goal of a business is to create value for the business owner. I've struggled with that because, again, from a moral standpoint we are creating jobs, we are serving people, we are doing things.</p> <p>But when it's all said and done, if the business owner is not getting paid, he's not going to put his neck out there and risk the time and energy and effort and everything to do that, which is what creates the value for everybody else.</p> <p>So the value in all these other things that happen are all the side effects of the company. And I agree with my teacher that the one core goal of a company is to make the owner wealthy. So there's that.</p> <p>But then again I have the other moral dilemma. So for me I've always kind of struggled with that. But for me, I've always had just one major worldly goal, whatever you want to call it, and I still struggle with that.</p> <p>Sharing that outwardly is kind of hard for me. I don't know if you can tell, I'm kind of stumbling over my words, just kind of sharing this with you.</p> <p>But I honestly feel like it's okay to have something like that because it's what drives you forward. And you driving forward is what creates value in all the other aspects.</p> <p>It causes the ripple effect that helps the customers of yours to get value, which then hopefully gives them value. It's this whole ripple effect.</p> <p>For me, I've had this one worldly goal for so long that has been a driving force that hopefully the wake of me moving towards that goal has affected tens of thousands, if not more, people. And that's been kind of my goal for it.</p> <p>I hope it's not too selfish. I hope you guys can celebrate with me. And I hope at the same time for you guys that you won't feel too guilty having a goal like that.</p> <p>Some of you guys might be in a house like me. Maybe it's a car, maybe it's a vacation, maybe it's something. And don't get carried away. Don't make that the core focus, because people that do turn into bad people.</p> <p>People in this business, I've been around it long enough to see what money does to people, and it corrupts people and makes people do stupid things and it makes people not be themselves. I hope and I pray that never happens to me.</p> <p>But again, I guess I'm trying to give you guys permission, if you need that. And some of you guys don't need that. But if you do need permission to find one worldly thing like that that's going to be a driving force that gets you up in the morning and get you moving forward and get you excited.</p> <p>While in and of itself that thing is dumb and it's stupid and doesn't matter and we know that, the pursuit of that thing can cause a wake and a wave and a ripple or whatever you want to call it, that can affect and change and touch and serve so many other people.</p> <p>Anyway, that's it for today, guys. I don't have anything else. I'm just two excited. I'm two seconds away from my house. I'm going to jump out, grab my kids, give them a hug and a kiss. We are jumping in the moving van and we will be out of here. I appreciate you guys.</p> <p>For those of you who are in the Ignite Inner Circle waiting for boxes back from me, I had an hour blocked out today to respond for you guys and I can't do it now. I apologize in advance.</p> <p>But I will get you guys. I love you, I care about you. And as soon as I jump in the pool I will come back and finish up my work so I can keep you guys moving forwards as well.</p> <p>I appreciate everybody's listening in. Have an awesome day and we'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "08:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_129.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1433436173, "title": "Episode #128 \u2013 Recap Of Funnel Hacking Live", "author": "", "summary": "<p>See behind the scenes of what happened at our first annual Funnel Hacking Live event.</p> <p>On this episode Russell recaps, step by step, the stuff that went down at the Funnel Hacking Live event.</p> <p>Here are some exciting things to listen for during this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What happened each day during the live event, such as car racing.</li> <li>How the event raised $25k for World Teacher Aide.</li> <li>And all the other cool stuff that you missed out on if you didn\u2019t go to Funnel Hacking Live.</li> </ul> <p>Listen below to hear some of the cool highlights from the Funnel Hacking Live event.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>All right, everyone. I keep getting questions and Facebook messages and boxes and everything. For those of you guys who were not at the Funnel Hacking live event, if you weren't there, honestly I think you missed out. We had an amazing time.</p> <p>So I just want to give you guys a recap, for all those who have been asking and wondering. It was fun. For those of you who are Marketing In Your Car members who were actually at the event, I allowed you to pull me aside and say, \"You know, Russell, I heard your podcast about how nervous you were before the event, but this has been amazing.\"</p> <p>I appreciate you guys who were there and supported us. We had a good time. So I'll kind of walk you guys through what happened. I'm going to share everything because that's kind of how I am.</p> <p>If you haven't learned that now, I'm very transparent and I always want to know. I don't want to share numbers to brag, because that's annoying. I hate people who do that. But I want to share them just so you can kind of know what happened so that if you're trying to do an event, you can look at what we did as a gauge of what might be good or bad or whatever.</p> <p>I hope that helps. I remember when I first started going to Bill Glazier's mastermind groups and he would share his numbers. Then it was like, \"Oh, so that's how much money people make.\"</p> <p>When he shares with me how much money per head they were making on people in the room at the events, I was like, \"Oh, now I have something tangible I can assign things to, to see if I was doing it right or wrong or somewhere in the middle.\"</p> <p>That's why I'm going to share and that's the only reason why. It doesn't really matter how much money I made. All that matters is that you guys are getting some cool, actionable info.</p> <p>Let me break it down.</p> <p>First thing we did is the day before the event we flew in and we actually had our top JV partners, some of our Inner Circle members and some other friends and stuff come and we went to this exotic racing place. We went and raced cars, like Ferraris and Lamborghinis and it was super cool.</p> <p>And we got some amazing footage of everyone having fun, having a good time. And then Jeff Walker, who won the Ferrari, he was there too so we filmed an amazing, I mean crazy amazing promo video, with him there, that we ended up showing on day two of the event, which I'll talk about in a minute.</p> <p>I'm sure we'll post that video online so you guys have a chance to see it. But it was amazing.</p> <p>That was the first day. It was really cool just to get to know everybody at a more intimate level and build a relationship and give everybody a really cool experience.</p> <p>Even people that make crazy amounts of money, I thought they would be like, \"I'm racing cars, blah blah blah.\"</p> <p>But they all loved it and were so excited and blown away and grateful for the experience. So step one, if you've got affiliates to do cool stuff like that, do cool experiential type things where you bring them all together.</p> <p>The reason why we did the Ferrari stuff is I knew when we were giving away the Ferrari for the book launch, I knew only one person could win. I know that a lot of times if you can't win a contest, if you know you're not going to win, you won't even try.</p> <p>And we need a lot of people to try. So we said, \"Hey, let's do a top 10.\" And we eventually opened it to the top 15 partners, who get to come to this Ferrari racing.</p> <p>So now it's like you either win the Ferrari or you get to come and race Ferrari's with the top 15 people. And that's what got a lot more people to promote than typically would, I think. I think that was a big part of it.</p> <p>That was really, really cool. Next day, we didn't start in the morning, which turned out to be really nice. I think I'm going to keep doing events that way. In fact, I had Stu McLaren and a couple other people message me, \"This is so nice to be able to wake up the day of the event, come in, register, go out to lunch, hang out and then you don't start till 1:00.\"</p> <p>That's what we did and it was awesome. We didn't start till 1:00. We started at 1:00 and kind of did a recap of Funnel Hacking. Then we did a session on list hacking. Then we did Richard Cousins, who is one of our Inner Circle members, come and share his list hacking funnels, which are pretty intense.</p> <p>He showed those off. Then we took a break. When we came back from the break, then we did a session on your dream 100. I've talked about that with you guys before in the past. We talked about your dream 100.</p> <p>And then we opened up a new feature in Click Funnels, which is called Backpack, which is our internal affiliate system. And we initially were going to charge a lot for that feature, but we decided to give it away to all funnel hackers who were there for free and add it to their account, and people were going crazy.</p> <p>I had Todd, Dylan and me, my two Click Funnel partners, up on stage, and we kind of shared that all. It was really cool because I felt like we were like Steve Jobs at Apple announcing a new feature, which was cool.</p> <p>We released the feature, people went nuts. They had a break. When we came back from the break we brought Stu McLaren, who is one of the coolest, just one of my favorite people on earth.</p> <p>And he and his wife started a charity called World Teacher Aid. So we just made a video. It was really cool.</p> <p>I had a chance a couple years ago to go to Kenya with him and see this feeding program and school building program they were doing. So I made a video.</p> <p>And we launched a new thing inside of Click Funnels where basically every time you create a Funnel, $1 goes toward World Teacher Aid. And I showed the video and it was cool.</p> <p>I was crying and my wife was crying. Everybody was crying. Stu was crying. It was just really powerful and emotional. It was neat.</p> <p>Then what we did is for everyone who was at the event, if they wanted the recordings of the event, all they do is donate some amount of money to World Teacher Aid charity.</p> <p>And from that we raised I think about $25,000 from the audience, which is actually going to build two classrooms. Then us as Click Funnels team did another classroom.</p> <p>So we paid for three classrooms in Kenya, which was kind of cool. And it just really got everyone engaged in the community there. Everyone felt like we were moving towards a common cause, which was just really neat.</p> <p>If you're doing any kind of events or community building or things like that, I highly recommend finding a really good cause like that to get everyone moving towards and believing in it and donating towards. It was really cool.</p> <p>That was day number one. Then that night we did roundtables with 10 people each. Pick a roundtable. We catered these hors d'ouervres and food and snacks and everyone came in.</p> <p>And you could sit around roundtables and network and ask questions to a bunch of speakers. That was a really cool experience too. Really good networking last night and people had a great time and it was awesome.</p> <p>That was day one. Day number two now, we started early in the morning. I'm going to forget everything, but first was I got up and shared our book funnel and my thoughts on free-plus-shipping and trip wire offers.</p> <p>Then Perry Belcher, one of my favorite people on earth to learn from, he got up and showed his trip wire funnels, how they built Survival Life into a $25 million a year company using nothing but free-plus-shipping trip wire offers.</p> <p>And after he got done, then Trey Lewellen and one of our Inner Circle members, got up and showed their free-plus-shipping funnel they're doing with gun targets and they're just crushing it right now. So he shared his little funnel which was awesome.</p> <p>After Trey was done, then we brought up Todd Brown, who was our number two affiliate. And we all thought he was going to win the Ferrari and at the last minute he didn't. But just one of my favorite people on earth, and brilliant marketer.</p> <p>We wanted to do something cool for him, so we brought him up on stage and we launched our dream car contest where basically any Click Funnel affiliate who gets 100 people into Click Funnels, we will cover the lease payment on their dream car.</p> <p>And so we brought him on stage, talked about what he did, gave him a check for the first year of his dream car and then announced the dream car contest.</p> <p>And then he gave a presentation showing basically what he would do if he was going to try to win the car, and walked through the step-by-step process in about 30 minutes about what he did to promote the book and what he would do to promote this.</p> <p>That was awesome. Such actual, \"This is exactly what you need to do to be an affiliate and win Russell's car.\" It was perfect. He talked about that, which was cool.</p> <p>Let's see, what happened after that? Then we went to lunch and then after lunch, then we showed the video that we made of Jeff Walker at the Ferrari racing.</p> <p>We showed that video and then brought him on stage and awarded him the Ferrari, which was really cool. And then after that, then he got up and spoke and showed his funnels, his launch funnels, and showed the whole process there, which was cool.</p> <p>He gave everyone his launch funnels, which was awesome. And after that, then I got up and shared a presentation that showed people how to become a six-figure-a-year funnel consultant.</p> <p>That presentation was the last of the night. At the end of it I was going to sell our Funnel Certification program, which we were going to sell for $5,000. But we gave the attendees a $1,500 discount. They got signed up.</p> <p>We did the presentation. I used the Perfect Webinar Script that you guys can all get for free at <a href=\"http://www.PerfectWebinarSecrets.com\">www.PerfectWebinarSecrets.com</a>. Plugged in my presentation to that, did the pitch, and it was insane. I've never had a table rush like that before.</p> <p>And we sold half a million dollars from that one presentation, which I still can't even fathom. That's better than anything I've ever done, ever. That was just crazy.</p> <p>We were planning on opening up and doing a big webinar to promote the Certification program, but we more than sold out. So we're closing it next year. We're not going to open again until next year at the next live event, which is reason for you, if you want to be certified, you've got to be at the live events. It's the only place to get access to the certification program.</p> <p>So that was awesome. And now we're going to do a week-long event in Boise where we certify a whole bunch of people. We just got the rooms booked. It's going to be so crazy cool.</p> <p>We've got a classroom style where it's like a school classroom, which we'll do the training for the first half of the day. Then we have three other rooms we broke down into horseshoe shape.</p> <p>The second half of the day we're going to go into these rooms and actually work for like four or five hours on the funnel we're talking about, on the concepts. So we'll have people going around the rooms helping and strategizing and all those types of things, and then back-and-forth.</p> <p>It's going to be amazing. We're going to live-stream it for those who couldn't come. It's going to be so awesome. That was cool.</p> <p>And then that night, back up to the event, then that night after the presentation, then we took all of our Ignite Inner Circle members to a really nice dinner and fed them. Everybody got to hang out and network and that was really cool.</p> <p>And that was Friday. Then Saturday morning we got started in the morning. How did that happen? Man, it's all a blur now.</p> <p>So Saturday morning we started at 8:00. I got up initially and I shared all of our high-ticket funnels. Then I had Robbie Summers from my team get up and show how he sells someone on the phone.</p> <p>He got up there and did role-playing and brought people on stage and closed them. It was really cool to see that.</p> <p>And afterwards we had Garret White, the master warrior, get up and show his high-ticket funnel that he's using inside of Click Funnels. He's doing between about $300,000 and $400,000 a month.</p> <p>He came up, and Garret, he cracks me up because part of us are very similar. We come from very similar backgrounds. He played football at Boise State, I wrestled at Boise State. Very similar religious upbringings.</p> <p>I think we both respect each other, but we definitely have different styles about us. I'm very quiet and one way, and he's the opposite where he's up there commanding the audience and dropping the F-bomb every other word and things like that.</p> <p>But man it was powerful. And it was interesting. 98 percent of the audience was just mesmerized and loved him, and two percent got really offended, which we kind of knew might have happened, by just kind of the way he is.</p> <p>It was important, though, because I wanted him there because that's what people need to be doing. The way he basically divided his audience and showed his funnel.</p> <p>The goal of his funnel was to divide an audience. It was amazing. It was powerful. So anyway, that was amazing.</p> <p>Let's see, did that take us to lunch? I can't remember. Yeah, that took us to lunch. No, that was pre-lunch. Then after that, then I did a session on the perfect webinar, showing the scripting, the funnel, all those kind of things.</p> <p>Then Jay Boyer got up and showed 17 of his webinar hacks where he shows his whole process that he uses to close people on webinars, which was amazing. Then we went to lunch.</p> <p>Then after lunch we came back and we revealed the next big feature launch inside of Click Funnels, which is Acitonetics. We showed that and people went nuts. It was awesome.</p> <p>So Actionetics and we also previewed the new funnel marketplace that is almost live. And so that was after lunch.</p> <p>Then I did a session on what happens if your funnel flops, and funnel stacking. So I shared that at the end. And then we wrapped up the event and I stood in line for two hours taking pictures with people. I was so tired, but it was awesome.</p> <p>I just had such a good time hanging out with all of you guys and being there and seeing the impact of Click Funnels and what we've been doing is having on people's lives. It's just been so much fun.</p> <p>I appreciate all you guys who were there. During that event, we kept talking about our Ignite Inner Circle program, and in the back if people were interested they had a chance to sign up.</p> <p>So all said and done, just kind of a recap of some numbers. We raised about $25,000 for charity. From certification sales we sold over $500,000. From Ignite Inner Circle sales we sold over $300,000.</p> <p>And then between ticket sales and everything else, when you round it all up and tie it all together in a bow, the event did just about $1 million, which was cool.</p> <p>And we only really sold one thing, which was cool too. I didn't want it to be a pitch fest, but I wanted to make sure we monetized it. And we only had one offer and it worked.</p> <p>So next year we'll do the same thing. We'll have one offer. We'll relaunch the certification program next year the event and we'll also obviously be talking about Ignite Inner Circle and those who are interested will go talk and get signed up and register for that as well.</p> <p>That was it. Feedback was amazing. So yeah.</p> <p>And we pre-sold tickets for next year's event, which is going to be at the end of March in San Diego. So we'll get info about that up really, really soon. That was what happened. It was a lot of fun and I'm almost home, you guys.</p> <p>I hope that helps, and I hope that helps you recap the event and see behind the scenes with the numbers and the metrics and how it all worked, how we choreographed it.</p> <p>We had a couple calls to Bill Glazier ahead of time and I appreciate him helping me choreograph the event and kind of make it in a way that gets people maximum value, able to monetize it, but not in a way that people are turned off by it.</p> <p>Everyone gets a ton of value and it just turns out to be awesome. That's what happened. That was kind of how it all ended. Again, those of you there, I appreciate you being there.</p> <p>Those that weren't there, get on board for next year because these tickets will sell out fast. We already sold out, I think a third of the tickets sold out live.</p> <p>So if you want to go, be sure to book it ASAP because it will not be around long.</p> <p>Thanks everyone. I appreciate you guys listening in and we'll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "15:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_128.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1433187568, "title": "Episode #127 \u2013 Don\u2019t Get In The Way Of Your Own Success", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How $7 kept this guy from becoming successful.</p> <p>On this special episode Russell and his wife, Collette drive to the airport for the Funnel Hacking Live event.

My wife's pretty sure we're going to die. She's not used to this podcasting while we're driving.</p> <p>We're about to go through and we're going to survive. Okay, so today's message, this morning I was getting ready to head out, jumped on Facebook to make sure everyone was still coming to the event, and that the party's still on.</p> <p>It was, which is good. But then there's some dude who posted in our group basically saying they still hadn't gotten The Dot Com Seekers book, which I understand. It's been a little while. I've posted like 50 times why it takes a long time.</p> <p>But anyway I kind of responded back and said, \"Hey, this is why.\"</p> <p>I said, \"It was a pre-launch of the book. That's why it didn't get shipped until recently.\"</p> <p>And then the publisher, we're going through a publisher so we don't really have control of it.</p> <p>My wife's making me punch it past another car. Oh man, if you guys witness this death, tell our kids we love them.</p> <p>So anyway, I told him basically about the reason my book was late. I basically said, \"In exchange, we gave you a $2,000 course for free. And basically you paid $7 shipping and handling. It's going to be all right. Just calm down and everything will be all right.\"</p> <p>Anyway, the guy comes back and like private messages me kind of all flipping out about how, \"If I was to go to Denny's and if I ordered a steak, I don't care if they'd have brought me free donuts and ice cream. I ordered a steak and I want the steak.\"</p> <p>Anyway, just something like that, which whatever.</p> <p>We're going to be okay. I promise.</p> <p>And the thing that bugged me he said about the book: \"I would have bought Click Funnels and I would be at your event this weekend, but because I didn't get the book I refuse to invest in those because it just left a bad taste in my mouth,\" or something like that.</p> <p>And it just made me think about how often we let stupid things get in our way from being successful. Like, honestly, this guy could be using Click Funnels, which would give him the ability to change his entire company, change his life, as all of you guys know.</p> <p>But he refused to do it because his book has been shipped late. He could be at the event right now, networking with 600 other amazing entrepreneurs who are changing the world in their own way.</p> <p>But he didn't, because he's annoyed that the book showed up late. And I think that sometimes people, and this guy is a perfect example, he's just putting all of these roadblocks in his way to success because he's just annoyed, instead of being grateful for all the stuff he's getting and all the value he's getting from me and from us and from everything.</p> <p>And then after a back and forth I apologized and I was trying to be a nice guy, and then he messaged me and said, \"Well I tried Click Funnels, but it doesn't work for real estate agents.\"</p> <p>I'm like, \"Dude, you missed the whole point of everything. Had you have watched the 14 hours of the training,\" oh cool, some jets just flew over, \"If you had watched the 14 hours of training, you would understand how to use Click Funnels as a realtor.\"</p> <p>Had you networked in group, had you have logged into Click Funnels and gone through the training, had you have showed up at the event, you would know exactly how to use it for what you're doing. But instead, you're confused because you let a stupid thing keep you in the way of being successful.</p> <p>So the moral of today's lesson is don't let stupid things keep you in the way of being successful. Just blow it off. It was $7 you spent.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that makes sense. Now we're getting in traffic now and we're still pretty good on time. We have 13 minutes before we have to be there.</p> <p>Anyway, so I just wanted to leave that with you guys today. Just make sure that you're not the one keeping yourself from success over little trivial things. Let things roll off your back and look for the good in things and look for all the awesome stuff that can happen.</p> <p>And if you do that, you could be successful. You could be at the live event. You could be using Click Funnels. You could be changing your life.</p> <p>Instead you're annoyed about something outside of any of our control. So I hope that helps. Collette, any final words for the listening audience?</p> <p>Collette: Stay lovely. Vegas, baby!</p> <p>Russell: We're heading to Vegas. All right, we'll see you guys. We're going to be in Vegas here in a couple of hours. I appreciate you all and we'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "05:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_127.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1432668753, "title": "Episode #126 \u2013 Lessons From A Rubber Band", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A powerful lesson I learned from one of my mentors\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about some last minute preparations for the Funnel Hacking Live event.

I always try to figure out a different way to make that sound different every time I say \u201cMarketing in your car\u201d, but it probably comes out the same to you guys. But in my mind, every time it\u2019s a little bit different. A little more energy, a little different type of energy. Today, my energy is excitement and nerves and all these crazy things, because right now we are preparing for our first annual Funnel Hacking event.</p> <p>And it\u2019s really amazing, like, when we first started putting this event together, I was scared because, like, I hadn\u2019t done events for a long time. And when I was doing them, back in the past, it\u2019s always stressful. We would get, like, 200 people to sign up for it and then only 100 people would show up, and all sorts of stuff.</p> <p>And you never know, and there\u2019s all these unknowns. And so when we were first doing this, we were like, well, how many people can we get? We get 100, we get 500, we get 1000. We were trying to figure out. So we set a hard limit at 500 and I was like, that\u2019s going to be really hard for us to get, but that will be kind of our goal. And so, we get the room size booked and everything, and then we went and started promoting it.</p> <p>And we didn\u2019t even promote it that hard, we ended up selling 600 tickets. Which screwed up everything, because it turns out, the Fire Marshal at a hotel won\u2019t allow you to have more seats, they don\u2019t care how many people you\u2019ve sold to. Which is insane. So, we had to go and change the room size and get approval from the fire marshal and like, all these, just, you know \u2014 but, good problems to have, right?</p> <p>Definitely better than the other side around, we\u2019re like, okay, we\u2019ve got a room that holds 500 people, how do we shrink it down to 50, right? So, it\u2019s a good problem to have, it\u2019s just one of those things. That\u2019s happening, and then I\u2019m trying to just make this an amazing event. Like, the people that signed up, it\u2019s crazy. Like, I can\u2019t believe how many of my peers and friends, all signed up. So we\u2019re trying to make this just an amazing experience, and just have awesome content and videos, and just a cool environment.</p> <p>And we\u2019re giving away a Ferrari, and we\u2019re launching our dream car contest, and all these things. And then I\u2019m making, like, really cool handouts and order forms for the few couple of things we are selling. And just trying to make it like a class act event. And, man, I can\u2019t tell you, I\u2019ve been doing smaller events for a long time, and I\u2019m comfortable with those.</p> <p>But this one I\u2019m really nervous about. So, anyway, yesterday for us was Memorial Day. Depending on where you are in the world, or when you\u2019re listening to this. So went in yesterday in the office. I wanted to play with the kids, but I couldn\u2019t because I\u2019m just, yeah, I had to get stuff done. So I actually wrote four presentations. I think I\u2019m presenting seven different things at the event.</p> <p>So, I wrote four presentations yesterday, I had already done two before. And I\u2019ve got one more to do today. But this morning I had Aidan \u2014 my little four-year old had his little gym graduation. So I went and did that this morning, which was super fun. And just having, you know, just all these fun things happening. It\u2019s almost time for school graduation, we\u2019re finishing kids\u2019 projects, like, it\u2019s so much chaos right now.</p> <p>Note to self, don\u2019t ever do an event at the end of May, again, because that\u2019s when everything else on Earth in kids\u2019 lives are happening too. But anyway, it\u2019s exciting. So, now, I\u2019m heading to the office, and I\u2019ve got one last presentation to create. In this one I\u2019m going to be teaching people how to become seven figures, excuse me, six figures a year Funnel Consultants, which is going to be exciting.</p> <p>And then, at the end of it, we are going to offer our Funnel Certification Program. Which is a really neat program, I\u2019m excited for it, I think it\u2019s going to change some people\u2019s lives. And so, I\u2019m fired up. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got going on today. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just fun and so, for you guys listening, I\u2019m trying to think what value I can provide for you guys today.</p> <p>It\u2019s always kind of my thought process when I\u2019m driving, like, what cool can I say or can I share that will hopefully help everyone in their business. And I think for today, a lot of it is just like, stepping outside of your comfort zone. You know, like, I do a lot of stuff and I need people looking at me, man you\u2019re stepping outside your comfort zone, but I really have been.</p> <p>Like, I\u2019m pretty comfortable with all the insane things I\u2019ve been doing, but this was one, like, I feel nervous in my stomach right now, the event is not for two days. And it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s nervous and it\u2019s good. It\u2019s a good thing to have, and I think that \u2014 I had a mentor, back when I was about 19 or 20 years old. And I remember he was doing this presentation, talking about us and how we needed to grow.</p> <p>And he did this thing where he held up a rubber band, and he talked about it. He said, \u201cLook, this rubber band, like, by itself, it\u2019s just kind of useless, like, it\u2019s just this floppy little thing that doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d And he says, \u201cThe only way that this rubber band becomes valuable is if it gets stretched. Because then it gets stretched, now it can bind things together and hold things, and it can actually do stuff.</p> <p>\u201cBut it has to be stretched to be able to do it.\u201d But he said, \u201cBut if you\u2019re not careful and you stretch it too much, it will snap and it will break. And then it becomes useless again.\u201d But he said that, \u201cFor this rubber band to be useful at all, in any capacity, it has to be stretched.\u201d And I started thinking about with what we\u2019re doing, you know, with this event. Like, me and my entire team and everyone who is putting this together, I feel like we\u2019re being stretched.</p> <p>And a couple of times I felt like we were stretched to the point where we\u2019re snapping, but then, for me, I had to come back. And my wife today was like, \u201cSo, you\u2019re nervous, you\u2019re freaking out, what\u2019s happening?\u201d And I was like, you know, I\u2019m not, and I think it\u2019s because, like, it\u2019s okay. You know, like, if everything, if nobody shows up at the event, or if the event flops, or people are like, \u201cMan, Russell, you were really boring on stage,\u201d or whatever.</p> <p>Who knows, like, all the irrational fears going through my head right now, like, worst case scenario, next week we\u2019ll be back here in Boise, hanging out, having fun, and that was kind of comforting for me. It gave me the ability to kind of relax and just kind of take a little bit of pressure and tension off of the situation, to keep it from snapping.</p> <p>And so, I hope that that gives you something that can help you today, when you start thinking about that with yourself. That understanding that for you to be useful in any capacity, you\u2019ve got to be stretched, you\u2019ve got to keep stretching yourself and stretching yourself. And if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re just going to be a useless rubber band that just sits there, right?</p> <p>But also, knowing on the other side that if you stretch yourself too much, you are going to snap, and so, kind of finding that balance and being okay with whatever happens. And if, you know, again, if I show up and I\u2019m the only dude in the room, you know what, my whole team will be there, we\u2019ll have fun, we\u2019ll go, I don\u2019t know, go just have some fun in Vegas, and it will be alright.</p> <p>But best case scenario, we can do this amazing thing and change some people\u2019s lives and that\u2019s really the end goal. And I was hearing Sean Stephenson, he\u2019s a little tiny dude, motivational speaker. And just really just an impressive individual. He was speaking and I was listening to, like, his public speaking training. He said, \u201cIf you\u2019re nervous for, to speak,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a selfish thing, because you\u2019re worried about how other people think about you,\u201d and things like that.</p> <p>He says, \u201cWhen you change it to the point where you\u2019re concerned about them and serving and giving, it takes that away from you, the nerves,\u201d and that, he said, you shouldn\u2019t be nervous. And I\u2019ve been thinking about that. You know, like, part of me is still nervous, I wish I could say I wasn\u2019t. But I\u2019m still, I\u2019m nervous. But I thought it was interesting \u2014 I think a cop just saw me. Crap. Yeah, the cop, there\u2019s a motorcycle cop coming in my direction, totally was looking at me while I was talking on the phone with you guys.</p> <p>But he is, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s flipping around. And if so, I\u2019m about to turn into my office, little driveway thing, and he can\u2019t catch me anyway. Anyway, sorry, back to my train of thought. Where was I? Yeah, so, for me, like, again, I still have nerves, I\u2019m still, you know, it\u2019s the kind of thing, like, I can\u2019t wait to get to the point, like Sean talked about, where it\u2019s just, you\u2019ve got, you know, you\u2019re so focused on the serving part of it that you don\u2019t get nervous.</p> <p>But I\u2019m not there yet. But more so, I think that, as I keep preparing these things, every time I get nervous I\u2019m like, I\u2019m giving my all, like, if they don\u2019t get value from this, then, you know, then that\u2019s kind of on them, I guess? And as long as I do my best to try to serve and change and help people, that\u2019s really the key. So, anyway, with that said, I\u2019m at the office.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to go try to finalize and craft this last presentation, with the goal of helping a lot of people to change their lives and be able to take whatever it is they\u2019re doing in whatever capacity, and become Funnel Consultants. That\u2019s kind of the last presentation, and I think it\u2019s going to open up a whole new world for people. And I\u2019m excited to hopefully help facilitate that, and give people the ability they need to reach whatever goals and dreams they have with ClickFunnels and with the certification program.</p> <p>So, be awesome. I appreciate you guys. If you\u2019re in Vegas, I will see you soon. If you\u2019re not coming to Vegas, hopefully you\u2019ll come to the next one and we will see you at that. So thanks, you guys. I appreciate you and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "09:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_126.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1432622146, "title": "Episode #125 \u2013 The Power Of Moving Forward", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Powerful stories of people in our inner-circle and ignite program who opened up doors from skill sets they didn\u2019t know they had.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the power of moving forward. Why the process of moving forward can often lead to more or better opportunities.</p> <p>Here are some of the cool things you will hear on this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why sometimes what you want to do doesn\u2019t work out, but if you keep moving forward other opportunities will arise.</li> <li>Find out how many times Clickfunnels failed before it finally succeeded.</li> <li>And why you have to keep trying and working hard even if something isn\u2019t successful the first time around, because you never know what people are in the market for.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why always moving forward can lead to your success.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, guys and gals. This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to \"Marketing in Your Car.\"</p> <p>This message today is one that I think is important, and I hope that a lot of people listen to this and take something from it, because it's been really interesting.</p> <p>I've been watching a bunch of our coaching clients over the last year or so, [laughs] and there's been this really weird observation, really interesting, that's been happening. A lot of people come in, and when they come in they've got a direction they want to go in, right, and so we coach them in that direction, they start moving forward, and they start moving forward.</p> <p>Some people just, the first direction we point them in, they run and then they have success \u2014 someone like a Liz Benney, who had picked a path, she executed on it, boom, is making crazy money. She's done over five hundred grand so far this year after she picked her path and started running.</p> <p>But other people, and I would say probably the majority of people, don't have sex, success \u2014 ooh, I almost said the wrong word there, [laughs] don\u2019t have success right out of the gates, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I know it's frustrating for them, but it's interesting, because a lot of people that happens to, and I see it, they just fall away. They just give up, and it's done.</p> <p>But there's others that are super stubborn, and I think that I would probably fall into this category as well. [laughs] They're really stubborn, and they're like, \"You know what?\" They keep moving forward, and they keep moving forward, and they keep moving forward, and because of the act of them moving forward, doors become open to them, if that makes sense.</p> <p>I remember when I was \u2014 I think I shared this on a podcast \u2014 who knows how long ago, but when I was first getting started, I had some friends who saw what I was doing, and they came and wanted to work for me. After a year of working with me, they weren't making any money. I was, obviously, and one of them had this insight, and he told me the next day, \"You know what we realized? It's not so much, Russell, that you're smarter than us, or anything, the only difference between you and us is you're always moving forward. You're doing this, you're doing this, you're doing this, you're doing this.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s like, \u201cMore than half the time, what you're doing is not working,\" [laughs] \"but ten, twenty percent of the time it does work. Just the act and the motion of you moving forward working on stuff is opening doors and making other stuff happen.\"</p> <p>Anyway, I had a really good experience that just happened ten minutes ago. I just got a VOX from one of our coaching clients, and it just re-illustrates this point. He's a cool guy. He came to our coaching program and he picked a market that honestly, I don\u2019t think it was a good market for what he wanted to do.</p> <p>He wanted to sell to engineers. It's just not a market that's super passionate or ripe. They're not rabid buyers, but he was passionate about it, so he spent all this time and energy, and he built the perfect webinar and he launched it. He drove traffic, and he launched it. He kept going. He was squeaking by and making pennies here and there \u2014 making some money \u2014 but he was so passionate. He kept going back and kept tweaking it and making it better, and tweaking it and making it better.</p> <p>While he was doing this, he was frustrated because he wasn't making money, right? But what he was doing was he was honing his skills, he was fine-tuning, he was getting better and better at what he was doing. About two weeks ago, he met one of our other coaching clients who is having some success, having webinars, is doing really well with it, and basically said to him, \"Hey, I love your product. I think your webinar's good. I'd like to pitch it. Do you mind if I pitch it?\", and this guy's was like, \"Yeah, man, I would love to not pitch my own webinar.\"</p> <p>So this guy took the other guy's webinar and looked at it, was looking at it and saying, \"Well, based on all the work I did before, this is how I'd change it,\" and he tweaked it, and he fine-tuned the presentation, and he went last week, and he did it live for this guy, [laughs] and he crushed it \u2014 did like three times as many sales as the main person did, doing his own webinar.</p> <p>Both of them got excited. One's like, \"Man, I made a bunch of money doing someone else's webinar. The other guy's like, \"I made a bunch of money, and I didn't have to do the webinar. I actually made more money having this guy do it than if I was doing it.\"</p> <p>They just did another webinar. It just ended like fifteen minutes ago, and they closed over $20,000 in that webinar. These guys are going crazy now, and because of this, I talked to this guy, and I said, \"You know what? You should start a webinar-pitching business where you go through, tweak people's webinars then pitch it for them, and take a percentage of the profits.\"</p> <p>I think he's going to do that now. I just look at it \u2014 he came into the coaching program trying to go in this direction, and we coached him through that process. So far he hasn't made a lot of money from that process, but the skills set he learned along the way have now become this valuable asset. He's going to make ten times more, maybe a hundred times more from this, but he would not have ever gotten that if he wasn't moving forward, moving forward.</p> <p>Another guy, who is one of the coolest people. He\u2019s probably listening to this, so I won't embarrass him with his name or anything, but he knows who he is \u2014 we've worked with him on his funnel. He's been struggling. He has not been making money with his funnel, but through the process, he's gotten really good at something else \u2014 his Facebook Ads. His Facebook Ads, I remember, John and my team looked at his ads, and he's like, \"I have never in the history of my life seen an ad that was this good, that has this high of engagement and quality score,\" and all these types of things.</p> <p>His ads are amazing, he just can't get his funnel to convert. He's driving these things, and so last week, I saw him do what was brilliant. I was just so impressed with him for doing this. He posted on Facebook in our group, and he was like, \"Hey, my funnel's not making any money yet, but I'm really good at Facebook Ads. In fact, look at these things.\"</p> <p>He's like, \"If you want, I trying to get better at this skill and see if I can master another niche. If any of you guys want, contact me, and I'll do your ads for free.\" From that, he got a whole bunch of amazing people to raise their hand, obviously, and he's doing this. Right now, what he's doing is he's honing this skill. He's getting better and better at it, and through that process, I don't know yet where the future's going to go for him, but my guess is he's going to make a lot more money with this direction than he was with what he was doing.</p> <p>It was the byproduct of what he was trying to accomplish. It's interesting what happens when you're moving forward constantly. You don't know where success is going to come. If you've ever read the book \"Rework,\" it's one of my favorite books of all time. He talks about how one of the powerful things you can do with your company is make money off the byproduct of what you're doing.</p> <p>So you're doing a bunch of stuff. What\u2019s the byproduct? To give you an example, our \"Dot Com Secrets Labs Book,\" we ran a bunch of split tests, two or three years, and also we had all these split test results. I compiled them into a book, and we launched that. That turned into an extra three or four million dollars last year.</p> <p>It was the byproduct. It was just my split-testing results from other stuff we were doing, taking the byproduct of what we were doing. You never know where these opportunities are going to come and what skill sets you're going to create to become really, really good at.</p> <p>So what I wanted to say for all you guys is just, is the process is less of getting something perfect, and more of moving forward. As you move forward, and you continue to move forward, you don't stop. You keep moving forward, and moving forward. Doors will open. Opportunities will come to you. Things will keep falling into your lap that you never would have thought were there before. It's just really, really impressive, from both these guys, I've talked about it before. There's more that I could share.</p> <p>Another example is one of the guys that came to our training and wanted to be a copywriting teacher. He kept doing this, kept doing this, kept doing this, and spent six, seven, eight months trying to do that, and finally got so fed up and frustrated \u2014 and man, I'm so proud of him for this, though, but a month ago, he got so frustrated that he was selling his front-end products. No one was buying his up-sells, no one was buying off his webinars, so he just picked up a phone, and starting dialing every single person that had bought his product in the past. They might not have bought a product, they had showed up to a webinar, or bought one of his free-plus-shipping things \u2014 just started calling them, almost frustrated, and the first month, made thirty grand just calling his customers and saying, \"Hey, but this coaching thing from me.\"</p> <p>Then yesterday he told me he did this webinar. He had two people buy this free-plus-shipping thing, picked up the phone, called those people personally, and sold ten grand, just buildt from one little thing.</p> <p>It's again, not the opportunity he thought he was going to do. That was not his goal when he got started, but it was in the process of him moving forward, that his skill sets go better. He learned things, he honed things, and he got better and better and better, until, boom, a door opens up. That's the door you run through.</p> <p>It's really interesting. I was even watching \u2014 there were two podcasts where I was talking about what happens when your funnel flops, and I shared a story. I'm going to share it again, because I think it's relevant to this, where Bryan Tracy was talking about how he was watching this TV show, and it had all of these millionaires on there, and they asked the millionaires, \"How many times on average did you fail in business before you became a millionaire?\"</p> <p>They went through and surveyed everyone and they found out the average person was like eleven times they failed before they became a millionaire. Bryan Tracy comes back and says, \"You think it's because they all luckily, the eleventh time, stumbled upon the magic formula.\" He said, \"No, what happened was, the first time they screwed up, the second time they screwed up, and after ten or eleven tries, they couldn't help but be successful because they'd tried everything else.\"</p> <p>That is the key with this, you guys. Anyway, I'm so proud of these people in our group that are doing that, because I'm seeing, and again, it's usually a different direction than we even point them in initially, but because of the process of moving them forward and doing these things, they start building up skill sets that they give them the ability to become powerful and marketable and be able to open up whole new worlds and whole new doors for them, so I thought it was interesting.</p> <p>On the opposite side of that, we've got coaching clients, who I love as well, who are going through this and they keep focusing on one funnel, on one thing, and one thing, and they want it to work, and they keep trying, and it feels like they're pushing a square peg through a round hole. It's like, \"You've got to learn how to pivot and shift and try things and move things around. If this doesn't work, try this and try that,\" because we don't know what people are going to respond to. We can guess. We try to get as close as we can and we pray and hope that we're going to get it on the first try, or the second, or the third, but traditionally it doesn't work that way.</p> <p>You've got to be flexible. You've got to be willing to pivot, and keep moving around and moving forward until those opportunities open for you. I had an interview today with a lady, and she was asking me about that. \"What happens if someone's funnel doesn't make money?\"</p> <p>I said, \"Do you know what? Did you know that Click Funnels failed the first few times we launched it?\" She's like, \"What?\", and I'm like, \"Yep. We launched it \u2014 bombed. I could have just given up. I was depressed and sad. I could have licked my wounds and cried about it, but, no, I said, 'Okay, it didn't work this trip around,' and we tried it a different way. Boom \u2014 failed again. We tried it again, and the third time, it was a home run, and blew up, and now has become what it is. And it's growing insanely fast, but again, it's because we were moving forward, and opportunities open up when you're moving forward.\"</p> <p>So if nothing else you get from today, you guys, it's time to keep moving forward. When you do that, you may not get what you thought you were going to get, but you will get what you deserve, I promise you that. You will become what you need to be, and the doors and the opportunities will open up to give you the abilities to shine.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope that helps you guys. I just thought of another guy in our group \u2014 same kind of thing. Came in, wanted to be an MLM guy, and now he\u2019s driving traffic for ten different people, because he was moving forward, moving forward always, so move forward, you guys. Have fun.</p> <p>For those of you guys who are going to be at Funnel Hacking Live next week, I\u2019m so excited. We had five hundred tickets. We opened up a couple more. We sold about six hundred. It\u2019s just crazy, so we should have over six hundred people there, and it\u2019s going to be nuts. I\u2019m excited to meet a lot of you guys in person, and I\u2019m going to try to put on a show that will change your business, change your lives, and really rock your world.</p> <p>That is the game plan, and hopefully we will deliver. I\u2019m confident that we will, and excited for those of you guys who are coming. Thanks again, you guys. I\u2019m out for the weekend. Have an awesome day, and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "12:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_125.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1431964021, "title": "Episode #124 \u2013 Yes, The Potato Gun Blew Up In My Face\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Lessons from a whirlwind weekend that started with a potato gun exploding in my face.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about a whirlwind weekend he had which involved a carnival, a camping trip, and flying to and speaking in 2 different cities.</p> <p>Here are some of the interesting things you will hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>How a camping trip led to Russell burning off his eyelashes and eyebrows when a potato gun blew up in his face.</li> <li>Why Russell spoke at 2 events in different cities for free.</li> <li>And why working for free is sometimes really important.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how Russell nearly blew himself up and then went on to speak at 2 events just a few hours later.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell. I\u2019m doing this Marketing in Your Car for a couple reasons. One of them is so I don\u2019t fall asleep while I\u2019m driving because I don\u2019t want to die and I really need you guys to help me out, so that\u2019s one part of it. It\u2019s super late. I just landed on a plane.</p> <p>The last 48 hours of my life have been completely insane. I just want to tell you about it because I think it\u2019s just funny and I thought you guys would enjoy it because you guys are going to hear all my strange things that happen to me. It started with a potato gun blowing up in my face and ended with me driving home from the airport.</p> <p>This is my life for the last 48 hours. I don\u2019t do a lot of public speaking anymore, going traveling and stuff like that because it\u2019s hard with my wife and kids, and business and everything else but for some reason, I got booked to do two things this weekend. One was to speak at Ray Hick, just a really cool guy, really someone I respect a lot in this industry.</p> <p>He was doing his high end mastermind for his $25,000 clients in Park City, Utah and he asked if I could come in and speak for awhile. Again, Ray is someone I really look up to so I was like, \u201cYes, I will definitely come up and do that.\u201d</p> <p>Then Steve Olsher did an event called Internet Prophets Live and asked if I could come speak at that one too. I said yes. I had those two events happening this weekend. I booked them, had flights and everything planned. I was going to go out there and do it.</p> <p>Then my wife tells me about a week ago, \u201cHey, don\u2019t forget that on Thursday,\u201d this Thursday or whatever, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a carnival for the kids and then Friday is our church camping trip.\u201d It\u2019s called fathers and sons. We take our boys out camping.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cOh no, I have those plus I\u2019m supposed to speak at Ray\u2019s event and Steve\u2019s event the same weekend.\u201d It was the middle of when I was supposed to be speaking, so I had to call those guys up and say, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I can\u2019t come the day I\u2019m supposed to be coming. Can I shift the days, move things around?\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, somehow luckily because there\u2019s not a lot of flights coming out of Boise -- Boise is a little airport -- somehow luckily for me, we lined it up where I could basically go Thursday to the kids\u2019 carnival, Friday, work for two hours in the morning and then pick up the kids and go camping that night, camp all night Friday night.</p> <p>Then wake up in the morning, race home, drop the kids off, and then race to the airport, fly from Boise up to Salt Lake, and then Uber drive from Salt Lake to Park City, speak there, and then fall asleep that night, wake up at six in the morning, drive from Park City back to Salt Lake, fly from there to LA.</p> <p>Then speak at his event, fly home, and land in Boise. That\u2019s what I just did. I just landed in Boise after that whirlwind of traveling, speaking, traveling, speaking that was wrapped at the end of a camping trip. It turned out really well. We had a fun time.</p> <p>But the camping trip is where the fun began so let me start there. I was camping with the kids. You know, you guys who know, who follow my business and all that, I started this whole business with potato guns. That was the first thing.</p> <p>I got a ton of potato guns. I had 10 or so of them in my garage. We\u2019re packing up for the camping trip. It\u2019s funny, because we\u2019re camping for one night and we literally had my wife\u2019s extended cab Denali, huge car, completely filled to the brim with coolers, sleeping bags, tents, and pads, and potato guns -- just crazy.</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cHow in the world? This is one night\u2019s sleep. How did people back in the day go camping?\u201d Nowadays, you\u2019re basically bringing your whole hotel with you. It\u2019s crazy. We had it in there and had the potato guns.</p> <p>So we get there. We were the first ones there because I took the kids out of school early. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know, if I\u2019m going to go, let\u2019s make it fun,\u201d so I pulled the kids out of school, went to lunch and then drove down there and got a campsite, just goofing off.</p> <p>Then we broke out the potato guns and started shooting these potato guns which is like one of my favorite things to do. I really enjoy it. So we\u2019re shooting potato guns, having fun. Then one of the potato guns misfires. The potato doesn\u2019t come out of it.</p> <p>I know not to look at the end of the barrel because that\u2019s safety rule number 101 in my how to make potato gun course. I\u2019m the potato gun guy. I know the rules. We wrote the rules, so I don\u2019t look in the end, but I go back to the chamber which I had just sprayed for a minute, a whole bunch of hairspray and I capped it off.</p> <p>I opened up the back of it and all the hairspray starts coming out of it. Then I flip the back side open and look in there. I see potato jammed in there. I\u2019m trying to figure out, \u201cWhy in the world didn\u2019t it shoot? The fuel is coming out. I don\u2019t see any gaps around the potato. Why did it not work?\u201d</p> <p>So I flick the igniter just to see - yes, stupid Russell. I flicked the igniter to see why in the world it doesn\u2019t work, and this huge fireball goes boom, and comes out the backside right into my face. My eyelashes curled in half. You know what happens if you light your hair on fire.</p> <p>They curled in half. Then my eyebrows completely got singed off. Then the whole front of my bangs just shrunk up, you know how hair when it gets on fire goes, all the front of my hair. First, I\u2019m trying to figure out, \u201cAm I dead? What just happened? My whole face just caught on fire. Okay, I survived.\u201d</p> <p>Then I started feeling my eyebrows. \u201cThese feel all crunchy. Something weird is happening.\u201d I feel my crunchy eyebrows and my hair. Anyway, needless to say, my face had caught on fire. We kept shooting potato guns until both of them got jammed and ruined.</p> <p>Then we just packed up and went back to camp. That night, we were making s\u2019mores. By the way, if you make s\u2019mores, the best way to do them is instead of using chocolate, you use Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups. Oh, if you try that, it will change your s\u2019more experience.</p> <p>I don\u2019t even like s\u2019mores anymore unless they have Reese\u2019s. Now it\u2019s amazing. We had tons of Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, and we had the whole thing, making s\u2019mores and went camping. We went to bed that night in the tent with the kids, super fun, great time.</p> <p>Next morning, wake up and pack up the whole thing, get in the car, and I look in the mirror and I couldn\u2019t even believe how horrible I looked. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be speaking at Ray\u2019s $25,000 mastermind group in four hours.\u201d</p> <p>We race home and I have 20 minutes when I get home to the time I have to leave to the airport in time. I\u2019m in the bathroom with these little scissors, snipping off the singed hair off my eyebrows and eyelashes, and my bangs so that I don\u2019t look like I have singed, curly hair. It took me 20 minutes to snip off all the tons of singes.</p> <p>I still didn\u2019t get it all out. My hair looks horrible right now still. I shower real quick. Then I don\u2019t even have time to pack my bags. It\u2019s basically one night, two cities. I just get my backpack, throw in my clothes and stuff, and jump in my car, race to the airport, and then fly.</p> <p>I almost missed my flight. It was crazy. I got to the airport 30 minutes before my flight was supposed to leave. Luckily I didn\u2019t have any check-on backs so I was able to get on. I flew to Salt Lake, took an Uber up to Park City which was awesome.</p> <p>We go to Park City. I had a chance to meet with this group who was different than the group I normally hang out with. I\u2019m an Internet nerd so I\u2019m usually with Internet marketing nerds. This was a bunch of network marketers.</p> <p>It was a small room, probably 30 people or so in a big suite overlooking all of Park City. It was amazing. As soon as I walked in the door, they were in the break. I walk in and Ray comes, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d and hands me a microphone.</p> <p>I put it on and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d \u201cOh, what did you want me to talk about? You didn\u2019t even ask me what to speak on.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, just talk about this.\u201d So I go out there for an hour and talk about some stuff.</p> <p>It was really cool. I talked about everyone talks about their product or service, selling things like that. I just talked about that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. People buy based on results. I asked what everyone was doing.</p> <p>There was people in Beach Body, people in all these different network marketing programs. I told them, \u201cThe biggest, most powerful thing you guys can do is go and work for free for someone. Go get a result. Go and prove that what you have works. If you got a product, go and give it to other people. If you have a service, perform that service and just wow someone.\u201d</p> <p>I told the story about how when we re-launched our coaching program, I needed some good success stories. The first thing I did is I worked for free. I called up this guy named Drew Connolly, flew out to his office and worked for free for him, served him, and was able to help their company grow, and then from that, I was able to capture proof of video testimonial of that experience and then used that video testimonial to leverage and to grow our coaching program.</p> <p>I showed them the right way to capture those and everything, and just said, \u201cYou know, whatever your product is, step one, go out and serve. Go and get some people results. After you get results, then you can capture those on film and record those on your iPhone or whatever it is to make a really good video. Now, that\u2019s the leverage you need to do everything else.\u201d</p> <p>I talked about that. I talked about my Dream 100 strategy. I showed them how to do that. I showed them this concept of how to penetrate Dream 100 to dramatically increase your traffic and a bunch of cool things, stuff that if you\u2019ve read the DotCom Secrets book, and in fact, there\u2019s a bonus chapter if you upgraded and bought the audio book, there\u2019s a bonus chapter called \u201cThe Dream 100\u201d that I taught that whole concept with.</p> <p>I showed that whole process which was cool. Then I got to go to an amazing restaurant and hang out with all these network marketing guys, and hear their stories. These are all of Ray\u2019s top earners. There are guys making a million dollars in network marketing.</p> <p>It was cool to see their process because these guys make their money not by selling products but by building teams of people and teaching these people how to build teams of people. It was cool to see how business works in that sphere among the elite people which was cool.</p> <p>Then that night, I went to bed, woke up in the morning, again, six in the morning, Ubered back to Salt Lake, flew to Steve\u2019s event. Steve\u2019s event was interesting too because it wasn\u2019t like a normal Internet marketing event where everyone gets up and teaches and sells, things like that but it was more they had what he called a 20/20/20 where they had 20 minutes of teaching, and then 20 minutes of actual workshop time where people had to go work, and then 20 minutes of Q&amp;A.</p> <p>I watched some of the other speakers do that. Then I was going to do that, and then I ended up last minute changing my process and just gave my Funnel Hackers presentation because I felt like that\u2019s what that audience really needed. It was really cool.</p> <p>I kind of did that. It was awesome. I didn\u2019t get a sale. It wasn\u2019t a selling event. I just gave the first basically hour long of my presentation. Afterwards, I had a lady come up in tears crying, talking about how it changed everything she\u2019s doing. It was really rewarding for me.</p> <p>It was fun. A ton of people had my book and I got to sign the book. It was really fun. After that was done, one of the attendees threw me in their car and drove me back to the airport, jumped in the plane, sat on the plane passed out, and then woke up right when I landed.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m here, hanging out with you guys. It was a crazy weekend, a ton of fun. I was able to accomplish a ton of stuff in a very short period of time and just grateful, really grateful for this opportunity that I have to be able to go and share what I\u2019m passionate about.</p> <p>I was thinking about both of these events, I didn\u2019t get to sell anything at them. I just got to go and try to inspire people and to share my story and talk about for me, what my thing that I\u2019m passionate about which is Click Funnels and just talk about how it\u2019s affected me and changed my life, and changed other people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>It was so cool to see as I shared that with people, them have breakthroughs and get how this could help them as well. It was fun. It came back to what I talked about earlier where I had a chance this weekend to work for free.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t get paid. I paid my own way. I paid for my own flights, my own hotels. Not only did I not make any money, but it cost me money to do it but it was a chance for me to go out and work for free. I just want to encourage you guys to do that.</p> <p>I know that we\u2019re always there, building a business, trying to make money but there are times when you just got to give back and work for free. I looked at that lady who was in tears when she gave me a hug when I left. Who knows what that is going to do for her? I don\u2019t know yet.</p> <p>Because I was willing to go and work for free and try to share, and try to share my message and what I do, it affected her that way and a lot of other people. I think it\u2019s a blessing that we all have, that it\u2019s good for all of us every once in awhile to give back as much as you can and hopefully change someone\u2019s life.</p> <p>There you go. I\u2019m almost home, feeling a little more energized than when I started talking so thank you guys for keeping me up, not letting me pass out and die behind the wheel. I\u2019m also happy that I survived the potato gun incident. Hopefully by the Funnel Hacking event in two weeks, my eyelashes will have grown back.</p> <p>If not, sorry about that for everybody who is going to be there. All right everybody, I appreciate you guys. I am going to sign off and go get some sleep, and will be back at it next week, having fun, inspiring, trying to spread the message, trying to get more people in the Click Funnels, trying to take over the Internet marketing scene with it.</p> <p>One last thing, for those of you guys who are going to be at the Funnel Hacking event, I\u2019m going to show you a blend of two worlds, of the network marketing world and the Internet marketing world. We\u2019re going to take the best from network marketing and strategy that companies like Mary Kay use and ViSalus, and all the big network marketing companies use to inspire and motivate their customer base to spread their message, and we\u2019re going to bring it to Click Funnels.</p> <p>If we execute it correctly, every single one of you guys listening to this podcast right now could be driving a brand new Corvette or Tesla or Ferrari, or whatever car is your dream car, and I\u2019ll be paying for it. It\u2019s going to be sweet. I\u2019ll fill you in with more details soon, but just to get you excited about what\u2019s coming up.</p> <p>I\u2019m back home. Talk to you guys soon. Have an awesome night. If you shoot potato guns, make sure never to look at either end, not just the top end. Thanks guys.</p>", "duration": "15:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_124.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1431540135, "title": "Episode #123 \u2013 What Happens When Your Funnel Flops?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Are you frustrated because nobody is buying your product?

I want to welcome you to Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right everyone, today, the message for you guys today is all about publishing, about putting stuff out into the world. It\u2019s been interesting as I\u2019ve seen those in our high end coaching program who are successful versus those who aren\u2019t. It\u2019s almost one very common theme that happens over and over again.</p> <p>Those who are having success are publishing a lot of things. They\u2019re writing emails, sending out blog posts, making funnels, making videos. They\u2019re doing stuff. They\u2019re moving forward. The ones who aren\u2019t making money, they\u2019re focusing on one perfect funnel and not doing anything else except for making this thing just the most perfect thing in the world.</p> <p>They\u2019re spending months and months trying to do it. The nice thing about Click Funnel is it\u2019s about the process we teach at Funnel Hacking. You should be able to build a funnel in a day, maybe two days if you\u2019re slow but it shouldn\u2019t be longer than that. If you get a video camera, the iPhone cameras nowadays are better than any expensive things.</p> <p>Throw up a camera, record something, throw it out there. It\u2019s all about just getting stuff out there and publishing. I remember Jeff Walker. I read an email from him a couple of years ago that really illustrated this for me really well. He talked about how the best thing you could do in business is start publishing stuff, putting things out there because you can find out what people are responding to.</p> <p>So many people I know are putting all of their eggs in this one basket of a webinar or video sales letter, whatever that thing is. They\u2019re putting so much effort on that that it may or may not work. A lot of times, they don\u2019t work. I would say half the time, my stuff doesn\u2019t work either.</p> <p>Hopefully, each time, we get better and better at making things right but half the time, it\u2019s not going to work. You\u2019ve got to get good at just publishing and putting it out there, and seeing if people are responding to you.</p> <p>Put up a funnel and direct some traffic. If people don\u2019t respond to it, then do another one. Create something new. It\u2019s not that hard. It doesn\u2019t take that much time. If someone doesn\u2019t buy your product, guess what? Maybe no one wants to buy your product.</p> <p>I keep seeing people who have been spending six, eight, ten, 12 months trying to get somebody to buy their product when it turns out nobody wants their product. Marlon Sanders, one of the original Internet marketing guys, I heard him speak one time.</p> <p>His presentation was called A Dead Duck Can\u2019t Fly. He got up there saying, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t care how great you think your product is. A dead duck can\u2019t fly. You can keep making new sales letters for it and new videos, do everything but sometimes, a dead duck won\u2019t fly - or all the time.\u201d</p> <p>If you know your product is dead and nobody is buying it, or whatever the issue might be, you\u2019ve got to understand, sometimes people aren\u2019t going to buy it. Maybe the product, as much love, effort and stuff you\u2019ve put into it, maybe people don\u2019t want it. I had a friend when I first got started in this business, man, 12 years ago.</p> <p>I met him and he was selling this ebook he had written. He was so passionate about this ebook. He kept trying to sell it and trying to sell it. He spent two or three years trying to sell this book and nobody would ever buy it.</p> <p>I remember saying to him, \u201cKen, I don\u2019t think anyone wants to buy this book. You need to create a new product. You need to try something different. You got the skill sets. You know how to write a book. You know how to put up a sales letter. You\u2019ve done the whole process once but you need to create a new product because nobody is buying that one. Nobody wants it. As much as you love it, nobody wants it.\u201d</p> <p>I remember he told me, \u201cRussell, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve spent two years of my life on this. I can\u2019t stop now. I can\u2019t quit now.\u201d I just got to tell you guys, sometimes it\u2019s okay to be a quitter. You got to quit sometimes. You just have to.</p> <p>You can\u2019t just keep on. Eventually, the market will tell you if something is sellable or not. It\u2019s really cool how that works. If people don\u2019t want it, they\u2019re not going to buy it. If nobody is buying it, it\u2019s because nobody wants it. That\u2019s a lot of times the issue.</p> <p>Sometimes, obviously the issue is not getting traffic or your sales letters don\u2019t sell well, things like that. But sometimes just people don\u2019t want what you\u2019re selling. You got to be okay with that. You got to detach yourself from the emotion of it and just focus on what do people want.</p> <p>Awhile ago, when I got started, there was this really cool course called The Underachiever Formula. I later bought that company and renamed it Underachiever Secrets. As you can probably tell, all my stuff is \u201csecrets.\u201d But in that product, it was from Frank Kern and Ed Dale who initially published it.</p> <p>What they talked about was brilliant. It said, \u201cThis is the process. This is how you are successful online. Step one, you got to find a hot market. If you\u2019re not in a market that\u2019s hot right now, you got to change your market. I don\u2019t care how passionate you are about whatever, if it\u2019s not a hot market, people aren\u2019t going to buy it.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe they\u2019ll buy it a little bit but if you want to make a lot of money, you got to find a hot market. Find a market that\u2019s rabid, that people love buying things, people that are currently buying lots of other things. That\u2019s step number one.</p> <p>Step number two is after you find the hot market, then you have to ask them what they want. Never assume that the cool thing you want to create is what they actually want. My guess right now is if you\u2019re selling something and nobody is buying it, it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t ask them what they wanted.</p> <p>You thought about what you would want and you created that. It turns out you\u2019re the only dude or dudette who wants that thing. Am I right? You got to ask them what they want. Survey them. Do teleseminars. Do webinars. Ask questions.</p> <p>Call up your customers and find out what their pain points are. Find out what they actually want. Then after they tell you what they want, then you create that. You don\u2019t create your own thing. Again, the way this whole process works, it\u2019s by surveying -- surveys and finding out what your audience wants.</p> <p>It\u2019s by publishing, sending out emails, making Facebook posts, driving traffic to it, and seeing what people respond to. If no one is clicking on your posts, if you\u2019re spending $20, $30, and nobody is sharing or clicking on your posts, then guess what? Nobody wants it, okay?</p> <p>That\u2019s fine. Move onto the next thing and keep moving until boom, eventually you\u2019re going to hit a quarry. That\u2019s what people want. I can\u2019t tell you over the 12 years of me doing this how many products I\u2019ve launched and they\u2019ve flopped. I mean, flop after flop after flop.</p> <p>It was kind of like Michael Jordan where he goes out there. They said he missed more shots than anybody else but he also made more shots than anybody else, right, or more game winning shots, whatever the thing is. You got to put a lot of stuff out there.</p> <p>I cannot tell you - I have a road of hundreds of offers that we have published that have flopped, but we\u2019ve got a handful, maybe a dozen that have blown up and become multimillion dollar projects but I would never have got to those dozen had I not flopped over and over again. You guys got to understand that this is a process.</p> <p>You building out a sales funnel, think of it like school. You go to school for four, six, or eight years depending on what your major is. When you\u2019re done, you go out there and then start trying to do it. It\u2019s the same thing here.</p> <p>Your first funnel, your second funnel, or your third funnel and your tenth funnel, this is your education. This is you learning the process, learning how to write copy, learning what people respond to, learning what they\u2019re not responding to.</p> <p>I\u2019m sick and tired of people getting all upset, \u201cOh, my Web site\u2019s not making any money,\u201d and they want to quit. It drives me crazy. The first one didn\u2019t work. Make a second one. If that one doesn\u2019t work, make a third one and keep doing it until you\u2019re successful.</p> <p>When I was first getting started, I remember I was listening to this seminar from I think Brian Tracy actually. He was talking about there was this news show. They had 15 self-made millionaires up on stage.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to screw up the numbers but the concept, I understand. Basically he asked these guys, he said, \u201cHow many businesses did you fail in before you became a millionaire?\u201d They were trying to add it up.</p> <p>They cut to a commercial break and came back. Everyone added it up and they said that the average of all these 15 millionaires was they had launched and failed I think it was 11 times before they were successful - 11 times, 11 companies they\u2019ve screwed up on before they made millions!</p> <p>Okay, then Brian Tracy asked, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s because they all got lucky on the eleventh time?\u201d Do you think Einstein got lucky on the whatever, 3000th time he tried to invent the light bulb? No! What happens is you try one thing and it doesn\u2019t work, people don\u2019t respond, so you try something else, and try something else.</p> <p>Eventually, you\u2019ve tried everything that doesn\u2019t work. Eventually, the next thing has got to work. Eventually, you\u2019ve figured out all the ways that people are not going to buy and one of these times, you\u2019re going to hit one that people do buy.</p> <p>The difference between me and the person listening to this who is not having success right now is not publishing enough. People are like, \u201cRussell, you put out so much stuff.\u201d Guess why? Half of my stuff flops, okay? I\u2019m not sure which half is going to flop until I put it out there, so I got to keep putting it out there and keep putting it out there, and keep putting it out there.</p> <p>When they respond to something, and you say, \u201cBoom, this is the winner,\u201d then you keep ringing that bell and keep pushing and keep pushing it. For example, when we launched Click Funnels the first time, guess what? It was a flop. I hate to admit it, it was a complete flop.</p> <p>We launched it, we did a big huge launch with prizes, and it was a flop. Nobody bought it or very few people bought it. For me, I felt the product was still good but I had to figure out something else so we tried another thing and tried another thing.</p> <p>I probably rewrote the sales letter, I don\u2019t know, 10, 12, 15 times and none of those things works. I finally was so depressed I was going to give up and Mike Filsaime called me and said, \u201cHey, I need you to speak at my event about Click Funnels.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, nobody is buying this thing.\u201d</p> <p>But he\u2019s like, \u201cYou got to figure it out and you got to sell a $1000 version of it.\u201d I created a new webinar pitch. We called it Funnel Hacks, launched it at the event, and the rest is history. Since then, we\u2019ve sold over 3000 copies at $1000 apiece. That\u2019s $3 million right there in the last six months.</p> <p>Then on top of that, we\u2019ve used at that as a tool to add over $4000 active customers to pay $97 a month so it works. But guess what? It didn\u2019t work the first time or the second, or the third, or the fourth, or the fifth, or the sixth, okay?</p> <p>You guys got to be comfortable with publishing. This is your education. The first, second, third, fourth, fifth funnel that you guys do, just plan on it not working and be okay with that. Quit complaining. It\u2019s so funny, in every other business in the world, people understand that hey, you got to spend time, effort, and money.</p> <p>My friend is a chiropractor. He had to go to 10 years of school. Then he had to go get a SBA loan to build his office. Then he had to go get clients. Five years later, he\u2019s profitable. Somehow, for some reason, we think that the laws of business don\u2019t function online.</p> <p>There\u2019s too many people out there teaching get rich overnight, get rich quick, all that stuff and you can, and people do but it usually comes with a lot of effort, a lot of work, a lot of you cutting your teeth trying thing after thing until you find out boom, that\u2019s what works. When I got started, it was 18 months before I made my first dollar online - 18 months!</p> <p>I don\u2019t even know what I was doing for 18 months but I was trying, spinning my wheels before I realized how to actually sell things. Obviously the coaching, programs, tools, and everything we\u2019re giving you, my goal is to shortcut that success. That\u2019s why we teach the Funnel Hacking concepts.</p> <p>You find someone who has already failed 1000 times. You look what they\u2019ve gotten and you model it from there. Typically, if you do that, you\u2019re going to be starting at a better spot. You\u2019re going to be starting about where they left off.</p> <p>Hopefully, you\u2019re going to cut out tons of the trial and error but even with that, you got to understand that it\u2019s okay if your first thing or your second thing, or your third thing doesn\u2019t work. You are creating a business. You are trying to attract people.</p> <p>You\u2019re seeing what people respond to, and when you figure out what they respond to, then you ramp it up and scale it. One of the guys in our coaching group we\u2019re working on is kind of in the survival market. He\u2019s done three, four, or five versions and has this ad that just works like crazy but the different landing pages he\u2019s got just haven\u2019t been working.</p> <p>He\u2019s tried two or three or four. I actually created one for him. We have a couple versions. So far, none of these things are working but he\u2019s getting traffic. Things are happening. He just hasn\u2019t quite figured out what\u2019s that thing that these guys are going to respond to.</p> <p>As soon as he figures that thing out, boom, it\u2019s game over for him. You got to try. You got to be patient with it. You can\u2019t complain and whine because that\u2019s how this game is played. Anyway, that\u2019s my rant for today. I hope that for those of you guys who are publishing stuff, it inspired you to know you\u2019re on the right track.</p> <p>For those of you who have failed, I hope it inspires you to know that I fail all the time. For those of you guys who are getting started and you\u2019re frustrated because you\u2019re not making yet, I hope that paints a clear path of what to expect and how to get there.</p> <p>The last thing I want to mention before I jump into the office here is, is it worth it? Is it worth it to fail five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten times before you smash one out of the park? Yes, it is because one of these things that goes right, one of these things that connects with your audience, the right way when they respond they want to buy, you can make money in a month, two month period of time than most people make in a lifetime.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth it but you got to understand that it doesn\u2019t always happen first try. You got to become okay with that and go on the second try and third try. Just keep doing this because you will keep learning and find out what people respond to. Eventually, you\u2019re going to hit a grand slam.</p> <p>It happens all the time to those who don\u2019t quit after the first failure or the second, who keep going because they\u2019ve got faith. They\u2019ve got a vision. They\u2019ve seen that it works for other people. They\u2019ve seen that man, this guy named Russell, it works for him. This guy over here, this girl over here, if it works for other people, it can work for me.</p> <p>I just got to figure out what my audience responds to and create exactly what they want. If I do that, like I said, you can make more in a month than most people make in a lifetime. It\u2019s definitely worth it. Don\u2019t get frustrated.</p> <p>Stay the course. Have fun with it. This is your education period. This is your time to learn and to grow and to have fun with it. If you do that, I promise you guys it will be worth it. It\u2019s worth it in the long run. All right, I\u2019m at the office.</p> <p>Today I\u2019m going to have some fun. I got a lot of fun things I\u2019m publishing and see what people will respond to, see what gets them to part with their hard earned money. I\u2019ll find out. If it works, we\u2019ll scale it. If not, we\u2019ll check out something new tomorrow. Appreciate you guys, hope you have an awesome day and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "14:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_123.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1431373613, "title": "Episode #122 \u2013 Why And How I Canceled My Email", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What the last 24 hours have been like without my personal email address\u2026</p> <p>On this episode of Marketing In Your Car Russell talks about how he got control of his email and his Voxer account and how that helped his stress level and why he hopes it will give him more time to spend with his family.</p> <p>Here are a few of the interesting things you\u2019ll hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>How many emails Russell was getting a day and why that caused him to finally, after 12 years, kill his email address.</li> <li>Find out Russell\u2019s solution to being Voxed by clients at all times that were causing him to disengage with his family.</li> <li>And find out if Russell has yet achieved his goal of spending more time with his kids than he does at work.</li> </ul> <p>Listen below to find out how Russell cleared some of the stressful clutter from his life.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell, and welcome to \"Marketing in Your Car.\"</p> <p>Hi, everyone. Late night, just got back from the grocery store, heading home, and I want to tell you about something cool that I think I'm doing that I want to recommend to you guys to do, I think. [laughs] I'm pretty sure I am. I'm kind of stressing out about it right now, but I think that after I get through the withdrawal symptoms, this process is going to be awesome.</p> <p>As some of you guys know, we just had our book launch, Click Funnels launch, a baby, we have our live event coming up. We just moved offices, and we're about to move our house. All this change, and all these things, and it's been insane keeping up with everything.</p> <p>On top of that, we have all the normal things that we have to do, right? And for me, as some of you guys know through our coaching program, I give our higher-end clients access to me through Vox, so I get Voxers all the time. There's just all these things that are pressing on me, and it's like it's getting to the point where it's hard to bear, all of it, and so I've been trying to think, \"How do I structure things differently so that I can get out from under this pressure?\"</p> <p>I remember Dan Gable, who, those of you guys who know wrestling, he's like the Michael Jordan of wrestling. One time someone asked him about pressure, \"How do you deal with all this pressure that's on your life?\", or they asked him if he believed in pressure, and he said, \"Well I believe in it. It's there. I just don't choose to put myself underneath it.\"</p> <p>I was thinking about that. I feel like I've been putting myself under enormous pressure, [laughs] and I have this horrible problem where I just say \"Yes\" to everything. I want to do all these things, because it's completely exciting to me. So I've been trying to weave things out and trying to simplify my life and everything.</p> <p>Anyway, over the last 24 hours or so, I've made some big jumps, like some crazy huge leaps, and I want to walk you through them, because again, I'm in the withdrawal process right now, and it's stressing me out, but I think it's going to be really good, long term.</p> <p>First off, the first step was email. I had to get control of my email. I have had the same email address for like 12 years. Everyone in the world has it. I'm on a million newsletters, a million different things, and right now, on average, I was trying to measure between that. I use a service called Sane Box, which takes all your junk and tries to filter it out and get rid of it before it gets to your inbox.</p> <p>But even with that, I get over a thousand emails a day hit my inbox, and between that and Sane Box, it's about 3,500 emails a day. It's insane. I don't even know how...if you ever emailed me and I didn't write back, that's probably why I didn't. It just gets so overwhelming, and every time I walk in, I'm just sick to my stomach. I don't even know what to do, and it just never goes away. It just keeps growing and growing and growing.[laughs]</p> <p>I've been so scared to not have it, like, \"What happens if I miss an email? What if I don't see something?\", and so because I'm checking my phone a million times a day because email's coming in so fast that it's pushing emails off the screen, and I don't want to miss anything. Anyway, there's all this stress that comes from it.</p> <p>So my first thing I decided to do was I needed to kill my email address, which was crazy. I set up a new email address, and then I was like, \"Well, I don't want to just tell everyone my new email address, because I'm going to start getting a million emails.\" So what I did is I set up an auto-responder thing on my old email address, and I'm still going to have Kelsey, my assistant, go in each day and just browse, and make sure that I'm not missing anything super important like bills or things like that, who knows, whatever could come through.</p> <p>But now there's an auto-responder for emails on my old email address that pops up and says, \"New email address \u2014 how to contact me inside.\" You open it up, and it basically says, \"Hey, I was getting 3,500 emails a day. I can't keep up with it. But if you're awesome, and I'm assuming you are, and you want to contact me, then this is how you can do it,\" and I push them to a form to fill out. I push them to a Wufoo form, and basically the Wufoo form says, \"What's your name, your email address, your Skype number, and what's your question?\"</p> <p>When someone goes to that form, they don't have my new email address, but they can fill it out, and then I get that. Wufoo emails me the form that they got, so the form pops into my email address that says Name, Email Address, Skype, and their question. I look at that question. If it's something for me, I can respond if I want to, or if I don't, I can forward it to Kelsey or to Brent or to someone on my team to take care of it, and that person never gets to me.</p> <p>If it is someone that I want to hear from, then I can respond back to them, and then that person's got access to my inbox. I did that on Friday, before I left. It's Saturday night. It's been 24 hours, and it's been stressing me out because my email inbox only has three emails from people who've actually got the thing, filled it out. Two of them I didn't want to respond to, so I forwarded them to someone else, and then one of them was someone I wanted to. I responded to them, and that was it, and it's crazy.</p> <p>I even went back to my old email box, scanning through to make sure I'm not missing anything, but for the most part it's really refreshing. There's no one contacting me, and it's kind of stressing me out because of that, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>The next thing was Voxers. I've got my high-end clients on Voxer, which used to be really, really easy, but as we've grown, it's gotten more and more, and so I always try to get back to people really, really fast, and the problem is that means I'm answering Voxers all day long, all night long, all the time, and I just needed to get more control over that.</p> <p>So what I did is one of my friends from our Mastermind group \u2014 his name's Joe McCall \u2014 he bought me a new iPhone while we were there, which was super cool. He gave me this brand new iPhone, and so I turned this into my new iPhone. I've got a new install of Voxer on it, and I just gave this one to close people that I really needed to communicate with, people that I want instantly, like I need to have the contact with my wife, my team, things like that.</p> <p>The other phone, I kept on my Voxer conversations, and I kept it at my office. I didn\u2019t even bring it home this weekend. I don\u2019t even have it. People are probably Voxing me, and I don\u2019t have the ability to respond back to them. I\u2019m going to respond back to them on Monday when I get to the office, and then I\u2019ll just have that at the office, and I\u2019ll do client work there, and then when I\u2019m home, I don\u2019t do client work there anymore, which is kind of cool.</p> <p>That was the next barrier that I put up, and then the next thing is, my assistant Kelsey's been my assistant for four or five years. She's been doing the support role and assistant and things like that. Now I'm trying to make her more of an assistant. Each day, she comes in to my office, and the day, gives me a write-up of what's happening the next day, tells me what's in my inbox, who I've got calls with, what's happening. She's been kind of controlling my whole life. She's been checking my emails. She's trying to put up as many barriers around me and take care of me, so I don't have to stress out.</p> <p>She gets my lunches now, all these kind of things, so I can focus on what I do best, which is what brings the money in. The next thing I'm going to try to start doing is I'm going to try to start \u2014 because I don't know about you guys, but at the beginning of the year, I set a goal. One of my goals was to spend more time with my kids than I do at the office. So far, I haven't done that yet, but these are the first steps to get me to that point. Next, I'm going to start trying to spend more time in the mornings with my wife, maybe take her to the movies once or twice a week in the mornings. Spending more time with my kids \u2014 coming home a little earlier.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm trying to get this under control, and it's hard for me. I don't know if you guys are like me, serial entrepreneurs. This has been a hard, painful process. I totally keep checking my phone, and there's nothing there for me. There's no one to talk to, which is good. I've got to focus on who I love the most.</p> <p>As I said, I'm going through withdrawals right now, but I think, hopefully, in a couple of days I'll realize that nobody really needs to talk to me, that I'm going to be okay, and I will go have a chance to be more present with the people that I love and that I care about, and things like that.</p> <p>Anyways, it's kind of cool. I'm excited for it. It's painful right now, but I think it's going to be good, and I just want to recommend for you to do the same thing, to start putting up some barriers. Start making some rules. I remember Alex Mendosian, one of my first mentors, and one of the smartest dudes \u2014 just an amazing guy. I remember him telling me probably five or six times over the last 12 years, I've heard him speak about retiring your email. Once a year, he'll offer you an email address. I've never done it. I've been so scared, and I finally am doing it. I'm finally getting out from under that pressure, like Dan Gable said.</p> <p>So I can focus, and I can create better. I can be better, and be more, and I'm excited for it. I hope that this gives you guys permission to do that, to turn off your email. It took me a while to figure out the right way to do that, and I think that that way that I figured out works. It's really smart, and I think it's working really good. Again, we're basically vacation auto-responder messages back to them. It tells them to fill out a form. The form gets sent to me, and I decide if I want to respond or forward it to somebody else, and it's really simple and easy to do, and something that I recommend for you guys to test out and to try.</p> <p>Anyway, hope that helps. I am home with the groceries. I\u2019m going to go in and be with my wife and my baby, Nora, who\u2019s probably still awake. Everyone else had better be asleep. [laughs] I appreciate you guys for listening. I hope things are awesome, and if you don\u2019t have your tickets to the Funnel Hacking Event, go and get them. It\u2019s going to be amazing.

We\u2019ve had our inner circle mastermind group here. I got to tell you, I have been in a lot of really good groups. I was in Bill Glazer\u2019s for six years. I was in Ryan Deiss\u2019 once. I\u2019ve been in a lot of them. I\u2019ve been in Joe Polish\u2019s.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been in as many as I could join. I got to tell you that the group - and I\u2019m not just saying this because I\u2019m biased. I got more value out of the group than I have out of any other group ten times over. Just the caliber people that are in it are amazing.</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful to be the one that gets to facilitate it. It\u2019s one of the most amazing, cool things in the world. It\u2019s interesting, I used to have a mastermind group probably seven, eight years ago that ran for two or three years. We just shut it down eventually because it wasn\u2019t super profitable and the groups were okay.</p> <p>They just weren't where I wanted them to be at. It was kind of whatever. When we relaunched this about 18 months ago, I was really nervous, \u201cDo I want to do this again? Do I not?\u201d The first meeting when we did it, we had signed I think eight people that had joined the inner circle so it was only a one-day meeting right before we did a three-day workshop.</p> <p>Then the next meeting, we had the group had grown to be a two-day meeting. Then the next one, we had a two-day meeting but it was so packed. We had 30 something people that were in it which is a good problem. People are excited and they want to join.</p> <p>Then this time, we turned it into a three-day meeting just because we had so many people in it. We\u2019re actually going to be splitting the groups now. I told them last time I was going to split the groups too but everyone freaked out, \u201cNo, we\u2019d rather have bigger groups.\u201d Anyway, so I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do but we\u2019ll see.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure if we keep growing at the pace we have, we\u2019ll have to open another one. It\u2019s just been the most amazing experience for me and for them, got a ton of good stuff. We\u2019re actually going to be going today and do half a day with everybody because what was interesting, there\u2019s always themes that happen at these events.</p> <p>The last inner circle, the theme was definitely focused around webinars. That was the topic everyone was focusing on. That\u2019s what we were digging deep into is webinar funnels, cycles, and what you do and how you do it. It was really fascinating.</p> <p>It was really cool to see that and get tons of value out of that as a group. Then as a group, everyone went out and over the last four months since our last meeting, people have been doing webinars. We have people making $50,000 a week right now doing webinars. We have people, one guy just passed $100,000 doing webinars.</p> <p>It\u2019s really fun watching all of the success coming from that. That\u2019s been cool. Then the theme this time -- we weren\u2019t planning on it at all. It just evolved into that -- has been high ticket phone sales. Everyone is starting to try to add elements of that into their company and trying to figure out how to get that as part of what they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>And so today we decided to do bonus session. It was kind of cool. I\u2019m going to be coming in here in about 30 minutes, about 45 minutes actually and I\u2019m going to be showing off two different high ticket sales funnels that I believe are probably the two most effective high ticket phone sales funnels online. One of them is mine, I\u2019m not going to lie.</p> <p>The other one is another one that I think is amazing. In fact, I\u2019m going to be the person whose funnel this is will be actually speaking at the Funnel Hacking event and will be showing off this funnel. If you don\u2019t have tickets to Funnel Hacking yet, go and get them, <a href=\"http://www.funnelhacking.com\">FunnelHacking.com</a>. I\u2019m going to be showing those off today first.</p> <p>Then we\u2019ve got our two sales guys that do all of our sales coming in. These guys are amazing. Some of you guys know my back story. We used to have a sales floor of 60 full time sales guys. The two best guys were Robbie and Randy. They were the two best guys we had on our team.</p> <p>Now that we no longer have our sales floor, we didn\u2019t have any phone sales for three or four years. Then we decided to bring back in - they came back in. It\u2019s crazy. These two guys alone are doing as much volume as 60 guys were doing before back in the day which is nuts.</p> <p>Part of it is the process and part of it is them but the process is really cool. We went from back in the old days when we had our 60 sales guys, we were averaging about $120 for every lead we got. Right now, we\u2019re averaging over $1100 for every lead we get. We\u2019ve almost 10xed what we were making for every lead we would get which is cool.</p> <p>That has to do with the process. Then Robbie and Randy are the two best sales guys I think on earth. They\u2019re amazing. They really are. Robbie is going to be going over the script today, showing everyone the script, going through it, training them on it so they can go back and train their staff on it which is going to be really cool.</p> <p>In the second half, Randy is going to come and talk about his close because he\u2019s got this thing he does that is - I remember about a month ago he sat down with me and he asked me some questions, \u201cWhy do people buy from you?\u201d I was trying to tell him, \u201cOh, they buy because of this and this.\u201d He said, \u201cWrong, that\u2019s not why people buy. I\u2019ve talked to more of your customers than you ever have. I\u2019ve talked to thousands of your customers. Let me tell you exactly why people buy.\u201d</p> <p>He explained it. It was nuts. It was one of the coolest things ever. He\u2019s going to be sharing that with everybody today too. It\u2019s pretty exciting anyway. We\u2019re having a good time. Most of the people that are there are going to come over to the office today and just see our operation, see what\u2019s going down, how we run what we do which will be kind of fun as well.</p> <p>It\u2019s exciting but I just have had a great time with those guys and some interesting things. One of the things I learned from the mastermind group, one of the guys in our group, his name is Joe McCaul. Joe first off is just a stud. He\u2019s one of the coolest guys I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s been helping me with my real estate nightmares in St. Louis, getting rid of my homes, getting the other ones fixed up.</p> <p>He\u2019s a crazy nice guy. He messaged me I think two or three weeks before the mastermind. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey Russell, I want to make $250,000 new money before the mastermind. Here\u2019s my strategy.\u201d We went back and forth on it a little bit. Then he executed on it.</p> <p>He got to the meeting all depressed because he only made $98,000 in the two weeks or whatever. It was so awesome. He\u2019s awesome. One thing he was talking about, his primary lead generation source is podcasts which is kind of cool, seeing as you guys are listening in the podcast.</p> <p>He said that they found podcast listeners are way more affluent, they have more money. People that buy from iPhones are worth way more. I\u2019m guessing that 90% of you guys right now are probably listening in on the iPhone or some version of an Apple product, so the highest quality leads.</p> <p>That\u2019s his entire lead gen strategy, based off podcasts which is so cool to see how he was doing it and why he was doing it. He was telling us that I think it was Expedia or one of the airlines, they found that same stat, that Apple buyers were worth more money so if you came from an Apple device, they showed you the more expensive hotels.</p> <p>If you came from Android, they showed you the cheaper hotels to increase conversions which is awesome. That was really cool. Jay Bower spoke. He\u2019s going to be speaking at the Funnel Hacking event. He\u2019s a big guy that teaches a really cool webinar process that he does. He\u2019s a webinar host, a full-time webinar host.</p> <p>Every Thursday night, he hosts a webinar for somebody. He makes $100,000 a week doing it. He just showed his whole process for how he does it, the sequence when someone registers, what they do when they show up, and the aftermath and all of the operational side of a webinar. He had 40 or 50 different points of what he did, each step along the way to increase the tendency of more people to show up.</p> <p>Just a couple quick bombs I\u2019ll drop to share with you guys as our faithful listeners, one of them that we\u2019ve been doing for the last little while that he talked about as well is he uses GoToWebinar. Three hours before the webinar starts, he changes the title in GoToWebinar.</p> <p>Say your title is \u201cFunnel Hacks,\u201d \u201cFunnel Hacks Presentation.\u201d He changes the title to \u201c**Starting Now,\u201d or, \u201cStarting in three hours**,\u201d then \u201cFunnel Hacks.\u201d Then it says, \u201cDo you want to update all participants about this change?\u201d He says, \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Then boom, it emails everyone who is registered with the new webinar title which is, \u201cWebinar starting in three hours.\u201d Then he changes that in two hours, then at one hour, and GoToWebinar will automatically send that out.</p> <p>He does one more 20 minutes ahead. He gets GoToWebianr to send out four emails for him off of their IP which gets amazing deliverability. That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing to get people on which is awesome. We\u2019ve been doing that as well and it just works great.</p> <p>One thing I got from him, we did a webinar the other day and we did over $100,000 live on the webinar which was really cool. That\u2019s always my goal. We hit it about once or twice a month which is exciting. Anyway, we did $100,000 on this webinar.</p> <p>Then I was looking at Jay\u2019s follow-up sequence that he taught at the last mastermind meeting. One of the steps that he does is so cool. Some of you guys may have seen this last week. He\u2019s got a girl who goes and will not transcribe the webinar but rewrite it in cliff notes format.</p> <p>She has a picture of the slide and recaps each slide. He took mine and a couple other people in the mastermind group, and took our presentations and had this girl go through and do it. She gave me back this 70 page word doc with basically the cliff notes of my webinar.</p> <p>The last day of the webinar, before I closed down the replay, I just said basically, \u201cCliff notes,\u201d or something like that, and emailed it and said, \u201cHey everyone, the webinar is coming down tonight at midnight. Because of the short time I want to speed this process up for you. Step one, download the cliff notes here. Step two, watch the webinar here. Step three, here\u2019s the direct order link to go get started and get your discount, blah, blah.\u201d</p> <p>In that follow-up sequence, we did an additional $150,000. That turned into a $250,000 webinar and more than half of it came from the follow-up sequence from stuff we learned from Jay which is nuts. Jay will be at Funnel Hacking as well, a bunch of cool stuff.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the office, you guys, grabbing some stuff to head over to the event. I got to go but I want you guys to know we appreciate you. If you want to be at our next inner circle mastermind meeting, go to <a href=\"http://www.DotComSecretsIgnite.com\">DotComSecretsIgnite.com</a>. You guys need to be there.</p> <p>They\u2019re amazing. It\u2019s by far the best marketing group online, and I know because I\u2019ve joined literally every other mastermind group seeking for the right people, and all of them -- no offense to all the people I went to -- they weren\u2019t good. We built an amazing group. If you feel like you could be or should be part of that, go to <a href=\"http://www.DotComSecretsIgnite.com\">DotComSecretsIgnite.com</a>.</p> <p>Let Robbie and Randy know that you want in the inner circle and we\u2019ll get you set up for our next meeting which is in September. Other than that, make sure you also get to the funnel hacking event, <a href=\"http://www.FunnelHacking.com\">FunnelHacking.com</a>.</p> <p>And also guys, one thing that Joe talked about on podcasts is you got to ask your listeners for reviews. I never do that. It makes me nervous. I don\u2019t even know how to review a podcast. If you like Marketing in Your Car, if you could do me one last favor today, go to I\u2019m guessing iTunes and leave some feedback.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to go try to figure out how to read the feedback. I would really appreciate it because that would be super cool, and maybe get a few more people listening in while I\u2019m driving to work. I appreciate you guys. Thanks so much and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "12:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_121.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1430498542, "title": "Episode #120 \u2013 Barricades To Protect Your Super Power", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What people and systems are you putting in place, so that you can focus 100% of your time on your super power?</p> <p>On this first episode after moving to a new office Russell talks about a few cool things that he has going on right now including the new Funnel Hacker TV podcast.

I think this is my first podcast since we\u2019ve been in the new office. I did one talking about going to the new office. Now we\u2019re there. We moved in. It\u2019s fun, exciting, new, and all the fun stuff that comes with that.</p> <p>This is the first time I think I\u2019ve messaged you since I\u2019ve been over here. So I\u2019m actually driving home right now. I\u2019m actually, just sometimes I don\u2019t plan things. We\u2019re also moving our house soon. Soon, my house will be close to the office.</p> <p>Then it will be a short commute again but for right now, the house is far away. You guys may get a couple episodes that will be a little bit longer than normal. I hope you guys don\u2019t mind. It should be fine. Anyway, I hope that things are going awesome for all you guys. I\u2019m having a ton of fun.</p> <p>It\u2019s been insane how business has been. You know, every month, we keep growing and this month, we just smashed through our records again from last month which last month, we were like, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to beat these,\u201d and we did it again. It\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>Hopefully we\u2019ll keep it rocking and rolling. A couple other exciting things, some of you guys know we launched the Funnel Hacker video podcast today which I\u2019m finally excited. I\u2019ve been talking to you guys about it for awhile. I hope you guys go and subscribe.</p> <p>It will be in iTunes hopefully by tomorrow but right now, it\u2019s just online. ITunes will be all right for it but it\u2019s video based because we\u2019re showing you guys awesome cool stuff. I would say make sure you subscribe to the video based one.</p> <p>Basically, all you got to do is go to FunnelHacker.tv and see episode number one. It was really fun. Basically I sketch out the concept of a funnel. Then we bring the person on whose funnel we\u2019re sketching out. They\u2019re going to show us, talk to us about the psychology, why they did what they did, and then for all those guys who are DCS Labs members, you\u2019ll get the funnel for free in your account which is kind of cool.</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening. I did the first episode one was on the DotCom Secrets book launch. I showed that off. Hopefully it will give you guys some cool insights and ideas from that funnel. That\u2019s what\u2019s going down over there.</p> <p>We got the big live Funnel Hacking event at the end of the month, so www.FunnelHacking.com which is kind of cool. We got one other cool funnel thing happening that we just started putting together yesterday or the day before.</p> <p>I was thinking about in my own company, when I want to get crap done, what do we do? I call up Todd, Dillon, and whoever it is from all around the country. We all fly to Boise, sit in the office for three days, and we don\u2019t sleep. You guys know about this because if you listen to the podcast, you hear me most nights coming home at four in the morning talking about these things, our hackathons.</p> <p>It was called hackathons. I thought, \u201cWhat if we changed our coaching program around a little bit?\u201d You\u2019ll actually see some big shifts coming from our coaching program here. It\u2019s based off this idea of what if we gave people an experience where instead of us coaching for over a year -- which is good but you know, it\u2019s extended. It\u2019s long -- what if we gave people an emerging period where they come to Boise and we do hackathon with them and their business?</p> <p>In three days, or four days, whatever it ends up being, we do it all. I\u2019m really excited. We\u2019re going to do the first test run probably in June. We\u2019re going to bring eight people in. Basically what\u2019s going to happen is we\u2019re going to have for sure two and maybe three sales funnels we\u2019re going to build out.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to build out a webinar funnel where I\u2019m just actually going to write their whole webinar pitch just because people always screw it up it seems like. I\u2019ll write the webinar pitch. Then I\u2019ll actually pitch it so they can watch me pitch it and record that so they have that.</p> <p>Then they will have a chance to pitch it. I\u2019ll critique them and stuff like that. I\u2019ll build out the sales funnel. It\u2019s not like my team will. It will be me. I\u2019m just going to do it all because I\u2019m probably one of the faster guys on my team now doing it. I\u2019m pretty picky about it because I know what works.</p> <p>I\u2019ll just build out those funnels. We\u2019ll also build out their high ticket funnel. I\u2019ll have my video guy take them out, film all the emotional story based videos we need for the high ticket funnel. Then we will go and train their salespeople.</p> <p>They\u2019ll bring two salespeople with them. My sales guys will train their sales guys. Then work on Traffic Geyser, get that set up and running and working. When all is said and done, they will leave with at least two funnels and up running, trained salespeople, a webinar pitch, everything, and it\u2019s going to be called the hackathon, the funnel hackathon. I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see more about that over the next few months but it\u2019s in embryo right now which is kind of fun. It\u2019s being developed and designed. I\u2019m really excited for it. Hopefully some of you guys will want to come to that.</p> <p>We will get done in three days what it would take a typical person six months or more to get done. It will be fun. It\u2019s not like again you\u2019re hiring a copywriter or something. You\u2019re hiring me. I\u2019m doing all the work which will be really fun.</p> <p>I\u2019ll really enjoy it. Right now eight because we want to have small groups, eight people, eight webinar pitches in a three day period of time. It will be awesome. I\u2019m excited. If you guys want to come to that in the future -- actually, if you want to book it now, if you go to DotCom Secrets Ignite, go apply and my sales guys will call you.</p> <p>Just be like, \u201cHey, I want in on the hackathon,\u201d and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cHow do you know about the hackathon? We haven\u2019t even started selling that yet,\u201d and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cI know, I\u2019m in the Marketing in Your Car podcast. I listen and take action.\u201d We\u2019ll get you in.</p> <p>That\u2019s about it. What I want to talk you guys about today now that you got some cool updates, some cool stuff that\u2019s happening, I want to talk to you about one of the interesting conversations that we had today in the office.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because when you start as an entrepreneur in most business ventures, it\u2019s you, right. It\u2019s you juggling everything. You\u2019re wearing every single hat. When I got started, I was the product creator, the copywriter, the Web site designer, the support agent. I was doing all of the pieces.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t even know. I had to figure everything out because there was no one there to help me. I wasn\u2019t making any money so I couldn\u2019t hire people. That\u2019s how a lot of businesses start. Then as you start growing, obviously after awhile, you start handing things off to different people and hiring people or bringing in partners depending on the route you go.</p> <p>Then from that point, you spend the time just focusing more on what you\u2019re good at. Anyway, we\u2019ve had some interesting conversations with my partners at ClickFunnels today. We had a conversation just about that thing where each of us have our own superpower.</p> <p>I think everyone does. I think everyone on earth has their own superpower. I think God gives everyone a superpower, something that they\u2019re uniquely qualified to do. I tell my kids this all the time. \u201cWhat\u2019s your superpower?\u201d and they all know what their superpowers are.</p> <p>I think that each of us, especially in your company, everyone has their own superpower. A lot of times, when we start growing, we get people to do different pieces of it but still usually in a smaller company, everyone is wearing a lot of hats which is necessary for awhile but as you start growing a little bit, and without trying to hire a ton of people because that\u2019s not what we\u2019re trying to do but really getting the stars on your team to be able to focus on their superpower and get really good at it.</p> <p>You look at of all the tasks I do every single day, and there\u2019s like a thousand things I do everyday, there\u2019s one that makes the most money. It\u2019s when I\u2019m on a webinar pitching. When I\u2019m on a webinar, I\u2019ll make more money in 90 minutes than I do the rest of the month combined. How can I - what can we do so that I\u2019m always on a webinar?</p> <p>We\u2019re looking at both Todd and Dillon who are some of the most amazing developers I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. They\u2019re developing stuff and they\u2019re awesome at it but then half the time, they\u2019re sitting back where they have bug fixes and requests, all these things they have to do that aren\u2019t their superpowers.</p> <p>They have to do those though to keep things moving forward. The problem is that because of that, things can\u2019t move forward. It\u2019s one of those chicken and the egg scenarios, you know how it works. What we\u2019re trying to focus on doing is looking at what each one of our superpowers are and trying to barricade ourselves around so the only thing we\u2019re allowed to do, the only thing we\u2019re able to do is what our superpower is so we can move that thing forward because again, in 90 minutes, I can make more money than I could in six months doing all these other things.</p> <p>The same thing with Todd, Dillon, or with you, whatever your job is like you focus on your one superpower, you can make your company more money than doing all the rest of the stuff. How do you protect yourself and barricade yourself at a spot where you can just focus on that? What people do you need to add to your team that can take off those other pieces from you that are strangling you?</p> <p>You know, when we moved to the new office, so much stuff was happening, so many things were juggling. I was so overwhelmed with everything so I took Kelsey, who has been my assistant for four years now. She\u2019s been my assistant and support. She\u2019s done both roles.</p> <p>Because of that, when support goes up, I lose her. We broke her away where she does overflow support now but her main job is making sure that I can get my job done because the big thing is she can answer support, it takes all day but if she can facilitate me selling, we\u2019ll all make more money. It will facilitate me selling.</p> <p>We\u2019re trying to put this barricade around me, all these little things that are holding me back like getting my office clean and creating things right here, meetings, all the other things that I don\u2019t like doing and that are a struggle for me, she\u2019s trying to barricade those from me so that I can just - it was funny, Brent on our team was like, \u201cAll we want Russell to do is sit behind his computer on the microphone and just sell stuff. If he can do that all day long, everything else will take care of itself.\u201d</p> <p>Just my thought today as I\u2019ve been thinking about this from conversations we\u2019ve been having for me is just how can I barricade myself as much as possible so that I\u2019m only focusing on my superpowers? The other stars on my team, how can I barricade them so they\u2019re only focusing on their superpowers?</p> <p>If we get everyone doing their superpowers and obviously with any kind of company, there\u2019s always, you have to wear a lot of hats but if we can shift it where instead of spending 80% of our time wearing a bunch of hats and 20% of our time doing our superpower, if we shift it to 80% superpower, 20% the other stuff, or if you can get to the point where you\u2019re doing 90% or 100% superpower, how much more of a dramatic impact and a change can you make within your company to your team, to your customers, to the world?</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of my thought. That\u2019s my focus. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking at is what can I do to become better at that and really be able to get myself and my team focusing on that. Anyway, I hope that helps for you. I know all of you guys are doing different things and at different points and different spots in your business but it\u2019s just a smart thing to start thinking about.</p> <p>I remember the first time I understood this concept was when I read the book The E-Myth by Michael Gerber. It\u2019s so funny, I was at an event with all these people. This was 10 or 11 years ago. All these people were talking about it.</p> <p>I thought The E-Myth was an entrepreneur book or an Internet marketing myth, like email, e-myth. I was going on a family trip down to Lake Powell, Utah which is like a 10 hour drive from here. On the way out of town, we swung by Barnes &amp; Noble and Collette\u2019s like, \u201cGet a book,\u201d so I got The E-Myth because I\u2019m like, \u201cPeople talk about this. It looks awesome.\u201d I started driving. We get all the way down to Lake Powell. We get in this boat out in the middle of the lake.</p> <p>We sit there. I pull out my book to read. Within five minutes, I realized this has nothing to do with Internet marketing. I was like, \u201cOh, dang it. I thought this was an Internet marketing book I was trying to read. Now I\u2019m stuck on a lake and this is all I have.\u201d I read it.</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful I did because it talked about the systemization of businesses and how to pull yourself out of them, and a bunch of really cool stuff. If you haven\u2019t read that, go read it. If you have read it, now is the time to start applying it more so in your life.</p> <p>I\u2019ve done it to a good point but I haven\u2019t been religious about making barriers around my time, not just making barriers to make barriers though because you don\u2019t want the rest of your company to fall apart but making a barrier by replacing that piece and putting the right person in place so that the ball doesn\u2019t get dropped.</p> <p>I\u2019d rather have other people in my team wearing multiple hats than myself. That\u2019s really the goal. Anyway, I hope that helps. I hope you guys are doing awesome. I\u2019m almost home so I\u2019m going to end today. I appreciate you guys listening in.</p> <p>Again, go check out FunnelHacker.tv. It\u2019s www.FunnelHacker.tv. Oh, and the other cool thing is that we are now giving away free Funnel Hacker t-shirts.

In the back of my car, I\u2019ve got a bunch of my computer monitors and stuff. And I\u2019m actually moving across town to a brand new office and it\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>We have the movers actually coming tomorrow to do all the heavy lifting of desks and all that crap that I don\u2019t want to do but I got my own computer and monitors because I don\u2019t want them to screw that up, so heading over there right now, and I\u2019m driving and just reminiscing on some stuff.</p> <p>And I wanted to share because I thought, hey, you guys like hearing all the random thoughts that come out of Russell\u2019s head, right? So I apologize but that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do because I think I got something that could benefit some of you guys.</p> <p>I was just talking to Brent on my team as we\u2019re packing up the cars and kind of walking. We actually moved into this building about four years ago now which is crazy. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s that far away. When we left to come to this office, it was under completely different circumstances.</p> <p>At the time, a year prior, I had about 100 employees, we were doing about a million dollar a month. Everything was cranking. We were having some fun. Looking back now, we weren\u2019t very profitable with that big of a staff but we were making money and serving people, and all that kind of thing.</p> <p>One day -- it was in January -- all of our merchant accounts got frozen, got shut down and just gone. It\u2019s kind of a long, the next 12 months of my life was by far some of the hardest of my life. I had to watch as my friends and family members walked away from me, watched as my business I had built kind of disappeared.</p> <p>I watched as bill collectors and angry people - all this stuff just happened. It was crazy. I thought I was going to have to go bankrupt but luckily I didn\u2019t which was kind of a whole story for another day. But after a year of trying to keep everything open and keep things sustained, one day, I just came to the realization that I couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>We got hit with on top of all the debt and all the other issues that had come because of not having merchant accounts, and not having the ability to process money and still having payroll, staff, coaching clients, and all this craziness, on top of it, we got hit with an IRS bill of crazy money, like $150,000, $200,000, something just ridiculous. And all these things were collapsing around beside me.</p> <p>I remember just being in a state of fear, panic, nervousness, and just hopelessness to be honest. I was sitting in my home. I knew that we had to leave out of the office we were in. We had a huge office, over 20,000 square feet. It was amazing.</p> <p>It overlooked all of Boise. It was the coolest office in Boise by far. I knew I had to leave. I knew that if I left, they were probably going to sue me because we still had time left on our lease and contract but we had to. We couldn\u2019t cover the monthly payments anymore, and all these.</p> <p>I\u2019m painting not even a very deep picture of where it was at, but it was crazy. I was sitting there one night on my little iPad trying to find an office we could move into. It was just crazy. I found this little office space that was four minutes from my home.</p> <p>It was one or two in the morning I found it. I got out of bed, jumped to my car, and I drove to it. It was less than five minutes from my house. I looked through the windows, and I was like, \u201cThis is it. This is the office we have to rebuild and get back to basics.\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, I called the people up. We were able to rent it. It was about one tenth the size of our old office. At that time, we had gone from 100 employees down to about 20. We had to jam 20 employees in this little tiny space. We had to rebuild and figure things out.</p> <p>Over the next year or so, I had to fire employee after employee. We got smaller and smaller to the point we ended up with about seven people at one time. And I said, \u201cYou know, these are seven people I have to have to run my business. Everyone else was nice to have. These are the got to haves. I can\u2019t go any lower than this.\u201d</p> <p>I also made a rule at the time. I will not ever hire again. That was kind of my thing. For the last four years, we\u2019ve been in that building and for the first year or two was trying to rediscover who we are and what we were doing. Then I went to this phase of wanting to be in every business possible.</p> <p>We launched like 15 different companies in every niche you could dream of and did a lot of stuff, had some successes, nothing that was really huge. Then two years ago or so is when we launched our supplement which became very successful as a lot of you guys know. We became insane about split testing.</p> <p>Then we came out with our split testing book which helped. We relaunched our coaching program which has been amazing. We launched ClickFunnels last year which is growing like nothing ever, better than anything I ever dreamed of.</p> <p>Today as we\u2019re moving, I just had this nostalgic feeling of four years ago when we were moving into this building. At that time, I was so nervous and scared, fearful and hopeless, and just afraid of what my future was going to look like. Now four years later as we\u2019re moving out and we\u2019re moving to a new office, just the different perspective, how excited I am about life and about business, and about who we\u2019re serving, and about the future.</p> <p>It just was so interesting to me because of today. I had this emotional thing. I just wanted to share it with you guys. I think the main reason why I wanted to share it is because I know that all of you guys are in different spots in your business. Some of you guys are in the spot where I\u2019m at right now where things are going amazing and you feel hopeful, excited, and this desire to serve people, and try to change the world.</p> <p>But some of you guys I know are on the opposite side where I was at, where you\u2019re falling down a black hole and you don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to get out, where you\u2019re going to go, and you\u2019re scared, hopeless, and you just have so much fear. I remember waking up some days and being so scared to go in the office because I didn\u2019t know what to do and how to motivate people.</p> <p>What pep talk was I going to give my team this time to try to convince them that we were going to be okay? How many times I would have to do that, over and over again. It was crazy hard. I hope that if you are on that backslide and you\u2019re in the spot with your business or your life, it\u2019s tough. You\u2019re struggling.</p> <p>You can\u2019t see the future and the future makes you scared. I just want to share this message with you to hopefully give you some hope. You know, they always say that the night is darkest right before the dawn. It\u2019s true. There were times where I couldn\u2019t even tell you, it felt like I was in the pit of despair.</p> <p>Now, such a short period of time later, I just feel so much hope, excitement, and passion. Again, if you are in that spot now, I just want to let you know that you\u2019re not far. Keep trekking through it. Don\u2019t give up. Keep moving forward because the light is on the other side.</p> <p>When you get back to that spot, it\u2019s amazing and it makes it all worth it. I look back at those things now that we had to go through, and it sucked. It was painful, it was embarrassing, it was hard but if it wasn\u2019t for those things, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to create and do what we did that got us to the spot we\u2019re at right now.</p> <p>I\u2019m so grateful for those things. I always look back at the day when we lost our merchant accounts as the worst day in my life but I also look at it as the best day of my life because it is what caused us to change, and it was a necessary change. For me, it helped me to find out who my true friends were, who were people I could count on, who were people I could trust, who were people that cared about me and not about the paycheck they were getting which was important, and it also gave us the ability to think clearer.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard. First of all, I didn\u2019t feel like I was thinking clear but at some point, you got to step back. For us, we had to cut all ties of everything and say, \u201cLook, none of this stuff is working. We got to figure out something else. What is it?\u201d and give us the ability to reset and start over.</p> <p>I remember about that time, in the middle of this whole thing, Tony Robbins had put out a video about New Year\u2019s time. In the video, he got up there and said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s the new year.\u201d It was him and his wife Sage.</p> <p>He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a new year. We can change any time of the year that we want but the new year always gives us a new outlook and the ability to think and to do things like that.\u201d He says, \u201cYou know, I basically want to give you guys permission to change.\u201d He said, \u201cIf you\u2019re in a relationship you don\u2019t like, change it. If you\u2019re in a business you don\u2019t like, change it. If you\u2019re struggling with whatever, not happy with your physical appearance, change it.\u201d</p> <p>I remember sitting there thinking, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s right. I can just change it. I\u2019m so stuck on what we were doing, the model tied to this thing that I didn\u2019t think about the fact that I could just change it.\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s so cool about what we do.</p> <p>I\u2019m guessing that if you\u2019re listening to this, you\u2019re an entrepreneur. You create your own destiny. If that\u2019s you, then understand that you are an entrepreneur. You create your own destiny. You can create, build, become, and be whoever you want.</p> <p>Use this as an opportunity first off to hopefully give you a glimmer of hope, and second off, give you the ability to sit back and look at what\u2019s happening around you. If you need to and you want to, then just make those changes.</p> <p>I\u2019ll give you permission. Just like Tony gave me permission, I\u2019m going to give you permission. I promise you guys that the light is there. It\u2019s not far off. You got to stay the course, keep on working. Work through it and focus on serving other people.</p> <p>If you do that, you\u2019ll get to where you need to be. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s a wrap for today. I hope that it will help some of you guys. I\u2019m excited to be in the new office. My future podcasts will be coming from the new office which is exciting.</p> <p>We\u2019re about to launch the new FunnelHacker podcast which is cool. I got the first episodes in the can. I think we\u2019re going to be launching that probably early next week is the goal. So you guys will see that as well coming out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see videos and stuff from the new office and everything as well.</p> <p>It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s fun. I appreciate you guys listening to my random thoughts for the day. I hope that it\u2019s been a value to you. I appreciate you guys as listeners and subscribers. I hope you got the Dot Com Secrets book. I\u2019m excited for you guys to get it. I\u2019m excited to share that with you guys as well.</p> <p>That\u2019s it. I will talk to you guys soon. I\u2019ll see you in the new office.</p>", "duration": "11:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_119.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1428681629, "title": "Episode #118 \u2013 Late-Night ClickFunnels Hack-A-Thon", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Want to know some of the secret ninja stuff happening inside of ClickFunnels?\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks some cool stuff that is happening at the hack-a-thon, including some awesome stuff that is coming up in Clickfunnels.</p> <p>Here are some fun things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell realized after many days in a row of wanting to a Marketing In Your Car podcast at 3am, that he is a workaholic.</li> <li>How you can now do emails in Clickfunnels and why that is so cool.</li> <li>And some other amazing updates coming up in Clickfunnels.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to get excited about the awesome upgrades rolling out on Clickfunnels soon.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>So excited for today. It\u2019s funny, there\u2019s a couple of times I wanted to send you guys messages this week, but to be honest I did a Google Hangout with Todd Brown, the other day. And he followed my Marketing In Your Car at like 3 in the morning when I was driving home from the office. And every night this week I\u2019ve been driving home about 3 in the morning.</p> <p>I keep wanting to do them, I\u2019m like, no, I\u2019ve got to do it at normal times, so Todd doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m, like, a workaholic. But, alas, turns out I\u2019m a workaholic, and it\u2019s 10:00 at night, I\u2019m heading back in to the office for another one. I think this is the fourth night in a row, but it\u2019s kind of all blurring together. But no, it\u2019s fun. Amazing stuff is happening. We have our whole Ted, Deb, team, and all my partners for ClickFunnels flew in to town.</p> <p>And we\u2019re, they\u2019re here for, I think, ten days or so. And we\u2019re doing some amazing, amazing, amazing things. And so, because of that we had to put sleep on the back burner for two weeks, then we\u2019re going to crash and just be done. But it\u2019s just, it\u2019s been amazing. Like we listed out on the whiteboard, like, things we wanted to implement. Some new features, new things, bugs we needed to kill.</p> <p>And just a bunch of stuff like that. And I\u2019ve been watching these guys, and again, I don\u2019t have any skills, so I can\u2019t do much of it. I\u2019ve been watching these guys and they\u2019ve been going through and just, like, crazy things that are amazing. And in fact, it\u2019s 10:00 at night, I\u2019m so tired right now but I\u2019m going back in the office because there\u2019s so much energy and synergy, and things happening, and I want to be a part of it.</p> <p>I want to, just so exciting. And so, and I don\u2019t do, not that I do nothing. I play my part, but yeah, as far as the technical stuff, they build it on. It\u2019s amazing what they\u2019re doing. So, a couple of just sneak peeks for you guys, you know what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s amazing. So the first thing we finished off with the affiliate platform. Some of you guys know that one of the things that everyone is asking for and that I personally wanted for a long time, was to be able to run affiliate programs through ClickFunnels.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t really have an option, we had to use a third party system like LeadDyno or things like that. Which are just, they\u2019re annoying to, you know, it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s another plug-in, and it just doesn\u2019t really work that great. And so finally we decided best, let\u2019s go and conquer that. So, we build it out initially before the actual book launch, and we\u2019ve been beta testing it to the book launchers, it\u2019s been working flawlessly, which has been great news.</p> <p>I was a little bit nervous, to be honest, but it\u2019s been working flawlessly, and then what\u2019s cool about it is \u2013 sorry, I\u2019m filling my gas so all the people around me are looking at me like I\u2019m crazy. You guys know I\u2019m not crazy, right? Anyway, so, yes, because the use of affiliates for the book launch has been working awesome. So first thing when they got here is they worked on finalizing \u2014 I picked the wrong gas. Okay.</p> <p>So we\u2019re talking finalizing the affiliate system and getting all the UI working and everything, it looks awesome. So we\u2019re going to get some beta testers over the next week or two, to start testing it out and see if they can get it to work flawlessly as well. And as we do that, then we\u2019re going to open that up, hopefully soon, to ClickFunnel\u2019s members, which is going to be amazing.</p> <p>So you can run it on affiliate programs, and it\u2019s pretty slick. So, that\u2019s one of the big ones. That was the first day, we got that all finalized and done. Then we started focusing on what I think was, like, the last missing piece that makes ClickFunnels ClickFunnels. And it was the, you know, engine. The, you know, sequencing. Because you know, if you\u2019ve been using it, there\u2019s a really cool ability where someone joins the list you can have it send out.</p> <p>You know, these email sequences and just basic segmenting, so, like, auto-webinars like that, they show up at the webinar, they send out this email sequence. They don\u2019t, send out this one. And, you know, if they opt in here then they buy, and you can move them to a different list. You can do some basic stuff but that\u2019s kind of all it was. And then we had this thought about a week ago, before they came out, so, like, what if we did a couple of things?</p> <p>What if we could create a way where you could edit your emails inside of the ClickFunnel\u2019s editor? And that was the first thing, of a thousand possible. In fact, last night, about 2 in the morning, we may have figured out how to make that possible, and we were all going crazy because it was possible. And as a matter of fact, I just got an email about ten minutes from them.</p> <p>The email was created in the editor and it\u2019s the most amazing looking email I\u2019ve ever seen, in my 12 years of doing this. Just amazing. So now you have the ability to edit your emails in the email editor, which is amazing. And now, and the next thing to build out is you can do broadcasts, instead of lists. And things like that, which is, like, the last missing piece.</p> <p>And I can\u2019t tell you guys how cool it is. If you\u2019ve read the Dot Com Secrets book, you know what I\u2019ve been teaching about forever. I always talk about the best way that I think you can do sequencing is someone joins your list, you send out a soap opera sequence. And what\u2019s cool is now you can do that in ClickFunnels. When someone opts in the funnel, you can build out a whole sequence there, in the funnel.</p> <p>So the initial soap opera sequence goes out over 7, or 10, or 20, or how many days you want to do that. And you can do some basic segmenting. So they buy a product, you can take them off, you can move them, things like that. But what\u2019s cool is that at the end of the segment, or the middle, or wherever you want, you can either copy or delete them, or move them to another list.</p> <p>And so the next thing I always teach people is that after someone goes through your soap opera sequence, you transition them to your broadcast, like your David Seinfeld emails. And so, but most people it\u2019s like, I can never do that because they\u2019re no auto-responder software that really does that. Where now in ClickFunnels you can. It\u2019s amazing. So as soon as I\u2019m finished with a sequence, you move them so now they\u2019re on your broadcast list, and they get broadcast.</p> <p>And you can set it where as soon as they, if you want, as soon as they join a new funnels list, you can pause it. It will pause the broadcast emails as you\u2019re sending things out. And then when they get to the end of it, then boom, they\u2019re just back on the broadcast for them. So they\u2019re getting just your soap operas for that funnel and then pause it for the broadcast, or vice versa. There\u2019s a million different things you can do but that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to use it.</p> <p>That\u2019s so exciting, and just the beginning, like this, that part of the market automation will get better and better. It\u2019s kind of the first phase of it. And it\u2019s just amazing. You can set up sequences where they, so they hit this page, now cue up this, you know, email series to go out. They hit this page, or if they go here, you now have different sequences and different things, and it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>Like I said, this is the first big piece in our marketing automation suite. In the near future it will be even smarter where someone joins your list, it will go out there, it will lead score, it will figure out, you know, how many subscribers they have, how much money they make, what neighborhood they live in, whatever it is. All the demographics, cycle graphics, social graphics, all those kinds of things, they\u2019ll pool back in there.</p> <p>And from that, you can customize your funnels. So you can say, hey, somebody joins my list and they have over 100,000 fans on Twitter and make at least X amount of dollars a year, she\u2019ll miss up so, but if not, she\u2019ll miss up so. So that way, people make over $100,000 a year, so you\u2019re a high ticket upsell where people that don\u2019t only see your, you know, your cheaper upsell or whatever it might be.</p> <p>I mean, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s amazing. And the best thing is I have different email sequence based on it, and it\u2019s just awesome. So, anyway, but the first step email broadcast part should be done tonight. That was the message I got back from [Inaudible 07:03] tonight, is that all the email stuff is done, so that\u2019s close. I\u2019m going to be beta testing, you guys will see me doing it, and it\u2019s going to blow your mind, so that\u2019s coming. Some other cool things that are coming.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got the funnel marketplace. I think there will be people, probably people from the sound of my voice, who will make millions of dollars creating templates in ClickFunnels, and selling them through our marketplace. Literally, you can go create templates for realtors, or for info product people, or [Inaudible 07:29]. Whatever you build, that entire template, put it in the marketplace and boom, people can start buying it and you get paid every time someone buys your templates.</p> <p>Which is going to be amazing. There\u2019s so many cool things happening, you guys, I wish I could share and show all of them to you, but you will start seeing them. Start seeing them really, really soon. We\u2019re excited. We\u2019re aggressively growing, we finally got in some amazing, an amazing new developer help clear up some of the legacy of little issues that have been [Inaudible 07:56], bugging some of our members. And those should mostly be done, hopefully within the end of the month.</p> <p>And then from that point forward we\u2019re going to be aggressively rolling out the new feature sets, so we can compete with the core systems out there. We can compete with InfusionSoft, we can compete with Ontraport. We can compete with, you know, whoever else is out there in our way. And after these last two integrations done, the fill in email, my business will be 100% in ClickFunnels. I won\u2019t need any other external party, service, to do anything.</p> <p>And that\u2019s amazing. So, I\u2019m excited, you guys. You know, this podcast is not about teaching you guys anything tonight, or sharing anything outside, just my excitement. It\u2019s some cool new things. Stuff that I wish I could share with the world, but the world is not ready yet. So, because you guys are here, because you\u2019re my faithful Marketing In Your Car listeners, you guys get a chance to hear about the new stuff that\u2019s happening and I hope that gets you excited as well.</p> <p>So, the other thing, [Inaudible 08:47]. So much cool stuff I want to share with you guys. The new funnel hacking podcast, your funnel hacker podcast, I recorded the first video earlier this week and it\u2019s awesome. So we\u2019re going to be launching that, probably by the end of the week. It might be early next week, though. I have, we have a new on-boarding process in ClickFunnels that has to be done, where we\u2019re giving away these funnel hacker t-shirts.</p> <p>So I had to get that part of it done, first, before I can launch that. Because they\u2019re kind of tied together. So, working on that, trying to get that done this weekend. So that will be live, and it\u2019s going to be amazing, like, the first steps there, you guys, I drop bombs. I give away hundreds of thousands of dollars of free stuff. And every single week is going to be the same thing. I think it\u2019s going to \u2014 I\u2019m proud of it. It\u2019s going to be amazing. So, there\u2019s that.</p> <p>And then, what else? What else is cool? Funnel hacking event, I hope you guys are coming to that. We have a bunch of our ClickFunnels members who are going to be showing off their funnels. I just finalized a schedule for that, it\u2019s going to be amazing. So if you don\u2019t have your tickets yet for that, please come to funnelhacking.com. It\u2019s in Vegas, at the end of May. It\u2019s basically me, on stage, for three days, teaching the back ends of all our funnels, how we do everything.</p> <p>The strategies, psychology, I\u2019ll be opening my pages then, we have ClickFunnels members who are making millions of dollars using those types of funnels. We\u2019re going to get them to kind of show off their funnels and let you guys see behind the scenes of their businesses, and it\u2019s going to be so cool. So I\u2019m excited. If you guys like money, and you like cool stuff, you need to be there.</p> <p>So, anyway, I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go have some fun for a couple of hours. I\u2019m probably going to crash a little bit earlier tonight, because we\u2019ve got a long weekend coming up and I want to be prepared for it. So I appreciate you guys. Have an awesome night, and we will talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "11:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_118.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1427816380, "title": "Episode #117 \u2013 Marketing In Your Car Two Year Birthday", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A quick update from the book launch, and our two year celebration.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about losing power at his house and in his whole neighborhood. He also talks about how his product launch has been going and what the next steps will be.</p> <p>Here are some other super cool things you\u2019ll hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>It\u2019s Marketing In Your Car podcast\u2019s birthday and to celebrate Russell announces the launch of a new podcast called Funnel Hacker TV.</li> <li>Find out some of the cool stuff that you would see on Funnel Hacker TV.</li> <li>And hear Russell\u2019s goal of copies sold of his new book.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear about all the cool stuff that Russell has going on.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone! This is Russell, and welcome to Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>All right, so today we were getting ready, and I was actually juicing with Aiden, and we started juicing and all of a sudden VROOM! The whole power in the whole house goes out, and I was like, \u201cOh, crap! Did we hit a fuse?\u201d</p> <p>Turns out, the power went out all around my whole neighborhood. Everyone\u2019s power\u2019s out, the school\u2019s power is out, and anyway the kids are having so much fun and going crazy because of the huge power outage.</p> <p>And it\u2019s funny, like, you know, obviously we know we use power for a lot of things. But it\u2019s funny how much stuff you use power for when you have no power. Like, literally it was just so funny, like trying to do everything, like every little thing you do, like:</p> <p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t do that. Oh, I can\u2019t do that. Oh, I can do that.\u201d Internet doesn\u2019t work, security alarm doesn\u2019t work, the garage door opener doesn\u2019t work, like every single thing.</p> <p>But luckily I was able to get out the door. Oh man, and I am just hitting the main street, and there are cars lined up all the way out, which means that I\u2019m guessing the power lines\u2026 Oh, yep, power [laughter].</p> <p>The power lines are out, too. This is great. I love this kind of thing. Anyway, so that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in my morning so far, which is kind of cool. Hope you guys are having an awesome day.</p> <p>I wanted to talk about the product launch. People keep asking me and, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Last I heard, Russell, in the podcast, this was what was going to be happening, and then we haven\u2019t heard back from you.\u201d</p> <p>So yeah, sorry I haven\u2019t messaged you back. It\u2019s been kind of a crazy life, but things are going awesome. We launched the book last Tuesday, so we can go today, at the time I\u2019m recording this, and in that time we\u2019ve given over -- we\u2019ve sold 8,000 books.</p> <p>A little more than that, but a little over 8,000 books now, which is awesome, and our upsell-downsell sequence is working magically. We\u2019re averaging\u2026 I think we\u2019re averaging collectively about $32 for every book we give away, which is great from the upsell-downsell sequence.</p> <p>We\u2019re really happy with that, and now we\u2019re starting into phase number two. Which is where we\u2019re getting people from the book sequence into the invisible funnel sequence, which is the second step in our funnel stacking process.</p> <p>The third step then will be the webinar, the Funnel Hacks webinar, and the fourth step will then be the coaching. So it\u2019s kind of cool to see how the numbers all shake out after all four steps of the sequence, but so far, so good.</p> <p>Okay, so I\u2019m at the intersection now. There are cops everywhere. [Laughter] There are cops -- oh, that guy, some dude got in a huge wreck. So there\u2019s a guy in a huge wreck, then you got cops out in the middle, like flag people letting one car go at a time type thing.</p> <p>So anyway, this is exciting! This is like what the end of the world\u2019s going to be like, I bet. The power will be out. It\u2019ll be chaos, cars slamming into each other. It\u2019s going to be awesome.</p> <p>Makes me wish I was in the prepper market right now. If I was in the prepper market, I\u2019d have my\u2026 I\u2019d be going crazy with my free offers. [Laughter] Anyway, it\u2019s kind of fun.</p> <p>So today, what should we talk about today? There are so many fun things happening right now that I could share with you guys. One cool thing that I think would be kind of fun to let you guys in on is, I\u2019m going to be launching a new podcast, which is cool.</p> <p>This has been my staple podcast. In fact, my brother told me last week or earlier this week that we just passed the two-year episode from the first Marketing In Your Car upload -- the first download, first person downloaded it.</p> <p>So it\u2019s been two years that Marketing In Your Car has been live, so it\u2019s technically our birthday today.</p> <p>So for our Marketing In Your Car birthday, if you want to give us a present, go post on Facebook if you think Marketing In Your Car is cool. That\u2019ll be a great Facebook present, but I\u2019m about to launch a new podcast, and I\u2019m really excited for it.</p> <p>It\u2019s been called the Funnel Hacker. It\u2019ll be at FunnelHacker.tv. It\u2019s not live yet, but it will be, hopefully, within a week from now. And what we\u2019re going to do in this podcast is, each week we\u2019re going to go and funnel hack somebody\u2019s funnel.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to be cool, and so I\u2019m going to bring a guest on, and I\u2019m going to show them the, you know, show the four or five, however many different pages in their funnel, and we\u2019ll show each of those pages.</p> <p>And the person, the guest will talk about each page, what they did, why they did it, the psychology behind it, all that kind of stuff, which will be cool, and then it\u2019ll be kind of awesome. So that\u2019s going to be kind of the process.</p> <p>Oh, I\u2019m also going to talk about the email sequencing, and also where they\u2019re generating their traffic and their leads from. So it\u2019ll be fun, every single time absolutely going to be a new funnel.</p> <p>So one week will be a high ticket funnel, one time it\u2019ll be a tripwire funnel, one time it\u2019ll be a membership continuity funnel, and just different things all the time, and I think it\u2019ll be fun for everyone to kind of see behind the scenes.</p> <p>And then I had this really cool idea, where when after somebody watches a funnel\u2026 so you go and you watch, let\u2019s say, someone\u2019s cool high ticket funnel, and after it\u2019s done I always think, like, how do you monetize these podcasts, right?</p> <p>I have a friend, John Lee Dumas, who\u2026 he is Entrepreneur On Fire and he tells me he charges like, it\u2019s crazy, like $3500 an episode for earned advertising fees.</p> <p>[Coughs] Excuse me. Sorry that my cough\u2019s coming in. So what was cool about it is that, with that is he does a podcast every day of the week.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably something like three or four a day if I was making that much off each one. So that\u2019s how easy it is with advertisers, but, you know, I\u2019m not big on like going out and getting advertisers and all that jazz.</p> <p>I would be if I had his following. I definitely would be, actually, but since I don\u2019t, I just do kind of my own thing, and so what I\u2019m looking to do is like, how do you monetize this?</p> <p>And so I thought, how cool would it be if we show -- we funnel hack someone\u2019s funnel, we show off the whole thing, and then at the end of it I say, \u201cHey, who here would love this funnel?</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I just rebuilt it in ClickFunnels, and there I have a \u2018Share Funnel\u2019 link. You click on that and it\u2019ll pull this, his entire funnel inside your account, and then you can go edit it, and mock it up, and make it look wicked awesome.</p> <p>\u201cBut all you got to do is you got to be a member of our membership site, the Funnel Hacker Pro community,\u201d or whatever it is, and then so get people to upgrade to our continuity membership site, where each time I show off a funnel, they get the Share Funnel link.</p> <p>And that way, they can go and take the funnel they just learned about, and clone it and do it in their business, so kind of fun. I\u2019m excited for it. It\u2019s going to be super-awesome. So that is the game plan with FunnelHacker.tv, which should be coming out here in the next week. It\u2019s going to be awesome.</p> <p>So anyway, that\u2019s kind of the main stuff I want to talk to you guys about is give you an update on the book launch. We\u2019re selling books like crazy. Phase one is almost complete. We\u2019re, again, a week in, 8,000 copies.</p> <p>The goal: I\u2019ve got to hit 11,000 copies. That\u2019s where we\u2019re -- that\u2019s kind of our big number that we\u2019re shooting for. So I think we should be able to get that pretty easily, since it\u2019s a four-week launch, and we\u2019re in week one, and we\u2019re almost already there so it\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>My overall goal, I think, is sell 20,000 books. I\u2019d be really excited with 20,000 books, so that\u2019s kind of -- that\u2019s the magic number that I\u2019m shooting for, and we\u2019re going to be pushing hard.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got a whole bunch of people competing for the Ferrari to try to win it, and it\u2019s been really cool, so anyway that\u2019s kind of our game plan.</p> <p>But anyway, I\u2019ll keep you guys in the loop as things keep progressing. I\u2019ll talk to you guys about phase two in the funnel stacking process, phase three and phase four as they are implemented, but it\u2019s all good.</p> <p>It\u2019s really fun and I\u2019m excited for today to go and get some of this stuff implemented, and see what\u2019s going to happen when we unlock phase number two of the product launch!</p> <p>So I appreciate you guys listening. Hope you enjoy this, and again, for the Marketing In Your Car birthday party, if you want, please go share us on Facebook. That would mean the world to me, and we\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "08:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_117.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1427222382, "title": "Episode #116 \u2013 Watch The Process\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A secret million dollar education only for Marketing In Your Car listeners.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about his upcoming book launch and what will be included when it comes to marketing his new book.</p> <p>Here are some fun things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Some of the things Russell worked on until 3am to prepare for the launch.</li> <li>What makes this book so exciting and why you\u2019ll want to get your hands on it.</li> <li>And how watching the process of launching this book could be a free education for you and you should pay attention.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to get excited about Russell\u2019s new book.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Well, well, well\u2026 it\u2019s three in the morning and you\u2019re hanging out with me doing Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey, everyone! Yes, yes, yes\u2026 it is three in the morning, and it\u2019s raining outside, and I\u2019m driving home, and I\u2019m freezing cold! You may be wondering, Russell, why you up at three in the morning?</p> <p>And the reason is because tomorrow is a very exciting day. It\u2019s a day that I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a year, and it\u2019s all coming down to right now, and so when everything\u2019s about to happen, you don\u2019t sleep, right?</p> <p>Sleep is for people who are broke! I heard that in some video one time. Anyway, so three a.m. I\u2019m just leaving the office right now. The book launch is about to start in about 13 hours from now. No 12 hours, 11\u2026 11 hours from now, 11 hours from now we are going to be live, and you\u2019d think\u2026</p> <p>I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time, like 12\u2026 12-plus years, and you\u2019d think that I would just be calm and like, oh, it\u2019s going to be really, really good. But I\u2019m freakin\u2019 out, like what if\u2026 what if nobody wants to promote it?</p> <p>What if Facebook shuts my ad account down? What if my email list doesn\u2019t go though, and I get hit on UR or IBL list again? What if\u2026 like there\u2019s so many what if\u2019s that could happen!</p> <p>What if\u2026 I\u2019m giving away in this contest, and nobody even promotes? What if\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what else. There\u2019s so many, there\u2019s so many what if\u2019s, and it\u2019s funny because people are always like, \u201cOh, you know, shouldn\u2019t be nervous.\u201d</p> <p>This is whatever, but I am. Like it still gets me nervous every single time. We don\u2019t do product launches very often anymore, and this is part of the reason why. I hated the stress behind them.</p> <p>It\u2019s nice having a business that makes, you know, a million bucks a month without having to do product launches, but we\u2019re doing one because I felt like this deserved one. It\u2019s my first book, and I don\u2019t know about you, but if you\u2019ve ever written a book, it\u2019s like giving birth to a baby.</p> <p>Like how much work goes into it, and now that it\u2019s done, I just want people to know about it and hear about it, and so as you know, probably, I\u2019m giving away my Ferrari to whoever can help me \u201csell\u201d the most books.</p> <p>I say sell in parenthesis because it\u2019s free, plus shipping offer, and I did a webinar or a podcast a couple, I think last week, about some of the strategies behind what we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>We\u2019re doing a concept called Funnel Stacking. I invented a new concept called an Offer Wall and a whole bunch of cool stuff coming. Like if you guys want to funnel hack some cool stuff, you need to be watching what\u2019s happening, so I\u2019ll walk you through the process.</p> <p>I kind of talked about it the other day, but now that it\u2019s done and all the pages are in place, now I know it with extreme clarity -- so it\u2019s kind of fun.</p> <p>So it begins with my free plus shipping book, and\u2026 oh, I\u2019m so proud! Like the video turned out amazing on the sales page. We got really powerful testimonial videos. Well, I could just\u2026 it turned out really cool, so I hope people love it.</p> <p>They get the book, and I decided to put in a three-day workshop that I did with my $10,000 a month clients, or $10,000 a year clients. I almost didn\u2019t put it in, but it\u2019s like you know what?</p> <p>I just freakin\u2019 want to blow people\u2019s minds. I want to over-deliver times a thousand, and so they get the free book. They also get, it\u2019s like 10 or 12 hours worth of me teaching all the stuff inside the book at a live event, and it\u2019s really good.</p> <p>Like I honestly could sell that for $1,000 or more by itself, and I\u2019m just giving it away. So, hopefully, that\u2019ll inspire people to come and hang out in my life events more, right? [Laughter] If nothing else!</p> <p>So that\u2019s the offer. They\u2019re paying $7.95 shipping and handling. It\u2019s insane! So that\u2019s what it starts off with, and there\u2019s an order form bump for $37 bucks: You can get the audio book version as well as a lost chapter, called \u201cThe Dream 100,\u201d that I created.</p> <p>You can get that for an extra $37 bucks, which I think everyone will take that, right? For me, I would take the audio book version, without even thinking twice, like this audio book version.</p> <p>And by the way, I don\u2019t know if I\u2026 I might have podcast about this. The whole week is kind of a blur. But I went and found some guy someplace who had a recording studio and recorded the entire book last week.</p> <p>Nine hours recording it, and the guy\u2019s been editing ever since, and it\u2019s 3:00 in the morning, he\u2019s just eaten and he\u2019s still not done editing it. So I told him, I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, this book goes live tomorrow. I have to have the audio book version back.\u201d</p> <p>So I don\u2019t even really know this guy and he\u2019s pulling an all-nighter tonight. Ah! It\u2019s just awesome! Awesome, awesome guy to get the audio book version done in time! Which is cool, so that\u2019s the thing.</p> <p>Then my first upsell is my Instant Traffic Systems\u2026 Ah! I created a super cool page in Click Funnels, I\u2019m really proud of for my upsell page.</p> <p>Like it\u2019s the coolest upsell page I\u2019ve ever seen, so I\u2019m really proud of that. Re-did the video, and selling my $197 Instant Traffic Hacks, which is really cool, and the second upsell is my Perfect Webinar System, which is a newer product we just put together.</p> <p>Perfect Webinar Secrets, it\u2019s a $297 product, and that\u2019s going to be the second upsell, and then that\u2019s kind of it. At that point, they land on the order confirmation page, and on the order confirmation page we had a bunch of things.</p> <p>First off, I\u2019ve had people come to an invisible funnel style training, which is called the DotComSecretsBlueprint Workshop, where they come in to put their credit down, and they actually go through a live experience with someone on my team, and at the end of it, if they like it they pay $197, and if not they don\u2019t have to pay anything.</p> <p>On that Thank You page, the confirmation page, which I\u2019m calling an Offer Wall, then we also, I give them three other free plus shipping offers. One is for my DotComSecretsLabs monthly, which is my new $50 a month newletter.</p> <p>They get a $500 marketing gift for free, if they sign up for that, so that\u2019s kind of a cool funnel -- which, by the way, you should also funnel hack that funnel if you want to do any kind of continuity program.</p> <p>Then we give them a free copy of the Perfect Webinar script, free plus shipping, and that sales process is super cool, too. Oh crap! I forgot, they were for a mom. I forgot to create that. I was going to do that tonight. [Laughter]</p> <p>Well, good thing that\u2026 Okay, I think tomorrow is coming soon, and then the old DotComSecrets Lab book also is on the Thank You page, and they also get a gift, two-week, free trial access to ClickFunnels.</p> <p>So it\u2019s really cool, and then so that\u2019s the core funnel, but then breaking off of that there\u2019s four other funnels. There\u2019s the DotComSecretsBlueprint Workshop funnel, which an invisible funnel.</p> <p>Then there is the DotComSecretsLab\u2019s monthly funnel, which is the continuity, which I talk about in the book. Then there\u2019s the other\u2026 the two other free plus shipping funnels.</p> <p>And so anyway, I\u2019m practicing what I preach in giving people -- I\u2019m trying to lie, to lay out -- is that the right word? Lie out? I\u2019m trying to lay gold out so that, you know, getting the book, people will get insane amounts of value -- getting the training, getting all the stuff.</p> <p>But I\u2019m trying to -- like I\u2019m leaving hints, I\u2019m leaving clues, and I know that you guys, you\u2019re the Marketing in Your Car crew. You guys listen in. You\u2019re paying attention, you\u2019re intelligent, so you\u2019re going to see that, and I want you to notice the stuff.</p> <p>Like don\u2019t just go and buy it because you\u2019re in the heat of the moment. Like study it. Look at -- like funnel hack me, you guys!</p> <p>Like this is gone\u2026 I\u2019ve spent like insane amounts of time, putting this all together, and you know, it could bomb, it still could bomb. I hope it doesn\u2019t bomb, but it could.</p> <p>If it does, that\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s a lot of strategy and thought and stuff that went into this and I\u2019m proud of it. And I think that for those of you guys who were paying attention, you\u2019re going to get a free education just watching the process, so make sure you do.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m home, I\u2019m tired, and I\u2019m awake at the same. It\u2019s one of those weird feelings. So anyway, I\u2019m going to go try to crash for three or four hours and get back up, and then get this launch out the door!</p> <p>So I appreciate you guys listening in. I hope that you take some time and watch the process. And that if you do, it\u2019ll be a little secret gift I\u2019m giving you guys because you\u2019re Marketing in Your Car fans and listeners, and I appreciate you guys.</p> <p>So thanks again, and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "08:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_116.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1426520794, "title": "Episode #115 \u2013 I JUST SOLD MY BUSINESS!!!", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Just super grateful today for the gift of entrepreneurship\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the opportunity he had in the last few days to sell his Neuracel business.

It's really late at night right now. I'm driving home, and wanted to say, \"Hey,\" to all my \"Marketing in Your Car\" followers.</p> <p>Hey, everyone. First off, I appreciate you guys listening, especially this late at night. [laughs] I know it's probably a normal time of day for you right now, but I probably sound a little tired right now. I'm driving home from a long day, after having our new baby, baby Nora. It's been kind of insane on our side. My wife's got to take care of her, obviously, and I've got to take care of four other kids, so it's been crazy. [laughs]</p> <p>We had football games today and birthday parties today, and I was driving around all day, and then I went and picked up food, and then came back, and then I just went grocery shopping, and now I'm coming back. Anyway, I'm kind of worn out, but just wanted to smile for a little bit and say, \"Hi,\" to all you guys, because things are good. Things are fun.</p> <p>We did something really exciting on Friday. I've been working like crazy trying to get everything done for the book launch, and I'm so excited for you guys to see that. I think it's going to be really exciting. I did a podcast a little while ago about the whole funnel stacking concept and everything. I think you guys are going to enjoy just seeing the process, and so again, funnel hacking, when I do it, but notice that it's a deep funnel. You're not going to see it all in one day, and so pay attention, take notes.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm excited for that. The other exciting thing is that as I was rolling in things happening and craziness, and it was a crazy week. I had our Decade-in-a-Day on Friday, which is like we do these one-hour consult for our new incoming members, and so I did six of seven of those, and just all this stuff, and then at three o'clock in the afternoon, I jumped in my car. I drove over to this big legal building, and had to go get name-carded and get someone to buzz me in the building, all these things, and went up to the top floor overlooking all of Boise. It was beautiful, and I was there with one of my friends who just purchased Neuracel from us. It was kind of crazy. We signed paperwork and it was interesting, because I've been really excited about this for a long time, and I was freaked. I've been nervous on it. I feel the same way like if I sold a house to somebody. I feel nervous about if they're going to like it, are they going to...all those kind of things. And so part of me's been nervous about that, \"Is he even going to like this? Is he going to be excited? What is...?\" Those type of things.</p> <p>I remember I was driving there and I got a Vox from him saying, \"Hey, we just got the cashier's check. We're so excited. We're going to come to meet you,\" and I was just like, \"How cool is this?\" What a cool win-win. It's exciting for him to come and buy this company from us, and it's so exciting for me to be able to sell a company, and I feel like we created an offer that was a win-win for both of us, where it was a really good win for us, it was a really good win for him, and just a great experience all around. It was so cool. We went up there in the building, signed the paperwork, and he handed me a check, the biggest check I've ever seen in my life that was a real check. [laughs] Just so exciting.</p> <p>So I'm just grateful. I'm grateful for the gift we have of being entrepreneurs where we can invent things and create things and try to provide value to the world, and what's cool is that when we do it right, and we do it the correct way, we get the world, the market, whatever you want to call it, that we're selling these things to, that we're putting the value and the ideas out there. They reward us by giving us money, and for me, I've always focused on the customers giving us money, which has been really fun, and it's just cool to see somebody else's value of something we've created enough and be excited enough that they actually want to buy it and own it. Anyway, for me it was just a big day, something I've always wanted to do, first time ever.</p> <p>I've sold websites before. I had sold one website for a little over $100,000, I think $114,000. That was my biggest. I think that might have been the only website I've actually sold, actually. No, I think I've sold two. Anyway, I've only sold a couple of websites here and there. This is the first time I've sold a real business. I've always wanted to do that, and it was just cool to see the process and see the whole thing, and to see the finality on our side of seeing this thing end. We'll spend the next couple of weeks transitioning it over, and what was cool for me is that one of the people that bought it is actually one of our coaching students, so I'm going to have a chance to be able to still have my hand in the business a little bit through proxy, through sharing ideas and stuff. It just makes me happy that I can still be part of it, even though it's not mine anymore.</p> <p>Anyway, it was really fun and just grateful to be an entrepreneur. I hope you guys are grateful for this opportunity as well. I know that some places in the world, this is not possible, and other times in history when this was not possible, and we just live in such an amazing day and age, and I'm so blessed and grateful to be here and to be able to have a life like this, and an opportunity like this. I think all of us are so blessed to be living in a time and a date where things like this are possible.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm just grateful, and so I want to share that with you guys, and I hope you guys are grateful for this blessing of entrepreneurship that we all have, and sometimes, some ideas that we have make money, some don't. Some lose a lot of money. I think I've probably lost more money than most people ever dream of. [laughs] But every once in a while, it works, and that's what makes it all worthwhile. Anyway, just like I said, I'm grateful to be an entrepreneur, and I want to share that with you guys tonight. I hope you're grateful as well.</p> <p>Just got home. The garage is shut behind me. I'm going to do in, and take the groceries in, give all my kids a kiss, and tuck my little baby into bed, and I'm going to pass out. [laughs] I'll be ready for next week when we do the last phase of our preparations for the product launch. I actually rented a studio. It's like a professional recording studio. I'm going to go on Tuesday and record the audio version of my book, so I'm just excited. So much fun stuff.</p> <p>I appreciate you guys listening as always. I'm going to go in, crash. Just be thankful, you guys, again for this gift that we have of being entrepreneurs and the ability to create and to give and to share and to serve. I'm grateful to have that chance with you guys.</p> <p>So thanks again, and we'll talk to you guys all soon.</p>", "duration": "07:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_115.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1426174546, "title": "Episode #114 \u2013 Funnel Stacking", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The four funnel sequence we are using to launch the DotComSecrets book.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about his new Funnel Stacking book.

So, some of you guys know I\u2019m launching my book in two weeks from yesterday. So we\u2019re going to try to hit the New York Times Best-Seller List, among some fun stuff and anyway. So I\u2019ve been working on the funnel, and I\u2019m really excited for it and thought I would share with you guys, because maybe it will give you some ideas on your own.</p> <p>So, first thing is I decided instead of just doing one funnel, I\u2019m going to try to do funnel stacking. I think that this is going to become a bigger trend for people, especially after we kind of do it this week, or during this launch. So, there\u2019s basically going to be four funnels inside of this funnel. So, it\u2019s like a dream inside of a dream inside of a dream, right? So that\u2019s kind of the idea. We will call it funnel stacking.</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of a cool name. Anyway, so the first funnel is going to be the book launch. So the first thing is going to be a book. It\u2019s going to be free plus shipping, and then we\u2019ve got an order form bump. If you don\u2019t know what an order form bump is, I think I did a podcast, like, a few months ago about it. And actually, we\u2019re about to launch a new dot com secrets monthly continuity newsletter.</p> <p>And my due, the very first issue is all about the order form bump. So, it\u2019s a really cool thing. Basically it\u2019s like someone puts in there, like, step one in the sales page says \u201cWhere do you want us to ship you the book,\u201d then step two says \u201cWhat\u2019s your credit card.\u201d And then right before the submit form there\u2019s a little bump there that says \u201cHey, how would you like to add this to your offer for an extra, whatever, $37?\u201d</p> <p>So for ours, what we\u2019re doing is, I mean, going back before that, I think I figured out a perfect order form bump. So the order form bump is going to be next Tuesday I\u2019m renting out an entire recording studio. I\u2019m going to record an audio version of the book, so I have, like, an audio version. And then I just run a bonus chapter of the book, the lost chapter, called the Dream 100, just how to get leads into your sales funnels.</p> <p>And so, what I\u2019m going to do for order form bumps is \u201cHey, how would you like to have the audio book version of the book plus the lost chapter called The Dream 100, How to Get How Many Leads Into Your Funnels, for an extra $37?\u201d So, quick, here\u2019s a boom, a $37 order form bump, which I think will crush, I think we\u2019ll get half the people to buy that. So, that will be cool. Then the first upsell we\u2019ll probably make in some traffic systems, and the second upsell will probably be the Perfect Webinar systems.</p> <p>So that\u2019s going to be the kind of the initial, like, sales funnel number one, right? So that happens first. And then we transition over \u2013 I think I have allergies today, that\u2019s why I probably sound kind of funny. I\u2019ve been sneezing all morning, so I apologize for that. Okay, then, so after we finish that one, then we transition over to sales funnel number two, which is called Will This Work In Your Business, or This Won\u2019t Work in My Business, something like that.</p> <p>And so, yesterday I actually filmed, I spent about eight hours filming this workshop that basically takes what\u2019s in the book. We have a blueprint called the Dot Com Series Blueprint. And basically, it\u2019s a blueprint where I took a group of nine people through yesterday. And one was a realtor, and one was a chiropractor and one was a info product person, one was a coach. So we had, like, a lot of different types of businesses there.</p> <p>And so we went in there, and taught this process where Grayson took everything from inside the book but broke it down into, like, what\u2019s the first step, second step, third step, fourth step. So they had very, you know, very straight line to where they were starting out to where we\u2019re going. And so that was kind of the event. And so, we\u2019re going to be doing an invisible funnel version of that event for people, where basically it\u2019s $0 and then they pay $197 afterwards, if they love it. And so that will be the second funnel.</p> <p>And then we\u2019re actually doing those live. We\u2019re going to have, we\u2019re going to be having small group classes. It will be like one facilitator for ten people facilitating these little classes, like I did yesterday. So it will be really, really cool. So that will be funnel number two, it will be the invisible funnel. And that goal there is, you bought the book, here\u2019s how to [Inaudible 04:18] liking this book until you, to make it work for your type of business.</p> <p>Funnel number three then is we\u2019ve got this really cool hand sketch video called The Death of a Website, talking about how websites are dead and sales funnel is the new thing, and it gets people to register for the Funnel Hacks Webinar. So that would be the third funnel in the process.</p> <p>And then funnel number four, in the process, will be, we filmed the video yesterday with Mike Stanczyk. And you guys, if you listened to yesterday\u2019s podcast, you heard kind of his story. So I think we\u2019re going to call it Rick Kid, Poor Kid, or something like that. And it\u2019s him telling his story about his experience with our coaching program, and from there we\u2019re going to be selling our coaching program.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of the game plan. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So it\u2019s going to be kind of fun to see. In our old funnels, because it was one funnel, we had averaged, you know at Dot Com Use Labs we had averaged about $40 per book in the sales funnel. And this one, I\u2019m really excited to see, I think will be, you know, who knows, it will be 2, 3, $400 per book. It\u2019s really in that funnel sequence, the funnel stacking.</p> <p>So, anyway, we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll let you guys know as it happens, but it\u2019s kind of an exciting time, you know. So I\u2019m at the gym now, have a great day, you guys, and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "06:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_114.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1426088210, "title": "Episode #113 \u2013 The Tale Of Two Marketers", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Two guys joined our \u201cInner Circle\u201d on the same day, one quit.

It\u2019s Russell and it\u2019s literally three in the morning right now. I\u2019m driving home, and this is another very special, exciting episode of Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>All right, so I guess it\u2019s three a.m., I\u2019ve just dropped someone off at the Hyatt place, and I wanted to tell you a story about him.</p> <p>So his name is Mike Stanzic. Some of you guys may know him. If not, you should get to know him, he\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>But Mike, he\u2019s here in town because we\u2019re trying to film a kind of promotional video with him, talking about our coaching program, and just kind of hang out with him and have a good time and it\u2019s been really cool, and I wanted to tell you guys a story about him because it\u2019s pretty impressive.</p> <p>Actually, I\u2019m going to tell you two stories, and these two stories are going to illustrate why he is successful, and why -- if you\u2019re struggling, if you\u2019re struggling to be successful right now at this time in your life -- you need to look at what he\u2019s doing, and it\u2019ll help you understand what you need to do to get where you want to be.</p> <p>So Mike was a college kid. He had dropped out of college and was like trying to figure out what he wanted to do. I think he said he had like $23,000 in his bank account that was meant -- that he had saved up for his college tuition.</p> <p>He went to this Tony Robbins event, and at the Tony Robbins he met this guy, and they kind of became friends and stuff, and Mike didn\u2019t know anything about Internet marketing.</p> <p>He was involved in a network marketing program but didn\u2019t know anything about Internet marketing, and this other guy was big, like had been studying Internet marketing.</p> <p>And so after the Tony event, they were driving home, and they were just kind of talking, and this guy was telling Mike all about Internet marketing and how it worked and all these cool things, and Mike was like, \u201cWell, I could use that for my Internet marketing business.\u201d</p> <p>And anyway, his friend basically said, \u201cHey, there\u2019s this guy. His name is Russell Brunson, and I wanted to join his coaching program. It\u2019s really expensive, but it\u2019s going to change my whole life, and I think you should join it, too. We should join it together. It would be awesome!\u201d</p> <p>And so Mike got excited, and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s join this thing together,\u201d and so they joined.</p> <p>And so, anyway, so this is the next Monday, so next Monday we get a phone call at our office from the buddy, and he signs up for our $25,000 Inner Circle Program, and then like four hours later Mike calls up and signs up for the $25,000 Inner Circle Program.</p> <p>And I guess what happened, you know, Mike told me the story now, is that his buddy was like, \u201cHey man, I\u2019m going to do it! I\u2019m going to do it!\u201d And he\u2019s like, then he called Mike, \u201cHey, I did it! I sent the check in. The money is going, like I\u2019m in, and you need get in, too.\u201d</p> <p>So Mike is like, \u201cAll right, I\u2019m in,\u201d so he went in and actually did it. Wrote a check, sent it in. Got involved in the program, and basically, yeah, he got in the program.</p> <p>And then, Mike called the guy back like later on that day or maybe it was the next day and to talk about it, and the guy was like, \u201cAw! I couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d Mike is like, \u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s like, \u201cAre you kidding me? You couldn\u2019t afford to like\u2026 Like you just told me you sent a check. Well, I wrote a check based on that.\u201d Like he said, \u201cI send my college tuition on this thing. It was like every penny I had in my bank account.\u201d</p> <p>And the guy was like, \u201cSorry I can't do it,\u201d and so Mike was like stuck at this point, and, you know, the buddy called us and canceled. But Mike had stayed in and basically Mike was like, \u201cYou know what? I committed to this. I can't\u2026 I got to do it.\u201d</p> <p>So he went through and did it. He showed up at our next Mastermind meeting or our first workshop, as green as green can be. The guy didn\u2019t know anything about Internet marketing or anything.</p> <p>And we started the Mastermind group and there\u2019s 18 people or so in this group, and each person is supposed to get up and present their business, and before I started it, I said, you know, \u201cDoes anyone want to go first?\u201d</p> <p>And Mike jumps right up and stands in front of the room -- doesn\u2019t know anything about anything! Stands up there, starts drawing a picture of his supplement that he sold through his MLM, and said, \u201cThis is what I have,\u201d and that was it, and so we started working on this thing.</p> <p>Man, he just jumped in and just worked hard and spent the next four months, building out his first funnel and launching it. Making some money, and then kept going from there and ended up learning how to drive traffic, and just kept growing and evolving.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been watching him do this stuff, and anyway he came today, he was kind of talking about what he\u2019s doing. I didn\u2019t realize his last week alone he made 10 grand.</p> <p>Last month I think it was close to like 30 grand or something crazy like that, and what was interesting is that he told me that his buddy, the guy that had signed up and then canceled, basically had just reapplied for school because he\u2019s frustrated and his business hasn\u2019t grown.</p> <p>He\u2019s just stagnated and he was going back to school now to figure out Option B, and it was just kind of cool to see this tale of two people, right? Two people who started at the exact same situation, both made the same commitment.</p> <p>One followed through and one didn\u2019t, and where is their life at now? What\u2019s the difference? You know, what\u2019s been happening, and it\u2019s just kind of cool to see that.</p> <p>And just to kind of like put you in perspective of like the type of person that he is, he was telling me a story tonight that he wanted do this partnership with this guy that he was going to be calling, and it was for this mortgage broker thing.</p> <p>The guy told him, \u201cHey, you need to start cold calling mortgage brokers,\u201d and Mike was like, \u201cAll right.\u201d So he grabbed a phone book and starting cold calling mortgage brokers. He didn\u2019t even know what the pitch was but started dialing numbers, and saying, \u201cHey, so we\u2019ve got this thing\u2026\u201d</p> <p>And didn\u2019t even know what it was, and was trying to like explain this thing, and he didn\u2019t even know what it was. The first one went and it totally bombed, so Mike called the guy back, \u201cHey, it bombed, but this is what I said\u2026\u201d</p> <p>And the guy is like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re selling. This is what we\u2019re doing,\u201d and so he kind of tweaked it.</p> <p>Anyway, he kept dialing, and just cold calling mortgage brokers out of a phone book; selling a product he didn\u2019t even know what it was, just because the guy said, \u201cyou need to do it.\u201d</p> <p>And he just jumped in and did it and did it and did it and boom! And eventually landed like four or five mortgage brokers in this deal, and just did it, and I was telling him how impressive it is for me.</p> <p>Like he\u2019s the kind of person when he just moves forward and he hits something, and then he just keeps moving forward, he keeps moving forward and he keeps moving forward.</p> <p>And I told him how rare that is, like people don\u2019t just do that. Like most people, they start moving forward, they hit something and they stop, and then they stop.</p> <p>Maybe they\u2019ll move forward again, they hit something, they stop. And the reason why he\u2019s successful is because he doesn\u2019t stop. When he hit something he keeps going and he keeps going. He doesn\u2019t let fear or excuses or no money or whatever, he doesn\u2019t let the fact that he doesn\u2019t even know what the product is, stop him.</p> <p>He just goes and goes and goes and goes, and I look at this kid now, 20\u2026 I think he\u2019s 22 or 23-years-old. You know, he\u2019s ten years younger than me, and this is a guy who\u2019s got the world on his fingertips.</p> <p>He can literally do whatever he wants now. Because he just brute-forced through this, he understands funnels and traffic, and I\u2019ve seen him build funnels now for himself and other people, and he\u2019s learned the process and it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>And so, I wanted to share that story, first off, because it inspired the heck out of me, and hopefully inspires the heck out of you as well. I hope that it makes you guys look at yourself, and then kind of look internal and look at like what are the things that keep you from moving forward sometimes?</p> <p>You know, it\u2019s kind of funny, on the flip side of that I had a phone call today with another person who joined our coaching program, who signed up, went through the initial program.</p> <p>Went through my initial consult I do with them, where I kind of steer them in the right direction. I map out a business model, a funnel for them, and gave them everything on a silver platter, and then for two months he didn\u2019t do anything.</p> <p>And then, two months later he calls me and is like, \u201cHey, so I haven\u2019t done anything. I can't remember what you wanted me to do. Can we do another call, so that you can re-explain to me what you told me two months ago?\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cNo, like if you didn\u2019t take notes, if you\u2019re not paying attention, I\u2019m not going to do it for you again.\u201d Like, and then, the guy said like, \u201cOh, well, if I can't talk to you on the phone, I want a refund for my money.\u201d</p> <p>All these things, and I was like, \u201cDude, like two months ago I gave you a business model on a silver platter. Since then you\u2019ve had the ability to Vox me any time you want. How many times have you Voxed me? Zero.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a chance to inbound call my two business partners every single week. How many times have you inbound called them? Zero.\u201d</p> <p>You know, and it\u2019s just this guy who\u2019s frustrated and upset, and look at him versus Mike, what\u2019s the difference? Okay, one person doesn\u2019t make excuses.</p> <p>One person doesn\u2019t let\u2026 I don\u2019t know what would get in the way. One person doesn\u2019t let any\u2026 just moves forward, and knows that success is right there and just goes and grabs it.</p> <p>Where another person, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s been there for two months. He hasn\u2019t been working, that\u2019s for dang sure, and now wants to blame it on me or blame it on whoever and it just drives me crazy.</p> <p>And so, I want to make sure that you guys are more like Mike. Not like Mike\u2019s friend, or not like the other guy that I\u2019m talking about. Don\u2019t be that kind of a person, you guys. I want you to be successful.</p> <p>So anyway, I hope that helps. It\u2019s three in the morning. I\u2019m so tired, I don\u2019t even know if anything I said even makes any sense, but that\u2019s how it works.</p> <p>So, you guys, if you\u2019ve come to my events before or heard me talk about this, I talk a lot about a concept called Lead or Gold, where when I set goals or have ideas, I always set what I call a Lead or Gold Deadline.</p> <p>And that story comes from -- I heard John, John Carlton, and Gary Halbert tell the story years ago, where they talk about how like the Mexican mafia, how when they need something to happen, right?</p> <p>They go to the government and they say, \u201cHey, we need to change this law, so that we can get more drugs,\u201d or whatever, right? And the government is like \u201cNo, we can't do that. That\u2019s stupid. Like we\u2019ll never do that.\u201d</p> <p>They say, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine.\u201d And then, that night they\u2019ll break into the government leaders\u2019 homes and they\u2019ll jump, you know, come and grab them and hold a gun to their head, and hold the gun in one hand in a bag of gold in another hand and say:</p> <p>\u201cHey, you know what I talked about earlier today? You need to change it, right now, and you\u2019ve got two options: Number one is lead, and you\u2019re going to die. Or option number two is gold, where you\u2019re going to take my bribe, and those two options, Lead or Gold.\u201d</p> <p>And when those are your options, Lead or Gold, it\u2019s pretty easy to take the gold, okay? And so for me whenever I try to get something done in my business, I set what I call Lead or Gold Deadlines.</p> <p>Like this has to happen, right now, and I do not deviate from it. I set these deadlines in there. In my mind, they are Lead or Gold. I will die if I do not create this deadline, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m out at three in the morning.</p> <p>Because I set a Lead or Gold Deadline on a project that I\u2019m doing tomorrow, and it\u2019s 3:09, and I\u2019m finally getting home because my Lead or Gold Deadline, I had to hit it. I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to weasel out of it.</p> <p>And anyway, that\u2019s one thing I do, you guys, to help me be successful and help make sure I get stuff done.</p> <p>So anyhoo, I\u2019m home. I\u2019m done. I need some sleep because I\u2019ve got to be up in four hours to go and give the presentation I just finished a few minutes ago.</p> <p>But I appreciate you guys. Thanks for hanging out with me tonight. I hope that you got something from this podcast.</p> <p>I appreciate you guys. Go out and conquer, go serve the world in your way. Change somebody\u2019s life today, and if you do that, all the stuff we talk about is going to be worth it.</p> <p>So thanks, you guys, I appreciate you, and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "11:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_113.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1425575409, "title": "Episode #112 \u2013 Stories = Belief, Belief = Money", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The small tweak that goes from zero sales to unlimited sales.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about his perfect webinar script and why everyone who isn\u2019t making money off of it is making the same mistake.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>What is the one mistake everyone is making and how to fix it.</li> <li>Why initially making someone believe in your product is more important than teaching them.</li> <li>And how you can make someone believe in your product = money and once that happens you can teach them and change their lives.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out what the one mistake is that everyone is making and how you can avoid making it too.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Alright, so, I\u2019m in a good mood today. I just got an email from one of my friends saying he tested click funnels. He\u2019s got a funnel that he\u2019s been making a couple million dollars a year with for like five years.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t touched it, but he rebuilt it and click funnels launched it. It\u2019s getting a 62% conversion rate. Boom! There you go. It\u2019s another amazing success story through click funnels. We are getting literally dozens a day. It\u2019s amazing. I love it!</p> <p>If you\u2019re not using click funnels, you don\u2019t belong on this podcast my friends. It means you hate good stuff \u2013 you hate money. If you hate money, you should not be here for sure. Anyway, I want to talk you about something today.</p> <p>This has been kind of a fun thing. Some of you guys have gone through the perfect webinar script. If not, we\u2019re going to be launching it as a free shipping offer in the very near future. You\u2019re going to be able to find it at perfectwebinarsecrets.com or actually on perfect webinar.com.</p> <p>Somehow it got expired and the dude could sell it back to me for $5000. So I said, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m buying perfectwebinarsecrets.com for $10. Anyway, that\u2019s kind of a funny story.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s been fun because we\u2019ve had tons of our higher-end students go through it. We did a whole two-day workshop here in Boise. It\u2019s been fun watching you guys going out there and just crushing \u2013 person after person after person.</p> <p>There have been three or four people \u2013 or actually more than that. I would say five or six people who have gone through it who have launched a webinar and it didn\u2019t work, didn\u2019t work, and didn\u2019t work; and they asked me, \u201cHey, can you look at my slides? What do I need to do differently?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting. Every single one of them \u2013 not just one or two \u2013 every single one of them that is not working yet, I told him to make an almost identical change. All of them made the same change. All of the webinars now work.</p> <p>They all followed the script. They used the one thing and they used the three secrets. But for the three secrets, they shifted from marketer/salesperson to educator. They try to teach; and they teach, teach, teach. They have so much cool stuff, and they are trying to make it amazing. That\u2019s good because you want to teach and inspire.</p> <p>But, but all of them did \u2013 I think they knew it but they just didn\u2019t do it \u2013 is understanding that in a 90 minute presentation you cannot teach people how to do your thing. So, trying to do that is a disservice because they are getting a fragmented part of it. What your goal is and what your job is is to inspire them and make them believe. If they believe that whatever you are selling or teaching or doing \u2013 that they can actually do it \u2013 than they are going to invest in your program.</p> <p>Now you can actually help them and serve them and change their lives. So, the entire goal of the webinar is not to teach them something. The entire goal of the webinar is to get them to believe that what you are talking about is possible \u2013 not just possible but possible for them. If they believe that it\u2019s possible for them, they will give you money.</p> <p>It\u2019s very important to understand that. It\u2019s the same with any kind of sales you guys. It\u2019s not so much \u2013 it\u2019s funny if you ask our two sales guys \u2013 they each do millions of dollars a year in sales. If you ask them anything about Internet marketing, neither of them knows anything about Internet marketing.</p> <p>But they believe in me and what I can do for somebody. They believe in that, and they can get other people to believe in that as well. That is really the key. So, with all of my students\u2019 webinars that we came back to and I had them shift out their three secrets for training into storytelling.</p> <p>That is telling stories about them and about other people and how this concept that they are sharing \u2013 the secret \u2013 how it works through story. I had them cut out all of the teaching \u2013 not teaching any of the technical parts but just talking about what it is and sharing results and stories to make it so that people believe that it will work for them.</p> <p>When they shifted those things, it all worked for them. So, what I want you guys to understand is that stories cause belief, and belief causes people to give you money. When you understand that, it will change your business.</p> <p>So quit teaching and quit educating until after they have bought your product, you guys. You are not doing them service as much as you think you are. Create stories that cause belief. After they have belief, they will give you money. Now, you can change their life.</p> <p>Does that make sense? Alright. I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019ve got a fun day planned. I just wanted to drop that one on you guys really quick. Thanks so much for everything! I\u2019ll talk to you guys all soon.</p>", "duration": "05:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_112.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1425400542, "title": "Episode #111 \u2013 Baby Coconut Is Here!", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The power of doing awesome\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the arrival of his new baby daughter, Norah.

I\u2019m on day three now having a brand-new little baby.</p> <p>I can\u2019t remember if I told you guys yet or not, but we just had a baby at the end of February. It was a month early. My wife woke up at 430 in the morning and said, \u201cRussell, I think my water broke.\u201d</p> <p>So, we started the process, and sure enough a little baby came a month early. She\u2019s doing awesome. She\u2019s really big. She was 7 pounds and 1 ounce when she came \u2013 really healthy. We got to take her home yesterday which was really cool.</p> <p>It\u2019s been amazing. I got her home last night, and now I have my early morning weightlifting. Fortunately, my mother-in-law is in town and can watch the baby for little bit.</p> <p>We\u2019ve named her Norah Jane Brunson. So, that\u2019s been fun. It\u2019s funny because we thought we had an entire month to plan. We had nothing planned yet, which has been a fun experience of hurrying and buying everything we need and trying to coordinate schedules and get everything off.</p> <p>We have all these plans this week that we now obviously have to cancel and move things around and shut things down and just go crazy with things to get all the free time so I could hang out with the family for this week and get things under control.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s been crazy little bit. We are all tired now. We are worn out and everything. But, I just want to jump on and say \u201chey\u201d for one. I miss you guys and I hope you are doing everything.</p> <p>Secondly, I did a podcast about this a long time ago. If you go through the archives marketinginyourcar.com I\u2019m sure you can find it and listen to it. But, it has to do with just our attitudes toward things.</p> <p>I was talking in that podcast about how my kids \u2013 we trained them a long time ago \u2013 if someone asks us how were doing, we don\u2019t say \u201cgood.\u201d Everyone says, \u201cHow you doing?\u201d \u201cDoing good. Doing good.\u201d</p> <p>The world is boring because everyone\u2019s just doing good. It\u2019s a bad thing. So, probably two or three years ago I decided that when someone asks me how I\u2019m doing, is that of saying that I\u2019m doing good I\u2019m going to say that I\u2019m doing awesome.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny because we go to the airport at four in the morning and you\u2019re buying some gum or something the ladies like, \u201cHow you doing today?\u201d When you say, \u201cI\u2019m doing awesome,\u201d there always like, \u201cWhat, really?\u201d</p> <p>You can really catch people off guard. So, we trained our kids about a year ago at dinnertime we sat around that I had them each go through and talk about this. The rest of the world is doing good. We are doing awesome.</p> <p>I would say, \u201cHow you guys doing?\u201d They would say, \u201cWe are doing awesome.\u201d I always quizzed them all the time too. Whenever I see them in the morning I go, \u201cHey, Dallin, how are you doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m doing awesome Dad!\u201d \u201cHey, Ellie, how are you doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m doing awesome, Dad!\u201d</p> <p>We get everybody saying they are doing awesome. It\u2019s funny how just that little tiny shift can change everything. They used to laugh because four years ago we had our last kid. His name is Aden, and he is four now.</p> <p>We were in the hospital, we had this nurse who was crazy negative. I just remember she was so miserable all the time \u2013 so much so that my wife actually left the hospital early because she didn\u2019t want to stay on her shift anymore.</p> <p>She literally called me up and said, \u201cHey, come get me. I\u2019m leaving because I just don\u2019t want to be on this nurse\u2019s shift. She\u2019s so miserable.\u201d What\u2019s funny is that this time we\u2019re having a baby and we go to the hospital. It\u2019s four years later! Who would think that would see her again?</p> <p>But all of a sudden, Collette said that she was sitting there in her room and there were some nurses talking outside. Then, the nurse shift changed. A woman said, \u201cHey, good morning. How you doing?\u201d And the nurse said, \u201cI\u2019m miserable. Blah, blah, blah,\u201d and she went on and on and rattled off about 10 things about how miserable her life was.</p> <p>Then, she came in and it was the same nurse. This lady has literally been miserable for the last four years. She is not changed her state one bit. It\u2019s funny how people live in that horrible state.</p> <p>So, what I want to tell you guys today is that first of all, I\u2019m happy. Life is amazing and good. There are so many problems still, but I wake up every morning and I\u2019m grateful for my family, for my kids, this fund business we get to be in, and all the cool stuff we are learning, and just how amazing everything is.</p> <p>This morning I woke up and I can\u2019t tell you how tired I was. We were up all night with the baby. My kids asked me, \u201cHey dad, how you doing?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m doing awesome!\u201d If anybody asks how you are doing today or for the next week or for the rest of your life, don\u2019t say you are doing good.</p> <p>Good is the enemy of great. Say you are doing awesome. Teach your kids that, and share it with people around you. It will make everyone better and keep you in a better emotional state. It\u2019s amazing how just that little shift to shift your entire day, your entire week, and your entire life.</p> <p>So, I\u2019m at the gym. I\u2019m going to go workout. I am tired. I am worn out. But, I am doing awesome, and I\u2019m excited. I appreciate you guys listening, and we will talk soon.</p>", "duration": "06:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_111.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1424969464, "title": "Episode #110 \u2013 Are You Willing To Do What Others Aren\u2019t?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>It\u2019s 4:30 in the morning, what time is it for you?\u2026</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about being willing to do what others aren\u2019t willing to do and how that will help you be the best.</p> <p>Here are some cool things to listen for in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>How Russell became the best when he was a wrestler.</li> <li>And why if you are not willing to put in extra time and effort someone else will be and then you will miss out on something great.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why you need to be willing to work hard when others aren\u2019t in order to be the best.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone!

And you may be wondering, \u201cWhy in the world, Russell, are you up at 4:30 in the morning?\u201d</p> <p>And the reason is because I did a webinar tonight with a group from Australia, and so I wanted to serve them at their time zone, and so I went in super late tonight into the webinar and just kind of got done, and I\u2019m about to crash and fall asleep.</p> <p>I hope I don\u2019t wreck on the way home. [Laughter] If I do, and you guys hear this, let my wife know I\u2019m on the side of the road. No, just joking, but anyway I had a lot of fun with it, and today was a crazy day.</p> <p>I don\u2019t like bragging about numbers or talking about numbers. But one of the most -- one of the biggest money days in our business, which is cool because we didn\u2019t even have a product launch. I did three webinars, which was kind of fun and wears you out, obviously, and then we had a huge coaching deal come through.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been working on it for almost a year now, and anyway, it\u2019s crazy. I mean, we literally did more today than we did last January as a whole, which is really cool, so exciting times, fun things are happening.</p> <p>But what I want to talk to you guys about tonight, and hopefully, I hope this is kind of coherent. I have no idea if it will or won\u2019t be, but we will find out when we see the transcripts later, right?</p> <p>So, and by the way, if you guys don\u2019t know, we\u2019ve got <a href=\"http://www.marketinginyourcar.com\">MarketingInYourCar.com</a>\u00a0where now you can see, get all episodes there as well as the transcripts. So that\u2019s a gift we gave out you guys as well, so <a href=\"http://www.marketinginyourcar.com\">MarketingInYourCar.com</a>, check it out.</p> <p>What I want to talk about today is, I want to talk to you about being willing to do what other people aren\u2019t willing to do. You know, when I was growing up I was a wrestler, as a lot of you guys know, and I wanted to be the best. And I remember that, you know, I would wrestle at my high school.</p> <p>In high school, we\u2019d go through our wrestling practice and everyone would go home, and when everybody went home my dad would get off work and he would come over, and I\u2019d do another two-hour wrestling practice with him every single night.</p> <p>And I remember during the off season, while everyone was out, goofing off and hanging out, I would go to freestyle, and I\u2019d go to Greco, and I\u2019d go to these other practices, and during an off season I would typically\u2026</p> <p>Like, in the typical high school season you\u2019d get about 40 matches, and during the off season, during freestyle and Greco, I\u2019d on average get about 80 more matches.</p> <p>I\u2019d get two seasons in while everyone else was slacking off and goofing off and having fun, and I remember one day my dad told me, he said that a coach could take a kid about\u2026 he could take a kid so far.</p> <p>He\u2019d hold his hands \u201cabout this far, a coach can take a kid.\u201d But he said, \u201cBut it takes something special. It takes someone willing to go beyond that to get to the next level.\u201d</p> <p>And he used to say it to me all the time, and I remember thinking about that, thinking, \u201cYou know, like if I go home when everybody else goes home, I\u2019m going to be as good as everybody else, and if I want the edge, if I want to be better than everyone else, I\u2019ve got to be willing to do things other people aren\u2019t willing to do.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to be willing to do a second wrestling practice when everyone else is at home, eating dinner. I\u2019ve got to be willing to go and during the summer when everyone else is goofing off and having fun, put in two more seasons.\u201d</p> <p>Because I wanted to be the best, and I think about that now with this, with today, it\u2019s 4:30 in the morning. I woke up this morning at about 6:00, I think, to do my three:</p> <p>I had a early morning webinar, afternoon webinar, and nighttime webinar, and as well as a whole bunch of other crazy things as well, spending three hours with my kids tonight, time with my wife and everything else.</p> <p>And, you know, I think that most of my competitors, the people that we\u2019re competing against in our business, they\u2019re sleeping right now, and I know that they will be where they\u2019re at, but I know that I\u2019m always going to outwork them.</p> <p>I know that I am willing and able to do what they are not, and so I want you thinking about your business or your life. I don\u2019t care if this is your finances, if it\u2019s you\u2019re, you know, your an entrepreneur, if this is your, you know, if this is relationships, whatever it is, I\u2019m curious. Are you willing to do what other people aren\u2019t?</p> <p>And if you\u2019re not, there are people out there who will, and if you want to be the best at whatever it is you do, you\u2019ve got to be willing to put in the extra time and effort when it\u2019s required.</p> <p>So I just want to leave that with you guys, quick message. I\u2019m heading in, going to go crash and sleep. I\u2019ll be asleep hopefully when you guys are listening to this, so I appreciate you guys.</p> <p>Have an awesome day, work hard, work your butt off to get that edge, and we\u2019ll go from there.</p> <p>Thanks, everyone!</p>", "duration": "05:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_110.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1424796097, "title": "Episode #109 \u2013 The High Ticket Funnel Smackdown", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My thoughts after seeing a really cool new high ticket sales funnel built in Click Funnels.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about how someone else used Clickfunnels to make over $300K.

This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to Episode Number 109 of the Marketing In Your Car series, and I cannot believe that I\u2019ve been this consistent to do 109 episodes, but I\u2019m excited to have you guys all here.</p> <p>All right, everyone. So I woke up this morning, I was supposed to do a podcast interview at 7:00 my time. I called into the podcast, and it turned out my assistant screwed up on the time and it\u2019s actually 9:00.</p> <p>So I had an hour today to kind of goof around, and I was looking up some stuff and saw this message in the Help Desk from somebody using ClickFunnels, and the guy said:</p> <p>\u201cHey, just so you know, we love ClickFunnels,\u201d whatever, and anyway then I saw the guy\u2019s name, and I knew him on Facebook, but I\u2019d never really talked to him before, so I messaged him and I was like:</p> <p>\u201cHey man, just, you know, saw your thing in our support desk. Glad you love ClickFunnels,\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, man.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOur new funnel is doing over $300,000 a month because I had ClickFunnels.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? That is amazing!\u201d I said, \u201cWhere is it at? I want to see it!\u201d</p> <p>So he sent me a link to the funnel, and so this morning that\u2019s all I did, is I was going through his funnel. And it was amazing, and it made me so proud that ClickFunnels is the backbone that\u2019s given him the ability to do that.</p> <p>But what was even more powerful is, as I was watching his process -- and he\u2019s selling a $10,000 boot camp, a weeklong boot camp type thing, and he\u2019s got videos throughout this funnel to sell the process.</p> <p>And it was interesting because it was kind of similar to my coaching funnel in some ways and very, very different in other ways.</p> <p>For those of you guys who listen in, if you guys haven\u2019t seen my coaching funnel, I recommend doing it for two reasons. One, you\u2019re going to get a ton of ideas if you are selling your own high end coaching program.</p> <p>Number two, that\u2019s how you get in my coaching program, and if you\u2019re listening to Marketing In Your Car, I promise you there\u2019s no better coaching program online than ours.</p> <p>In fact, I was just two seconds ago responding back to our members. All of our members have me on walky-talky and they can ask or message any time they want, and that\u2019s how much I care about you guys and want your success.</p> <p>So either way, you need to go check out the Coaching Funnel. If you go to <a href=\"http://dotcomsecretsignite.com/liz\">DotComSecretsIgnite.com</a>, you\u2019ll see one of the coaching pages there. If you go to <a href=\"http://dotcomsecrets.com/thesecret\">DotComSecrets.com</a>, there\u2019s a whole bunch of links to all different versions of the coaching page.</p> <p>You can kind of see what it is there, and then go through the process. Again, go through to see it, but go through because you guys should get involved in our coaching program if you want to go to the next level.</p> <p>But look at the process and, you know, so step number one, there\u2019s typically a video of one of our success stories. I think right now, if you go to\u00a0<a href=\"http://dotcomsecretsignite.com/liz\">DotComSecretsIgnite.com</a>, you\u2019ll see Liz Benny telling her story there.</p> <p>It\u2019s an emotional, captivating story of her experience of the coaching program, and then there\u2019s kind of a long form sales letter that kind of goes through what\u2019s involved and what happens, and those kinds of things.</p> <p>And then after you apply, or after you finish the first step, then it takes you to the \u201cApplication\u201d page, and on the \u201cApplication\u201d page I\u2019ve got like a 20 or 30-minute video that I call \u201cThe Journey,\u201d and it\u2019s me.</p> <p>I kind of intro the story real quick and then I show testimonials, this whole, like, story of people who\u2019ve gone through our coaching, and we\u2019ve got people crying, and talking about how it changed their life and all sorts of stuff, and it\u2019s a very emotional video there for step number two.</p> <p>And then after they apply, then it takes them to the third step in the sequence, which is the \u201cHomework\u201d page, which then pre-sells them and gets them really excited about our call and why they want to work for me, and things like that. So it\u2019s a really cool process.</p> <p>Right now, for every single person that applies, we\u2019re averaging $967 in backend sales, so the process works and it gives me the ability to work with people and change their lives at a level that has never been possible before for.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of what my Coaching Funnel looks like. It\u2019s this three-page sequence. There are emails and other things tied to it as well, depending on what you do and where you go and that kind of stuff, but that\u2019s kind of the basic overall architecture of it.</p> <p>So today when I was watching this guy\u2019s coaching funnel, it was beautiful. What he did is, step number one, he had this really cool video of him out in front of Wall Street, kind of telling his story about how everything crashed in 2008, and anyway it kind of tells a story.</p> <p>It was a visually captivating video. The page looked amazing, it was really, really cool. So then I followed step one, I put my email address in, and step two took me to like a documentary style of the weeklong coaching program, and it was super cool.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t watched the whole thing yet. It\u2019s like an hour and 20 minutes long, but you watch this video, and it\u2019s the actual process that he takes his people through, and he\u2019s showing it.</p> <p>He\u2019s got people crying and all these things happening, and he\u2019s showing the process. Which was powerful, because obviously I\u2019m not in his coaching program -- or I saw what he does with his people, and how he does it, and how he affects them.</p> <p>You know, and I\u2019ve known who this guy was on Facebook for a long time. I\u2019ve never really\u2026 he always kind of drove me crazy, to be honest. But when I saw him and how he uses his personality to effect change in people, I got a soft spot in my heart for him and I was like, \u201cWow, this guy\u2019s really doing some cool things!\u201d</p> <p>And it just made him very, very real. It kind of put purpose behind his exterior, and stuff like that, and it made me really, like, bond with him. In fact, by the time I was finished -- you know, I haven\u2019t watched the whole hour and 20-minute long video, I watched a bunch of it, like I wanted to go through the program.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cMan, this is really, really cool!\u201d Because then he\u2019s showing the actual process of how he affects change in people, and you see the people\u2019s lives. You see the look in their eyes, you see all those kinds of things, which is really, really cool.</p> <p>And then -- check it out, guys. I got to the gym and my trainer is not even here yet. Oh, I\u2019m early.</p> <p>Okay, and then\u2026 so then you watch that hour and 20-minute long video and then there\u2019s a thing that says \u201cApply for his program.\u201d So you click on the \u201cApply\u201d button, and then it takes you over to a page where he\u2019s talking directly to the screen, and it\u2019s got the application box on the right-hand side.</p> <p>And he\u2019s telling them how the process can happen, and how this is an interview, and how you can\u2019t lie, and you got to be very truthful when you go through this, and just very direct and very\u2026</p> <p>Anyway, it was really, really cool. This video, probably about 10 minutes long, telling them what to expect and how to do it and the way to go through this process, and so kind of that page right there.</p> <p>And after you go through and apply, then on the next page it takes you to one more video of him, where he\u2019s sitting there getting a tattoo. It was kind of cool, and he\u2019s talking to you as he\u2019s getting his tattoo, and just telling you like,</p> <p>\u201cThis is what\u2019s going to happen now, this is what to expect, and this is where we\u2019re going, and this, you know, you just finished step one of your interview, and you\u2019re going to have a chance to speak directly to me, but only if blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p> <p>You know, all these different things. And anyway, it was just, it was a really cool process and it made me think a lot. I look at how salesmanship online has been evolving, just in the 12 years that I\u2019ve been doing it.</p> <p>You know, when we first got on, it was very rudimentary copy that got people to buy. You know, over the next five or six years we all got better at writing copy, and copy got slicker and better and better at convincing people of things.</p> <p>And I look at my own marketing, I look at other people\u2019s marketing, and I almost feel like the era of like sales copy is dying, and it\u2019s transitioned into the era of like almost like reality TV, like stories and emotional connections and things like that.</p> <p>Like again, if you look at my coaching funnel, like the copy on the page is not very substantial at all. It\u2019s more there to logically support what they\u2019re feeling when they watch the emotional videos.</p> <p>You know, this guy\u2019s, he didn\u2019t even have any copy. It was just the emotional videos that got people to want to change, and it inspired them and gave them belief and hope that he could effect change in their lives.</p> <p>And that\u2019s kind of similar to, if you look at my coaching funnel, what we have in there. All the videos and stuff are structured to cause belief and hope and cause that change in someone. So anyway, it\u2019s pretty exciting.</p> <p>So for me, again, a couple of things: First off, it was fun to see it in ClickFunnels. Second off, it was fun to see another successful coaching funnel. There\u2019s not a lot of them out there, and it was really fun to see his and see that the style model mimicked a lot of kind of what we were doing, which was exciting.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t think he modeled it from me, he just did it his own way, but just the psychology behind how we both had kind of structured things was similar, and in some ways I think his was even better, which was really, really cool.</p> <p>It made me want to go back and make an, you know, an hour and a half-long documentary about our coaching process, what we take people through, but it was really cool.</p> <p>So anyway, I just wanted to kind of share that with you guys, and if you want to see a good coaching funnel again, go to <a href=\"http://dotcomsecretsignite.com/liz\">DotComSecretsIgnite.com</a>.</p> <p>And for those of you guys listening, I\u2019ve never really pitched you guys on anything before in the 109 episodes we\u2019ve done this, but if nothing else, you guys need to get involved in our coaching program.</p> <p>There\u2019s none other like it on the Internet. If you want success and you want to get from where you are to where you need to be, we\u2019re the best at that, and I have no reservations saying that.</p> <p>I don\u2019t feel guilty, you know, talking about my own program, not only because I\u2019ve seen the results and I\u2019ve been in tons of other coaching programs, and I always desired something from them and I never got it.</p> <p>And so when we started putting this together, I said, \u201cWhat would I actually want? How would it affect me the most?\u201d And we built something based around that, and because of that, I mean, you\u2019ve seen the success stories pouring in from what we\u2019re doing, so it\u2019s pretty exciting.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I got for today, you guys. I\u2019m going to check out, but for all you guys who are interested in some high ticket stuff, go look at my coaching funnel, study it and model it, use it for what you guys are doing, bring emotion, bring stories in.</p> <p>Take the results and the case studies from people\u2019s lives you\u2019ve changed, capture those on video and make a really compelling story, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get people to want to be inspired enough to sign up for your high end program.</p> <p>So that\u2019s it, you guys. I appreciate you all, and we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "10:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_109.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1424451950, "title": "Episode #108 \u2013 T&C \u2013 The Strategy Behind The Booth", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How we used our booth at Traffic and Conversion Summit to grow our list, brand and following, using t-shirts, girls and a helicopter\u2026?</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the Traffic Conversion Summit and why Clickfunnels did a booth, and some of the challenges that came with it.</p> <p>Here are some fun stuff to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>How Russell made a crappy booth in a crappy location into an awesome booth in a much better location.</li> <li>How Russell was able to get a bunch of people wearing his t-shirts and make his booth memorable.</li> <li>And some other challenges they encountered and how they overcame them.</li> </ul> <p>Listen below to hear how Russell and Clickfunnels made thier name stand out at the Traffic Conversion Summit.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone! This is Russell and I want to welcome you to the one and only, Marketing In Your Car.\u00a0 I hope you guys are having an awesome day today. I have some fun stuff to talk about to you guys. I hope that you\u2019re in the mood to hang out. Just dropped my son off at school, and I\u2019m heading back into the office.</p> <p>And it was funny\u2026 someone messaged me this week on Facebook and asked me to do a podcast about my thoughts on the Traffic and Conversions Summit, which we just got back from late last night, and so I thought that I would do that.</p> <p>So I want kind of talk about some of you guys know the Traffic and Conversion Summit. It\u2019s a huge conference that happens every year. This year they had, I think like 3,500 people. It was pretty impressive that there were that many people all there. It was kind of crazy.</p> <p>And so it\u2019s kind of like a no-pitch event, pretty much. You know, they come and they teach, and, you know, Ryan and Perry that run it, they sell a couple of their own little things, but not really aggressively or anything like that.</p> <p>And so anyway, so they kind of were doing the event, and because with that many people there, we obviously wanted to be there with ClickFunnels, and so we decided to do a sponsorship booth.</p> <p>And so they had different sponsorship levels. The highest one, I think, was like $75,000, which we didn\u2019t want to do that one. But there\u2019s one at $25,000 where you got a booth, and then you were able to actually speak onstage for like 45 minutes in one of the break out rooms.</p> <p>And so we did that, and so we had to figure out like how to maximize that. You know, in a format where I can\u2019t sell, how do we make as much money as possible?</p> <p>And so we tried a bunch of strategies -- some worked, some didn\u2019t work, but I thought I\u2019d kind of share some of them.</p> <p>So first thing, obviously, we got a booth, and we had never really done big booths before. We had kind of, you know, had a little booth, we\u2019d taken a couple of events, but that was about it.</p> <p>So we had a big booth, and so we showed up there the night before and our booth was set up, and they put us like clear in the back corner where nobody could find us, and I looked at our booth and everyone else had these amazingly huge, designed booths and all these crazy things.</p> <p>And anyway, it was kind of interesting, and we looked at ours. Ours looked so crappy next to everybody else\u2019s because all we had were like these two little side banners and then like a tablecloth and that was it.</p> <p>And I was like, honestly that night, so embarrassed about our booth, and then second off, like kind of upset that they gave us such a\u2026 like literally, I think there were four $25,000 sponsors and all of them had like front row and we were like way in the back, like we got the worst placement of anyone by far, which was kind of annoying.</p> <p>So anyways, the first thing, I was just like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix this somehow,\u201d and Roland Frasier, he\u2019s one of the owners of Digital Marketer, he was like, \u201cIf I was you guys, I\u2019d go rent a big huge TV for that and make your booth look a little more presentable.\u201d</p> <p>So 6:00 o\u2019clock in the morning, the next morning, we called around and we were able to rent out an 80\u201d TV, so we boom! Popped this huge 80\u201d TV and we put like a loop reel of ClickFunnels on the background, and now our booth looked actually pretty dang awesome, to be honest.</p> <p>So that was kind of cool, and then that day I had a chance to speak, and so we were trying to figure out like how in the world, first off, to get as many people into my break out sessions as possible because I\u2019m competing with two other speakers, and I was the first up.</p> <p>And then second was like, how to make this thing memoriable? Memoriable? Memorable. How to make this memorable so people start talking about us and how to create a good buzz, and so the thing first we did is we got a whole bunch of t-shirts that on the front said \u201c#Funnel Hacker\u201d and then on the back had the ClickFunnels logo and it said \u201cPowered by ClickFunnels.\u201d</p> <p>And so we actually ordered 1,200 of those shirts, 500 pounds of them, and had them shipped to the event, and so we had all these shirts there, and so we were handing out shirts and telling everyone, \u201cIf you come to Russell\u2019s session, you get one of these cool Funnel Hacker t-shirts.\u201d</p> <p>You know, the day before or a couple days before, we\u2019d messaged all the ClickFunnels members as well and said, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re going to be in Traffic and Conversion, come help us get people into the booth and if you do, we\u2019ll take you out to dinner.\u201d</p> <p>And that kind of, that like, we didn\u2019t execute that part right. You know, I wanted to base like an affiliate program where they came in, they had coupons and they\u2019d use these coupons to push people into my session.</p> <p>But just the way that -- I kind of didn\u2019t execute that one right -- we only had a couple of people end up doing it. And yeah, so it\u2019s kind of, that part didn\u2019t work as well as we thought.</p> <p>And then like two hours before I was speaking, maybe about three hours before, we were looking at the layout, and like my break out room is really far away from the main stage and like, \u201cHow are we going to get people here?\u201d</p> <p>And one of the guys who was with us, I was like, \u201cMan, I wish we could get some booth babes, some pretty girls to kind of push people in.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get some really quick.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p> <p>So he jumped online, he started calling all of these different like modeling agencies, and I think he called Hooters. He called all these things, trying to find some cute girls to help us push people in, and finally he found some.</p> <p>He found a company that was able to get three girls to us, like in the next half an hour, and so these three girls came. They were beautiful girls, we gave them Funnel Hacks t-shirts, trained them really quick on how to get people into our session.</p> <p>And we had these girls plus about eight of our staff members all pushing people and funneling people into my session, which was cool, and we filled up my entire room. We had no more room, so that was the first step. We got them in there.</p> <p>Then in my presentation, which is the same presentation I normally sell Funnel Hacks from, except for I wasn\u2019t allowed to sell. So basically I did all the build up, all the excitement, and then I had to stop, and so we pushed everyone.</p> <p>We said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s push everybody over to, you know, like in a situation where we can sell them.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, we need as many selling options as possible.\u201d</p> <p>So one thing we did is we had guys in our team with mini laptops, or mini iPads there, and we had this DVD that was a DVD of my Funnel Hacks presentation with a pitch and everything, and basically it said:</p> <p>\u201cHey, if you come back and get a DVD, put your email address in here and register for a webinar, we\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d So basically we got, I don\u2019t know, a couple hundred people registered for a webinar that we\u2019re going to do on Wednesday, selling Funnel Hacks.</p> <p>And so those guys all got into our funnel so I\u2019ll have a chance to sell them there, plus we gave them all these DVDs that if they watched the DVDs, also sells the presentation as well.</p> <p>So trying to like throw this in as many different directions as possible, and so we did that and we gave away a ton of DVDs. We gave away, I think, like 600 or 700 t-shirts during the presentation, which was really cool.</p> <p>And then got a whole bunch of people registered for the webinar as well as giving them these DVDs that is the webinar, so hopefully they\u2019ll watch those as well.</p> <p>So that was kind of the first major attack that we did, which was cool. And then the next day we woke up, and what was cool is that almost everyone was wearing our t-shirts.</p> <p>So now we have like 300 or 400 walking billboards of our company, walking around the whole event, which was really cool. I recommend bringing t-shirts if you\u2019re doing a booth and trying to dominate an area, right?</p> <p>So that was kind of cool. So we had all these billboards walking around, and our booth was in such a crappy location, Brent was able to go and get them to move it to like a prime location right out in front, which was good.</p> <p>And then for the next two days, we just kept funneling people back to the thing, and we were getting people registered for the webinar. We were selling people, we\u2019re signing people up, we were doing all sorts of just crazy cool stuff, and it was really, really fun.</p> <p>And so, our goal going into it is like, we wanted to make so much noise and we wanted to get everyone talking about ClickFunnels and about Funnel Hacking and just stick out like a sore thumb.</p> <p>And I think that if you were to ask anybody at the event, like who was memorable, like will they remember the vendors, definitely it would\u2019ve been us.</p> <p>Everyone else had a booth with like a little bowl of candy out there and that was it. Where we\u2019re out there just doing crazy things and getting people to do stuff, and giving away just crazy gifts and a whole bunch of really cool stuff.</p> <p>So we had a good time with it. It\u2019ll be interesting to see kind of how it pans out financially over the next little while. But, you know, for us the biggest thing we wanted is, you know, for us in this industry, that\u2019s kind of the big event of the year.</p> <p>And it sets the tone for the year, and we wanted to be a part of that message and to be able to kind of launch this year out with everyone talking about ClickFunnels and about Funnel Hacking and about that whole concept.</p> <p>And so, so far it was, you know, from that standpoint it was really good with people; all their Facebook, posting their pictures of, you know, the shirts and stuff, and it was really, really cool. So that was kind of what happened from our side.</p> <p>The event as a whole, people kept asking about it. It was good. I didn\u2019t have a chance to go to all the sessions, but as a whole it was good. I felt like this, this year\u2026 it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019ve been, I think, four years in a row now.</p> <p>In the first year, I really felt that when we went, it was like what they shared was very, very prolific and very different and unique, and which I think is why they initially got the following for this event and why it started growing.</p> <p>The second year they started bringing in more guest speakers, and it kind of diluted it and kind of watered it down.</p> <p>Last year was pretty good as well. They had a really good focus, they were focusing on funnels, they were pushing people through a really cool sales process, and I felt they had a lot of, like prolific things.</p> <p>They introduced the tripwire concept and things like that, whereas this year I was kind of disappointed because I didn\u2019t feel like it had evolved at all. It was kind of just like, \u201cHey, all that stuff we talked about last year? Yeah, you just keep doing that.\u201d</p> <p>And you know, it didn\u2019t really, I mean, they tried, you know, to talk about 2.0 of everything, and they tried to like \u201cand here\u2019s the next step,\u201d but there was nothing really that jumped out to me as like new or prolific or that much different.</p> <p>So that was kind of a little disappointing from that side of it, but as a whole, the networking there was second to none. I saw people there who I hadn\u2019t seen in 10 or 15 years, and it was kind of cool.</p> <p>So I\u2019m at the office now, I got one more story to tell you and then I\u2019ll be done. And this is, you know, I kind of shared with you guys some of the strategies and things we went into this event with, but you know, I\u2019ve never had a company where we did booths before or where we go to events.</p> <p>And so I\u2019m kind of learning this whole thing and how to stick out and how to, you know, acquire customers and things through that kind of a process. And so, you know, I\u2019m still kind of learning it, but we had a guy who was in our inner circle group, man, probably five or six years ago.</p> <p>His name was Big Mike and he was a big booth person. He sells advanced hydroponics -- and so, yeah, take that for what it\u2019s worth. But he does, at least when he was in our group, he was doing like $40 or $50 million a year selling this stuff.</p> <p>And he was kind of like the bad guy in his group and nobody in his market wanted him there. They didn\u2019t want him at their events, they refused to sell him booth space, they refused to sell tickets to him, and so he got really upset by that, so he wanted\u2026</p> <p>Anyway, they were doing this big industry event and he wanted to come and just dominate it, and so he was strategizing this in our mastermind group and then he executed it, and then afterwards came back and shared what he did and it was crazy.</p> <p>And so we were trying to do this in a small part. Obviously, we didn\u2019t do it to this extent of what he did, but what he did was amazing. So what he did, the night before the event, he rented out the venue across the street from where the convention was, and he threw like the biggest party in the industry.</p> <p>He spent, you know, I don\u2019t know, $50,000, $100,000 on the stuff. And he had girls there and all these things, and he brought all these people in and he kind of made a theme for the event.</p> <p>He made these t-shirts of this big huge bowl, and if you could imagine this in your head, the bowl is, you know, taking a big huge drink. The bowl is standing upright, right? And he\u2019s all flexing and huge, and he\u2019s taking a drink of his hydroponics.</p> <p>And then it shows down below, it shows him peeing out into a bucket, and has his competitors, the name of his competitor\u2019s product on the other bucket, and he made these t-shirts like that.</p> <p>And so what he did is he gave everyone at this party all these t-shirts and he said, \u201cHey, tomorrow we\u2019re walking around handing out $1,000 bills to people who are wearing this t-shirt.\u201d And so the next in the entire event, almost every attendee was wearing those t-shirts with the bowl on it.</p> <p>And so he basically, even though they wouldn\u2019t sell him booth space, he had, you know, 2,000 or 3,000 people all wearing that t-shirt the entire week, so he basically was walking billboards on everyone. But then the next part that just like took it to the next level, it\u2019s just ridiculous.</p> <p>He went in and he rented a helicopter and then -- I can\u2019t even like say this without just laughing -- he rented a helicopter and on the back of it he flew this huge banner ad that had that picture of the bowl, drinking it and his competitor, and he had some like headline or something on the thing.</p> <p>And for the three-day event, he had this helicopter just circling on top of the event building for three days, and anyway, that\u2019s like he went and completely seminar hacked this seminar and just went in there and just became the talk of the whole thing.</p> <p>And the campaign, you know, spending a quarter-million dollars on the campaign, but you know, when all is said and done, like everybody knew who he was and everyone was talking about him the entire time.</p> <p>So anyway I thought it was really, really cool, so just think about that when you guys, you know, I was just trying to be -- obviously, you know, this guy was doing everything out of spite so he was able to take it to the next level. You know, I respect Ryan and Perry, and we didn\u2019t want anything that, you know, that they wouldn\u2019t like, so we tried to do everything within the confines.</p> <p>We still wanted to come in and use this as a tool to get new customers and to get our name out there and stuff like that, and so we were trying to be creative and stuff like that.</p> <p>So if you guys ever do booths and things like that, hopefully, it gives you a couple of ideas on how you can dominate it and really maximize it to the end. And so, anyway I hope that helps you guys.</p> <p>I\u2019m in the office now, I\u2019m going to go hang out, get some work done. I got a webinar today, this afternoon. My goal, I think we can do 100,000 on this one, so that\u2019s the goal. If I do that I will be excited, and that\u2019ll take me to the weekend where I can relax a little bit, so that\u2019ll be fun.</p> <p>So anyway, appreciate you guys listening. Hope you love the podcast. If you do, go tell your friends, go post it on Facebook, or do something cool like that. I appreciate it, and we will go from there.</p> <p>Thanks you guys! And we\u2019ll talk soon.</p>", "duration": "14:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_108.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1423673533, "title": "Episode #107 \u2013 What\u2019s Your Level 10 Opportunity?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Things I thought about after talking to Tony Robbins today.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about finding level 10 opportunity after years of having level 10 skills but only level 2 opportunities.

This is Russell Brunson and welcome to a late night\u2026 a very late night Marketing In Your Car. Hey everyone, so I\u2019ve actually just jumped in my car, and I\u2019m heading to the gym to go wrestle because that\u2019s what I want to do all day. If it were up to me, I would go back to when I was in college and just go back to wrestling.</p> <p>But I live in the real world, and unfortunately, it means I have to work and have a business, and all those other fun things -- which I love, which it is not bad.</p> <p>But if it were up to me I\u2019d be wrestling all the time, so when I get an opportunity to wrestle someone I am there. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m at right now, and I\u2019ve got like a 15-20 minute ride to the workout room, so I\u2019ll just hang out with you guys for a little bit. I hope you don\u2019t mind.</p> <p>Today was a super fun day. We\u2019ve been working on a lot of really cool projects and stuff as always. Man, I don\u2019t know if you guys are loving ClickFunnels like I am, but I literally built out our entire seminar funnel inside of ClickFunnels.</p> <p>Yesterday, I built out one for our book launch. My book launch is coming up where I\u2019m giving away my Ferrari. I built out, anyway, like three of four funnels in the last 48-hours.</p> <p>It\u2019s just so exciting and so much fun -- and I love it! It\u2019s like a second, close to wrestling. Let\u2019s just put it there. If ClickFunnels was a sport\u2026 man, it might even beat wrestling, but it\u2019s close. It\u2019s a close call right now. So anyway, it\u2019s a ton of fun.</p> <p>And I had a really cool chance\u2026 Today, I actually had a call with Tony Robbins. Some of you guys, I\u2019m sure, probably saw it. He recently did his big book launch for his MONEY Master the Game book.</p> <p>Which is an amazing book, and we promoted it and everything, and before the book launch, I saw what they were kind of doing and I messaged him. I was like, \u201cHey Tony, do you know there\u2019s some things we can do to help tweak the sales process so it will do better for you?\u201d</p> <p>But he just ran out of time. They were so busy with the launch and with him speaking at, you know, every T.V. station in America for a month or two that the book was rolling out.</p> <p>But he just didn\u2019t have the you know, the bandwidth to be able to make the changes and adjustments he needed to, and because of that their funnel really suffered. You know, obviously, he\u2019s not going to be able to share stats, numbers or anything, but he didn\u2019t do as well as they had hoped.</p> <p>And so, I had to email them a couple days ago basically saying, \u201cHey, now that you kind of done with the whole whirlwind book tour thing, if you\u2019d like, I\u2019d love to give you some feedback on some pretty simple changes you can to your funnel to help things out.\u201d</p> <p>He emailed me back and said let\u2019s talk Tuesday at 4:30, and it was kind of fun. So I had a chance to talk to him and just talk about his funnel and his goals.</p> <p>One thing that I can say that was just really, really cool from my phone conversation, you know, we talk a lot in business about staying focused and having like one goal and one thing you\u2019re working towards and being very myopic on that.</p> <p>And it\u2019s been interesting -- I\u2019ve watched over my 10-year career here in this business, it\u2019s 12 years now. Wow.</p> <p>Anyway, every time that I focus on one project and we start making a whole bunch of money, and as soon as I start making a bunch of money, my first tendency is to go and start doing like 30 different projects, and once I do that my whole business collapses.</p> <p>And then I get back, and then I have to cut everything and focus on one thing, and it grows again, and then I get excited and I start doing it.</p> <p>You know, I talked earlier on a podcast about cycling, and that\u2019s one of the main reasons why I\u2019ve cycled a couple times is because of that.</p> <p>And it was interesting because when I first talked to Tony, I assumed that he wrote the book because he wanted to open up, you know, a back-end financial division and all these things and he kind of indirectly did.</p> <p>If you read the book, you\u2019ll kind of see kind of what he did. But it was interesting talking to him because the whole time he kept bringing it back to like what his core message is and his core focus and his reason why he\u2019s here on earth.</p> <p>It was really interesting. He talked about, you know, bringing these financial buyers is like\u2026\u201cBut we don\u2019t have a financial back-end.\u201d he's like, \u201cI don\u2019t have a desire to build one.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s said, \u201cMy only goal, my only focus, my life\u2019s mission is to change people\u2019s lives through, you know, my personal development stuff.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cAnd I want to get people over to that.\u201d</p> <p>And I thought: Man, how powerful is that, that someone who spends four years writing a book, going on a mission to change this piece of the world, even though he did that to fill a personal mission?</p> <p>Like his only goal for that still is to come back to his core -- his core focus. And that was just a real big lesson to me about, you know, having your one thing that you\u2019re passionate about and you want to be best in the world at, and focusing all efforts there.</p> <p>You know, it\u2019s been interesting, since we did launch ClickFunnels, I\u2019m thinking a lot about that just because, you know, we\u2019ve been trying to grow that and making it the best it possibly can be.</p> <p>And as lot of you guys know, I have my hands in a lot of different projects and opportunities and things like that, and it has been always tough for me over the last, you know, however many years of my career to focus on like, on a great opportunity because there\u2019s so many good ones, right?</p> <p>For example, a lot of you guys know about my supplement that\u2019s doing\u2026 you know, it\u2019s still doing great. But the problem is, I\u2019m not focusing on it. Like it\u2019s sad, you know, like I shared numbers in the webinar to get people excited.</p> <p>Those numbers are actually really low, from what should be happening. Like that\u2019s something that should be at two or three million dollars a month. Like if I was to focus 100 percent of my effort on that, it would be there in a very, very finite short period of time.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not my passion, it\u2019s not my focus, it\u2019s not my thing, and so in spite of myself -- just the fact that it\u2019s there -- it\u2019s doing anywhere from $250 to $500 to $600.</p> <p>I think our swing, between like the high months and the low months, by $250,000 up to $600,000 a month, just consistently, without me doing really much of anything. Because I have no focus or effort there, it just kind of sits there and doesn\u2019t really do much.</p> <p>And so, for me, I\u2019m looking at trying like how can we sell this? And I\u2019ve been grateful that one of my friends and one of the guys in my mastermind group is looking at purchasing it right now.</p> <p>Which I think it can be a huge deal. A great deal for him and a great deal for me because he\u2019ll be able to have it, and actually put 100 percent focus on it, and give it the care that it needs and to be able to grow it. And it gives me the ability to start, you know, to take one more distraction away from me, so I can focus more on my core message.</p> <p>I also look at like our DotComSecrets Company. You know, for years my business model was: We need to create new offers. You know, just to create new offers to make more money, right?</p> <p>Like what\u2019s something cool people will buy? Okay, let\u2019s create this and create this, and we created some cool stuff.</p> <p>But it\u2019s been interesting. As I\u2019ve come back and look at how we transitioned that company, how we\u2019re continuing to transition (and you guys will see that more and more throughout this year), that the DotComSecrets Company, the only goal of it is not so much to create new products and sell more stuff.</p> <p>We\u2019ll do that, but the reason why that\u2019s happening: You\u2019ll see everything that we\u2019re creating is very strategic to get people into ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is my Level 10 opportunity, right? It\u2019s the thing I want to focus on, and the thing that I want to dedicate my life to.</p> <p>You know, we\u2019ve had people already ask us like, \u201cWell, you know, are you going to sell it? How much are you going to sell it for?\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s been the funniest thing because any other business I\u2019ve ever had if people asked me how much I\u2019d sell it for, I\u2019ve always had a number, instantly, in my head and with this one I don\u2019t.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny like\u2026 I would almost rather do anything than sell it. Like people\u2026 I don\u2019t know like, it\u2019s just so exciting for me that I literally want to be doing this in the next 10, 15, 20 years. I\u2019ve never had a business where I can see myself doing it in 20 or 30 years, but I can with this one.</p> <p>That\u2019s how passionate, how excited I am. And so, when people talk about selling it, it\u2019s just like so far from my mind like it makes me sick to my stomach. Because I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a number that I would say\u2026</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there would be a number I would say yes to, but if I did I think I\u2019d always -- you know, I have so much I want to do with it, in so many cool directions and things we\u2019re going to be doing -- and so, anyway, it\u2019s just kind of interesting,</p> <p>Another really cool thing that I kind of think about, it\u2019s kind of related, but I\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019s brilliant, one of the smartest marketers I\u2019ve ever met. His name is Bill Harrison, and if you get to know him, him and his brother -- Brad and Bill -- they run a publicity company and it\u2019s really cool.</p> <p>About two years ago, actually, I was at Traffic Conversion with Bill Harrison, and we were talking about opportunities, and he was talking about him, and it was interesting, if you look at him, he\u2019s one of, like I said, one of the most amazing marketers I\u2019ve ever met.</p> <p>If you go to his house\u2026 I haven\u2019t been in his house, but I\u2019ve seen pictures of it where, literally, every room in his house is covered from the floor to the ceiling in marketing and sales books, and it\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>He\u2019s actually been sending me like boxes of books as gifts, just randomly, because he\u2019s got too many books that his house, literally, cannot fit them all. It\u2019s not like a library or a room. It\u2019s the entire the entire house is covered with them, and he knows marketing probably better than anyone on earth.</p> <p>And I was talking to him, and he said, \u201cYou know, it kind of drives me crazy. I have these friends who are horrible marketers, but they step into a Level 10 opportunity and their Level 2 skills.</p> <p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re a Level 10 opportunity, you know, some of these guys have sold their companies for hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d and he says, \u201cYou know, me, our company is doing well.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re doing $10- or $15-million a year, but he\u2019s like, \u201cI felt like I have a Level 10 skill set, but I\u2019m stuck in a Level 2 opportunity.</p> <p>And I remember when he said that I started looking again at myself, looking internal. I thought, you know, I feel kind of like the same way. Like I\u2019m in a Level 2 opportunity, with all my little things out here, and nothing for me was like that thing that was passion -- that drove me.</p> <p>You know, I was dabbling in a lot of things that I really loved and I cared about, but there wasn\u2019t anything that was really like my driving force. And I look at ClickFunnels as like something where I can take my Level 10 skills and apply it to a Level 10 opportunity and so for me it\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>So, anyway, I just wanted you guy thinking about that a little bit today. You know, it really impressed me when I was talking to Tony, just hearing him just keep pushing things back to that, and maybe kind of re-remember my focus and my goals in my company, in my business.</p> <p>And everything is to push people back to my core opportunity, and I just want to encourage you guys, as well, to think about that strategically, and don\u2019t just put out things to put out things, but think about like what\u2019s your mission in life?</p> <p>You know, think about what\u2019s Tony Robbins\u2019 mission? We know that, right? We\u2019ve seen it. We\u2019ve seen him changing millions and millions of people\u2019s lives around the world. Like that\u2019s his mission.</p> <p>My mission is to help people to build sales funnels and to take their message out to the world, and be able to do it in a way that they can be profitable. You know, what\u2019s your mission? What\u2019s the thing you were put on earth here to do in your business? Because I promise you guys that you can change people\u2019s lives, and you\u2019ll be able to change a lot more people\u2019s lives if you\u2019re focused 100 percent on that thing.</p> <p>So, anyway, that\u2019s about it for tonight, you guys. I am almost to the gym. I\u2019m excited to go wrestle and\u2026 this is cool. So I appreciate you guys all listening.</p> <p>It\u2019s fun having someone who listens to my random thoughts. I get messages on Facebook, randomly, from you guys all the time. Tell me you listen to the podcast. It just makes me happy.</p> <p>So keep on listening. Share it with your friends if you like it, and outside of that, I appreciate you guys for listening, and we will talk soon.</p>", "duration": "11:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_107.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1423161652, "title": "Episode #106 \u2013 You\u2019re Not Cooler Than You Think You Are", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Until you\u2019ve cycled at least once, I can\u2019t be your business partner.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about why successful people aren\u2019t as cool as they think they are.

I was thinking a lot. I actually did a podcast last night but we're going to do another one because I just want to talk about something that I think is very important for everyone to hear, especially me, especially pretty much everyone.</p> <p>The moral of this podcast, I\u2019ll tell you the moral first and then we'll dig into the actual nuts and bolts behind it. The moral of the story is you are not as cool as you think. It's funny, in the world that we live in, the world that I'm in, it's amazing to me how impressed people are with themselves. It drives me insane.</p> <p>I don't know what it is but when people have a little bit of success, they just become super impressed with themselves, and rightfully so but there comes a time I think in most entrepreneurs' lives where you realize that you're not as cool as you think you are. The sooner that happens for you, the better.</p> <p>If it hasn't happened for you yet, I want to give you the blessing of letting you know that you're not as cool as you think. I remember when I first got started in this business, and things started happening and started making money, man, I thought I was the coolest thing in the world. I was unstoppable. I started making stupid decisions because I thought I was invincible, and grew my company really, really quick, and then lost it all because of stupid decisions.</p> <p>You think after almost losing it all once, I would have been a little bit smarter, but no, instead, I got a little more success again, things came back, and the second time I built it twice as big. We had 100 employees and I was so impressed with myself. I was so awesome. I loved telling people how many employees I had.</p> <p>Then guess what happened? I made some more stupid decisions, and I lost it all again. I remember for a long time being really depressed about that. Then one time, I was in Mexico hanging out with some really cool marketers. There was this guy named Robert Hirsch. We were talking about our businesses, our careers, and our paths.</p> <p>I was telling him about my two ups and downs in my business so far. He goes, \u201cOh good, you've cycled twice.\u201d I go, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He's like, \u201cYeah, you've cycled twice. I refuse to work with entrepreneurs who haven't cycled at least once.\u201d I'm like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>He's like, \u201cEvery business has these ups and downs. When you have your first up, you think you're invincible and you drink your own Kool-Aid and you believe it.\u201d He said, \u201cI refuse to work with entrepreneurs that way because they still believe they're cooler than they are. They don't understand that there are so many things external from them that make them successful, and it's not themselves. They're not as cool as they think they are.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cThe fact that you've cycled twice means that you hopefully have learned from the second time and the first time, and hopefully you don't think you're as cool as you think you are.\u201d I remember when he said that, I was like, \u201cYou know what? That's pretty powerful.\u201d</p> <p>I think it's important to understand that. I've tried. Again, I'm not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but I've tried since my last cycle to be a lot more humble and to realize that it's not me. It's people around me. It's our customers. It's all these amazing things. I take it way more, I don't take it for granted. I'm a lot more appreciative.</p> <p>I try to be careful when I make decisions now, and things like that. That concept has reared its head this week on the whole marketer's cruise. Before we went on the cruise, supposedly, I didn't even know this, but some guy messaged Brent on my team and said, \u201cHey, I'm going to be on the marketer's cruise. I\u2019d love to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>Brent is like, \u201cCool, yeah, come find us, we'd love to meet you too.\u201d That's where it left off. We're on this cruise, 700 other marketers mind you, plus 1300 guests, so 2000 people here. I first off didn't know who the guy was, didn't know he was supposed to meet us. Brent has messaged him on Facebook for 30 seconds maybe, didn't know his name or picture, just some guy.</p> <p>I probably got at least 15 to 20 people before the cruise who said, \u201cHey, I want to meet you.\u201d I'm like, \u201cAlright, I'm there, come find me.\u201d Supposedly, this guy was pissed off and upset because I didn't come and find him. Again, I have no idea who he is from Adam yet he obviously knows who I am.</p> <p>Anyway, the last night I guess, he bumps into Todd, one of my partners in Click Funnels and was all yelling at him and pissed about the fact that we've been ignoring him. Todd is like, \u201cI don't even know who you are. Who in the world are you?\u201d so Todd tries to calm him down and everything.</p> <p>I guess when all was said and done, all he really wanted was an affiliate link. Todd was like, \u201cOkay, we'll get you an affiliate link.\u201d Yesterday, this guy Facebooks Brent, yelling at him about how we all ignored him, how rude we were, and all this stuff. We're like, \u201cWe don't even know who you are. We were there every night talking. You know who we are. We had no idea who you are. Why wouldn't you come up and talk to us?\u201d</p> <p>He comes back and he's like, \u201cNo, it was not that you guys didn't know who I was. You were purposely ignoring me. I'm so big, I got this and this. I'm so famous, blah, blah,\u201d all this stuff. It was so weird. I remember thinking back and saying, \u201cWow, this guy, because his ego is so big, because he thinks he's cooler than he is and because he believes that, he just missed out on some amazing opportunities.</p> <p>Had he come up to me and said, \u201cHey Russell, I'm so-and-so. I messaged Brent. I\u2019d love to meet you,\u201d I probably would have hit it off and become good friends. I remember in the guy's Facebook message, he's also pissed because I did meet a really cool guy. There was this guy who runs a karate thing back east. His name is Jeff.</p> <p>We hit it off. He's a jiu jitsu guy. I'm a wrestler. We actually wrestled twice. We went to the yoga room on a hardwood floor, laid out some yoga mats, and wrestled twice. I still have bruises on my knees and bruises on my neck from choking me out because we had so much fun, and hit it off with this guy.</p> <p>Man, I love this guy, I love his family, I love everything about him. We're trying to help him and serve him, and how we can take his business and him to the next level. We're doing everything we can now to serve him because he didn't think he was cooler than he is. He's just a cool guy who got to know us at a personal level, and we got to know him, and had a great time with him.</p> <p>Because of that, the relationship he's built, I would be shocked if the relationship we have with him now, if he doesn't make millions of dollars in the next couple of years from that. It wasn't because again, he was saying, \u201cOh, do you know who I am? I'm the biggest karate guy in the east.\u201d He didn't do any of that. It was just because he was a cool guy.</p> <p>It was just a reminder to me. I think about the people I deal with in business and I think about myself. I think about other people, and I just want to make sure everyone knows that you're not as cool as you think you are. This stuff is happening, these are blessings that have been given to us. Don't take those things for granted. Be grateful for them.</p> <p>Never think that you're too big to talk to someone. Never think that people should acknowledge you and know who you are. It was funny, on the cruise, every person I met, I tried to introduce myself and say who I was because some people, it was funny, you see some people who are just like, \u201cOh, you don't know who I am?\u201d and they walk away.</p> <p>For me, I don't assume that people know who I am. I assume that they don't and I try to get to know them. It's just a better way to live. My encouragement for today, you guys, is understand first off that you're not cooler than you are. You probably are pretty cool but just remember that all entrepreneurs cycle.</p> <p>If you haven't cycled yet, you're going to. If you're dumb like me, you'll cycle twice, and hopefully it doesn't happen to me a third time but I'm sure it might. I just want to be humble enough to accept it when it comes, and to dust myself off, get back up, and make sure I take care of other people around me so that when we go for the next round, the next cycle, the people that I love and care about are still there.</p> <p>I hope that helps you guys. I hope you have an awesome day today. Go inspire people. Go change the world in your way, and see how you can serve people. If you do that, everything you want and need in life will come back to you. Thanks again, you guys. We'll talk to you on the next Marketing in Your Car.</p>", "duration": "08:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_106.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1423160771, "title": "Episode #105 \u2013 #FunnelHacker", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Three awesome lessons from a hardcore funnel hacker!</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about an upcoming event called the Funnel Hacking Event and what kinds of things will happen at the event.

I got some feedback from my man Stu McLaren. He said that he misses the old theme song as an outro, so I was thinking wouldn't it be cool if we took the old theme song and made it more retro and cool, and did a cover version of it, and had that as an exit, just for nostalgia for those who remember the old show, who remember the old thing.</p> <p>I want to say hey to everyone. It's been a little while since I've done a podcast. I had a chance to go on the Marketer's Cruise last week which was amazing, got to meet a bunch of people. We had a chance to go and feature Click Funnels there and get a lot of people involved. It was just really cool.</p> <p>For those of you guys who were there, I had a great time meeting you guys. I'm not really sure. There are a couple of cool things we had talked about today. I'm actually driving to my haircut so I have a little extra time today than I typically do. I was trying to think what would be the coolest way that I could serve you guys today.</p> <p>Just thinking about a lot of different things, I think, let me walk you through some cool stuff that's happening. That might help open up some cool direction. We've got a couple of cool things coming up. One thing is I just finished my new book. We got it printed. I got first pre-release copies here in my office.</p> <p>I ordered 250 of them so I have 250 of them sitting in my office. It's like the coolest thing in the world to have that and to be able to have a chance to start sharing it with everyone. I want to encourage you guys to watch as we do the roll-out strategy. There's going to be about 10 years worth of ninja hacking skills all going into this roll-out.</p> <p>The entire sales funnel will be built inside of Click Funnel. It's going to be worth buying, first off, because the book is going to be amazing, but second off, just to see the process. I've told you guys this before and I\u2019ll tell you over and over again. You'll learn as much by watching the process as you will from purchasing the product.</p> <p>Make sure you do that. In fact, when you're buying any product, you guys, make sure you're not missing that lesson from me or from any marketer in any market. Watch the process you're going through. I tell you, that's the most valuable piece of what we're going to be doing. That's one thing that's super exciting.</p> <p>We also are going to be doing our first big live event in the last few years. It's been probably five or six years. We're going to be doing it in Vegas. We're going to have about 500 people there, and the event is going to be called Funnel Hacking. I'm excited because hopefully you guys have a chance to have seen the Funnel Hacks webinar.</p> <p>If not, go find one when I'm doing the next one and register for it, and be on it because it's kind of cool. Our last event here in Boise, we had our workshop here. It's cool because funnel hacking is becoming a verb in people's vocabulary, \u201cOh, I'm going to go funnel hack him,\u201d or, \u201cOh, you should funnel hack him.\u201d</p> <p>That's good. I want people thinking that way. Instead of, \u201cOh, what should I create? What kind of funnel should I do?\u201d thinking like that, I want people thinking more like the funnel hacking method where it's like, \u201cLet me find someone that's successful, see what they're doing, and let's model the look, the feel, the layout, and the price points of their funnel.\u201d</p> <p>That's kind of what funnel hacking is. We talk about it a ton in the webinar. That's been fun. We decided to do the entire event called Funnel Hacking. This event is really cool because I wanted to show the core different types of funnels inside of Click Funnels.</p> <p>For example, Perry Belcher who is one of the coolest guys is going to be coming and speaking on how to do a tripwire funnel. He's the one who invented that term and that concept. He's going to show and talk about what he's doing and show a bunch of examples.</p> <p>After that, we're going to have a bunch of different people inside of Click Funnel who have tripwire funnels get up and show their funnels and be like, \u201cThis is mine, this is what I did, this is how I modeled. This is what I did different, this is what I did the same,\u201d and then go through and show five or six, or ten people who do tripwire funnels.</p> <p>Then we'll get up and talk about webinar funnels. We'll have five, 10, 15, 20 people, whatever, all talk about tripwire funnels. We'll go from funnel to funnel over two and a half days. It's going to be the coolest thing. I'm so excited to share this stuff with you guys.</p> <p>One of my goals, I'm not sure if it's going to happen in time for the event but I'm hoping, I know a lot of you guys have seen our split testing book. If you don't have it yet, it's free. Go to <a href=\"http://www.DotComSecretsLabs.com/\">DotComSecretsLabs.com</a>. You can get it for free but it has 108 proven split test winners in that book.</p> <p>I think it would be cool to make a book that's like 108 funnels that you can hack. I'm trying. My goal is to get it all put together before the event, and then anyone who is at the event will get a free copy of it which would be cool. That is just another cool thing we're doing.</p> <p>On top of that, obviously Click Funnels is growing super fast. It's been such a fun time in business. I hope you guys are enjoying your businesses as well with that. I think the biggest thing I want to talk about today with you guys, outside of you guys doing funnel hacking and things like that, is just the power of the right front end offer.</p> <p>I've talked about this in past podcasts. I know some of you guys are just listening now for the first time. Some of you haven't listened to all 105 episodes. It's a recurring theme that keeps coming up with my coaching clients. I think it's worth repeating.</p> <p>If you look at my business two years ago, it's funny, I don't like sharing numbers. I'm not doing this to brag but just to put some perspective. A year ago, last January, as a company we did about $300,000 in sales. This January, we did over a million dollars in sales, more than three times as much.</p> <p>We didn't do much. I didn't launch anything in January this month. It was just from all the different things we had done. When I look back at what's the one big change we made over the last 12 months that's had the biggest profound impact on our company and on what we've been doing, it's that I really stepped back and I asked myself a couple of questions.</p> <p>First off, I was looking at who we were attracting at the time, who our customers were, and for me, they were business opportunity seekers. There's nothing wrong with a business opportunity seeker. I was a business opportunity seeker. I'm guessing most of you have been as well.</p> <p>The problem with the business opportunity seekers is typically, they don't have a business yet. They don't have anything so you spend so much time in the beginning phases that you don't get to get to the growth phases. I was talking to Mike Filsaime about this. He was talking about when he and Andy launched their new company.</p> <p>He said they walked in the room and had a big whiteboard. They drew a line down the middle of the whiteboard. On the left-hand side, they drew a zero. On the right-hand side, they drew a one. He said, \u201cWe want to create products and services that will attract people who have made at least a dollar online.\u201d</p> <p>If they've made at least a dollar online, it means they've figured out how to set up a website, how to get traffic, how to do all these kind of things. He said, \u201cThere's people out there. There's a big market for people who are helping you make your first dollar online but we don't want to be in that market. We want to focus on the other side of the market which is you've made at least a dollar, and now how do we scale that and turn it into a big company.\u201d</p> <p>He even talked about when they launched the Webinar Jam product, initially, the messaging was all about how much money you could make with webinars. He said, \u201cIf we do that, if we try to pitch the argument for webinars, the problem is we get people who are business opportunity seekers. We're convincing them that they can make money online with webinars. That's not what we want. We want people who are already doing webinars to get them to just transition to our products.\u201d</p> <p>They changed the messaging from how to make money with webinars to, \u201cHey, if you're already doing webinars, this is a better way to do them.\u201d From that, they attracted the right customers. With us, it was about a year ago we launched Dot Com Secrets Labs which was our 108 proven split test winners. What's cool if you think about it, we designed that on purpose because if you look at that, it was created in a way so it would literally repel the customers we didn't want to get.</p> <p>Someone who is a business opportunity seeker, who has never had a website, who doesn't have anything, when they see that book, it doesn't make sense to them. They're not going to buy that. They don't know what a split test is. They don't know why they even care but for my dream client, for the person that I really want into my company, it attracts the right person, someone who already has a business.</p> <p>A split testing book attracts the right person. Look back over the last year. What did we do? I didn't work harder this January and last January. In fact, I worked a lot less this January yet we made over a million dollars this January as opposed to $300,000 last. What was the big difference?</p> <p>Again, it was first off, really identifying and spending time figuring out who is my dream customer, what do they look like, what do they want, what are their desires. Then after I knew who that person was, I didn't mean just know them, \u201cOh, I want males from 13 to 26,\u201d that wasn't how I knew them.</p> <p>It was I got to know them at a personal level. Who are they? What do they really want? Then after I knew that and I had a really good understanding of who my dream clients were, then we came back and figured out what's the bait we can create that's going to attract that person.</p> <p>For us, Dot Com Secrets Labs was the bait that attracted the right person. People always say, \u201cHave you made much money on that, Russell?\u201d I'm like, \u201cYeah, we have. We've made a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>I look at our coaching program. Before DCS Labs, it was very small, almost nonexistent. After we launched it, we've added over 100, probably 130, 140 people at our Ignite level, which is $10,000, and I think we're at 36 people now in our $25,000, and we have two people in our $100,000 program.</p> <p>It's attracted millions of dollars in revenue, but more so, it attracted the right people, people I love working with, people that I give my coaching clients access to Voxer with me, and we Vox back and forth throughout the day. There are people that are just doing things that are so cool. It's so fun to hear what they're doing. It's made my happiness level different.</p> <p>I've been able to work with clients I love, and because of that, we've made more money, and they've made more money. I just look at for you guys, if one thing that you can think about, I mentioned this on another podcast but it's not thought about or talked about enough but it's really spending that time to figure out who your dream client is, and creating bait that's going to attract them.</p> <p>One of my students has a webinar right now. He's been doing really well with it but he's attracting business opportunity people. He's like, \u201cDo I need to change the whole thing?\u201d I'm like, \u201cNo, you just got to change how you pitch the front. Change the bait on the front that will attract a different person.\u201d</p> <p>The product will still help either person but if you change the bait, you change the messaging on the front, you'll get different people in. That's just something to think about. All you guys out there marketing and selling things, you're trying to make things better and easier, and I can't tell you enough that the biggest change for me in our company over the last year has been that.</p> <p>I hope that helps a little bit. I'm here to get my haircut now. I'm ready to rock and roll. My big three takeaways I think from today, number one is you need to learn more by watching the process. Again, when you guys buy my book, watch the process and see what I'm doing, not just what I'm saying. Follow the process.</p> <p>Number two is funnel hacking. First off, everyone needs to start saying funnel hacking. In fact, if you guys are going to Traffic Conversion Summit, we're giving away t-shirts that say #funnelhacker on the front, and the back has a big Click Funnels logo and says, \u201cPowered by Click Funnels.\u201d It's super cool, all grungy looking and awesome.</p> <p>We're trying to get everyone to become a funnel hacker. Funnel hacking is cool. Become a funnel hacker. Go watch the webinar if you missed it. Come to the live event when we do announce it here in the next couple of weeks, and become a funnel hacker.</p> <p>Then what was the last thing?

Hopefully it will help you all a little bit on stuff you're working on. Notice I said ya'll. I've been hanging out with too many friends from Georgia, from Texas, and they're getting me to say words like ya'll. Anyway, I apologize about that.</p> <p>I don't know how this is going to relate to any of you guys but hopefully for the right person, for someone, this message is a big thing. I had a friend. I'm not going to tell any names or anything because it's not important but he had a partner in a project. The project went sour. Because of that, he locked the partner out, thinking whatever, but he changed passwords and locked this partner out of his business.</p> <p>That was three years ago or so. I just saw him recently and asked how things were going. He said that basically for the last three years, he's been in a lawsuit and almost on the brink of bankruptcy and lost everything, and all that. I was kind of telling the guys at work with me about that, and just we were talking about how lucky we've been that we haven't had anything like that happen yet.</p> <p>I was thinking, \u201cWhy hasn't something like that happened to me before in the past?\u201d and things like that. One of the guys who works with me said, he just made a comment, he said, \u201cIf you think about it, the reason is you just always treat people good, Russell. You don't screw people over. If something bad happens, you're the first one to walk away and let it be.\u201d</p> <p>I thought about that little. I thought, \u201cYou know, it's interesting, but it really is true.\u201d I told partners this in the past. I don\u2019t think they believe me at first but it's true. People always want a contract. I'm like, the only times I've ever been screwed over in business is when people, every time, it's been by the person who wanted a contract. It's really weird.</p> <p>I don't know what it is. Mostly, I just work with a handshake. I always tell people, \u201cLook, this is the deal. We're going to work together. If something bad happens, I'm just going to walk away from it because I don't really care. I\u2019ll just give it all back to you.\u201d People don't really believe me.</p> <p>That actually happened earlier this year. We had a project that when all was said and done, we invested about $50,000 in it, never could get this thing to work, and I just gave it back to the person and said, \u201cYou know what? I've tried all I can do. I spent a lot of money. Hopefully this helps you. I'm just going to give the whole thing back to you.\u201d</p> <p>It was interesting because, this may be a bad example, but the person we were working with got all upset at me. I said, \u201cWhy are you upset?\u201d She was like, \u201cNo, we were supposed to be partners.\u201d I said, \u201cI know, but we spent $50,000, I redid your site and your sales funnel, everything, and I just can't get it to really work so I'm going to give it back to you as a gift.\u201d</p> <p>It was funny because she kept trying to attack me like I was trying to do something bad to her. I'm like, \u201cNo, I'm really just giving this back to you. There's no strings attached. I'm not going to charge you any money. I'm going to pay all the taxes, the accountants to close out the books. I'll just cover it. I'm just giving it back to you.\u201d</p> <p>I don't think she ever believed me. I was trying to transfer the site over and she's getting all upset. When I'm trying to transfer the site back over, I'm like, \u201cNo, you don't understand, my entire team is here to help you. We're trying to give this back to you and help you.\u201d I think it was so backwards because most people, they think that people always assume you're trying to screw them over.</p> <p>I try to be the opposite way. I'm like, \u201cI'm just going to, worst case scenario, I\u2019ll just give everything back to you and hopefully left you off in a lot better place than I met you.\u201d I think that all of us need to think about that more, especially if we have partners. I know in the internet business, we always have loose partnerships we throw around all the time.</p> <p>I look back over the years, people, in fact recently, it's kind of funny with Click Funnels, we had a partner who was involved and the person totally, totally screwed me over. It was funny because I remember when I got the Skype message, or I can't remember if it was Skype or Voxer, the person basically told me, \u201cHey man, sorry,\u201d it wasn't this many words, but it almost was.</p> <p>It was, \u201cHey, I'm totally screwing you over, sorry, but this is just how it is.\u201d I was like, \u201cHuh.\u201d I remember being so upset and so angry, wanting to go and backlash, and yell at the person, and do what my other friend had done, lock this person out of everything but I thought, \u201cYou know what? I'm just going to let it be.\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cAlright, that sucks but whatever,\u201d and just ignored it, and left it as it was, and kept going on with my day. Three weeks later, the person came back, apologized, and ended up becoming our number one affiliate by far, and also introduced us to about 20 other people. I would say indirectly from that relationship, we've brought in almost a million dollars and over this year, it will probably be two to three million dollars.</p> <p>If I would have blown up and yelled at that person when they screwed me over, none of that money or income or anything would have been there. I'm just a big believer, not that you need to let people screw you over but if they do, don't burn that bridge because you never know when you're going to need it again. I have a lot of people in the past that bad things have happened.</p> <p>I'm not going to say I'm perfect. I've had times where I've screwed up and I've burnt bridges but the ones that I haven't, multiple times, they've come back and turned into huge things later on. Again, I don't know if or who this is going to help but if you've got partners, if you're working with people, give them the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>If something bad happens, be forgiving. Let them off the hook. Do whatever you can, because I tell you what, having somebody burn you and you walk away from is way better than the opposite where you spend the next three years in court, and issues and headaches, and all sorts of problems that come from it. Like I said, I would say 50% of the time that someone has done something bad to me and I didn't do much, and I just let it roll off, because that's how I approached it, later on, it came back tenfold to me.</p> <p>Just some thoughts, I hope that helps someone who is out there listening. Again, I'm not saying I'm perfect. I've screwed up. I've offended people more times than I ever want to admit but I hope just that thought, I'm hoping that one of you guys, someone out there listening to this who has a decision right now is going to make the right decision and just make your life and the other person's life a million times better.</p> <p>I promise it will come back to you in a positive way. That's what I got. I'm at home and I'm going to go play with the kids, have some fun. I appreciate you guys, and thanks for listening.</p>", "duration": "06:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_104.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1421172916, "title": "Episode #103 \u2013 Calling My Shot", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How we did $23,000 dollars in sales in front of a live audience.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how when you do a live event you need to do cool stuff because people love it.

Did Russell do the live webinar? Did it convert? Were there technical problems? What happened? Anyway, I'm going to tell you guys the story.</p> <p>We started the event yesterday. It was really cool. It's funny, when I used to do my events back in the day, I would try to jam in every single thing I knew for two or three days, and people would get so overwhelmed, they wouldn't do anything. This event has been very focused on just one thing and digging really deep into it, and not just having training, training, training but trying to pull in other cool things outside of that to help facilitate, teach, and coach.</p> <p>It's been a fun process. We started out the day with me on stage talking about stuff. I didn't go in a lot of depth about the perfect webinar script because everyone had seen that but I went in depth about how to create the offer, how to do the content section, and things like that. We dug really deep there.</p> <p>They had some exercises which people got to create their offer, things like that, and then create their content pieces, the one thing in the three secrets. That was cool. Then after that, I had Liz Benny who is one of our webinar case studies who is crushing her webinar right now, she came on stage and we brought a couch up, and I just did a Q&amp;A with her and asked her questions about her webinar.</p> <p>People loved that. It was so cool. We spent almost an hour of her talking about it and her experience, the ups and the downs, and all the stuff that happened. I think it gave people a lot of hope and faith as they've been struggling and trying to get theirs done which was cool.</p> <p>Then after that, I did a presentation on how to pitch because a lot of people can follow the script well but then they can't get up and actually present it well, so I'm teaching how to do tonality and voice inflections, and trial closes, and all these important things. Then we went to lunch. While everyone was at lunch, I got my laptop set up and we hard lined it into the event center.</p> <p>I was so scared that the internet was going to crash or a million different problems. I had a webinar. We had about 1200 people registered for it. It was starting at two o'clock mountain time. We were going through it and I told everyone at two o'clock, come into the room. You got to be quiet because I'm starting live.</p> <p>If you guys want, you can just watch me and learn from the way, seeing me actually do it. They're all coming in. We're getting ready. I was going to start 10 minutes early and get on there and start welcoming people, but 10 minutes early, I did one quick run through of my slides and it turns out none of my video files of my slides were working.</p> <p>I'm scrambling, trying to get it to work, trying to get it to work and none of them were working. We had one minute before the webinar was supposed to start and they\u2019re still not working. I'm like, \u201cOh man.\u201d I throw out all the slides. I deleted all the slides of the video stuff, found the video files, and it was crazy.</p> <p>Then it's top of the hour, supposed to be starting. I told everyone, \u201cOkay, everyone, quiet, time to calm down.\u201d I think we had 200 people or so on at the time, \u201cAlright guys, here we go.\u201d I clicked start and clicked record, and started going through the presentation. At first, it was super nerve-wracking because literally, there were 80 people in our event that sat in watching me.</p> <p>I'm sitting there on a laptop, standing up in the room in front of the laptop giving this presentation. It was super awkward. I was telling people afterward, \u201cI felt like I was on a date with a girl, and I just took her home and was going to kiss her for the first time at the doorstep, and her parents are standing out there watching me, just staring at me as I'm doing it.\u201d That's what it felt like.</p> <p>How do you do this? How do you perform under this kind of pressure? After about 10 or 15 minutes, I just got in the zone and totally forgot about everything else, did the webinar presentation, did the pitch, and it ended up going for an hour and 15 minutes, the whole thing.</p> <p>When it got done, I did my call to actions. Then I muted myself. When I muted myself, I popped out of state. I turned around and the entire room was standing and gave me a huge standing ovation. They kept clapping for two or three minutes. I literally fell exhausted down onto the couch. I was like, \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>They sat there clapping and clapping. Then I was like, \u201cAlright guys, let's take a 20 or 30, or an hour long, I don't know, let's just take a break for awhile. I'm beat.\u201d We split up. It was so cool. I got so much good feedback afterwards, people that came back and they were just like, \u201cWow, I've been on webinars. I've tried listening to you teach about it but seeing it actually live and seeing how you do it, seeing all that kind of stuff took it to a whole new level and changed the whole paradigm.\u201d</p> <p>It was cool. I felt good about it. I think they all loved it. When all was said and done, we did $23,000 in sales from that webinar. That was my other big fear, \u201cWhat if nobody buys and I look like I don't know what I'm talking about in front of everyone?\u201d I was grateful I did $23,000 in sales, and then from that process, we had 140, from the little campaign, we had 140 people join Click Funnels, the trial.</p> <p>Those all re-bill at another $14,000 a month recurring which is awesome. When all was said and done, it was a smashing success. It worked. After that, I did another presentation where I went back through my slides and walked everyone through some of the core things that I did that I wanted to make sure they didn't miss because there's some really cool ninja stuff that we're doing. That was fun.</p> <p>Then we brought up Natasha Hazlett who is another one of our people who is just crushing it with webinars and live events, and had her tell her whole story about what she's doing and how she's doing it. People loved that as well. After that, I was beat. I said, \u201cEveryone, I had another session planned but let's just go home and get a nap,\u201d so we broke and everyone went out and networked, and had a good time.</p> <p>The day was exciting. It was awesome. We had a fun time. That was yesterday. I'm driving in for today now. Today's event, we are talking about webinar registration process which is cool. I'm going to be showing some really cool things that we're doing I think people are going to love. That's going to be first.</p> <p>Then I have a guy named Jason O'Neill who did his very first webinar last week and he crushed it. He made seven or eight sales and he was just going crazy, how excited he was. He's going to share his whole thing which is going to be fun, then we have a guy named Mike Neilson who Mike has been driving all the traffic for Liz's webinar.</p> <p>He's the Facebook webinar registration ninja. He's going to show his whole process which is going to be cool. After lunch, I have three or four things I think we could go. I'm not sure where we're going to go though. We will see.</p> <p>One thing we're going to do for sure is break things into accountability groups and get everyone accountability partners, stuff like that. That's what's been happening. For those of you who aren't in Boise, I just wanted to keep you in the loop on what's going down. For those who in the future are going to come to Boise, you got to come. This is like no other. We don't do what everyone else is doing. We go and take it to another level to try to inspire, excite, and to show you what's possible.</p> <p>It was a lot of fun. For those of you who are here who went through the process, I appreciate you guys, and those who weren't, if you become an Ignite or Inner Circle member, we'll have all the recordings in the member's area for you guys. That's about it for today. My brain is so fried, you guys, I don't have too much more value to give other than if you're doing live events, do cool stuff because people love it.</p> <p>That's about it, you guys. I appreciate you all. I will report back in the next few days on what else happens through the rest of the group. We have the second day of our Ignite event today, and then tomorrow and Thursday are our Inner Circle mastermind meetings. That's about it. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_103.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1421080550, "title": "Episode #102 \u2013 Prolific And Specific", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The keys to a winning offer, and a few other cool things.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about the event he has going on today with his Inner Circle and Ignite members.He also tells his story of his first experiences selling to large groups of people and what he learned.</p> <p>Here are some of the cool things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Find out the story behind how Russell has been developing The Perfect Webinar.

It's six in the morning. It's snowing outside. I want to welcome you guys to an awesome Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, so I hope that you are listening to this at a time that's warm and a normal hour because right now, I'm recording this at a not normal hour and it's snowing outside, and it's freezing but I'm here because today, we have our event. I'm excited. Those who have been following us for any amount of time, if you know, we have an Inner Circle mastermind group and we have an Ignite coaching program.</p> <p>Three times a year, we get together and hang out, and we talk about cool stuff, and today is that day. I was up late working on stuff getting everything ready, and up early because I was nervous and excited, and had a chance to meet a bunch of our students I've been working with for six to eight months or so that I've never met face-to-face. That always makes me excited.</p> <p>I'm anxious, nervous, and excited and everything all wrapped into one. It's going to be a ton of fun. I'm driving right now to the event center where we're going to be at, and I'm praying that I don't slide off the road and die because it's really icy out here and wet. This podcast could also be my last will and testament if I do. If I do, my wife gets everything and my kids. They're awesome.</p> <p>I want to talk to you guys today about a couple of random things more so than anything because there's some stuff that's been on my mind that I think is pretty cool. I don't have any other format to share stuff like that, so here you are. You get to hear it. First thing I want to talk about was for yourself, I know all of us in our businesses focus on growing and what we can do, all that kind of stuff but my first question for you is what are you guys giving back.</p> <p>I know some people who listen to this give back a ton, and some people don't do anything. I had a really cool experience yesterday. There's a little handicapped boy who goes to church with me. I talked about him on other podcasts. His name is Jesse, just one of the neatest people in the world.</p> <p>He gets $20 a week from the state for food and for things like that to survive. Sunday, we took him to church. Everybody takes turns picking him up and taking him. We took him on Sunday. We got there, and as soon as we sat down in the seat, he pulls his wallet out of his thing and gets out his tithing, which is 10%, right?</p> <p>Of his $20, he pulls out two dollars. Then in our church, there are a couple of other funds. There's one that's called a fast offering fund which is money that goes towards people who are less fortunate, helps feed them, and things like that. Then he puts five dollars into the fast offering fund, which was one fourth of the money that he gets to survive each week.</p> <p>Then there's a missionary fund which helps missionaries to support themselves. He put two dollars in the missionary fund. What's that, five, six, seven, eight, nine, so almost 50% of his income, he gave back. He was so excited to do it. You should have seen him.</p> <p>He was jumping around, so excited and so grateful that he had a chance to give to those who are less fortunate than him. This guy makes $20 a week. That's it. He struggles to walk and talk, and all these types of things. I just look at how many excuses that a lot of us have, especially as your business grows.</p> <p>I still complain about government because they're a bunch of punks and they\u2019re taking half my money. That's always frustrating. I try never to complain about church because we pay 10% of our income to the church. That number gets bigger and bigger and bigger. I hear people who struggle about that, and whine and complain. It's not fair, that's my money, things like that.</p> <p>It drives me crazy. I look at someone like Jesse who literally gives everything, 100% almost of what he has. He keeps the last 60% so he can buy his food for the week but everything else, he's giving for the Lord. I thought that was a really neat thing.</p> <p>I look at some of my friends in this business. One of them that always inspires me is Stu McLaren and his wife Amy. His whole mission of his business is not to make a ton of money. It's to be able to serve people and help people. They've built this charity out in Kenya. We had a chance to go out to Kenya a couple of years ago with them.</p> <p>It's just inspiring to see people who are using what they're doing to help others as opposed to just helping themselves all the time. Anyway, that is lesson number one for you all today. Some other stuff, here's another one I was thinking about. The workshop today is called \u201cThe Perfect Webinar.\u201d It's funny, I've been doing some version of webinars or teleseminars for over 10 years now.</p> <p>I remember when I first started doing them, I would go and I remember the very first one. I was actually at an Armand Morin seminar. I signed up. I had $2000 I think for the seminar. I was so excited, my first internet marketing seminar. I was going to go meet internet marketing people which I was really excited about.</p> <p>I'm at this event and I'm learning all this stuff. The first speaker gets up and he starts speaking, and at the end of his presentation, he closes. He tells people to run at the back of the room and go buy his thing. I look and I see people running to the back of the room. I had never seen that before.</p> <p>I'm doing the math. I think he was selling a $2000 package. I'm doing that two, four, six, eight. I'm like, \u201cThat guy made $40,000 right there.\u201d The next speaker gets up and does the same thing. Boom, he's selling a $5000 package, five, 10, 15, 20, \u201cDang, in an hour.\u201d</p> <p>The next speaker gets up. After three days of watching this, shy little Russell who didn't dare to talk to anyone, who loved my internet business so I could hide behind the computer was like, \u201cI got to learn how to do what these guys are doing because I want to be able to do that,\u201d and started being on this quest, this 10 year quest to figure out how in the world to sell from stage.</p> <p>I remember the first couple of times, I was so embarrassed. I would try to mimic what people were doing. I go and do my pitch, and crickets at the end. Nobody would budge. I would be standing there at the front, and it would be so awkward. I literally would go up to my hotel room and shut the door, and just hide in there because I would be so embarrassed.</p> <p>I seriously, there would be events where I would spend three days at the event hiding in the hotel room because my stage pitch bombed and I was too embarrassed to see the promoters or other attendees, or anyone. I would just be embarrassed and hide up there. This is me 10 years ago. This would give you guys comfort for those of you guys who are nervous to do this kind of thing. I was scared out of my wits.</p> <p>I kept seeing people do it. I'm like, \u201cOh, I got to figure this out. They can\u2019t be that much smarter than me,\u201d so I started studying. I went through 10 or 12 different public speaking courses. I went to Dan Kennedy's and Bill Glazer's, and Armand Morin's, and on and on. Each time, I learned little pieces and little nuggets that would get me closer and closer to having the perfect webinar.</p> <p>Anyway, I kept doing that for over 10 years now, just getting that webinar better and better. A little while ago, I put together a template for what I call the perfect webinar. I was putting together this template called \u201cThe Perfect Webinar.\u201d It was basically all the pieces I had learned, I tried to sketch them out in one cool spot.</p> <p>I think in the future, I'm just going to give that out. I think I'll do a free plus shipping on it. In the future, if you go to I think I own <a href=\"http://www.PerfectWebinar.com/\">PerfectWebinar.com</a>\u00a0or <a href=\"http://www.ThePerfectWebinar.com/\">ThePerfectWebinar.com</a>, I'm not sure. It's not there today but in the future it will be there and I\u2019ll give away the template for free. It's basically all these pieces put together to a really cool template that you can use, and you plug in the pieces.</p> <p>After I built that, the first presentation I did was one called \u201cHigh Ticket Secrets,\u201d and I went and created the whole thing and launched it. We did 70 or 80 grand from the webinar. I was like, \u201cThat's not too bad.\u201d Then of course, stupid Russell, when things work, I forget about them sometimes and don't do them.</p> <p>Then I had some coaching clients who came through who I knew for what they were doing and wanting something, \u201cYou guys need this. You need to use the webinar script.\u201d I gave them the script, trained them, and coached them on it. Person after person we gave it to, boom, knocked it out of the park.</p> <p>It just kept happening over and over again. I was like, \u201cThis thing is really good. This is one of the best little pieces of paper I've ever put together.\u201d Then about three or four months ago, I had to do a webinar. We had actually, it's a funny backstory but I'll share it with you guys because you are Marketing in Your Car fans and you guys are hanging out with me all the time.</p> <p>Nobody else really knows this but when we launched Click Funnels initially, it was a smashing failure. You thought I was going to say smashing success. No, we launched it. It shocked me how few people signed up. We got people in there but my goal was at least 10,000 people.</p> <p>I think from the entire launch, we got about 1000. I was like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I was sick to my stomach, spend a million dollars on a program, you want it to work. We were all frustrated. Then a month later, Mike Filsaime is like, \u201cI want you to come to my event and you guys sell Click Funnels.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cRight now, Click Funnels is a dollar, a free trial. How am I going to sell it? We got to package this thing up.\u201d Two days before the event, literally, I'm like, \u201cOkay, I got to start on a presentation,\u201d so pulled out the perfect webinar script, and I just followed it to a T. I was like, \u201cYou know what? This is 10 years of work. I'm too tired and too worn out to try to reinvent this thing.\u201d</p> <p>I just took \u201cThe Perfect Webinar,\u201d spent two days going through and plugging in the PowerPoint slides, following my script to a T. Two days later, I got to San Diego for Filsaime's event, stepped on stage, never gave this presentation before, super nervous, got up there and did it, and closed 34% of the room.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cDang, I've never closed 34% of the room before.\u201d We went home, we started doing webinars, and it's funny, we did the first webinar on a Thursday morning and we did $30,000 in sales. I thought, \u201cThat's not too bad but I thought we'd do better.\u201d I had another webinar four hours later.</p> <p>I went through all the questions that people had asked me during the webinar. I was like, \u201cOkay, these are all the sticking points that I'm not explaining things well enough,\u201d so I went back and we tweaked things, tweaked things, and got it better and better. Then four hours later, did the webinar again, same size audience, same everything, almost identical demographic, and did $120,000 in sales.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cDang, this keeps working better and better.\u201d I did that webinar four or five times, and wound up doing I think about a million dollars the first three weeks doing that webinar, and then what was cool was Dan Kennedy's company, GKIC, asked me to come speak at their event so I went out there and did it, the same presentation. We closed 49% of the room, almost 50%, one more dude and I would have tipped it over and had half the room buy.</p> <p>Anyway, I was so proud. I couldn't believe that worked. I came back and said, \u201cYou know what? This whole perfect webinar idea, we need to focus more on it.\u201d That's what's happening in the next two days here. Everyone in my high end coaching program is coming in for two days. We're going to build out perfect webinars.</p> <p>50% is the script and 50% is the sequence. Today, we're going to be doing script, and tomorrow, we're doing sequencing. What's cool is that at this event, this is what I'm most nervous about is I'm going to go out on stage right after lunchtime and I have about 900 people registered for a webinar today. I'm going to sit up on stage live in front of everyone and do the webinar with a whole audience listening in.</p> <p>I'm either going to bomb and make no money or I'm going to crush it and make as much money in front of everybody. Anyway, I'm nervous but you guys are going to see what I'm saying. I'm going to have 100 people in my audience here in Boise listening and watching me, and I'm going to stand up on stage for 90 minutes and do my pitch.</p> <p>Hopefully, if I don't screw it up, I'll just close a ton of people. Anyway, it's going to be super fun. I'm nervous. I'm nervous because half the time, hotel internet doesn't even work so people might not even be able to hear the presentation. There are so many things that could go wrong but if it goes right, it's going to be really, really cool.</p> <p>We're going to try it out. Typically, when I do things, I like hedging my bets. When I do things that can make me look stupid, I do them in private so that if a webinar bombs, nobody knows except for me but this time, there's everyone here so what can you do? It's going to be fun. We'll have a good time with it, right?</p> <p>Hopefully these guys will be forgiving if I screw it up, but if I do it correctly and execute it right, I think it will be a good learning opportunity to have them see how I do it because it's so much more than just watching a webinar to get it. There's a lot about just the way you present and the way you pitch live. It's going to be fun.</p> <p>The last core thing, I'm almost to the event center which is cool. I'm early. I'm never early to these kind of things. My wife would be very proud of me right now. The last thing, as I was going through my presentation last night, building my presentation for today, I've had a lot of people who have gone through \u201cThe Perfect Webinar\u201d script and given it back to me.</p> <p>The advice I'm about to share with you is important for perfect webinars, for video sales letters, for any kind of selling that you're going to do but they give it to me and they're like, \u201cHere's my thing. I go through it, I watch it.\u201d The difference between a webinar that makes you $1000 and one that makes you a million dollars is not much. It's a very fine line that gets you from one spot to the other.</p> <p>The thing that I think pushes you over the edge are two things. It's being prolific and being specific. Let me elaborate on it. The first one is being prolific. This is one that's hard to teach. How do you become prolific? You're prolific or you're not. You got to think about that. How do you become prolific?</p> <p>With this one guy I was critiquing, he had this big buildup about what his big secret thing was. The secret was in the back end. I'm like, \u201cMan, everyone's secret is the back end. That's not a unique thing.\u201d Your big reveal can still be the back end but you got to call it something different.</p> <p>Being prolific is 90% how you name things. It can still be the exact same thing as everyone else is doing but just the naming it, what do you call it? If you call it the back end and everyone else calls it the back end, it's no longer exciting. I was telling him because the thing he was selling was very similar to something I was selling that we call the black box funnel.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cWhat you're doing and what I'm doing are very similar.\u201d I said, \u201cYou called yours the back end. I called mine the black box funnel. Which one sounds more prolific?\u201d The black box funnel, \u201cWhoa, what is that?\u201d You're very interesting and you got to figure that thing out. You can't just answer it in your head.</p> <p>You can't be like, \u201cOh, it's a back end sales funnel. I've listened to 30\u00a0 webinars and they talk about this.\u201d That's the first piece is being prolific. The second piece is being specific. In this guy's presentation, he kept coming back to, \u201cOh yeah, and then you can do Google Ads or Facebook. You can do five different kinds of back ends. There's this or that, different things. There are a whole bunch of things you can do.\u201d</p> <p>That's the opposite of sales. What sales is, \u201cThis is the exact specific thing you have to do to be successful. If you deviate from this one iota, you will fail.\u201d It sounds like I'm going over the edge but that's what sells, being very, very specific. Again, if you look at the Black Box Funnel, I think the video as of right now is still there if you go to <a href=\"http://www.BlackBoxFunnel.com/\">BlackBoxFunnel.com</a>, you'll see it.</p> <p>I have a video there that sells. It's one of our front ends for our coaching program, and I'm very, very specific, \u201cThis is how you do it. This is what the first page has to look like. The second page has to look like this. This is how the ad has to look like.\u201d I'm very specific. I tell them things in absolutes.</p> <p>If you guys watch Star Wars where they say that only Siths deal in absolutes or whatever, it's very, very true. You have to be very specific and absolute. It can't be like, \u201cOh, there's a bunch of ways to do this.\u201d It has to be there's only one path to success, this is what it is, do not deviate from it because that's what people respect.</p> <p>That's what gets them inspired and to want to give you money, that there's a specific path. You've got it. Nobody else does. Even if there are other paths, you don\u2019t tell them about it. You tell them about the path, the specific one that you want them to go on, and that's it.</p> <p>For example, this whole perfect webinar thing, this is the only path. You notice that I'm very, very specific. If you look at the way we're selling this and teaching it, these are the slides, this is the order, do not deviate from it or you're going to screw it up, very, very specific. I think it's prolific too but we'll leave that.</p> <p>We'll find out when this offer goes live and see how it works. That's the key, guys. When you're making any kind of content or sales presentation, whatever, always think in your head over and over and over again, prolific and specific, prolific and specific. Those are the keys. You can't be un-prolific and give people tons of options.</p> <p>If you do, you're never going to be successful. This is a long podcast, guys. We're at almost 18 minutes but I'm at the event center. I'm going to go in and get things unpacked, get things rocking and rolling. I appreciate you guys listening. I hope you enjoyed this.</p> <p>If you're not in our inner circle yet, what are you waiting for? Come on, now. There's nobody that gives as much as I do. We not only do events three times a year, you also get me live on Voxer, which Voxer is like a walkie-talkie coaching program through the phone, which means you can literally walkie-talkie me.</p> <p>I have some guys in our inner circle that walkie-talkie me three or four times a day asking me questions. There's no one that gives as much as I do because there's no one that cares as much as I do. I care about you guys, so if you're not in our inner circle or our Ignite coaching program yet, it's time to do it.

Good morning! It\u2019s raining here in Boise, Idaho, and I want to welcome you to episode 101 of Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>All right everyone, so what do you guys think about the new theme song, huh? Huh? Do you like it? So yes, as I told you in the last episode that\u2019s what delayed me from recording any episodes for like a month.</p> <p>So all I did was I went to Audio Jungle, found a sweet audio track, then went to VoiceJockeys.com, paid someone $60 to say that and boom! I got a jingle!</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s not quite as professional as the last one, but it\u2019s also not quite as 1980s. So anyway, I\u2019m in the office right now and I\u2019m super excited for today, getting everything prepared for my live event that\u2019s happening next week.</p> <p>We have our two-day workshop for all of our DotComSecrets Ignite members, and for two days we\u2019ll be focusing on webinars, and webinar sales processes and scripting and traffic and everything tied to webinars, which is going to be awesome.</p> <p>And then, the second two days, we have our High-end Mastermind Group for our Inner Circle members.</p> <p>So it\u2019s going to be a ton of fun and I\u2019m excited, and today while I was kind of getting ready and preparing for this, I was thinking about like what I should talk about on the podcast. There was one kind of theme that I\u2019ve noticed in the last week or the last couple weeks that I want to address.</p> <p>In our coaching group we have a lot of people doing webinars now, because I think webinars are one of the easiest ways to get started, to have an offer that you can break even on traffic or make a profit, a bunch of other things.</p> <p>And the problem is that\u2026 Well, not the problem. The good part is we had -- I think this week we had eight or nine of our students who did their very first webinars, which was awesome and it was fun to see.</p> <p>It was funny because some people finished the webinar with like\u2026 Anyway, every time they were finished, they would all Vox to me. Vox is like my communication channel with my coaching students.</p> <p>So we\u2019ve got Vox on the phone. They can Vox me. It\u2019s kind of like a walkie-talkie, and they can Vox me any time they want throughout the day. And so, basically, they would Vox me after the webinar, and say, \u201cHey! This is what happened, and this what happened\u2026\u201d You know, they\u2019d just kind of tell me, and about half of them had such a good attitude. They said:</p> <p>\u201cWow, Russell, I did the webinar! I learned the script and I practiced it. Nobody bought, but I did it. And people showed up and people loved it, I good feed back, and they were excited.\u201d</p> <p>And they\u2019re like, \u201cMan, I\u2019m so excited! I\u2019m going to make some tweaks and changes, and then do it again and just keep getting better and better at it, and start making some sales in the future,\u201d and bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, and those guys are like, \u201cyes!\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the right attitude, you know, like the very first time you do your webinar, your goal is not to make a million dollars. Your goal is to do your first webinar, right?</p> <p>To practice the pitch, to get some feedback, to see what happens, to see how you feel in front of an audience, to see if people respond to the offer, all those types of things that you do the first time you\u2019re doing one -- doing one live.</p> <p>Obviously, your goal is to make sales, but not to make a ton of sales. On the other side of it, we\u2019ve got people who -- and it\u2019s probably because I get excited.</p> <p>I\u2019d share numbers that we do with our webinars and people that other of our students have done and things like that, and so they\u2019re expecting to make like a million dollars in one webinar on their very first one.</p> <p>And so, the other half wrote me back and messaged me and were just like all depressed, and \u201coh nobody bought, and only 20 percent of the people actually showed up.\u201d It reminded me of like Eeyore the donkey like, \u201cOh, nothing\u2019s gonna work.\u201d</p> <p>[Laughter] you know, like that kind of an attitude, and I literally had to go Vox everyone, and like get them excited and say:</p> <p>\u201cLook, you have to understand like, you just opened a store. This is Day One, your very first time you ever pitched it. Like most people do not make money on their very first webinar pitch. Most people are going to practice it, and like it\u2019s such a good thing just to do it because you learn so much stuff.\u201d</p> <p>You learn, you know, did the registration process work? Did the process to get them to attend the webinar work? Boom, boom, boom!</p> <p>You look through every single aspect, every single piece, because there\u2019s so many different variables, and from that you can really dial in and figure out what tweaks and changes you need to make, okay?</p> <p>I was telling one of the people, when we did the Funnel Hacks webinar the first time, we did the webinar and I got tons of feedback and things like that, and so the first time, I remember the first day we did it, we did it twice that first day.</p> <p>The first time I did it, we had a big show up, and we did $30,000, which may seem like a lot of money. For us it was based on the number of people who were on the webinar. It was really, really low, and I was like \u201cohh!\u201d</p> <p>I just felt really bad, but I looked at the comments and the feedback, and I thought about like how I felt during each section. And I had my second webinar; it was like four hours later.</p> <p>During that four-hour period of time, I was tweaking slides and changing and just moving things as fast as I could because I knew the next webinar was coming.</p> <p>So then, I\u2019d figure out all the questions that people were asking me, and I went and I tweaked those and added them into the presentation and move things around.</p> <p>Anyway, I tried to get as close as I could to what I thought was perfect, and the second one I did we did $120,000 with the same amount of people on it -- so four times as much money just by taking tweaks and changes.</p> <p>And so, the big thing I wanted to kind of mention on this podcast, and I want you guys thinking about, is positioning your expectations right, and looking at this as kind of the fun process that it can and it should be.</p> <p>You know, for me again, I\u2019m looking at we create this thing you\u2019re putting out there, and now my goal is not to -- like I remember one of the guys, he told me, he said, \u201cMy goal is to make 20 sales at $2,000 apiece.\u201d</p> <p>He wanted $40-grand off his first webinar, and I was saying, \u201cMan, if you get one, that would be awesome; like that should be your goal.\u201d</p> <p>You know, typically the products were selling on a webinar from $500 to $1,000, and so what I tell people I say, \u201cLook, what you need to do is invest. For your first webinar and traffic invest -- if it\u2019s $1,000 product, invest $1,000; if it\u2019s a $500, invest $500 -- and you\u2019re goal should be to just break even.</p> <p>Make one sale and see if you can do that. If you can break even, make one sale, then boom! You\u2019ve got it! Like that\u2019s the only thing you should be focusing on right now, is just breaking even on your ad spent from your first webinar.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the expectation, and then from that, now we get so much data. Like insane amounts of data come back to us as soon as you do your first webinar, where you make tweaks and changes, and just all this stuff that you can't do until you do your first one.</p> <p>Yeah, so I guess my big thing is setting expectations. You know, not trying to make a million dollars on Day One. Everyone that comes into our High-end Coaching Program, we always ask them what they\u2019re goals are.</p> <p>And the people who come back and say, \u201cYou know, my goals, if I can get to $15,000 to $20,000 a month, I\u2019m going to be really excited,\u201d those ones I like working with, because that\u2019s a realistic expectation for what they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>People who come in and say, \u201cmy goal is to make $3-million my first year,\u201d it\u2019s not a realistic expectation, and all it can do is just stress you out. People are like, \u201cWhy? I need to set high goals!\u201d</p> <p>Like, yeah, you do, but you also set a realistic goal. So say, you know, my goal is to be able to get point. Like for me when I got started, I was like I want to make a million dollars a year.</p> <p>That was my goal, but I didn\u2019t say it was this year; I said I want to make a million dollars a year. You know, for right now, if I can make $10,000 a month, that would change my life so that\u2019s what I\u2019m running for.</p> <p>So having your -- what do they call them in Good to Great? The BHAGS, the big, harry, audacious goals -- like having some BHAGS, but not like tying those to time. Do you know what I mean?</p> <p>Like don\u2019t say, \u201cI need this done this year: I\u2019m going to make $3-million this year.\u201d Just say my future goal is to make $3-million a year and a million dollars a year would be really, really cool. But right now, my goal I\u2019m running towards is, you know, what is it? Is it $5,000 a month, $10,000, $20,000?</p> <p>In my last or two events ago, we did this little exercise with people, asking them like how much money do they want to make, and everyone was giving me these crazy numbers.</p> <p>And then I showed them how, if you were making $20,000 a month, that you literally could live in a $2-million dollar mansion, drive a $100,000 car, and go on vacation every single month on $20,000 a month.</p> <p>Like $20,000 a month is a ton of money, you guys, and it\u2019s realistic to live off of that, right? - to have an amazing lifestyle off it, and a million dollars a year is just not realistic. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen for most of us.</p> <p>So first off, setting your expectations right, from like an income standpoint, again you goal should be: \u201cI\u2019m going to spend X amount of dollars in advertising. I want to break even.\u201d That should be the only focus when you first doing your webinar. That\u2019s it. Nothing else should matter.</p> <p>And the second thing is looking at this as the process. This is not like you built a\u2026 like I remember when one guy said, \u201cMan, I\u2019ve spent so much time on this, and I\u2019m frustrated because I spent so much time and effort on this.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, you don\u2019t understand. Like this is not a one-time shot. You\u2019re putting this time and effort in to create this thing. You\u2019re creating a masterpiece, and after it\u2019s done then you keep tweaking it.</p> <p>It\u2019s like the analogy of like you have a big stone, right? And you\u2019re chiseling away and chiseling away, and you\u2019ve done a lot of work, and it\u2019s looking good, but you keep chiseling and keep chiseling.</p> <p>I\u2019ve done the Funnel Hacks webinar, man, probably 20 times in the last two months. You know, we did over a million dollars in sales, and from that, every single time I do it, I\u2019ve changed the presentation.</p> <p>In fact I made like, I don\u2019t know, probably 15 different slide changes yesterday, after the last presentation I gave because every time I\u2019m feeling different things, and I\u2019m tweaking it.</p> <p>I\u2019m changing it based on response and based on questions I\u2019m getting. And things that don\u2019t feel comfortable when I\u2019m doing the presentation, I\u2019m tweaking and changing and adding things, and every time it gets better and better and better, and so looking at this is a work of art.</p> <p>Mary Ellen Tribby, some of you guys may know her, I talked to her one time, and she was talking about how us Internet marketing people, how dumb most of us are, and she went into like two different companies.</p> <p>She went into Wise Publishing, and then also into Agora Publishing, and took the division she was responsible for from like three or four million dollars a year to like $80-million a year within 18 months. And what she told me that I thought was really, really cool is she said:</p> <p>\u201cAll you Internet marketing people are brilliant. You make the most amazing offers in the world. It\u2019s just, but what you do is like the equivalent of creating a play, right?</p> <p>\u201cYou hire the best actors and screen writers, and you put this whole thing together, and you spend, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars, perfecting this play.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then, you live in Boise, Idaho, and so you go and you advertise it. A bunch of people show up, and you do the play, and it\u2019s a smashing success, rave reviews, everyone loves it -- and then the next day you pack up and you start writing your next script for your next play.\u201d</p> <p>And she\u2019s like, \u201cThe difference between what you guys do and what I do is,\u201d she says, \u201cI take that play on the road. Okay, it was a smashing success, and I take it from Boise to Salt Lake to Chicago to L.A and I take it on the road.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s how you have to look at this whole thing as, is this webinar you\u2019re doing, like right now you\u2019re testing in your local area, right? This is how the process is working, and you\u2019re testing and you\u2019re tweaking.</p> <p>You\u2019re making these changes and then you take it on the road. Each time you get better and better and better, and that\u2019s how you have to look at it, okay?</p> <p>So anyway, that\u2019s kind of my goal of this presentation, this podcast, whatever you want to call it. Because it\u2019s been on my mind and it\u2019s kind of a rant, but it\u2019s because I think everyone needs to get their minds\u2019 right.</p> <p>You know, everyone talks about mindset and goals and I think they do it the wrong way. They\u2019re talking about, you know, \u201cset huge goals and work towards...\u201d</p> <p>And those things are good, but it\u2019s more paralyzing a lot of times than setting the realistic goals and good expectations and understanding what you should be doing and how this process works, that\u2019s really the key in the game plan.</p> <p>So anyway, I\u2019ve been at the office in the parking lot. For like five minutes now I\u2019ve been ranting, so I\u2019m going to jump in and get to work, have a fun day today.</p> <p>You guys have a good one as well, and I\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "11:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_101.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1420651906, "title": "Episode #100 \u2013 My One BIG Change I Made Last Year", "author": "", "summary": "<p>We made one BIG change last year to our business, that seemed VERY small, yet helped us to more then double sales from the year prior.</p> <p>On this special 100th episode of Marketing In Your Car Russell talks about reminiscing on the previous year instead of making new years resolutions and the one big change he made in the last year.</p> <p>Here are some of the cool things you will hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>How to attract the right kind of people to your business.</li> <li>How to look at your clients and figure out what the end result needs to be.</li> <li>And to not be afraid even if your initial sales drop, because it will pick back up again when you attract your dream client.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how to attract your dream client to your business.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and I want to welcome you to our 100th episode of Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey everyone, so it's been a little while since I've done a podcast and to tell you the real honest reason, it's because I promised you all that I would have a new jingle for the 100th episode and I haven't got one yet, so I've been delaying and delaying. Yesterday, I actually messaged on Facebook to my friends who yelled at me saying, \u201cDude, you don't have a podcast episode. Where are you at?\u201d</p> <p>I'm going to repent and I'm just going to do one. Hopefully today I\u2019ll figure out a new song for you. I appreciate you guys listening, and actually caring so that's really cool. Today, I'm driving actually to work out. I'm not sure if I\u2019ll get my thoughts done by the time I get there so this may be one of those ones where I pause it and come back after my workout.</p> <p>It's the beginning of the year for me right now. If you're listening live, it's just after the new year. If you're listening to the recording or listening later, that's when I recorded this. It's interesting because it's been fun. I'm not a big New Year's resolution person but I am big at looking back at what happened over the last year and looking at the cool changes that happened in yourself as a person, as a business, and as a company, and all these different things, and then setting big, huge \u2013 I think the book Good to Great calls them BHAGs, big, hairy, audacious goals.</p> <p>I'm totally a big believer in that, setting huge goals for the years as opposed to resolutions. I've got some big goals we've set out. I started thinking over the last year and I looked at this time last year, where our company was at versus where we are right now. I got to tell you, it's like night and day.</p> <p>We had relaunched our little coaching program a little over a year ago. Some of you guys know, we at one time had 60 salespeople and we were selling coaching, $5000 packages of coaching, and it was a huge nightmare to be honest. I shut it down and for three years, we didn't sell coaching. We kept getting so many requests for it, we relaunched it last year.</p> <p>At the beginning of the year, it was really hard. We were trying to sell $5000 but the kind of people that we were getting in weren't that high quality, or the leads that were coming in. It was hard. I remember about this time last year making a conscious decision, thinking, \u201cYou know what? If I want to keep doing this business,\u201d because I was burned out, I was turned, and I didn't really like it, \u201cI've got to change the customers we have.\u201d</p> <p>I started looking at that. To change our customers, I've got to change the bait that I'm using. I looked at the bait I was throwing out there to the world to attract people in and what was interesting is most of the stuff I was sending out, most of our offers and things like that were all business opportunity stuff. It was attracting someone who wanted to start a business.</p> <p>The problem with that is you're going to get some really good people who want to start businesses but you also get every person on earth who just wants to make a quick buck. It attracts the total wrong type of person. I was putting out these offers and putting out these landing pages and ads, and everything that was attracting biz op people. That's what I was getting.</p> <p>It was obviously the type of customer that we didn't really want to keep having, you know what I mean? That's kind of where last year had started. We made the conscious decision, we need to get a different type of customer so to do that, we need to create a different bait. If you've been following me for any amount of time, you know the bait we put out.</p> <p>We created a book called The 108 Proven Split Test Winners, and we launched it for free plus shipping, no continuity, nothing tricky, just let's give this amazing product out to the world and see what happens. We did that. Over the last year, we sold over 10,000 copies of the book, which you may be saying, \u201cWell, Russell, that's not a big deal. It was free plus shipping. You didn't make any money on it.\u201d</p> <p>But us putting that bait out there completely transformed our business. We started attracting the right people in our coaching program, and we figured out a couple of things. First off, our high ticket product back then was $5000. Over the last year, we've raised our prices where right now, our lowest ticket product that we sell through coaching is $10,000 and we're about to raise that again to $15,000.</p> <p>By increasing the price, what happened was the people that we didn't want to work with, the people who were struggling to pay $5000, they stopped signing up. What was cool was that the right person, the people that my bait was attracting, $10,000 was not that big a deal to them. They were people who had businesses, who had websites, who wanted to take it to the next level.</p> <p>Man, I tell you, for me, that customer is so much more refreshing, such a better type person to work with. Again, we made that our low end as $10,000 and we added a $25,000, and last year, we sold I don't know the exact numbers, but we sold 120 people at the $10,000 level and 30 something people at the $25,000 level.</p> <p>That's like what, one and a half million bucks in coaching sales. We did that with two salespeople, which is insane. We did it without that much effort. It all comes back to we changed the bait that we used to attract. We got the customers we wanted and customers who could afford coaching, those who wanted coaching. It's been pretty awesome.</p> <p>I'm at the gym right now. I'm pausing this recording. When I come back, we will finish this up. Hey everyone, I'm back. Just for the record, I want to say that I'm not one of the New Year's gym goers. I've been going consistently three times a week for the last five years. I didn't go to the real gym. I have a personal trainer so it's just me and him. I don't have to deal with the thousand other people.</p> <p>I'm not sure where I left off but I know I was talking about how we consciously picked who we wanted our dream customer to be. The second step then was go and create bait that would attract our dream customer. If we look at our Dot Com Secrets Labs, what's interesting about it is anyone who is a business opportunity seeker, if they saw that, they wouldn't know what it was.</p> <p>They wouldn't even pay the $10 shipping and handling because they don\u2019t know what a split test is. They have no idea how that's going to help them but my dream customer, somebody who has a website, who is trying to figure out how to take it to the next level, the person I want to be working with, the people who I know can write a check for $10,000, $25,000, or $100,000, they see that and it's the right bait.</p> <p>I've had people who have tried this strategy, the free plus shipping things and they're like, \u201cI attract crappy people because the price point is so low.\u201d That's the wrong way to look at it. That's not true that you attract the wrong kind of person because of the bait you put out there. If you put out there a how to get rich quick product, you're going to get how to get rich quick people.</p> <p>If you put out there a product that's going to attract your dream customer, you'll get your dream customer. It's very important to really understand that, that the bait is key. After you've created the bait, then you got to come back. The bait has been created. Now where are my dream customers at? Where is the pond that they're at, trying to figure out where that's at.</p> <p>For us, targeting Facebook was big. We had to find other places, trying to find where are our dream customers. For us, when we were finding business opportunity seekers, it was way easier because the world is your ocean. They're everywhere. When we started identifying the right people, it shrunk our world down.</p> <p>The universe isn't as big for us to go after but it's a lot deeper. Like I said, we got 30 something people that pay us over $25,000 this year. We have two people that paid us for our million dollar program where they pay $100,000 up front and 10% of their profits. I can't go as wide. There aren't as many people to target but I can go way deeper with those people.</p> <p>Then the fourth step in the formula, first is find out who your dream customer is, what kind of bait you're going to create. Find out where to find those people, what's the pond you're fishing out of. The fourth one is where are you taking these people. What's the goal? I think I used to know the answer to this in my business and I think I was wrong in my goal was, \u201cI'm going to get them into my high end coaching programs.\u201d</p> <p>That's not what I'm looking for for number four here. The fourth is what's the result you want to get for somebody. I have a graph. I don't know if I mentioned, I'm launching my first real book. I'm going to try to get on the New York Times' bestseller list in March. You'll see this is chapter one. I talk about this concept.</p> <p>The fourth step is the result. Where are we trying to take this person? I have a picture of a mountain and me taking somebody up to the top of the mountain. For me, I look at my clients. Where am I trying to take these guys? What's my goal with them? What's the result I'm trying to get them to?</p> <p>For me, each person is different. I realize that for me to really know that, I need to spend time on the phone with everyone I coach. We shifted our coaching program away from this cookie cutter thing that we pushed everybody through, and they got certain sessions, and had different coaches and started looking at I'm really concerned about these people's result.</p> <p>The reason I'm in business is not just to\u00a0 get money. It's to get results for people. We shifted our coaching program where when somebody comes in, they get an hour with me where I help steer the direction. Then I hand them off to my team to help implement what we talked about, but then they also have live access to me through Voxer where they can Voxer me as many times as they want every single day.</p> <p>Some people totally abuse it, and other people don't take advantage of it at all, but now I have the ability to help people daily and help pushing them towards their goals, and moving them forward. I tell you what, the paradigm and the change in our business has been amazing. From a profit standpoint, from a happiness standpoint, for myself personally, from results for our clients, it's just been a million times better.</p> <p>What I wanted to do this podcast about for you guys today is to start thinking about that. We're at the beginning of a new year. I remember last year, Tony Robbins put this video out there. It was really cool because he said, \u201cYou know, it's the beginning of a new year.\u201d It may be January 1st or whatever but he says, \u201cIt's a new year and because of that, you guys have a chance. If you're not happy in a relationship, change it. If you're not happy with your job, change it. If you're not happy with your business, change it.\u201d</p> <p>I remember thinking that. I said, \u201cYou know what? I can. Why don't I make these changes that I want?\u201d so we just started making the changes. For you guys, I want you thinking about that. It's the New Year's here. If you're listening to this later on, then today can be your new year but just figure out what do you want your business to look like.</p> <p>Who are the customers you want to attract? If you don't think about those things first, then you're going to attract the people you don't want, I promise you that. After nine years of experience with not my dream customer versus the last year with my dream customer, it all just came back to knowing first off who I wanted to serve and second off, figuring out the right bait that's going to attract my dream client.</p> <p>For you guys, use this as a gift for yourself. Look at your business. Make the changes you need. Figure out who your dream client is. Create bait to attract them. Even if it means lower profits at first because you're going into unknown waters, and for us, we had a drop. The first year, we had a huge drop but at the end of the year, November, we had the best month of my entire business career, including when I had over 100 employees.</p> <p>December, which is typically the worst month ever, we did almost as much in December this year as we did all of last year as a company. It can change rapidly. There will be kind of a dip at first, and then it's going to change. I want to give you guys this gift to make that change, and do it.</p> <p>I'm back home. I'm going to go get ready for the day today. I got to go attract some more of my dream clients but I appreciate you guys listening. Thanks so much for being a Marketing in Your Car podcast follower. I will talk to you guys again soon.</p>", "duration": "11:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_100.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1414604475, "title": "Episode #99 \u2013 Inbound Vs.

This is Russell. I want to welcome you to Marketing in Your Car. Hey guys and gals. So this episode is kind of weird because I think it is the first Marketing in Your Car I have actually done when I am not in my car. Maybe there are one or two others, but that is what is happening today. I am at the office, and just want to share something cool with you guys because I think it would.</p> <p>I had a chance this last week to watch one of my friends. He posted on Facebook. He is a big believer in bound marketing. I agree with him for the most part. He is trying to get clients and make arguments, but he is talking trash about conversion and sales and persuasion and all these things.</p> <p>It makes me laugh because that is where his background came from, and that\u2019s what he learned. That is what has worked for him in the past. He is talking trash about that so he can sell his inbound marketing thing. I read it, and I just kept going back and forth. Do I agree with him? Do I not? Which parts do I agree? It was interesting because there are parts that I definitely agreed with him on. I do believe that it is the future. I believe in ad networks versus they don\u2019t squeeze pages and sales letters and things like that.</p> <p>There\u2019s that side of it, but the other side of it, which I think he is sort sighted on, he is trying to throw the baby out with the bath water, so to speak. His persuasion says it is important to understand, and if you understand those, then it just works. This weekend I had a really cool experience. I got asked to speak at Marketing Genesis, traffic genesis event. I went and spoke there.</p> <p>There were about 120-130 people in the room when I started speaking. I created a presentation. I don\u2019t know how many of you guys have gone through my perfect webinar presentation, but I have this script that I have built over 10 years, and it has taken the best I have learned from all of my coaches that have taught me how to speak well. I have learned from Ar and Moore and Jason and Dave Vanhoose, Perry Beltcher, and so many people. More than I could go through right now. People have helped me tweak my presentation and tweak it and tweak it and tweak it. I am to the point now, I call it the perfect webinar because it just works.</p> <p>Anyway, I got asked to speak there and so I spent a day and a half or so just working on the presentation getting it perfect. I just, I literally just followed my script to a tee. I didn\u2019t deviate from it at all. I just used the script. I opened my hand out. It goes through all the different pieces, and that is all I did. I went and gave the presentation, and it was really cool. After I pitched I ended up closing 36% of the room, which is the highest that I have ever done. Probably one of the highest that I have ever seen.</p> <p>I was just reading my skype right now and Mike said, \u201cHey, wanted to webinar for your offer. One of the best offers I have ever seen. Maybe the best. It was kind of cool. Just really exciting. I closed 36% of the room at a $1,000 price point. What is interesting is what has happened since then. This is the power of a good offer. If you get a good offer and a pitch that converts, all the inbound marketing stuff is good, but man it will turn your outbound marketing on fire.</p> <p>I did that presentation. Did my whole pitch, my close, everything. Made a whole ton of money. From there, almost instantly I had four or five people come up and beg me to do that webinar to their list. Mike and Andy asked me. Right now, people are lining up to do that webinar to that list because they saw it converted, saw it was going to make them a ton of money, saw that it was awesome. That is the power of having a good converting offer. People will line up to sell it for you.</p> <p>I think it was Gary Halbert said, I can\u2019t remember. A couple different quotes. One of them said something about, \u201cJust one sales letter will make all your problems go away. One good sales letter.\u201d I think it\u2019s true. Literally there have been two or three times in my business career where because of stupid choices on my side, we have almost gone bankrupt or things have almost happened. Every single time it is one good pitch, one good offer that totally saves and changes everything.</p> <p>While I agree with the whole inbound concept, I think that is where we all need to be going. After you use outbound concepts to get somebody in your funnel, that\u2019s where the persuasion and the sales skills and all the things we have been talking and teaching and doing for the last 10 years. They still work. They work better than ever. You just have to learn how to do it.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have the slide yet, but in the next month or so I will probably put it live. If you go to perfectwebinar.com, I am going to have a DVD there that goes to my perfect webinar script. I will do free plus shipping. I recommend getting it because that thing works.</p> <p>I just followed my own template, filled in all the blanks. Did the presentation and boom it works. I hope that helps you guys. I appreciate you all for listening. This is episode 99. The next one coming out is 100, and we will have a new theme song. I appreciate you guys, and we will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "06:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_99.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1413904923, "title": "Episode #98 \u2013 The Slight Edge", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A few quick things you can do to give yourself the edge.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about how he uses supplements to get a slight edge and how he does the same thing in business.</p> <p>Here are a couple of interesting things to listen for in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell uses so many supplements and how people react to them.</li> <li>How Russell is always trying to have a slight edge on his health and his business.</li> <li>And what three types of people you will see in both business and supplement taking.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear how supplements give Russell a slight edge.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to a very cold and rainy Marketing in Your Car. Hey everyone. We are almost on episode 100, which is exciting. At 100 I am changing the theme song. I promise. I honestly can\u2019t believe I have listened to 100, that theme song over 100 times. We have new things coming out. Also, I wanted to see how long all my podcasts have been. So I took them all, and I am getting someone to transcribe them all so I can put them on the blog, and all that fun stuff. I am posting it out there. I had my brother rip all the audios.</p> <p>We put them into one long thing. That\u2019s not counting the music. Just the actual talking parts. It ended up being seven or eight hours long. Maybe it was even longer. It was crazy. I was like, \u201cMan. That is a short key to my office. Can you imagine for a lot of you how much time you spend each day in the car?\u201d It is insane. So, anywho I wanted to talk about something I think is funny.</p> <p>As lot of you guys know I eat really clean and healthy. I also am a big fan of supplements, and every morning I have a supplement regime that takes me almost an hour to do. Some people think that is crazy. Why would I spend an hour doing it? I have my kits there. Aden helps me. He helps me juice, and also helps me pick out all my pills. We take whatever out of each bottle, and I have this huge stack of stuff, and I take all those.</p> <p>I take a bunch of powders and mixes. I look forward to it every morning. It is my favorite part. Usually when I am doing it, I am super tired. I take all the stuff and in about 15 minutes or so, I just feel like a million dollars. It is really awesome. Last night I took a picture of my supplements to post on Facebook. I thought it would be fun to get people\u2019s responses. Man, it cracks me up. People\u2019s feedback. Some people, and it\u2019s funny because the people who are the least healthy are always the ones who are trying to explain to me how it\u2019s going to kill my liver all these types of things. It makes me smile because I think about all the stuff I am taking compared to one big mac at Mcdonalds.</p> <p>It makes me laugh. Also, the super healthy people who have their thing that they follow and they believe, and they stick with that, and they won\u2019t. They said, \u201cAll you need is this. All you need is whatever.\u201d They have their thing. Then there\u2019s a couple guys who I know who are always trying to push the edge on things to get themselves the slight edges. All of them posted pictures of their supplements. Some of them have twice what I had on mine, which was fun as well.</p> <p>I just thought it was funny. I started thinking about that. In all aspects of life. Again, obviously I am a big believer in supplements, but during Halloween, not Halloween, we went down to this Halloween celebration to my brother in law, sister in law\u2019s house. They saw me taking all these things. It was interesting, my sister in law, she said something that I thought was kind of cool. She said, \u201cWow. You always look for little things to give you the edge.\u201d I thought about it, and that is what supplementation is.</p> <p>I am trying to figure out what little tweaks, what little hacks, what little things are there that I can take that are going to give me nutrients that I am not able to get out of my food, that are going to give me things that will help me open up my mind, or increase my energy in a natural way that\u2019s not tied to caffeine or tied to these horrible things. All these little incremental things that I am adding into my supplementation have been amazing. That is the first part, and then I started thinking about also from a learning stand point. For me, I am always trying to get the edge. That is why I read so much. That is why I study so much. That is why I am always listening to trainings and audios. I want to get those tiny things.</p> <p>Each little supplement I can learn and put it in my brain can give me an edge and help me increase my business and help me make more money and help me to serve more people. For me, just like supplements, I am always looking for those little things. I think about the people that almost had the same response with the supplements. I look at their life, and I think they\u2019re response of information would be very similar.</p> <p>Those who fight to have enough and they don\u2019t need to do learn more, who would mock my library. Then we have those who already have, who do, you know a lot, but they don\u2019t want to learn anymore, and those who are trying to seek knowledge in all aspects of life, and try to search out the best things. For me, I like the idea of always searching out the best things. Trying to find those little edges you can take that are natural. From a learning standpoint and a nutritional standpoint, to help you get to where you want to get, faster.</p>", "duration": "06:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_98.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1413218409, "title": "Episode #97 \u2013 Straightening Out The Wheel", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to find coaches to get your unbalanced life back into balance.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about having a life that is like an unbalanced wheel and he is working on straightening it out.</p> <p>Here are some interesting things you will hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why some areas of Russell\u2019s life are amazing and others are struggling.</li> <li>What Russell is doing to try to balance out his life so it\u2019s amazing all the way around.</li> <li>And why it\u2019s important to work out your life and make sure its balanced.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out what Russell is doing to straighten out his wheel.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to a brand new, exciting, awesome episode of Marketing in Your Car. Alright everyone. It has been a little while since I have done a podcast. Had kind of a crazy last month or so. Has it been a month? Probably not. It has been quite awhile. Since last we spoke we launched click funnels. It is going great. People are loving it. We are changing the whole industry, and it\u2019s awesome. Loving that. I want to do something different because today I woke up, and I am in an awesome mood.</p> <p>It is funny because there is a bunch of stuff that I could and should be upset about or frustrated or whatever, but I am in an awesome mood today. There are a lot of reasons for that. For one, I am just grateful for my family. I am grateful for click funnels. I am grateful for my partners, just everything that is happening. It is just awesome, like nothing could pop my bubble right now, which is really cool.</p> <p>The other thing I want to mention, and I think it\u2019s important, is I want to ask you guys, I want you guys to look at your life. There are different areas. Remember at a Tony Robbins event he had us do this in a circle. Each section\u2019s circle was a pie, each part was part of your life, your personal life, your financial, your spiritual, your physical and all those kinds of things. He had us draw from 1-10 where we felt we were at. If you were close to the center of the circle, the further out you went, the better it was.</p> <p>You drew these lines across each of the sections of the pie, and afterwards you looked at it, and it was this lopsided wheel. Everyone has one or two aspects of their life they are crushing it in. The other four or five they are really struggling it. It was interesting. He said, \u201cLook at this as the wheel. How can you drive on this? Parts of it are super close. The edges are super close to the center. Part of it is like a real circle.\u201d</p> <p>I think that is what my life has been like. I have been having great success in a lot of areas, and having a lot of fun and things, but other parts of my life are really struggling like my physical part. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I wasn\u2019t eating right. I was doing a whole bunch of stuff to try to get the launch out. Things became lop-sided. I did a podcast a while ago about the unbalanced life, which I still think is important, but I started thinking recently about that.</p> <p>I have certain aspects of my life, half I am crushing in and half I am struggling in. I started looking at what are the traits in things that are happening in the areas that I am really successful. I have coaches and a team around me helping me in those aspects in my life. Those other ones, I am just going at it on my own and hoping for the best.</p> <p>Recently, a little while ago I hired this guy. I am not sure if I told you guys or not. I don\u2019t know if I told you or not, but I went and got my blood tested in the middle of our product launch thing. My hormones were out of whack from lack of sleep, lack of, I definitely went unbalanced for a while. My hormones suffered because I gained a bunch of weight. It was hard to sleep.</p> <p>I had low energy. All of these things came from that. I went to a nutritional doctor, and he told me what I needed to do, and I didn\u2019t agree with it and it scared me. I didn\u2019t want to do. I looked out there, and I looked at my personal world, and try to find somebody who is really good at fixing the issues that I was having. I found this dude.</p> <p>His name is Caleb Jennings. You can search for him. He is awesome. He is really expensive, $600 for a coaching call. I did my first coaching call with him, and he recommended a bunch of dietary things and a bunch of supplementation things and other things. What I am eating now is so weird from what I have ever eaten in my whole life. We just got started. \u201cThere\u2019s two way to do this. The fast way and the slow way.\u201d I said I wanted the fast way.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He said the fast way is really expensive. I said I didn\u2019t care. I want to get where I want to be as quick as I can. Here is all the supplements that you should be taking. I spent $2,000 in supplements. I did that, changed my diet. I have been on it for 10 days now. I can\u2019t tell you. I feel better now than I felt my entire life. It is truly amazing. I feel like I am glowing. I feel so awesome.</p> <p>The point of this podcast because now I am at the office is, start looking at the areas of your life that are unbalanced and things you are not happy with instead of trying to trailblaze on your own like we always try to do. Go find a coach for that area of your life. There are coaches out there coaching people on anything. If you are struggling spiritually or financially or health wise, go find the person who is doing exactly what you want to be doing, and figure out how much it is going to cost and pay him.</p> <p>It will get you where you want to be so much faster. I was listening to Tony Robbins this weekend, and that is one thing he said as well. If you want to be successful, you can\u2019t find a good strategy. You have to find the best strategy. Find the best strategy. Find the person that you like the most and model them. Model them to a tee. If you do that, that is where you are going to be successful.</p> <p>That is what I am doing now. I am finding the areas of my life that are lop-sided, that I am not quite happy with. I am finding coaches and get there quick. The last 10 days, we had a family trip this weekend, and I was driving, and typically when I am driving I am snacking on food and trying to stay awake.</p> <p>Kids are going crazy and it is stressful. This time I didn\u2019t eat any snacks. I was just driving there. I had so much energy. I was so much more fun. I was goofing off. It was night and day. My wife was like, \u201cwhat is wrong with you? You are so happy right now.\u201d</p> <p>I said I don\u2019t know. From the changes in my diet and supplementation, I feel like a million bucks. I am going to find some coaches for the other areas of my life I am struggling with, and I will be firing those as well. Do the same. Appreciate you guys. Thanks for listening. Have an awesome day, and I will talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "06:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_97.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1411492165, "title": "Episode #96 \u2013 The Reverse Product Launch", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A cool new way that we are rolling out our new software to the world.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about the Clickfunnels product launch and how it\u2019s different than other product launches.</p> <p>Here are the coolest reasons to listen to this episode:</p> <ul> <li>How a product launch works and why it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to have all your ducks in a row.</li> <li>How this launch is really more like a reverse product launch and how it will work.</li> <li>And Why Clickfunnels is being launched differently.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear the plan of the Clickfunnels product launch.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a very special launch-day \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d</p> <p>Hey, everyone. It\u2019s been a little while since I talked to you guys, probably because we have been killing ourselves getting Click Funnels launched out. I\u2019m driving home at about four in the morning, and I\u2019m driving back a few hours later. I\u2019m usually a little bit too tired to talk [laughs], but the good news is that today\u2019s the day. We\u2019re going to go live, and it\u2019s exciting, and it\u2019s scary. It\u2019s so many things, but above all I\u2019m excited to share this tool, this gift, whatever you want to call it, with the world, and so we have spent insane amounts of time, effort, money, energy [laughs] to bring this to everyone, and today, we have the fruition of that, which is exciting.</p> <p>What I want to talk about today, just while I\u2019m thinking about it, every one of us, depending on if you\u2019ve got a business already, and you\u2019re rolling out new ideas, new projects, new things, or those who are just getting started, there comes a time when you have to launch, and a lot of times, you probably think that all of us who are doing launches, that we\u2019ve got everything, all of our ducks in a row, and it\u2019s always perfect, and it\u2019s sunshine and roses, but the reality is, it is crazy every single time. We\u2019re juggling a million different things, trying to get everything done, but it\u2019s fun to see it all come together. Now one thing that we learned from doing this or any launch is that first when you start a project, you get all of these things you want to do and then as you get closer and closer to the deadline, you\u2019ve got to start chopping things and pulling things off, and it gets smaller and smaller until you get to where you\u2019ve got something that you can actually do and put out there in the world, and even right now, it\u2019s kind of fun with this launch. We kept on changing it and figuring out what we had to have to go live, and we picked a date, and we\u2019ve stuck to it, and now it\u2019s go time.</p> <p>One thing that\u2019s interesting that we\u2019re doing on this launch \u2013 I think we\u2019re going to start a trend \u2013 maybe. I\u2019m not sure, but we\u2019re doing a reverse launch, so most people do product launches where they show you training video number one, then video number two, then video number three, and then video number four they sell you, and they open the cart and you can go in and you can sign up. This one is going to be backwards.</p> <p>What we\u2019re doing is inside Click Funnels, we\u2019ve got basically five or six different funnel types. Today we\u2019re going to launch, and we\u2019re going to launch one funnel type, which is our opt-in funnels, which that, by itself, makes us a better alternative than any of our competitors, so it does it better, easier, just right out of the gate. That\u2019s the first thing we\u2019re launching today, and that will give us a chance where the promotional video\u2019s all about that feature and about thing, and we\u2019re talking about that one little thing, and then two days later, we\u2019re going to unlock the next feature, which is our automated webinar funnels and our webinar funnels, and so that will come out. Then, \u201cBoom,\u201d we\u2019ll launch a new sales video with that. We\u2019ll have training that goes with everything and we\u2019ll indoctrinate and get people using that, and then three days later, we open our sales funnels, and after they open it, we\u2019ll go in there and help people get those integrated and get their shopping carts in there, et cetera, et cetera, and then after that we have launch funnels and the membership sites, but we\u2019re doing an internal rolling launch where we\u2019re rolling out new features every three or four days, for a couple of reasons. One is that it gives our affiliates a reason to promote every two or three days, which is very good for sales. That\u2019s the first thing.</p> <p>The second thing is it gives us a chance on the support side to make sure we\u2019ve mastered one funnel type, and make sure that it\u2019s perfect and that we have templates and Q&amp;As and all of those types of things. Just to make sure we\u2019ve got that one funnel perfect. And then on the third is that it gives the customers the ability to really get in there and immerse and learn one thing at a time, and so anyway, we\u2019re excited. That\u2019s the strategy, and it\u2019s never been done before, so it will be fun to see what happens on a reverse launch, and see if it blows up in our faces, or if it does awesomely, but either way we\u2019re excited, and just really excited to share Click Funnels with the world.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny. Somebody posted on Facebook the other day about how they thought Click Funnels was the biggest marketing innovation since e-mail auto-responders, which I personally do believe, but I remember that I posted in there \u2013 and I thought about it a little bit before I posted, and I posted, and I said, \u201cLook, guys, even if we never sold a single copy, this tool will make me and make my company millions of dollars. I\u2019m just so grateful to be the one that has the chance to share it with you guys,\u201d and that\u2019s really how I feel, and so today, if you\u2019re listening to this podcast, go get your Click Funnels account. Again, we\u2019re giving away free trials, and I promise you guys you\u2019re going to love it. It\u2019s going to change your business. It\u2019s changed mine already, and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the office now. I\u2019m going to go in. I\u2019m going to push the last few buttons and give everybody everything live, and in a few hours it\u2019ll be show time. I appreciate you guys listening in, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "05:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_96.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1410190387, "title": "Episode #95 \u2013 The Unbalanced Life", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The secrets of temporarily unbalancing your life to achieve your dreams\u2026</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about why his life is unbalanced because he isn\u2019t getting any sleep and why right now, that is okay.</p> <p>Here are some things you\u2019ll hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why entrepreneurs don\u2019t have the privilege of living a balanced life when you are just starting out.</li> <li>And why you have to sacrifice balance sometimes to get the momentum you need to succeed.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out why it\u2019s okay for Russell to live an unbalanced life sometimes.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a special late night \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d Actually it should be called, \u201cMarketing in Your Ferrari\u201d, because right now, late at night, I\u2019m driving to the office in the Ferrari.</p> <p>Hey, everyone. I want to welcome you to this webinar. This is not a webinar. This is a podcast. You can tell my brain\u2019s a little bit fried right now. Over the last week or so, we\u2019ve had Todd and Dylan and Chris and the entire Click Funnels crew flew in to Boise so we could focus on getting Click Funnels live and launched, and it\u2019s been super fun. We\u2019re halfway through the week, and we\u2019ve got the other half coming up, and so I\u2019m going in for another late-night session so that we can keep cranking this thing out so we can have it ready for you guys all to experience here soon, and I\u2019m really excited. We\u2019ve got some amazing changes. If any of you guys have used Click Funnels yet, you\u2019re going to be blown away by the new editor and the new UI that we\u2019re rolling it out on Thursday, and so we\u2019re trying to hit a hard deadline and get it all done by Thursday, which will be pretty cool. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re all killing ourselves right now.</p> <p>I was thinking about some stuff recently. In my life, I\u2019ve been trying to do so many things. I\u2019ve been trying to get this new company launched while keeping our old company growing, while being a dad with my kids now in football, and my daughter in soccer, and then trying to be a good husband, and trying to do all of my church responsibilities. There\u2019re so many things that are happening right now, and I\u2019ve been trying to live a balanced life and because of that, I basically had to cut out sleep almost completely from my schedule, which has caught up with me. It\u2019s been hurting, so I\u2019ve been trying to get some more sleep, and so I\u2019m trying to figure out, what do you do? They always talk about living a balanced life, and how do you do that as an entrepreneur, especially when you\u2019re trying to launch a new company, and trying to provide value to the world. How do you do it?</p> <p>I was thinking about a couple of things, and funny enough, by both of them coming from Mark Cuban, who, if you guys don\u2019t know who Mark Cuban is, you\u2019re probably living under a rock right now, but one thing he said that was really interesting, and I\u2019m going to slaughter the quote, but he said something along the lines of \u2013 something about sleeping at night, like, \u201cWhile my competitors sleep, and I\u2019m staying up at night getting ready to kick his butt,\u201d or something like that, and so that\u2019s been our mantra, because we\u2019ve been going through this. We\u2019ve got a couple of big competitors, some of them with VC money and everything that we\u2019re competing against. We\u2019re the ones busting our butts at night while they\u2019re sleeping soundly in their beds, and they\u2019re not going to know what came and hit them, so that\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>The other Mark Cuban thing was I was listening to, watching \u201cShark Tank\u201d. This was a couple of months ago, but I remember this one scene, and it kept replaying through my head this weekend as I was trying to figure out how to become more balanced. He was talking about how, as an entrepreneur, when you\u2019re first getting started out, you can\u2019t lead a balanced life. He was talking about how things have to fall to the wayside, because there\u2019s so much effort and momentum that has to go into launching this thing. He was like, \u201cEntrepreneurs do not get the privilege,\u201d or whatever you want to call it, \u201cthe luxury of having a balanced life when they\u2019re getting started.\u201d Someday, obviously, the goal of being an entrepreneur is to shift that, right? So all of this effort, you kind of frontloaded turns into this company that pays for itself, pays for you and your family so that you can go and live those things you want.</p> <p>It got me thinking about that. It\u2019s not good to always live your life unbalanced, but there are times when I think you have to, to be able to push forward and to succeed. I look at when I was wrestling in high school and college. My life was very unbalanced towards that, but that\u2019s what I had to do to be able to succeed. You\u2019ve got to sacrifice other things to be able to do that.</p> <p>I look at the two years I spend on a mission for my church, and when I was doing that, life was very unbalanced. I was giving up everything else to be able to focus on that aspect and to be able to serve the world in that way, and so while I think that the goal is to get to a balanced life,\u00a0 I think in order to get the momentum you need to succeed at almost anything, that initial inertia comes from being not in balance, and so you have to kind of pick and choose.</p> <p>Tonight, my wife and I sat down, and we started talking about what aspects I need to cut during this process to be able to function, so there\u2019s going to be some things in my life that I love that I\u2019m going to have to cut out just so that I don\u2019t die [laughs] from lack of sleep and lack of everything, right? So one of the things I\u2019m going to cut out is going to be weight-training. It\u2019s going to be this and that, and like, \u201cWhat are the pieces I\u2019m going to pull out so that I can focus on the good stuff which is obviously launching this company and having success with it and all of those types of things.</p> <p>Anyway, kind of fun \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going down. I\u2019m at the office now. Late night, I\u2019m driving the Ferrari. Things are good. Time to get this Click Funnels launched so it can change the world, both your guys\u2019 and mine. I\u2019m excited, and I will talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "05:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_95.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1409842216, "title": "Episode #94 \u2013 Working On The Defense First", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Lessons that I learned from my Greco coach, and how they 10x\u2019d my results.</p> <p>On this episode Russell talks about his wrestling career and some of the things he learned when he started practicing for the Olympics with a new coach.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you will hear in today\u2019s episode:</p> <ul> <li>A brief history of Russell\u2019s wrestling career and some of the experiences he had.</li> <li>Why he questioned his Olympic wrestling coach until he saw the brilliance of what he was teaching.</li> <li>And why it is important to use what he learned in other aspects of his life.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear what Russell\u2019s Olympic Wrestling Coach taught him.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a very late night \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d</p> <p>Hey, everyone. It is eleven o\u2019clock at night. I just got done with a two-hour wrestling match, and it was awesome. One of my buddies who\u2019s been my jiu jitsu coach for the last few years or so \u2013 I wanted start to do some hard wrestling, and he was trying to learn some wrestling, so we\u2019ve been going a few nights a week at night and beating the trash out of each other. We just got done with that, and I had so much fun. It was awesome. Despite the fact that I\u2019m old and I\u2019m out of shape, I could still do all right in wrestling, which makes me happy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got a little drive home right now, and I want to talk about some stuff. I have no idea if this is going to relate to you or your business at all, but I think it\u2019s really interesting, and I think that there are things that you can grasp from it, whether it be in your business or in your personal life. I\u2019m going to be honest. I don\u2019t know how these directly relate to you specifically, but it\u2019s a principle that I learned in a really interesting way, and I\u2019m going to share that with you, and hopefully you\u2019ll get some value out of it. I think that if you think about it, and try to figure out how to apply it to your circumstances, you\u2019ll find value, but it\u2019s not going to be surface-level. It\u2019s not going to be like, \u201cOh, yeah. This is how this works,\u201d and so if you listen to this podcast, and you don\u2019t get it [laughs], listen to it again, and then just think about it, and think about a couple of different aspects of your life. Think about your personal life, your business, your relationships, because I think that this is applicable on a lot of different levels besides the one I\u2019m going to share with you right now. There\u2019s my preview for this podcast.</p> <p>The backstory is \u2013 a lot of you guys know my wrestling background. I wrestled in high school. I was a state champ. I had a chance to go the High School National Tournament, and I took second there. I became an All-American, lost in the High School National finals by two points. It was a really close match, but it was amazing. Out of all of the things in my life that I identify myself as, I still to this day, if you were to ask me, \u201cWho are you, Russell?\u201d I still consider myself a wrestler.</p> <p>That was, more than business, more than anything else, that was the thing that defined me and made me who I am. I just love wrestling, and so I got done with high school, I got a scholarship offers at a couple of places. I wrestled a year at BYU, and then they cut the wrestling program, so I transferred up to Boise State. I wrestled my last four years there, and I just had a great experience. I can\u2019t tell you how many happy moments and the stuff that came from that, but again, the defining thing in my life is definitely that.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure that all of you guys have in your life something that \u2013 I look at my life before wrestling, and I\u2019d come home from school and I\u2019d watch cartoons [laughs] until dinner, and then I\u2019d eat dinner, then I\u2019d go to bed. It was the first thing I had where I had a dream, and I had a goal, and I put everything \u2013 my blood, sweat, and tears into it and chased that dream and achieved some big goals, and also didn\u2019t achieve some goals, and I learned how to win, and I learned how to lose. It was just \u2013 to this day, the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever had a chance to experience \u2013 that was my wrestling.</p> <p>Then when I got done with college, I took a couple of years off, and ate a lot of food. My wife got pregnant with twins, and I gained a lot of weight because of this whole thing, and fast forward about four or five years later, I just really missed wrestling. My business was cranking. We were making money, and I did a podcast about this earlier, so I\u2019m not going to tell the whole story again, but I decided I wanted to train for the Olympics. We built an Olympic training center out here in Boise. I hired an Olympic Greco coach, moved him out here. We moved out six or seven guys who were training for the Olympics, and I hired them. They worked for me, and then we were wrestling every day. It was a really cool experience.</p> <p>But the story I want to tell you guys today is we brought this coaches in to Ivan Ivanoff, and to this day, one of the most amazing people I\u2019ve ever met. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even told him this before, but one of the people I look up to more than almost anyone else in the world, and just an amazing human and an amazing person. I remember we brought him in as this coach, and he had actually come from Bulgaria with basically nothing \u2013 showed up here in America. He moved out to Utah. He got this job coaching this little kids\u2019 club. My little brother\u2019s in that club, and in two years, he took my brother, and this group of kids who didn\u2019t know Greco at all, and within a year and a half to two years, my brother took second place in the country in Utah and the state took first in the\u00a0 country in Greco.</p> <p>He has this amazing ability to put his hands on somebody, and have them transformed. As soon as he did that with these high school kids, then the Olympic team brought him up, and he started coaching the Olympic Greco team, and raised up some of the most amazing athletes really, really quickly and just awesome, so when I wanted to start wrestling again, I was going to have someone, I wanted Ivan, and I\u2019d never had a chance to personally work with him, but I saw what he did with my brother. I saw what he did with these other people, and so I wanted him there. I was lucky enough and blessed to have him agree, and he moved to Boise and he started coaching us.</p> <p>It was interesting because I remember the first probably four or five months, we were practicing, and I was really frustrated about how he ran practices. I was almost confused, and I was thinking, \u201cWhat is this guy doing? Does he not know how wrestling practices run?\u201d Literally, what we would do is every Sunday we\u2019d come in, and in wrestling you\u2019ve got an offensive guy and a defensive guy, right? So I\u2019m practicing moves on him, so I\u2019ll have a guy stand there, and I\u2019ll practice shooting on him, and I\u2019ll practice taking him down. I\u2019ll practice different moves. The defensive guy plays like a dummy, and he\u2019ll let you take him down. That\u2019s how you drill, right? You practice that way, and then you go and you wrestle matches where everyone\u2019s going live, so you have this dummy\u2019s day where your defensive person is like a dummy just standing there and going through the moves, and then you have full-speed wrestling where the guy\u2019s going a hundred percent.</p> <p>Ivan, literally, probably about the first four or five months, all he would do with us is he would drill the defensive guy on how to be a good partner, and like I said, I was getting so frustrated, like, \u201cIvan, you need to be teaching us stuff. I need to be learning some new take-downs. You need to be drilling us,\u201d but he would focus on the defensive guy and getting the defensive guy to be a better partner, and teaching him to react the right way as a defensive partner needs to do.</p> <p>Literally, every single day, we\u2019d come to practice and we would drill defensively how to be good defenders during practice, how to be a good dummy man. I was so frustrated, and I remember one day he told me, \u201cRussell, right now when our guys are coming in here, they\u2019re drilling against people who don\u2019t know how to be dummies, so that\u2019s not going to help them in competition. In competition, if you\u2019re not practicing against somebody who is a good partner, who is giving you the right looks and the feel and the pressure and things like that, if you\u2019re not practicing perfectly in your practices, when you get in competition, you\u2019re not going to be at that level,\u201d and so he spent those three or four or five months getting us to be good defensive wrestlers, to be good dummies, and then as soon as he did that, and as soon as he got to the point where he said, \u201cYes, now you guys are good defensively. Now you\u2019re good practice partners. Now we can focus on the offense,\u201d and then he started focusing on the offense, and I saw the brilliance in what he did.</p> <p>Literally because everyone on our team became great at being the dummy, and at giving the right looks and the right pressure when someone was drilling on you, when he started introducing new moves, we were able to pick them up, and not only pick them up faster, but our technique was perfect because the partners we were drilling against were defending them perfectly, and they were giving the right pressure and doing the right things, and so you could literally just start seeing the huge improvements in yourself. I look and a month and a half, two months later, that team that we had built up went to the U.S. tournament, and we were this unnamed team. I can\u2019t remember \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure we won first place at that tournament, if not it was just because we didn\u2019t have as many guys as the other teams, but just we did awesome. We had three or four guys in the finals, and it was really fascinating to watch that.</p> <p>I\u2019d forgotten that lesson, until a little while ago when I was wrestling with Jason, my jiu jitsu coach, and I told him that. I said, \u201cWhat was interesting when we first brought Ivan in, the first three or four months, he didn\u2019t focus on techniques for offensive techniques. He focused on drilling the defense man and making him become the perfect partner, so that when we did introduce techniques, we got those techniques perfectly, as opposed to picking them up in an un-perfect environment.</p> <p>I told Jason that, and Jason got really excited. He went back to his club, and he started focusing on the guys he was training, not so much on offensive, because he said, \u201cOffensively these guys come to practice and the defensive guys are just lying there. They\u2019re doing to moves perfectly, and then they go to tournaments, and they go to matches, and they go to fights, and they\u2019re losing because when they go against somebody who\u2019s good, the pressure and the things that are happening defensively at practice are not at the same level as what\u2019s happening in the tournaments. So he went back and he started focusing on that part of it with his guys, and he started seeing these huge leaps and bounds.</p> <p>I think that a lot of times in all aspects of our life, we do what I thought we should do, and what I came in and wanted to coach my team, right? It was, \u201cLet\u2019s focus on offensive, offensive, offensive,\u201d and that\u2019s not always the right way to start something. Building the foundation and understanding that part of it, which may seem like you\u2019re taking a step back. It might seem like you\u2019re going slower at first, but it builds a solid structure and builds a platform where now you can offensively grow ten, twenty, thirty times faster.</p> <p>Again, I\u2019m not sure how this relates back to your life \u2013 if it\u2019s in your relationships, if it\u2019s in your businesses, if it\u2019s in some other area \u2013 your finances, your religion \u2013 whatever it is, but I want you to think about that. What part of your life \u2013 it could be your nutrition. It could be your whatever, like what is the equivalent of what I talked about? What can you step back and focus on that builds out a better foundation so that when you are trying to make those offensive moves, you can grow and see ten, twenty, thirty times results from the exact same amount of effort?</p> <p>Just kind of a thought. The guy got really excited about it, and I\u2019ve been trying to figure out different ways to implement it back in to my life now, and I wanted to share it with you guys\u00a0 and let you guys stew on it. Again, if you don\u2019t get it yet, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s right in front of your face. It\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to think about, and figure out how to relate it to yourselves.</p> <p>I\u2019m here now. I\u2019m at my home. I\u2019m going to go shower, and I\u2019m going to take a nice, long nap, or I\u2019ll just go to bed, and I\u2019ll see you guys maybe tomorrow. I\u2019m excited. Click Funnels relaunch is about to happen, and I\u2019ve got Dylan and Todd in town. They just got here tonight, and I\u2019m super fired up. We\u2019ve got a new editor. It\u2019s an exciting time, so maybe I\u2019ll share some of our pre-launch strategies with you guys tomorrow on a podcast, because I think you\u2019ll enjoy it. We\u2019re doing some cool stuff and building a lot of buzz, and I\u2019m excited for it.</p> <p>With that said, you guys, I appreciate you all for listening, and I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "12:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_94.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1409334842, "title": "Episode #93 \u2013 The Power Of The Order Form Bump", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How I can make as much front end revenue giving my product away for free, as I can selling it for full price.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about something so easy that everyone should be doing it, but nobody is.</p> <p>Here are some cool things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>The secret that has transformed Russell\u2019s business.</li> <li>And How Russell can get three times as many customers and make the exact same amount of front end cash, before up-sells.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to find out how Russell was able to transform the way he does business.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to another \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d</p> <p>Hey, everyone. It\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve done one of these. I\u2019ve been super busy, and was actually out until about three o\u2019clock last night recording the coolest promo video ever. I\u2019m excited to launch it. It\u2019s a blend between the FourHourBody.com, if you watch Tim Ferriss\u2019 promo video there \u2013 it\u2019s a blend between that and \u201cPrison Break\u201d [laughs], and I think it\u2019s going to be pretty cool. It took us six hours to film, literally, twelve seconds of footage, so we\u2019ll see how it all turns out. In my head it\u2019s amazing, so I\u2019m hoping that it actually turns out that way. That\u2019s pretty exciting.</p> <p>What I want to talk to you guys about right now is something that I think is literally changing my business right now, and it\u2019s so simple and so easy that everybody should be doing it \u2013 and I don\u2019t see anybody doing it yet. Actually, one other dude, I do. One dude was smart enough to see what I did and copy me.</p> <p>So this is the concept. Let\u2019s say you wanted to sell a $47 product. You\u2019ve got your $47 product, and you\u2019ve got your up sells, and you\u2019ve got your down sells. That\u2019s just trying to sell. For a typical $47 product, you\u2019ve got to write a really good VSL. It\u2019s a lot of work to sell that, right? So you take that into consideration, and there\u2019s your $47 product.</p> <p>Or you create a free shipping product, and then afterwards you have the same up sell and the same down sell you do on the $47 one, but it\u2019s free plus shipping. I want you to go head-to-head with those. I\u2019m curious. If you send a thousand people to both of those, and on your free plus shipping offer, your copy\u2019s not amazing, but it\u2019s a good offer, so people want it. How many people would you think want both of them? I was thinking we\u2019d be conservative. From $47 down to free, let\u2019s say we get three times as many, so let\u2019s say at $47, I get ten customers. At free, I get thirty customers.</p> <p>Now I want to ask you \u2013 do you guys agree that that\u2019s pretty realistic? If I had almost the identical product, if it was just as good of a product, with one I\u2019d get three times as many customers by not charging them and by giving it away for free? They just cover five or six bucks for shipping and handling? I\u2019d say that three times is pretty conservative. Let\u2019s say three times four \u2013 this argument of what I\u2019m trying to sell you guys on right now, okay? [laughs] So there\u2019s that.</p> <p>Now this is a little secret that we figured out about seven or eight months ago that is literally transforming all three of our core companies. On the page that we\u2019re taking the product, we have the order form, and they put in their credit card information, and then right before they click \u201cSubmit\u201d, there\u2019s a little tiny block that has two sentences. The sentences just say, \u201cYes, I want this,\u201d and \u201cHey, do you want me to throw in this extra thing that does this that\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s an extra $47. This is a one-time offer, and not available anywhere else.\u201d It\u2019s literally probably thirty or forty words. I\u2019ll have to find out how many exactly, but that\u2019s about it, and then we sell this $47 product. That\u2019s called a bump, that\u2019s like an order form bump.</p> <p>Now, right now, we\u2019re averaging almost forty percent, so I think it\u2019s thirty-eight percent is what we\u2019re averaging \u2013 people who buy our free plus shipping offers, who click on that little button. So let\u2019s say we broke it down, and we only got 33.3 percent to do it. So now I want to come back. We\u2019ve got two offers. The $47 product that we\u2019re selling along with our up sells, and then we\u2019ve got our free plus shipping product, but on the order form, we\u2019ve got this little bump that says \u201cHey, only $47\u201d, and right now, we\u2019re getting a third of the people to take that. What just happened?</p> <p>What just happened is, we get the exact same amount of front-end revenue. Ten customers at $47 or thirty customers at zero plus shipping and handling with a $47 bump, if one-third of those people are taking that bump, which they are in all three of our tests right now. Do you guys see what I\u2019m saying? I can get three times as many customers and make the exact same amount of front-end cash before people see up sells by doing the free plus shipping on page order form bump as I can for a $47 straight sale, and the $47 straight sale \u2013 I\u2019ve got to sell the crap out of it, whereas with the free plus shipping, I\u2019ve just got to tell them that there\u2019s a cool thing for free. They pay for shipping, and on the order form I need two sentences to sell them on my core $47 product.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting. We were doing some consulting stuff, and these guys had a sales page, and then their up sell was their membership site. It was a $1 trial, and they\u2019re getting fifteen to eighteen percent of the people to take that trial. They had some really good copy \u2013 a long form video and everything to sell people on that $1 trial. I said, \u201cIf you just got rid of that whole video, added that offer to your order page, and write two sentences, they said the lowest we\u2019ve gotten is twenty-eight percent conversion. The highest is over fifty. They\u2019re averaging fifty \u2013 pretty close. I think it\u2019s thirty-eight percent or so, are taking that offer. It changes the dynamics of everything.</p> <p>So I want you to think about that. It might be kind of hard to envision from me explaining it, so listen to this two or three times, and kind of map it out, but the concept is amazing. When we launched Click Funnels, we gave away a free trial, and then we had a $47 bump on the order form. That was the lowest one, I think. We had eighteen percent of the people take that. From the eighteen percent, it made something like $60,000 in sales from giving away free accounts. So pretty sexy, pretty exciting and definitely something you guys should look at and figure out how to try to implement in your business.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the office now. I have a fun day planned out, so I will talk to you guys all again later.</p>", "duration": "06:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_93.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1408465222, "title": "Episode #92 \u2013 What If There Were Only 20 Hours In A Day?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A cool strategy to redistribute your work day into other areas of your life.</p> <p>On today\u2019s episode Russell talks about receiving advice from his life coach about shaving a couple hours off his work schedule each day.</p> <p>Here are some fun things you will hear in this episode:</p> <ul> <li>Why Russell thinks he should be able to get the same amount of work done in a 20 hour day as he would in a 24 hour day.</li> <li>Why his life coach recommends cutting two work hours out of his schedule everyday.</li> <li>And how Russell thinks these changes will go.</li> </ul> <p>So listen below to hear Russell\u2019s plan of getting the same amount of work done in less hours.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d</p> <p>Hey everyone. It\u2019s another early morning day for me today. I had my accountability call with me coach, Carl, today, which was kind of exciting. I learned some cool stuff. I\u2019m heading in to the gym, and I wanted to jump on and do a quick podcast because I thought what I learned today was pretty profound. I hope it will help a lot of you guys, too.</p> <p>All of us, as entrepreneurs, have this horrible, horrible problem of working too much. I\u2019m not sure if you guys are the same way, but I\u2019m guessing you probably are [laughs], and it\u2019s interesting. Carl \u2013 one of the reasons why I wanted him to be my accountability coach is he used to work the 9-to-5, five days a week, like all of us, and then he started cutting out Fridays, and then he started cutting out every other week and literally, right now he works Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, every other week, so he works eight days a month right now. He\u2019s making more money than he ever was working the whole time, right? Today his big challenge to me was, \u201cHey, Russell, you need to start shifting your work habits and what you\u2019re doing.\u201d It was interesting.</p> <p>He said that, \u201cDo you think that if God took the day, and instead of making it twenty-four hours, he made it thirty hours, would you get more stuff done?\u201d I was like, \u201cProbably not. Maybe a little bit, but not a ton more.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay, well what if we went the other direction. Instead of having twenty-four hours in a day, he cut it down to twenty hours a day? Do you think you would get less stuff done?\u201d and I was like, \u201cNo, I think we\u2019d still be able to get everything done in the same amount of hours. We\u2019d be able to jam it in. A lot of times, when you have less time, you get more stuff done.\u201d</p> <p>He was like, \u201cWell what if we did that to your work day? Right now, what time do you usually leave the office?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, about six.\u201d He said, \u201cLet\u2019s shave it off so that every day, you start leaving the office at four? Do you think that you could do that?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI guess I could.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat do you do from four to six, anyway?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 just stuff?\u201d He said, \u201cI bet if you cut those things out, all of the stuff you could get done prior to four. At four o\u2019clock, you have to turn your computer off, and you had to leave the office.\u201d We went through the whole process, and he committed me to doing that, which is kind of fun, so I\u2019m excited to start trying that out today.</p> <p>The next thing was he was like, \u201cWhat about Fridays, man? What do you do on Fridays?\u201d I was explaining. I explained what I do, and he said, \u201cFriday\u2019s kind of dead day, then, right?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell I get stuff done, but, yeah, it\u2019s not as productive usually,\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat if you just jammed all of your Friday stuff in to Friday morning, and then every Friday at noon you left and took that last half of the day off? What do you think would happen?\u201d I said, \u201cProbably not a lot. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d lose out on too much stuff.\u201d So he kind of committed me to that. So I am shaving two hours a day off of my work day, and then I\u2019m going to shave half a day off of my Fridays, and just see what happens, and my guess is that the world\u2019s not going to come to an end. I\u2019m excited to find out [laughs].</p> <p>I want you guys to think about that as well for your life. All of us don\u2019t have enough time \u2013 enough time for your family, enough time for your church, enough time for all of the different pieces you\u2019re having, but we spend so much time at the office working. So I\u2019m going to try to shave off those two hours and put it into use in other things in my life that are out of balance and see what happens. I\u2019m guessing, I\u2019m not sure yet, but I\u2019m guessing that everything else will just fall in to the right spots. So I\u2019m going to try it. I want to encourage you guys to try it as well.</p> <p>I remember one time I was listening to this old cassette course I bought from Jay Conrad Levinson, Jay Abraham, Chet Holmes \u2013 I can\u2019t remember who all. It was called \u201cGuerilla versus Gorilla\u201d, and it was awesome. One of the concepts I learned in there, Jay Conrad Levinson was saying that people have habits \u2013 a lot of us will kick our business and work eighty hours a week, and we\u2019re going to work so that eventually we can launch whatever, and then we can cut down to twenty hours a week. He said that what he\u2019s found is that whatever your habits are when you start will be your habits forever. If you want to live a lifestyle where you work twenty hours a week, you have to start working twenty hours a week from day one, otherwise you\u2019ll just never get there. It will become a habit.

This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d</p> <p>Hey, guys and gals, and everyone who\u2019s listening. I hope you\u2019ve had an awesome day so far today. If you\u2019re in the car right now, then you\u2019re just like me, and you\u2019re getting excited and pumped up for the day \u2013 trying to get in the state, right?</p> <p>I just want to talk about what my mind\u2019s been on all weekend, because it\u2019s been kind of exciting. For the last however many years \u2013 seven or eight years, I\u2019ve been watching everyone do their big product launches. They do the multi-video sequences and all of those kinds of things. I\u2019ve done a lot of product launches in my day, but I never really did the whole multi-video thing. For whatever reason, I just never did it.</p> <p>The first time I\u2019ve really done it was with the Click Funnels launch to our own internal list, where basically \u2013 and partly it was because we had these really cool product launch funnels that I wanted to test out, where it lets you do four videos and all kinds of stuff, and so I got really excited to try it out. So we made these four videos and they were fun and they were entertaining and we got to use some good content. It was just kind of cool.</p> <p>The coolest thing about it was that people loved the videos. Even those that didn\u2019t buy it, they watched the videos. They loved them. They build a good relationship, and it was cool. I keep thinking more and more about that. I remember I was at a Mastermind meeting, and Frank Kern was there and he was talking what he calls \u201cindoctrination pieces\u201d. He says that before he sells anything, he sends out three or four e-mails of these different indoctrination pieces to pre-dispose people to actually buying. He was showing videos he\u2019s send out. He was showing pdfs. He was showing all of this stuff to go out there and give cool stuff out before you ask for a sale.</p> <p>The other day on Facebook, I was watching a copywriter [laughs]. He\u2019s one of my friends. He was bragging about two or three letters he wrote for Frank Kern, and how awesome they were, and how they did, [imitates] \u201ca million dollars in like twenty minutes,\u201d and all of this garbage. I was like, \u201cYeah, but in twenty minutes, there\u2019s no way everyone read the sales letter. They just bought because they wanted to buy.\u201d It\u2019s kind of like he had this feeling.</p> <p>Frank came in and he was like, \u201cHey, so-and-so\u2019s sales letters are awesome, but you have to understand that the sales letter\u2019s just one piece of the sequence to this. The sequence is what sells people. It\u2019s all of these indoctrination pieces. It\u2019s all of these things that are happening ahead of time that pre-frame them and get them prepared and get them warmed up to actually buy, where at the last minute, a lot of people never even read the sales letter. They\u2019re just going to buy it because they\u2019re going to buy.</p> <p>That was kind of a big \u201caha\u201d, a big epiphany for me. Having the perfect, scripted sales pitch is awesome, and especially for cold trafficking. If they don\u2019t know you, and you\u2019re driving them in from Facebook or somewhere where you\u2019ve got to click and you\u2019ve got to convert them really, really quick. A good old-fashioned video sales letter or an actual sales letter is definitely the way you\u2019ve got to go to convert them, but after they\u2019re on your list, or you\u2019ve got partners promoting it and things like that, I think the best way to do it is to take them through a gauntlet of pre-indoctrination videos and audios and cool things, just to build up that relationship, and do that first.</p> <p>I got excited. I\u2019m going to go back through all of them. We\u2019re in this process now of re-launching our affiliate program and re-rolling out each of our products and a bunch of other cool things. We\u2019re going to be doing that for each one. I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>For example, this week we\u2019re rolling out a new project called \u201cList Hacker\u201d, and I\u2019m really excited for it. With that, we basically used four different videos. The first video is this one that I recorded about a year ago with a guy named Jonathan [inaudible 2:25:14]. He came out and it was a video that I recorded at my old duplex, which is where I actually started my business. I told my list-building story, and how I\u2019d gotten shut down for spamming, and all of these things I\u2019d tried to do. I told that story, and it was fun.</p> <p>So that\u2019s video number one in the sequence, and then number two is me sitting in my office with a whole bunch of junk mail, and I\u2019m talking about junk mail and why it\u2019s important. I tell that whole story, which is again, not really a sales piece. It\u2019s just kind of getting people excited, and it\u2019s something cool that they can watch and get away from their day. The third one is where I do a little more teaching and training how to map out what a list hacking funnel looks like, and in the fourth one I actually show us doing a trip to Kenya, because a percentage of all the money I make goes back to the kids in Kenya. Then from there, \u201cBoom,\u201d then we push the actual sell \u2013 push people to the actual sales video which then slam dunks and closes them.</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of fun. I look at all of my projects. What kind of cool videos can I do to illustrate the concept and get people excited and provide some value before I ever ask for the sale? That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go back and do with all of our stuff. Just for you guys to think about that, even if it\u2019s not awesome sales pieces, just think of three or four cool content videos around that you for each of my products, just to get my warm list internally to get excited and build a little hype, a little excitement, give some value away, and like Frank Kerns, some pre-indoctrination pieces. Get them re-indoctrinated to what you need them to think to be able to purchase your product or service.</p> <p>That\u2019s it for today. I\u2019m going to go in today and bust out some pre-indoctrination videos. We should be rolling out the first video, \u201cList Hacking\u201d today, which I\u2019m excited for, and then we\u2019ll go from there. All right, everyone, have a great day.</p>", "duration": "06:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_91.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1407511324, "title": "Episode #90 \u2013 Work Your Way In Vs. Buy Your Way In", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The easy way to get to the top.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d</p> <p>Hey everyone. I\u2019m heading back from the gym right now, and I just had a quick thought. Because the drive from my gym to my house is even less than from the office, this one won\u2019t probably be that long.</p> <p>Last night, I had a really cool experience. I had a chance to talk to Dave Asprey from Bullet-Proof Executive. First off, it was really, really cool. I\u2019ve been trying to do the Bulletproof Diet. I thought I was doing it well, but I\u2019ve been gaining weight and gaining body fat. I was like [laughs], \u201cI don\u2019t think this Bulletproof thing is really working. I think there\u2019re some issues here, and so two months ago, I was on his site, and he had a link. It was like, \u201cHey, five hundred bucks for a one-on-one consultation.\u201d I was like, \u201cAll right. Sweet. I can do that,\u201d and so I paid him five hundred bucks. Last night was my one-on-one consultation with him, and it was pretty cool, because literally, I sat down with him on Skype chat, and within about thirty seconds, he told me everything I was doing wrong, why I was screwing it up. I always thought I was doing it intelligently, and I was doing it totally backwards. We completely rebuilt the whole thing, and it was awesome. I gained more from that hour than I could have gotten in five years reading every one of his blog posts, listening to all of his podcasts, and going through all of that kind of stuff.</p> <p>It made me start thinking about how when I first got started in this business, I met this guy. I can\u2019t remember his name, but it was at one of Armand Morin\u2019s events, and I may have even done a podcast about this before, because I think it\u2019s a cool concept, but I started thinking about it again last night. It was a young kid, and he was at this event, and he had joined Armand\u2019s Platinum Group, and I was talking to him, and he was in ten different Platinum groups, and all of these different Masterminds. I was like, \u201cDude, how in the world can you afford all of that? That stuff\u2019s expensive.\u201d He said, \u201cRussell, I learned something early in my life. There\u2019re two ways to get to the top. Number one, you can work your way in. Number two, you can buy your way in. I choose the second. I could spend three years trying to get to know Armand and become friends with him and do a deal with him and learn from him, and all kinds of stuff, or I can just pay him some money, and \u201cBoom,\u201d buy my way in. I buy into everyone\u2019s programs,\u201d and he just works. \u2013\u201cThere\u2019re two ways. You either work your way in or buy your way in. It\u2019s faster to buy your way in.\u201d</p> <p>I was thinking about how with Dave Asprey, I paid him five hundred bucks. Not a lot of money, but I had a chance to spend an hour with him on Skype. We got to know each other. At the end of it, we talked about his book he\u2019s launching. I talked to him about how to promote it, and \u201cBoom.\u201d We feel like we had a connection, and now moving forward, I feel like he will be a friend \u2013 someone who I\u2019ll be able to help in the future. He\u2019ll help me, and that kind of thing, whereas if it was someone who I had just contacted him normally, I probably could have gotten through to him. I probably could have met him, but not at the same level as when I was just able to come and just pay and get in that way.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m looking at the people who are in my Inner Circle, people who are in my Knight program and in our coaching programs, and its fun, because literally, I have Voxer on my phone, and all of the people in my Inner Circle have Voxer with me. I know their businesses. They ask me questions all of the time. I know their ins and outs. I know their ups and their downs. They get so much more access to me, and I feel like they\u2019re my friends now. Again, I never would have met these people if they\u2019d had to work their way in, but they bought their way in, and now \u201cBoom,\u201d I\u2019m here. I\u2019m on their team. I\u2019m helping them out in their businesses, and it\u2019s a ton of fun.</p> <p>There was a guy the other day who \u2013 now, I charge a lot more for an hour-long consult than Dave does, but he bought an hour-long consult with me. It was really cool. I went through the consult, and I gave him my all in an hour. We built out an entirely new business model for him online, mapped out the whole thing for him, and it turned out pretty awesome. At the end of it, he was like, \u201cHey, Russell, by the way, I\u2019ve got this new thing,\u201d that he was doing, and he explained it to me, and it was awesome, and now I am giving him money back in exchange for his thing. But he bought his way in, and that conversation probably never would have happened. It cost him money, but again, in return, I ended up investing in something he had, and he made his money back immediately. It was pretty cool.</p> <p>That\u2019s my thought for today. There\u2019re two ways to get in, again, you guys. You can work your way in, or you can buy your way in, but it\u2019s always better and faster to buy your way in. That\u2019s my thoughts. If you don\u2019t have the money, then go fricking earn it. Go get a job. Go rake some leaves.</p> <p>I literally, when I bought my first thing, I had to go rake leaves. I bought a $12 rake and a tarp at Home Depot, and I raked leaves for four or five weekends in a row to be able to invest in Mark Joyner\u2019s \u201cFarewell Package\u201d. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do sometimes \u2013 buy your way in.</p> <p>That\u2019s my message for today. I hope that helps some of you guys. Check out Dave Asprey\u2019s stuff. Super cool guy. I\u2019m excited for his book to come out. We\u2019ll talk to you guys all again really, really soon. Thanks.</p>", "duration": "05:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_90.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1407171788, "title": "Episode #89 \u2013 What She Missed At The Luau", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The secret of being present all the time.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I\u2019m here in the car today with Dallin, who is my little entrepreneur, and we\u2019re here for another exciting episode of \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>So today, its summertime still, and Dallin wanted to come to work with me today. He\u2019s got his little packet of stuff to work on his projects. It\u2019s going to be exciting. What are you planning on doing today?</p> <p>Dallin: Find out how to build a robot.</p> <p>Russell: He\u2019s going to find out how to build a robot, which is a very important task. Do you think we\u2019re going to sell that if we figure it out?</p> <p>Dallin:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe.</p> <p>Russell: Maybe. That\u2019s a good idea. So that\u2019s his plan today [laughs].</p> <p>I wanted to tell you guys about a thought I had over the last week. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done a \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d, and one of the main reasons was I in Maui with my beautiful wife. She had a birthday, and I surprised her, and had her family come and watch the kids while we were gone, and took her to Maui.</p> <p>We had a lot of fun, but one of the things I learned on this trip \u2013 I re-realized, and I wanted to give it to you. I want to share with you guys. One of the last nights we were there, we went to this luau. Everything out there \u2013 you know how tourist traps are \u2013 they\u2019re super expensive, right? I think it was a hundred and fifty bucks a person, so it cost us three hundred bucks to go there and have this luau, and we were sitting there and we ate dinner, and we enjoyed the conversation with some people we met, and it was really fun. Then they do an actual luau dance, with the hula dances and all of this stuff. It was really neat. We were watching it, and right in front of us to the right, there was this lady who got out her video camera. She opened it up, and she clicked \u201cRecord\u201d, and she was looking through this little tiny screen at the hula dance, which, it\u2019s nighttime. Her little hand-held $200 camera from K-Mart barely picked up any light. You could barely see anything, right? [laughs] She sat there for the entire ninety minutes or so recording it, looking through this little tiny screen, barely seeing it, so she could record it so she would watch it again later, I guess?</p> <p>I remember I was sitting there with my wife, and we were watching and enjoying this thing, and seeing some amazing things \u2013 people doing some cool choreographic things. I don\u2019t know \u2013 I love watching them perform, just doing their talents, and I looked over at this lady. She was looking through the screen, and she\u2019s missing the entire thing so that she can record it, so that she can watch it later.</p> <p>I thought it was ironic. How many times in life we\u2019re missing the most important stuff that\u2019s happening around us, because we\u2019re looking at our computer screen or we\u2019re looking at our phone, or we\u2019re recording something and missing the entire thing. I was reading somewhere on Facebook the other day. I don\u2019t even know whose concert it was. It was some concert. I think it was Jack White or something. I have no idea who that is, but I remember I was thinking Jack Black and he was a white guy, and his last name was White, so I think it was Jack White. Some of you guys probably know who he is. I think it was him. He was doing a concert. I think he was on some TV show \u2013 Jay Leno or, I guess Jay Leno\u2019s not on anymore [laughs]. That shows you how up I am with my pop culture, right? But anyway, he was on this show, and he was talking about how they don\u2019t let cell phones into their concert. He said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want people watching it, experiencing it through this tiny little screen. We want them actually experiencing it. That\u2019s why we do live concerts. They can go and watch the YouTube clips if they want to watch YouTube clips, but if they want to actually experience it, they have to be there and be present and experience it.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s my big take-away, was that most of us aren\u2019t present enough. I know I\u2019m guilty of this in a lot of things \u2013 in my kids\u2019 lives, sometimes, huh, Dallin?</p> <p>Dallin:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.</p> <p>Russell: [laughs] That\u2019s not a good thing to admit to. No, but even one day in Muai, we were sitting there, and my wife and I were in bed and we were texting on the phone, on Facebook, and stuff like that, and I texted her in the middle, and I said, \u201cHey, how are you doing?\u201d It was just kind of funny.</p> <p>We need to be more present in where we\u2019re at, and we need to put away our phones. When you\u2019re at something amazing, don\u2019t worry about capturing it on video so you can watch it later. Watch it right now, and enjoy it, and be there for the moment, otherwise you\u2019re going to miss it. It happens way too often. The more connected we become, the more its happening. It\u2019s happening to everyone, around the world.</p> <p>So I just want to encourage you guys. Don\u2019t be the person who\u2019s at the luau watching this amazing thing and trying to capture it on video so that you can watch it later. Be present, enjoy it now, and don\u2019t miss the moment, because they go way too fast.</p> <p>So that\u2019s about it, you guys. We are almost to the office. Dallin and I will have a fun-filled day. We\u2019re going to be launching a new project called \u201cList Hacking\u201d this week, which I\u2019m super excited about. We\u2019ve got a video guy coming over to film us and to film some stuff. We\u2019re going to roll it out, and what\u2019s exciting is we haven\u2019t started building it yet. We\u2019re going to build the entire membership site, sales process, everything inside of Click Funnels, and I will be able to get done in a day or so what used to take me two weeks, and so anyway, just kind of fun. We\u2019ve finished the beta for Click Funnels, now we\u2019re going to just be rolling out a bunch of projects just to prove how awesome it is. People can see the power of Click Funnels. It should be exciting.</p> <p>We\u2019re at the office, you guys. Have an awesome day, and we will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "05:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_89.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1405956902, "title": "Episode #88 \u2013 Tie A String Around Your Tooth And Slam The Door", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Lessons in success from my 8 year old son.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a late night \u201cMarketing in Your Car.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m actually headed back home. Todd is in town. We launched Click Funnels last week. It\u2019s been a smashing success, and now we\u2019re doing the other side of the software business, which is keeping up with customer support [laughs], and features, and bugs, and all of that fun kind of stuff. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. He flew in today, and we\u2019re going to be hanging out this week, cleaning it up, and making it perfect so that we can do our big, big launch here. Hopefully within the next twenty or thirty days or so \u2013 we\u2019ll plan that out tomorrow, but I\u2019m super excited for that.</p> <p>I wanted to do a podcast today, because I wanted to share a story that happened this afternoon with my son, Dallin. Dallin is the little entrepreneur in our family, for sure, and he\u2019s always trying to figure out how to make more money. He\u2019s doing yard sales and lemonade stands and all sorts of stuff.</p> <p>Yesterday, he told my wife, Collette, that he wanted to open up a bank account. He has a couple of dollars, and she\u2019s like, \u201cWell you have to have more money to open a bank account.\u201d So he\u2019s like, \u201cWell I need to make more money so I can open a bank account,\u201d so that\u2019s his mindset. We were driving home from church today, and he had this idea. He said, \u201cHey, mom and dad, if I lose a tooth today, then the tooth fairy can give me some money, and I can use that money to open a bank account.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, but how are you going to lose a tooth?\u201d He said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to get a string, and I\u2019m going to tie it around my tooth, and I\u2019ll tie it to a door handle, and I\u2019ll slam the door, and my tooth will get pulled out.\u201d</p> <p>We kind of laughed and giggled, and that\u2019s where I thought it was going to end. Fast forward thirty minutes later, we\u2019re in the house, and my wife and I are making lunch for the kids and getting everything ready for that, and I keep hearing the door slam upstairs. I totally forgot about what\u2019s happening, and so I\u2019m yelling upstairs, \u201cQuit slamming the door,\u201d and then Bowen yells down, \u201cIt\u2019s Ellie slamming it. She\u2019s trying to pull out Dallin\u2019s tooth.\u201d [laughs] I was like, \u201cOh man, hold on,\u201d and so like any good dad would do, I went and grabbed my phone, because I wanted to get this on tape [laughs], so I grabbed my phone, and I ran upstairs. He\u2019d gotten the ribbon from wrapping paper on a Christmas box, and he\u2019d tied a little knot around his tooth, and then he\u2019d tied it to the door. All of the kids were up there trying to figure out how to make Dallin some money, and Dallin was literally trying to pull his tooth out so he could make money so that he could open up a savings account.</p> <p>What was so funny was he was standing on the wrong side of the door, so when he would slam it, the string would actually get shorter instead of pulling it, and two of the times they were doing it, they were perplexed. They were like, \u201cWhy is this not working? Why is it not working?\u201d Then they were both like, \u201cDallin, you\u2019ve got to be on this side of the door.\u201d I\u2019m filming this whole thing on my phone, so Dallin goes on the inside, and they start slamming the door from the inside trying to pull his tooth out [laughs]. They would slam it, and sometimes the ribbon on his tooth would pop off, and other times it would start sliding through his teeth and not pull all of the way out. Anyway, I got, probably five or six times, them slamming the door and trying to lose his tooth. I thought it was really funny. Then I had them stop so that we could come down and have lunch.</p> <p>I started thinking about it. I started thinking about this little kid, right? My little Dallin \u2013 he\u2019s eight years old, and he\u2019s got in his mind, he needs money.\u2014\u201c\u201cI need to figure out how to make some money.\u201d There\u2019re a lot of things he can do. He can do chores. He knows he can make some money doing that, but thought, \u201cA quick way I can make money is to rip one of my teeth out.\u201d Instead of thinking about it and how it\u2019s going to hurt and all of these things, he just went and did it \u2013 just got out there and tied a string to his tooth, tied it to a doorknob, and started slamming the door trying to rip his tooth out.</p> <p>I was proud of him, not because I thought it was the smartest idea to do, but I just look at how many entrepreneurs I have a chance to work with and how many people I work with. Most of them want something, and they want money. They want whatever, but then when you lay out, \u201cHere\u2019s the steps you need to do to accomplish that goal and get that thing you want,\u201d they don\u2019t do it. They\u2019ll buy course after course after course, and they\u2019ll learn, and they\u2019ll hear, and they\u2019ll have ideas and all of these things in their head, but they\u2019re not willing to step up and fricking tie a string to their tooth and slam the door.</p> <p>I think that that\u2019s one of the biggest problems with people today. I\u2019m so proud of Dallin for doing that \u2013 for getting off his butt, tying a string to his tooth, and slamming the door trying to make some money. I think that for any of you guys that are listening to this who are on that fence right now, and you\u2019ve been in this learning cycle, and you\u2019re learning, and you\u2019re learning, and you\u2019re enjoying this learning cycle, it\u2019s time to get off your butt, tie a string to your tooth, and slam the door. I really think that mindset, that attitude, that thing that Dallin has, whatever that is, and I\u2019m proud of him as my son for doing that, but it\u2019s what all of us need.</p> <p>I look at the things in my life that have been successful, and a lot of it is because of that \u2013 because I\u2019ve just gone out there and tried to do that thing. If you\u2019re struggling, this is your call to action. This is your time to get off your butt, tie a string to your tooth, and slam the door, and go out there and find these things. Just do it. Do what it takes to make money. It\u2019s going to be painful. It might cost you some money. You have to get out of your comfort zone. You\u2019re going to have to stretch probably further than you\u2019ve ever stretched before in your life. You\u2019re going to have to have some sleepless nights. You\u2019re going to have to risk some of your own hard-earned money, and you\u2019re going to have to be able to do a lot of work to reach your dream and to have what you want, but it\u2019s worth it, I promise you guys. It is so worth it.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s my message for you guys today. I thought it was kind of a fun story. If my eight-year-old son, to earn fifty cents or a dollar, whatever the tooth fairy would bring him [laughs], he would have done it, is willing to tie a string on his tooth \u2013 on a tooth that\u2019s not even loose [laughs], and try to rip it out to make a buck, what are you willing to do? What are you willing to do to change your life? If you\u2019re not willing to do something, then you\u2019re probably going to keep being it at the spot you\u2019re at right now, so figure out what you\u2019re willing to do, get off of your butt, and go do it. That\u2019s my message for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks, you guys. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to be hearing more from me this week. I\u2019m back from vacation now, and we\u2019re having some fun rolling out the new company. I\u2019m excited to be sharing all of the little behind-the-scenes things that are happening with you guys. Thanks, again, and I\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_88.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1404746239, "title": "Episode #87 \u2013 Lead Or Gold", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to trick your mind to get crap done.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>Hi, everyone. Today is an exciting day. It\u2019s a Monday, and we are about to launch Click Funnels. This week is our execution week, which is kind of fun. Now, luckily for me, my wife and kids went out of town this week. They\u2019ve gone camping for the next three days, which basically means I get to pull all-nighters for three nights in a row, launch this thing, and then pass out for two weeks straight, unless there\u2019re issues. Then it means I\u2019ve got to not pass out for a week straight [laughs], but I\u2019m fired up and excited.</p> <p>I wanted this podcast just to talk about the process of actually getting a project or a product, whatever you want to call it, out of the door. I know that it\u2019s something that all of us go through, and it\u2019s funny. Todd and I were talking about this as we\u2019ve been getting all of this stuff done. It\u2019s kind of like, I think it\u2019s Pareto\u2019s Law, where no matter how much time you have left before the launch date, things will always fill up all of the available time to get things done. That\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling like right now. Literally, the launch date was two months ago, and then one month ago, and then this week, it\u2019s happening, win, lose, or draw, and we still have so much stuff that\u2019s got to be done [laughs], but it\u2019s at the point now where we\u2019re going to make it happen, and we\u2019re put it out there. We\u2019ll do whatever it takes and kill ourselves and get it done, and then we\u2019ll back fill it, and fix any issues we see along the way.</p> <p>I think one of the things that keeps most people from ever getting their projects out there, and I\u2019m guessing most of you have got at least one, if not ten or twenty projects [laughs] that are mostly done, but they\u2019re not finished yet. They\u2019re not pushed out the door. People, a lot of times, ask me, \u201cRussell, how do you get so much stuff done. How do you get so many things out the door?\u201d I think part of it is because of the philosophy we started using five or six \u2013 I don\u2019t know, maybe longer \u2013 seven or eight years ago.</p> <p>It started when I heard a tape that was called \u201cThe Scuttlebutt Tape\u201d from Gary Halbert and \u2013 it wasn\u2019t John Carlton \u2013 Gary Halbert and Michael Fortin were talking about copywriting stuff, and one of the things that Halbert talked about was this concept called \u201cLead or Gold\u201d. It was interesting to me because he talked about, and again, I don\u2019t know if the story\u2019s true or not, but the illustration of what he shared was powerful for me. He said that down in Mexico that when the mafia warlords wanted to change laws, they would go to the government and say, \u201cHey, you need to change this law.\u201d The government would be like, \u201cNo. We\u2019re not going to do that for you. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d [laughs] So what they would do then is the mafia would go and break in to people\u2019s houses late at night \u2013 the government officials. They would wake them up out of their sleep, and they would come up to them, and they would have a gun and a bag of gold, and they would say, \u201cWe need you to change this law tonight, and you\u2019ve got two options \u2013 lead or gold. Which one do you want? Do you want a bullet to the head, or would you like some cash?\u201d Very quickly, somehow, laws were able to be changed. When the options are lead or gold, it\u2019s pretty easy to get things done [laughs].</p> <p>I started thinking of that in my business. How many times do we have projects where we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to launch this week. Oh, okay, next week,\u201d and six years later, nothing\u2019s ever happened. We started setting these deadlines, and we called them \u201clead or gold deadlines\u201d, where it\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019re launching Tuesday at noon. Win, lose, or draw, it\u2019s happening, and we\u2019ve got two options \u2013 either lead or gold, and we\u2019ve got to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>When you give yourself those two options, and those two options only, it\u2019s amazing what kind of stuff you can get done. It\u2019s amazing how you can get people to stay late, and you can stay late, and you can work harder, and you can do whatever it takes. You\u2019ll get that project done. So for us and all of our coaching groups who have been here for the last five or six years, I always talk about this, and I say, \u201cLook, when you guys get home from this event, or home from whatever it is that you\u2019ve learned about something, you have to go and set lead or gold deadlines for each step of the process.\u201d You say, \u201cLook, for me, first I\u2019ve got to get the sales stuff done, okay? So my deadline is next Tuesday at three \u2013 lead or gold. There\u2019s nothing that can move that date. I will die if it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d and you just make sure it happens.</p> <p>Then the next one \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to have this part done by this day, and you set that lead or gold deadline, and then you hit it, and you keep doing those things. For most of you guys who aren\u2019t getting the things done that you want, it\u2019s because you\u2019re too soft on yourselves. You let yourselves off the hook, like, \u201cOh well, we ran out of time. We\u2019ll do it tomorrow,\u201d and when you do that, it keeps getting pushed forever, because of Pareto\u2019s law where as much time as you give it, things will always fill up the expanse of that time, no matter what it is, and so I promise you guys, if you want your project tomorrow or a month from now, either way, you\u2019re going to be up until three or four\u00a0 or five o\u2019clock in the morning the night before cramming to get it done, and so why not pick the date that\u2019s earliest and get you more money?</p> <p>That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m going in to the office now. We\u2019ve got two and a half days away from launch time, and we picked our deadline, and we are going to hit it, and no matter what happens, we will make it work, and I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m fired up. It\u2019s going to be an awesome day today. I hope you guys have a good day as well. Set some lead or gold deadlines, and we will see you guys again on the next episode. Thanks, everyone.</p>", "duration": "05:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_87.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1404404791, "title": "Episode #86 \u2013 The Chaos Behind The Launch", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What really happened over the last three days\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you once again to \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>So first off, I want to say that I think it\u2019s about time we get a new theme song. What do you guys think? [laughs] The 1980s initial version is about ready to be retired, I think, so that\u2019s going to be first on my list for this week.</p> <p>Anywho, it\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve done a podcast. The reason why is that I\u2019ve been neck deep in getting ready to launch Click Funnels, and I\u2019m guessing from the outside, everything seems so calm and simple and easy for what we\u2019re doing. We launched the first pre-launch video yesterday, but there\u2019s always a story behind the story, and so I thought I would just share that to you guys while I\u2019m heading in to the office, because I think it\u2019s always fun.</p> <p>First off, Click Funnels has been a big project [laughs]. We\u2019ve been going crazy trying to get all of the templates done, working and testing them on every browser, and on and on and on, and it\u2019s been a ton of work on that side, but it\u2019s turning out amazingly. For the last three or four nights in a row, I\u2019ve been pulling sixteen hour days. I work eight hours, go home and play with the kids, and then go back another eight hours, and then come home and sleep for a few hours, and then go back again. It\u2019s been a lot of work on that side.</p> <p>The last week we started planning out the pre-launch. What should we do? How should we do it? My team member, John Parkes, and I sat down and we brainstormed out an idea that it would be fun to have Chris, our number one designer, go head to head with somebody who\u2019d never used Click Funnels before, and see who could build a website the fastest. We started brainstorming these ideas, and it went from this really simple idea to us renting out an octagon and having these two fight it out in the octagon. We got really excited. This was Thursday.</p> <p>I had this guy who wanted to do the video, so I called him up and said, \u201cHey, do you have some time next week to do videos?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m flying into Tokyo on Monday.\u201d I was like, \u201cOn Monday? Crap. I need these before Monday.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI have tomorrow, Friday, if you want to do it then.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right, man. Let\u2019s do it,\u201d and so Thursday night, I\u2019m scrambling to try to write scripts for this four video launch sequence. Typically I think, most people spend a couple of weeks writing out scripts to launch a brand-new company [laughs], but literally, I had to do it in about an hour.</p> <p>Then I had to find an octagon, so I\u2019m calling around, and luckily, some of my buddies own an MMA gym and we were able to rent an octagon. We got the camera person in. I needed to find somebody to be the other person competing against Chris. One of my friends is an author in town. She\u2019s written a book, and she\u2019s been super successful. She\u2019s a life coach, and she also certifies life coaches, so I called her and begged her, and she dropped everything, moved all of her appointments around so she could show up and be the other person, and on and on and on.</p> <p>That day, I get a call from the Ferrari place, because my Ferrari, which is a whole other story for another podcast, has been in the shop for six weeks. They\u2019re like, \u201cThe Ferrari\u2019s done,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, sweet. We can have the Ferrari in the video.\u201d So I raced down to go grab the Ferrari, and on my way back, trying to get home, it died about thirteen times [laughs], so it still doesn\u2019t actually work, but at least it moves forward long enough so you can catch a glimpse of us driving it on the video [laughs].</p> <p>So we put the whole thing together, and then the video guy is scrambling because he\u2019s flying to Tokyo Monday morning at 6 a.m., so he\u2019s scrambling to edit the videos and put it all together and get all of his stuff done. Then he texts me Sunday night at about five in the morning and says, \u201cHey, I got it pretty much done. I left the hard drive out in front of my house, and you can go grab it, and hopefully the files will all work for you.\u201d [laughs]</p> <p>So I go and grab the thing, and it looked good, but there were some tweaks I needed, and my brother, who\u2019s my main video guy, was heading out of town Monday morning, so I called him and tell him and his wife they can\u2019t leave yet, and so he goes down on his computer and he\u2019s editing the videos and tweaking some stuff to get it just perfect [laughs]. I swear, his wife is probably cursing me out, because they were leaving on this big family vacation. We get that back, and then at the same time, we\u2019re in the process of moving our e-mail auto-responders again, for about the third time this year, to this company called MaroPost, and we\u2019re having issues there. We can\u2019t get the list imported [laughs], and then their scrubbing process, which should take an hour, took about three days.</p> <p>Then we started building out the launch funnel inside Click Funnels, and honestly, the only funnel I\u2019d never tested yet was the launch funnels, so we started testing them. The first time around, there\u2019re always issues that come with any funnel. Then we\u2019re rebuilding our entire launch funnel sequences and Click Funnels and we\u2019re adding features, and it\u2019s like this storm of things, literally, for the last four or five days. I don\u2019t even know.</p> <p>Finally, yesterday, I was in the office, and I hadn\u2019t slept in about three days in a row. I literally am living off of our supplement that we\u2019re launching in the MMA market, called \u201cMMA Ignite\u201d. I take a shot of that, every few hours to wake me back up, but the effects of it had stopped working yesterday. I think my body was just done. I was just dragging, putting all of the pieces together, and then finally we got the launch page up. We got the video live. MaroPost uploaded. I sent the e-mail out to the list, and I sat down, and I was just like [sighs], \u201cWe did it.\u201d I was so excited.</p> <p>I went home, played with the kids for a bunch of time, and then checked my phone, and a whole bunch of people were texting, \u201cMan, that video is awesome. It\u2019s the best video you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d You know, all of the things people message me on Facebook and stuff about how impressed they were with it all, and how good the scripts were and everything. It just made me smile, knowing that we pulled the whole thing off, literally, in about a day, if even that. I think it turned out pretty good, so behind the exterior, there\u2019s always crazy stuff happening inside.</p> <p>Oh, and not only that, we\u2019ve got our support team, right? We ramped up because we were getting ready for Click Funnels, but then, low and behold, Neuracel just went crazy, and so we\u2019ve got three full-time support people who\u2019re doing Neuracel, and we have no one to support Click Funnels, so we\u2019ve been scrambling and trying to hire people in Boise. We haven\u2019t found anyone good.</p> <p>Luckily, thankfully, and hopefully some of you guys listening have probably got some great friends who\u2019ve volunteered who are good at something, like Garrett Pierson. He\u2019s the owner of a whole bunch of sites, Trust Guard, Shopper Approved, Kart Rocket. He just dedicated his time. He\u2019s coming up for a week to work for free just to help us during the launch week [laughs]. We\u2019ve got a couple of other people that are I met on Facebook that are friends that are going to come in and work for a couple of weeks. People are literally flying here just to help out with the launch, just to help us so that it will go off opefullyHwithout a hitch while we\u2019re finding a more long-term support team.</p> <p>So anyway, it\u2019s just kind of crazy. I\u2019m grateful for everyone on my team that\u2019s made this happen. I\u2019m grateful for everybody outside of it, people like Garrett and others, who don\u2019t have any vested interest, but just care about me and about us enough to come and throw in a helping hand. Some really cool things are happening, but I just wanted to share that, because I\u2019m sure a lot of you guys, in your business, you see you\u2019re doing stuff, and you feel like nothing\u2019s working, and you\u2019re going crazy, and you\u2019re freaking out. Even though it may look like on the outside that we have it all together all of the time, we\u2019re just like everybody else. It\u2019s a lot of work and a lot of juggling, and when it all comes together in the end, it feels really, really good.</p> <p>I\u2019m excited. Launch Week is in less than a week \u2013 Launch Day. We\u2019re just going to launch to our internal list first and we\u2019re going to test that out and make sure we can handle the support, and then we\u2019ll open it up to affiliates after that. It\u2019s pretty exciting.</p> <p>After I got home last night, after the kids went down, I had a chance to finally watch \u201c24\u201d, which was awesome, because it\u2019s was Wednesday night, so I\u2019ve had two or three nights in a row of wishing I could watch it, but I\u2019ve been too busy working. I got to watch it last night. It was exciting, and I wish that show would never end. For those guys who are watching it right now, they only have twelve episodes a season, and they just finished up with number ten, so there\u2019s only two more to go. We should have a 24-Dot Com Secrets \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d party for everyone. That would be fun.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m in the office. I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. I\u2019ve got to go clean up a couple more messes and stuff for video number two, but I\u2019m excited for it all. I appreciate you guys listening. I hope you got something out of this one, and I\u2019ll talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "08:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_86.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1403631150, "title": "Episode #85 \u2013 Your Mental Shelf Space", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to stop focusing on the good things, so you can grow the great things.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone.

I got up early this morning for my accountability call, which again, I\u2019ve mentioned this to you guys multiple times, and I encourage you to do this if you haven\u2019t done this yet \u2013 find an accountability partner. The way we do ours is I write him a check, he writes me a check, and every two weeks we meet together. We have some goals and if we don\u2019t keep one of our goals \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t keep his goal, then I cash his check, and vice versa.</p> <p>Right now I\u2019m doing that with him, and I\u2019m doing it with someone else in a spiritual standpoint. I have some spiritual goals, and I have a buddy who does, too. We did the same thing. We wrote each other checks, and if one of us screws up, we cash the other person\u2019s check. It\u2019s amazing what happens when you do this. I\u2019m going to write a book about it someday, because I\u2019m making huge strides in my business, and in my personal life, so I\u2019m going to try to find another couple of accountability partners. Maybe I\u2019ll do a weight loss one as well, and a couple of other things.</p> <p>Today I want to talk about the entrepreneurial \u2013 I don\u2019t even know what the right word is \u2013 ADD, right? Something we all get. We get into these shiny object syndromes, and the guy I had my meeting with, my accountability partner, today we were talking about stuff and I was showing him our businesses and how we were doing. I showed him our supplement business, which is blowing up and growing faster than anything I\u2019ve ever had, and faster than I probably want it to be [laughs]. It\u2019s a business that scares me. There\u2019s liability that makes me nervous. There\u2019s inventory management. All of these things that I haven\u2019t done in the past, I can learn, and we\u2019re learning and we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s not my core competency. We\u2019re making good money on it.</p> <p>He asked me an interesting question. He said, \u201cIf you were to get rid of that business, Russell, how much money do you think you would make focusing on your core passion, your core business?\u201d which is our marketing and Click Funnels and some of the other stuff that\u2019s coming out in the next couple of weeks. I sat back and I thought about it for a while. He said, \u201cYou know, Russell, you\u2019re struggling right now because this business is netting you whatever each month, but what you don\u2019t understand is that that business may be costing you even more in your focus. You look at retailers like Wal-Mart. They have all of this shelf space, right? They look at every single SKU on the shelf, and if something\u2019s not performing or making enough, they get rid of it, right? Their shelf space \u2013 they\u2019ve got to be very protective of it. Entrepreneurs like us, our shelf space is between our ears, in our mind, and we\u2019ve got to be very, very aware of it, and be very careful. If something\u2019s taking up a lot of shelf space, and if it\u2019s not making as much money as it should, you\u2019ve got to take it out, because it could be suffocating other parts of your business.\u201d</p> <p>I was thinking about that this morning. I was thinking about how, whichever part of the business I focus on starts growing, so when we focus on supplements, \u201cBoom,\u201d it starts growing and growing and growing, and then all of the sudden, everything else starts hurting. All of the sudden we\u2019ll look and say, \u201cHey, the coaching business is hurting,\u201d and I shift my focus over there, and \u201cBoom.\u201d It starts growing and growing and growing. Then I look back and the supplements are suffering, and everything else is suffering. Whatever we\u2019re focusing on is growing. So, what\u2019s the opportunity that you have and that I have that\u2019s going to make us the most amount of money? Let\u2019s focus a hundred percent of our time and effort there, and let it grow. Don\u2019t let these other good things suffocate and kill the great things.</p> <p>This is stuff, obviously, I know and I\u2019ve heard before, but it was a good reminder for me this morning, and it made me start thinking about some of my side projects, and made me start thinking about what I can sell, what I can kill, what I can give to partners, what I can do and where I can do it to get to the point where I can focus on the great things, and so that\u2019s my focus for today. I just got home from the gym, and I\u2019m going to go see my kids and play with them for a little bit, and then I\u2019ll be in the office to go try to accomplish that, so it should be fun.</p> <p>I hope you guys have an awesome day. I hope you guys can do what I do and take some inventory of your mental shelf space, and make some good decisions so that you\u2019re focusing on the great things and not the good things. Thanks guys, and I\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "05:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_85.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1403036998, "title": "Episode #84 \u2013 Problems Or Solutions?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Are you the type of person who finds problems or are you the type of person who finds answers? Find out who you are on today\u2019s exciting episode!</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell, and I want to welcome you to a very late night \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>It is currently 1:14 in the morning, and it\u2019s funny. I volunteered at our church to lock up the building this week, and I completely forgot [laughs]. I was about to go to bed, and all of the sudden it popped into my head, so I\u2019m driving to the church to go lock up. I thought I would jump on the phone and leave you guys all a message.</p> <p>Today was the first day back after being gone for two weeks, which is kind of stressful. I don\u2019t know \u2013 our business runs well, but when you get back there\u2019re all of these little fires that are on fire when you come back, and you\u2019ve got to figure out how to put the fires out and what to do, and there\u2019re so many questions. You have this stuff you want to get done. You want to move forward, but all of this reactive stuff keeps pulling you back and pulling you back. I\u2019m sure you guys have felt that.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, because I still remember when my wife and I were engaged. I was maybe twenty-one or twenty-two at the time, and I was starting this business. I thought I was so cool. I had my laptop, and I was selling stuff on eBay. I had a website, and I probably had two customers total, maybe [laughs]. I might not even have been that lucky, but I remember on our honeymoon, every day I\u2019d have to turn on my laptop and check my e-mails and make sure customer support had been handled. I didn\u2019t want my business to collapse, and it makes me laugh so hard now. I could have not e-mailed those two customers back for that whole week, and it probably would have been a smart idea.</p> <p>But I digress, so I\u2019ll come back to what I was talking about. I\u2019m sure most of you guys who own your own business have that. You leave for a little bit, and you come back, and it\u2019s just like you have to spend a day or two putting out all of these fires. Today for us, we specifically had a lot of stuff. I\u2019m outside, and its 1:14 in the morning, so if I get mugged or something, we\u2019re going to catch it live on the podcast [laughs], so all of you faithful marketers in your cars are going to be hanging out. Okay, the first door\u2019s locked.</p> <p>Anyway, so basically, I came back, and our supplement has been blowing up. I\u2019ve talked about this during the podcasts. It\u2019s literally just going crazy. We can\u2019t even keep up with it. Literally, if we wouldn\u2019t have run out of inventory a little while ago [laughs], we probably would have passed a million dollars in sales this month, which is crazy. It\u2019s just growing and growing, and it\u2019s like a wildfire. We can\u2019t put it down. The immediate buyers, we had to cut them down to a fourth of what they were spending, and they\u2019re still spending like crazy. We\u2019re trying to order new supplements and import the ingredients from all over the country. The growing season\u2019s over, and they don\u2019t have enough in stock of the things we need. It\u2019s just issue after issue after issue, and problem after problem [laughs].</p> <p>We\u2019re behind on support, and we\u2019ve got two full-time support people and they\u2019re still so far behind, we have to hire another two or three or four more on top of that. We\u2019re putting out ads, and we\u2019re trying to hire people. You have people that are applying for ads. We have an ad out there that\u2019s pretty good, that gets them to want to. In theory, it gets them to. We make them jump through a bunch of hoops and do a bunch of stuff. They have to apply, and we have to get good people.</p> <p>We ended up getting ten or fifteen good people that actually went through all of the hoops that we put out there and applied. We called them back, and out of everyone, only two people called us back. It\u2019s just amazing how people, humans \u2013 disappoint me [laughs] over and over and over again. They just don\u2019t do stuff. Its like, \u201cIf you need a job, then return the call, or...\u201d I don\u2019t know \u2013 just whatever.</p> <p>So all of these kinds of things are happening, and then we\u2019ve got our mini call center that we\u2019ve set up, and they need more leads, and these other leads they don\u2019t like. We need a new funnel. Our funnel has been stale because we\u2019ve been driving so much traffic to it. It\u2019s been seen by all of the audiences on Facebook. It\u2019s been worn out. We need new leads for it. It\u2019s just thing after thing.</p> <p>Click Funnels is almost about to launch. We found out that there\u2019s an error here, and we\u2019ve got this thing here, and the day we were planning on launching, it turns out everyone on our team\u2019s out of town. Literally, just all of these issues today \u2013 thing after thing, and by the end of the day, I have this little couch by my desk, and at the end of the day, I laid down on it, and I felt this overwhelming feeling. I was like, \u201cMan, I\u2019ve made more choices in the last eight hours than I typically make in a year,\u201d and all of them are big choices.</p> <p>I think it was Dan Kennedy who said that every six months or every forty-five days or something, that an entrepreneur\u2019s going to make a decision that will make or break their business. I felt like today, I made enough decisions for our entire years\u2019 worth of stuff [laughs]. I was lying on the couch, and I was overwhelmed. It was like, \u201cUgh, I\u2019m so far behind.\u201d I\u2019m sure you guys have felt that, right? It made me think about \u2013 well not at first. At first I just felt overwhelmed. I had a sick feeling. My wife texted me and she said, \u201cAre you coming home for dinner?\u201d and I was like, \u201cYes, I need to get out of here. I need to just get away from it.\u201d So I got away from it for a while. I ate some dinner. We may or may not have watched \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d tonight, which may or may not be my favorite show [laughs]. I kind of passed out during it a little bit, because I was pretty beat up and tired, and I fell asleep for a little bit.</p> <p>Then I woke back up, and when I woke back up, I had some ideas. I contacted one guy, and I asked him questions. I got a whole bunch of ideas for the supplement, like how to fix that one. My buddy just gave me a bunch of some really good stuff from his experience. And then all of the sudden, I was just lying there, and this other idea just popped in to my head about how we could solve the application problem for our call center, and all of these things started coming, and I\u2019m like, \"Hey, Collette, I've got to go back to work. I\u2019ve got to get all of this stuff implemented quickly, before everyone else wakes up in the morning,\u201d and so I went back into the office until about 12:30, and I literally got most of the issues all lined out with all of the stuff I was stressing out about and all of the issues. My brain just needed a little reboot, and then I was ready to go back in and answer the rest of the questions and solve the problems, and now I feel like most of the problems are solved.</p> <p>Now by tomorrow, I\u2019ll go in, which tomorrow\u2019s the fun day, because I\u2019ve got lifting. I\u2019m lifting weights in probably four hours from now, and I\u2019ll have jiu jitsu practice tomorrow. It should be a lot of fun, but anyway tomorrow I\u2019m going to go in and just do normal stuff, but it made me think tonight about something my dad told me, and I hope I don\u2019t offend anyone with this. That\u2019s not my intention. The sprinklers are on, so hopefully you guys can still hear me. So I don\u2019t want to offend anybody, but my dad told me something when I was a kid, and my dad is an entrepreneur like me, and he had a bunch of his own little businesses and stuff that he did, and I don\u2019t remember the situation when he told me, but I remember it had a big impact on me. He said, \u201cRussell, there\u2019re two kinds of people in this world. There're people who find problems, and there\u2019re people who find the answers. You always want to be the latter.\u201d</p> <p>That had a big, profound impact on me, and I started thinking about that in all areas of my life, actually. I was thinking about wrestling. I was thinking about my family. I was thinking about business, thinking about our coaching programs, thinking about everything. There are two types of people. People who find the problems, and people who find the answers to the problems, and I was thinking about how, not all of them, but a lot of the employees on my team are people who find problems. They find a problem. If they have a problem, they come to you with it and say, \u201cI found a problem. I found a problem,\u201d and they just don\u2019t find the answer.</p> <p>There are a couple of guys on my team that are amazing people at finding answers. One of them who I\u2019ll mention is this guy named John Parkes, on my team and one of the neatest people I\u2019ve ever met in my life. I watched him today, because he gets the brunt of the problem people. They go to him first before they come to me. He has the major job of solving most of the problems. People come to him with all sorts of questions, and he finds them answers. He\u2019s able to think about it, and find an answer. He\u2019s a great person at finding answers.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve done this experiment over the years with people when they ask me questions, just to see. I think I heard Tony Robbins do it the first time. That\u2019s probably where I got it from. People would ask him something. They would ask him a question, and he would say, \u201cWell what do you think?\u201d and they\u2019d go, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d He\u2019d say, \u201cWell if you did know the answer, what do you think it would be?\u201d The person would almost always give the correct answer afterwards, and so I\u2019ve done that sometimes in the past. It\u2019s interesting that most people can solve their own problems just by asking, \u201cWell what do you think the answer would be if this was you?\u201d and magically they can go, and they can answer these problems.</p> <p>I think all of us have the ability to be the person that finds the answer, but for whatever reason, we\u2019re nervous, or we like that crutch, or we have this thing where we always want to put it on somebody else. The person who\u2019s willing to find the answers becomes the leader in every situation. In wrestling, I became a leader because people brought me problems and I found answers. In business, I\u2019ve become a leader because of that as well. I look at our coaching program, and it\u2019s interesting \u2013 a lot of the calls I do with our students \u2013 they come, and they\u2019ve got an issue, and most of the time, they know the answer, and they just want me to tell them that they\u2019re right. It\u2019s just interesting how much people need that validation.</p> <p>I think for you guys that are listening to this, think about yourself. Which kind of person are you right now? Are you the kind of person who finds the problem, or are you the kind of person who finds the answer? If you\u2019re really the person that\u2019s going to find the problem, I think the fastest way you can get a pay raise, or get more friends, or a bigger following, or whatever that thing is, is you\u2019ve got to shift to the other kind of person, and I know that the answer\u2019s there. When I hear some of our support people come and ask John questions, I know they know the answer, but they want the validation. They want him to answer it for them, because they don\u2019t want to mess up. They don\u2019t want to get in trouble, and they want somebody else to blame if something goes wrong, but if you\u2019re willing to step into that role and be that person, and be the one who\u2019s taking the brunt of the responsibility on your shoulders and if it\u2019s wrong then you take it, you will go a lot further in this life.</p> <p>That\u2019s for sure, so that\u2019s my message for tonight, and those of you who are entrepreneurs who have those days like I had today where it\u2019s hard and you get beat down and you just want to lay down and cry for a while, just know that it\u2019s okay. Lay down. Take a little nap. Watch The Bachelorette or whatever show it is that you need to, but then get back up and get back to work and solve your problems and make it happen. For all of you guys, focus on that. Focus on shifting from being someone who finds problems to somebody who finds the answers, and as soon as you do that, it will change everything around you.</p> <p>That is it. I\u2019m home. It\u2019s 1:26 in the morning. I am up in four and a half hours to life weights. [laughs] I hope I don\u2019t pass out. Hopefully something I said made a lot of sense. I\u2019m pretty tired, so I\u2019m not really sure, but I appreciate you guys listening in. I hope you enjoyed the podcast, and I will talk to you all again soon. Thanks, guys.</p>", "duration": "12:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_84.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1402935583, "title": "Episode #83 \u2013 Paleo Juicing Hippies", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell\u2019s test for increasing his energy and focus for this week.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. It\u2019s been a long time, but I want to welcome you to another \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>Hey, guys and gals. I hope you guys are having an awesome time. I actually took almost two weeks off from everything, which sounds really nice, but it\u2019s really painful for entrepreneurs like me who just want to go and create cool stuff, so I\u2019m back in the heat of it, and I\u2019m super excited for this week. I hope you are as well.</p> <p>While I was in San Diego, some really cool stuff happened. I had a chance to hang out with Todd, who\u2019s one of my partners. He\u2019s the one who has coded all of the Click Funnels, and it\u2019s always fun hanging out with him, just talking about everything from financial stuff to making money to health to weight loss. Always fun stuff, and he got me thinking about a lot of things.</p> <p>I had a chance to hang out with a guy named Drew Canole. Some of you guys may know Drew. If not, check out FitLife.TV, I think. It may be FitLifeTV.com \u2013 one of those two, anyway. Drew is a juicing expert and a super-cool guy. I saw him online, and I was really impressed with him. It turned out that he was in San Diego, so I wanted to go meet him. I had a chance to go hang out with him.</p> <p>This weekend, I decided that I was going to go, and I was going to try some experiments on myself from an eating standpoint. I\u2019m really going to track it closely. It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve done diets and weight loss things for my whole life. All the time from when I was wrestling and I was losing twenty-five to thirty pounds a week, to when I was just out of shape and trying to figure out how to get back into it, but I\u2019ve never been that good at tracking everything, especially from a food consumption standpoint.</p> <p>What I did is I went out on Saturday, and I went to Whole Foods, because I wanted to do the whole organic, grass-fed everything. I spent a lot of money [laughs], because Whole Foods is not cheap. I bought tons of vegetables \u2013 everything I could find \u2013 all of the leafy greens and as many different varieties of vegetables as I could find, and I went and found the organic grass-fed meat, and found a bunch of stuff. I came home yesterday, and I took all of my vegetables and I broke them down into five different days, so I\u2019m going to be juicing every day for the next five days. From Mercola.com, I bought his new juicer, which is different from the one I had before. The one I had before was the Jack LaLanne one, which spins and grinds. This one\u2019s got more of an auger in it or something like that, where it squishes the juice out instead of cutting it, so it\u2019s supposed to stay fresher longer. I don\u2019t know [laughs]. I thought it looked cool on the video. I\u2019m not going to lie [laughs].</p> <p>So I\u2019m doing the whole juice thing, and then I started making frittatas, which if you don\u2019t know what a frittata is, it\u2019s probably the best way to eat simply, so I probably spent an hour yesterday, on Sunday, making frittatas that will last me for at least a week, if not longer. Basically, it\u2019s eggs and vegetables and a whole bunch of stuff like that all mixed. It\u2019s like an omelet/quiche thing, but we call them frittatas. I made some huge ones, and what was awesome, because I went and put in tons of spinach and kale and broccoli and okra and all of these really cool vegetables in my frittatas. I\u2019m just veg-ing it up like crazy. So this is my experiment, guys. I\u2019m calling it my hippie paleo juicing week-long thing [laughs]. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to call it \u2013 something like that.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny. We\u2019ve been teasing about how we were in San Diego, and the area we were in had all of these hippie-type people there. Everyone\u2019s got dreadlocks, and they\u2019re surfing all day long. We were joking about how when I was younger, we used to always make fun of the hippie culture and stuff like that \u2013 eating green, where now it\u2019s the cool thing to do, so this is my hippie juicing paleo, because the frittatas are pure paleo the way we build them. It\u2019s going to be fun, so I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>I\u2019m excited to see how much energy I get from the whole process this week. It should be really, really cool, because I\u2019ve got a lot of stuff happening this week, so I need the energy. I need the excitement. I need the newness of it all, so I\u2019m excited. I\u2019ll let you guys know throughout the week how it goes.</p> <p>For you guys, I would say, \u201cThis week, figure out something different. Figure out a pattern interrupt. Figure out something that you\u2019ve been doing. If it\u2019s diet, or if it\u2019s health, or if it\u2019s how you wake up in the morning, or if it\u2019s how you work, or whatever, figure out something, and just do a big interrupt like I\u2019m doing right now \u2013 just a big pattern interrupt. Do something that\u2019s just going to totally shock your system, and see what happens. For all I know, this could be the worst thing in the world, but I\u2019m still excited for it. I think it\u2019s going to be awesome.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the office, you guys. I am going to go and get some stuff done today.

I actually wanted to do a special podcast. I don\u2019t normally log into Facebook very much because it stresses me out. Typically I\u2019m getting a lot of people who are asking me for my help for free. It\u2019s just hard, because I want to, and I wish I could give them all the attention. The problem is, with everything I\u2019m doing right now in my own company, in my own business, and in my own coaching clients, it\u2019s hard to find time to even sleep at night. There\u2019s so much stuff always happening, and so I don\u2019t typically log in that often, but the last week, I did for a couple of reasons. I just checked again when I was walking out of getting my hair cut. I saw a message, and it just made me think, so I want to tell you about two different people that approached me on Facebook. I won\u2019t use their real names, but I want to share their approaches with you, because they were both very different.</p> <p>The first guy that contacted me basically said, \u201cHey Russell, I\u2019ve been watching you for a bunch of years. I love your stuff. I think you\u2019re awesome. How much would it cost to buy an hour of your time?\u201d I said, \u201cRight now, I sell an hour for twenty-five hundred bucks,\u201d and he wrote back and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s kind of steep, but hey, man, I love your stuff, and I think you can help me, so where do I send the money?\u201d So I told him. He sent the money. Two days later, we were on the phone. We spent an hour on the phone with him looking at his funnel, building it out, tweaking it, giving him all the advice that he needed, and after he was done, he was like, \u201cMan, that was awesome. I feel like I\u2019ve shifted my focus. I know exactly where I\u2019m going now, I\u2019m going to go ahead and implement it. Hey, do you mind if I shoot some questions now and then as I\u2019m building this thing out, to help me create it?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, no worries.\u201d So he went out, and he\u2019s been building, and he shot me a couple of questions. I gave him some feedback, and I haven\u2019t minded because he understood the value of my time, and what it takes for me to spend some time. I don\u2019t mind helping him now, because he valued my time up front, and he was willing to invest, and now he\u2019s trying to implement what I showed him, and so of course I\u2019m going to help steer him in the right direction and have success. It\u2019s been awesome.</p> <p>Then I have this other guy. Again, a really nice guy, and my heart strings go out to him and to other people that I\u2019ve gotten this message from. Literally, I think, five or six people this week sent me similar messages about, \u201cHey Russell, I love your stuff. I don\u2019t have any money, but I want to work with you. I\u2019d love it if you could get on the phone with me and coach me through this. I\u2019ll give you half of my profits, and I\u2019ll do all of this kind of stuff.\u201d That\u2019s their mentality, and it\u2019s tough, because honestly, for me as a person, I can\u2019t even tell you how much I want to, but it\u2019s hard. Most of those I don\u2019t respond back to, because it\u2019s just so hard for me to tell them \u201cNo\u201d, but it\u2019s like, \u201cYou have to understand, that when I was getting started, I never would have gone to somebody who is as busy or had as much success, and just ask them for their time. I always would have gone and figured out how I could provide value to them, whether it\u2019s money or whatever, because their time is valuable.\u201d</p> <p>I look at my schedule. For example, this week, I was at the office twice until 3 a.m. in the morning this week trying to get some projects done. I literally had, I think, seven or eight one-hour phone call consultations with people. Every single one of those people, outside of the first guy I told you about \u2013 he paid $2,500 \u2013 everybody else paid $25,000 for those, and it was hard for me to fit those $25,000 one-hour calls into my schedule, because it\u2019s so busy with everything. I obviously made the time, because they made the investment.</p> <p>Plus I\u2019ve got the Reactive Coaching for our $25,000 students, and then on top of that, I\u2019ve got my own projects and my own businesses, and in our supplement company, we\u2019re in the process of trying to hire three or four more people. It has by far eclipsed our internet marketing business [laughs] to this point, which is exciting. We\u2019re about to launch Click Funnels, which is a brand new company. We\u2019re in the process of trying to find new office space and probably hiring a staff of, who knows \u2013 ten to twelve people to help with that.</p> <p>I literally don\u2019t have time to sleep right now. I go home. I spend time in the morning with my family and kids and at night with my family and kids. As soon as they all pass out, I\u2019m back to work trying to move things forward, and it\u2019s hard when I get an e-mail saying, \u201cI just need an hour of your time. Remember what it was like when you were just beginning and you had no ability? If you had just gotten some guru to help you...,\u201d and how it would help them, and again, my heart strings go out to them, but I don\u2019t think people really understand the reality of it.</p> <p>For me to carve out another hour of my time, I would have to put one of my projects on hold, and you look at opportunity cost. The one lesson I learned from my college education is opportunity cost. With opportunity cost, if you remember the concept, you\u2019ve got two options. The opportunity cost is what you lost by not taking the other option, so for example, if I was to jump on the phone with this guy for an hour, the opportunity cost is that I\u2019ve either got to give up an hour of time with my family, which is not something I\u2019m willing to do at all, or I\u2019ve got to carve out an hour of time from all of my other projects.</p> <p>An hour of focused time working towards Click Funnels or an hour towards something else, will make me a lot of money. It\u2019s hard, because what he is asking for and what people like that are asking for \u2013 they don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re asking for. They\u2019re asking for an hour of your time. An hour of your time, literally, on the low end, is $2,500. I was trying to be nice to this guy, but because he was willing to respect the value of my time, I was willing to do it for $2,500, but the reality is an hour of time that\u2019s focused on your own business is worth so much more than that.</p> <p>I just wanted to share. It\u2019s been on my mind. I may send him this podcast, and I hope it doesn\u2019t hurt his feelings. That\u2019s not my intention, but more so just to help him understand the value of other people\u2019s time, and if you want to get someone\u2019s attention, you\u2019ve got to look at things differently.</p> <p>When I first got into this business, I remember I went to this event, and there was this guy that was at the event. He was in this Mastermind group, and he was in four or five others, and I was like, \u201cHow in the world did you get in all of these groups?\u201d and he said, \u201cI learned something early on in life, Russell. I learned I can either work my way in, or I can buy my way in. It\u2019s way easier just to buy your way in.\u201d He had spent tons of money in to getting in to these different clubs.</p> <p>I said, \u201cHow in the world do you afford that?\u201d I think he had spent almost a hundred grand in these Masterminds. He said, \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t afford it, so instead of complaining about the fact that I didn\u2019t have the resources to afford it, I tried to get resourceful. I went out to a bunch of Internet marketing forums, and I found a bunch of people who were in similar situations like me. They couldn\u2019t afford it, but they wanted the information, and so I said, \u201cLook. This is the deal. I\u2019m going to invest in these five Mastermind groups, and my total cost is going to be X amount of dollars. I can\u2019t afford it right now, but if you will pay X amount of dollars into it, I will go to these events, and I will learn. I will do everything, and when I come back from these events, I will bring back and break down everything I learned, all the notes, give you everything, and you\u2019ll get a chance, at a fraction of the cost, to go to all of these events with me, basically, to get all of the information I extract from these.\u201d This guy literally got ten people to give him $10,000. He had $100,000 in cash to go out and join the best Masterminds in the world. I was just like, \u201cWow.\u201d \u2013 resourcefulness, right? He didn\u2019t have the resources, but he figured out a way to make it happen.</p> <p>I always think about one of my favorite people I ever met in my entire life, and this is in the business, or out of the business, but it\u2019s a guy named Stu McLaren. Before I even met Stu, I was putting on this workshop called \u201cAffiliate Boot Camp\u201d, and Stu paid $1,000 to be part of this boot camp. He\u2019s one of the smartest people I have ever met. It was a life-training series that I did, and I\u2019d do a teleseminar. Every teleseminar, I\u2019d open it up for questions at the end, and the first person to pop on was Stu, saying, \u201cHey, Russell, that was amazing. I\u2019m Stu McLaren. That session you gave was amazing. It just totally built me up,\u201d and he talked about why it was so great. He\u2019d ask me some questions, and then he\u2019d thank me, and, \u201cBoom.\u201d Literally, for ten sessions in a row, Stu was the first one asking questions, the first one thanking me, all of that kind of stuff, and it was awesome. Then at the end of the event, he called me up one day, and he was like, \u201cHey, man, I\u2019ve got an idea. We should work on this project together.\u201d I knew who Stu was, and I knew he\u2019d given me so much value from that side. Me, as an educator and a teacher \u2013 to have somebody invest in my business and thank me and all of these things along the way, it changes it. Where now, just like the dude who paid the twenty-five hundred bucks, I have a vested interest in him. I want him to be successful. I want him to take the advice. Yeah, I\u2019m going to pick up the phone, and I\u2019m going to return the call.</p> <p>The other interesting thing is, in my Mastermind group, in our inner circle, we have a couple of different levels \u2013 anywhere from $8,000 up to $25,000 in our coaching program, and inside the programs, all of our members are able to ask me questions each week. They can submit video clips and write questions to me, and we can chat back and forth. It\u2019s a cool process. What\u2019s interesting is that the majority of people who ask me questions will jump on and ask me a question, and that\u2019s it. We move on. Sometimes, they\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, thanks,\u201d but that\u2019s it. There\u2019re not many people that say, \u201cThanks,\u201d and I\u2019m fine with that.</p> <p>I\u2019m not looking for thanks, but there\u2019s one guy whose name is Simon Cryer, and Simon signs up for the coaching program, goes in there, studies a bunch of stuff, and then he jumps into this thing where he can message me, and makes me this video, and all the video said was, \u201cYou know, Russell, thank you. This was one of the most amazing things in the world. It was awesome. It was...,\u201d and all of this stuff. I watched the video, and then I was waiting for him to ask me a favor, a question, or whatever, and he never did. He just thanked me, and I was like, \u201cDude, that guy\u2019s awesome.\u201d Simon\u2019s name, I remembered.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, he e-mailed me a question, and because I knew Simon\u2019s name, and because he\u2019d given me value, I literally sat up that night while my wife was angry at me, because she wanted me to go to bed [laughs]. I spent almost an hour on the computer making videos for him, mapping out the whole game process, showed him what he was doing right, showed him what he was doing wrong, sent him all of my files. I literally gave him a years\u2019 worth of my research. I gave it all to him, one hundred percent, and I just said, \u201cHey, here you go, Simon.\u201d He told me when he got that that he started crying, because he couldn\u2019t believe that I would give him that. I told him afterwards, \u201cYou know what, Simon? You\u2019re the first person that ever thanked me.\u201d</p> <p>It was interesting how that works, and so the reason for this, you guys, is I would just say \u2013 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say, to be honest, but when you want things in life, there\u2019s the right way and the wrong way to do it. The right way is to figure out how you can provide as much value as possible to other people, and if you do that, it\u2019s amazing what they\u2019ll do back in return for you.</p> <p>Sometimes that is paying people, right? I pay coaches all of the time. I wrote Ryan Deiss and Perry Belcher a check for $25,000 in January, because I wanted some of their help. I\u2019m friends with them. I could text them. I could call them, but I wanted to show them that I have respect for them and what they do, so I wrote them a check. I asked them one or two little questions here and there, and those things have transformed my business.</p> <p>I look at Bill Glaser. I was in his Mastermind group for six years. I spoke on his stage tons of times, and one day I had a question. Instead of calling him and saying, \u201cHey, Bill, I have a question for you,\u201d I called his assistant, and I sent him, I think, fifteen hundred bucks for an hour of his time. We got on the phone, and we talked through it. It\u2019s just you understanding that people are busy, and yes, they may have time, and they\u2019re there for their buddies or whatever, but if you\u2019re going to pick their brains or you\u2019re going to do whatever, understand that that\u2019s not a small thing.</p> <p>I have people all the time that are like, \u201cHey, man, let me take you to lunch and pick your brain.\u201d In my life, I have not had the luxury of having lunch for months. I don\u2019t have time for lunch. I eat while I\u2019m working, because I don\u2019t have time to break away and go to lunch. I have too many projects and too many things that are happening. If I were to go to lunch, I would miss time with my family, so I don\u2019t eat lunch. So for them to say, \u201cHey, Russell, I want to take you to lunch and pick your brain,\u201d it seems like in their mind, they\u2019re thinking it\u2019s such a small thing \u2013\u201cHey, I\u2019m going to buy you lunch,\u201d but for me to pull away and go to lunch, it\u2019s like, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand the opportunity cost of that. That will cost me on the lowest end, $2,500, and on the high end, I\u2019m losing $10,000 to $15,000 or more by letting you take me to lunch to pick my brain.\u201d</p> <p>I think that it\u2019s important to understand that, especially with people you\u2019re trying to get to, trying to get access to and need information from. Figure out ways that you can provide value first. Coming to someone and saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019ll give you half of my business,\u201d or, \u201cHey, if you do this, I could make a lot of money, and I\u2019ll give you part of it back,\u201d that\u2019s the same pitch everyone is giving them.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny. I had a guy \u2013 this is another one. I get these all of the time, so I apologize for the rant here, but I had a guy the other day who came up to me and said, \u201cHey, Russell, this is the deal. I pitch you. You\u2019re the one I want to work with on this project. This project\u2019s awesome. What I want you to do is I want you to work with me to set the entire thing up. We\u2019ll do this, this, and this. Help me launch and help me do everything and from that I\u2019ll give you a percentage of the profits.\u201d I wrote him back, and I was like, \u201cDude, for the effort that it would take for me to go and do what you just asked me to do, <em>\u00a0</em>I could do the exact same thing on my own project and keep all of the money. I don\u2019t think you understand that. You\u2019re not providing me value by giving me half of your company and letting me do all of the work. There\u2019s no value for me in that, all right?\u201d</p> <p>And so it\u2019s just an understanding of you looking at the people that you want information from and figuring out, \u201cHow can I serve them first?\u201d Stu McLaren was smart. He did not come to me, day one, and say, \u201cRussell, I need this. I need this. I need this.\u201d He said, \u201cHow can I serve Russell first? I\u2019m going to join his coaching program and ask him questions. I\u2019m going to edify him, and I\u2019m going to do all of this stuff, and I\u2019m going to build a relationship,\u201d and now, when Stu calls, I will drop anything. When Stu says, \u201cRussell, I need this,\u201d I will. To this day, if Stu was to call me at three in the morning and tell me that he needs an accountant, I\u2019d be there. That\u2019s how much rapport he\u2019s built with me.</p> <p>I look at somebody like Simon. After that whole thing happened, I happened to be in Dallas one day, and I think Simon\u2019s from Dallas. We e-mailed, and an hour later, we\u2019re hanging out. We spent the whole day together, and I consider him a close friend. He came out to Boise. We went to the fights together. All of this stuff came from him saying, \u201cThanks,\u201d from him figuring out what I needed in my life to help me. Because of that now, I have this reciprocity, where I want to make sure he\u2019s successful, and he\u2019s going to be successful, because he played his cards right.</p> <p>This guy that came to me first and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to pay you twenty-five hundred bucks for an hour of your time because that\u2019s what it\u2019s worth to you right now,\u201d I\u2019ve probably answered fifteen questions for him since then, because he respected my time. It helped me to feel that value first, and so, yes, I want to help him back out in the other direction.</p> <p>Anyway, I hope this doesn\u2019t fall on deaf ears. In all aspects of your life, whether it\u2019s relationships, whether it\u2019s business or whatever it is, this advice is important. It\u2019s key, and you need to understand it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to admit this, but one of my favorite shows on TV is \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d or \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d. I watch this show, and I cringe every single time, because these guys get two minutes with the bachelor or the bachelorette to get to know them, and the ones that always blow it are the ones that get on there and go, \u201cOkay, so my name is Joe, and this is what I do, and this is what I love,\u201d and they just start talking about themselves, and just dump all of this garbage on the person that they\u2019re on this date with. The girl gets done and walks away, and they\u2019re like, \u201cWow. I know everything about that guy, but he didn\u2019t ask me a single question about myself.\u201d The guys who are successful are the ones who sit down and ask the girl questions. \u2013\u201cTell me about you. Tell me about this.\u201d Those are the ones that succeed. The ones that fall in love are the ones who are not talking about themselves and telling them why they\u2019re great. It\u2019s the ones who go on the dates and ask questions to the other person.</p> <p>When I was in college, I had a roommate. He was one of the most fascinating people ever, and I say that because I always thought that. I remember always thinking that this guy \u2013 John Merritt was his name. I thought, \u201cThis guy\u2019s just fascinating.\u201d He was one of the coolest people. I just thought he was awesome.</p> <p>One day, I came home from something, and I sat down, and I was talking to him, and he literally asked me questions directly for probably an hour straight \u2013 just question after question. Everything he had to say, he seemed more fascinated by what I said, and I was like, \u201cMan,\u201d and all of the sudden, in the middle of this I remember pausing and thinking, \u201cOh, wow. I think he\u2019s so fascinating, but I\u2019ve never asked him a single question. I\u2019m like that guy \u2013 I\u2019m the bad date, but he\u2019s the most amazing person in the world.\u201d He just kept asking me question after question after question. Everything I said, he seemed fascinated by, and that\u2019s what he gave me. That\u2019s why I always wanted to be around John. Everyone wanted to be around John. He was one of the neatest people ever.</p> <p>So anyway, there\u2019s some stuff for all of you guys to think about. I have no idea if this went the right direction or not, but I hope that you guys got some value out of it.</p> <p>I am at the bank grabbing some money, so I\u2019m going to jump off for now, and I appreciate you guys, and I will talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "18:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/podcast_82.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1401386400, "title": "Episode #81 \u2013 Tomorrow?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The little app that helps me get done three times more than anyone else I know.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>Hey, everybody. I hope you have an awesome day today. I was at the office late last night working on some secret projects, but some cool stuff happened. One, for example \u2013 I think I\u2019ve mentioned this before. I\u2019ve been working on a book that is my first real book. I really going to get it published and try to do the whole \u201cNew York Times \u2018Best Seller\u2019\u201d thing, but anyway, I needed somebody to write some blurbs and stuff for the book. I needed someone to write a \u201cForward\u201d and that kind of stuff.</p> <p>My dream person to write the Forward was Tony Robbins, because I know Tony, and so I came to him. \u2013\u201cWould you mind writing me a forward for my new book?\u201d I was assuming he\u2019d say, \u201cNo,\u201d because he\u2019s pretty dang busy, you know? He wrote me back and said, \u201cHey, I wish I could, but I\u2019m in the middle of writing my own book, but if you want, I could write a blurb, a quote, to put on the book.\u201d So I was like, \u201cAll right.\u201d So he sent me a quote last night, and it was awesome.</p> <p>I\u2019m driving, so I don\u2019t have it in front of me, but it was something about how \u2013 well, I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise. You guys will see it. It made me feel pretty good. I was excited. I\u2019ve got a quote from Tony that\u2019s going to be on the book, and then I still need a forward written. I think I\u2019m going to get either Dan Kennedy or Bill Glaser for the forward. I need them both. Can you do two forwards? That would be pretty sweet.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m super excited for the book. It\u2019s almost done. I should have the rough draft all finished by this weekend, and then I\u2019m heading out to a Mastermind meeting out in San Diego, and so I\u2019m going to be proofreading it out there. It should be pretty awesome, so I\u2019m excited for that, for today.</p> <p>I want to share with you guys a tool. I don\u2019t share enough tools with you guys, I don\u2019t think, so maybe I\u2019ll start doing more of this. There\u2019re three or four tools that I use to run my entire business, and this one I\u2019m going to share with you guys today is about the simplest, most dumb thing in the world. At first, honestly, I downloaded it as a joke, and then I started using it, and now I\u2019d say I probably look at it thirty times a day. It\u2019s one of my most important things ever.</p> <p>The story behind it is that back when I first got my phone \u2013 actually that\u2019s not true. I\u2019d had my phone for a couple of years. One time I was looking for some kind of task management or to do list software, and there\u2019re tons of them out there. Most of them are just lame, but there was this one that was called \u201cTomorrow\u201d, and basically what it is, is this app on your phone. You have a \u201cTo Do\u201d list, and you put in all of your to do\u2019s, and then can see them all there. What you can do is, if you say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get this done today,\u201d you can click a little button, and it pushes it to tomorrow. That\u2019s all the app does. It\u2019s a to-do list, and then you can push things to tomorrow. I think the joke behind it is, \u201cOh, just push it off.\u201d You can just slack off and keep pushing things until tomorrow.</p> <p>I started using it on my phone for a while. I didn\u2019t really use it a lot, but then one day, I don\u2019t know what happened. I was getting ready to look for some to-do software, and I found that they actually have an online version as well that syncs with your phone and with your iPod and your iPad and with all of your devices, so I logged in there. It\u2019s \u201cTomorrow dot D-O\u201d. Tomorrow.do is the website. It\u2019s free to use. I log in there, and I have my huge to-do list.</p> <p>What\u2019s cool about it is that in the past, I\u2019d have to-do\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d have a notepad of paper, and things just always slipped through the cracks for some reason. It always slipped through the cracks. I\u2019d have a notepad of paper at my house, and one at the office, and one in my car. I\u2019d have all of these papers everywhere, and it was hard to keep track of everything. Whereas now, with Tomorrow.do, it\u2019s on my phone. It\u2019s at my office. It\u2019s on all of my computers. What\u2019s cool is when I\u2019m sitting there, like when I\u2019m driving somewhere, and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh crap, I need to do this thing,\u201d I open up the app real quick and type it in, and, \u201cBoom,\u201d it\u2019s saved.</p> <p>Then what it does is, at midnight, everything that was on tomorrow\u2019s, \u201cBoom,\u201d all gets shifted over to today, because now it\u2019s today. If I\u2019m up late at night, usually I\u2019ll do it at night, if not, then first thing in the morning when I wake up. I\u2019ll see all of my to-dos. Everything that is still in my queue for me to do, and then I just start going through and I just push everything until tomorrow that I know I\u2019m not going to be able to do today. I push, push, push, push, push, and then all I have left a list of four or five things I need to do today, and it just feels awesome.</p> <p>I go through it, and every time I get something done, I log back in, cross it off, and I can\u2019t even tell you the feeling I get after I cross something off. It\u2019s like the greatest thing in the world. Literally, for the last eighteen months or so, this little tool has been how I\u2019ve been able to push forward and get things done and not have things slip through the cracks, and just keep cranking on things, and so, if you\u2019re looking for a way to get more done and make sure nothing falls through the cracks, and also for me, it organizes my day. It shows me exactly what\u2019s most important, but I don\u2019t lose track of the stuff I still need to do. It\u2019s my favorite thing in the world, and it\u2019s free, so I highly, highly, highly recommend it. Just go to Tomorrow.do, log in and create an account, and download the app. I think the app\u2019s just called \u201cTomorrow\u201d, I believe, but if you can\u2019t find the app, just go to the website and the website will link to the app as well, but it is awesome.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m at the office today. I\u2019m going to go in to the office, and the first thing I\u2019m going to do is open Tomorrow.do, look at my tasks, shove everything off until tomorrow that I\u2019m not going to get done today. Then I\u2019m going to start busting out those things, and I\u2019ll bet you I will accomplish more in the next four or five hours than you can do all day, because I\u2019ve got this little tool. You guys, go try it out. You will love it. I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go have some fun. I will talk to you guys soon. Thanks for listening.</p>", "duration": "06:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/81_-_Tomorrow.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1400868000, "title": "Episode #80 \u2013 What I Learned At A Lindsey Sterling Concert", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Last night I saw one of the most powerful uses of the \u201cattractive character\u201d ever. Let me show you how Lindsey Sterling used the \u201cattractive character\u201d to get her audience to fall in love with her.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>Hey, everyone. It\u2019s early, and I\u2019m heading to the gym, but it\u2019s nice, because now that it\u2019s summertime, it looks like noon at 6:30 in the morning. I love summer. I\u2019m excited for it.</p> <p>I wanted to share with you guys a really, super awesome experience. Last night, my wife and I had a chance to go to a Lindsey Stirling concert. If you don\u2019t know who Lindsey Stirling is yet, go to YouTube and type in \u201cLindsey Stirling\u201d, and look. There\u2019re a couple of really good videos. One of them is of her playing violin and dancing in fire, and one\u2019s her running through igloos. It's definitely worth watching.</p> <p>She did a show up here in Boise in a really small venue called \u201cThe Knitting Factory\u201d, where only about five or six hundred people could jam into this place. It\u2019s standing room only. We went to it, and it was awesome. I\u2019ve heard a couple of pretty cool things in my life, and this was one of the neatest experiences in entertainment I\u2019ve ever seen. We were talking about it beforehand, the fact that, if you watch her, she plays the violin while she dances. It\u2019s a really cool blend of talents. It\u2019s just so different. She was on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d a bunch of years ago, and Pierce Morgan kicked her off [laughs], and all of this stuff, but she just kept going and going, and now she\u2019s got this. I think this is her second tour, and she\u2019s done really, really well. What\u2019s interesting is, if you look at her, she\u2019s really good at playing the violin. I\u2019d say she\u2019s an above-average violin player, and she\u2019s a good dancer. I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s a great dancer. She\u2019s a good dancer, but the fact that she blends those two together makes her unique and different, and literally, the show last night, I felt like was world-class. I can\u2019t even say enough about how awesome it was.</p> <p>It was interesting, though. There was one thing I wanted to mention, because I thought it was profound from a marketing standpoint. I don\u2019t think many other people really caught it, but as you guys all know, I\u2019m obsessed with this whole marketing thing. I\u2019m looking at what people are doing and why they\u2019re doing it and how they\u2019re doing it and the reaction from the crowd and stuff like that. The one thing that she did that was super cool \u2013 she came out, and she played two or three songs, and everyone was going crazy. Then she needed to take a break really quickly to change outfits. She goes off the stage, and all of the sudden, behind, on the main stage, there\u2019s a screen that\u2019s got effects and all of these things happening. All of the sudden, this thing pops up, like a little movie, and it says, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been officially introduced yet,\u201d and then it shows Lindsey when she\u2019s an infant, and it shows her as a toddler, and it shows her as a two-year-old, and a three-year-old, and then five, and six. It\u2019s showing her throughout her whole life \u2013 these little video clips of her saying cute little things and doing stuff, and showing her dancing, and showing her practicing violin. All of her experience that got her to this point, basically, you saw in this little three-minute video, and literally, instantly, it went from everyone going there, thinking who she was and seeing her as a fan, all of the sudden, everyone saw her at a different level.</p> <p>At the event last weekend, I talked a lot about the \u201cattractive character\u201d. I\u2019m sure you guys, if you\u2019ve been following me for any amount of time, you\u2019ve heard me talk about that and the importance of it and what it does for your brand and for everything you\u2019re doing. I would look at that video, and it was just like, \u201cMan, look at how it changed everybody in this room. We all went from Lindsey Stirling and people who wanted to get out for the night to do an event to people who were fans. She did that all in a little three-minute video. It was not professionally done, but it brought out all of the elements of attractive character, and it was awesome.</p> <p>I\u2019m in the gym, but I want to keep talking about this, so I\u2019m going to pause it, and hopefully when I come back out to the car, my recorder won\u2019t have shut off. I\u2019m going to pause this, and I\u2019ll be back in forty-five minutes.</p> <p>All right, I am back. That was a hard workout [laughs]. So I\u2019m going to continue where we left off. We were talking about Lindsey\u2019s concert. I was talking about the video and the whole attractive character concept, and I\u2019ve had a lot of people ask me, when we talk about attractive character, \u201cHow do you introduce yourself to the audience, and how do you build this relationship?\u201d</p> <p>A lot of times, I think people are confused. They\u2019re thinking, \u201cHow do I do this on the front end before someone meets me?\u201d You create your own squeeze page or on your landing page or whatever, to get somebody in the door, just like Lindsey. She started the concert. She came out. She did two or three songs, and then after we built that initial rapport, it\u2019s like, \u201cHere, let me tell you my story.\u201d Boom \u2013 all of the sudden, it sucks you in. For us, usually on your front end or your squeeze page, it\u2019s kind of blind, trying to get somebody in the door. Now if they\u2019re in the door \u2013 \u201cBoom.\u201d Now it\u2019s where you introduce your attractive character and everything else.</p> <p>One of the big questions we had at our event last weekend was from one of the girls that were there. She was really cool. She was talking about how, \u201cHow come all of the ads are ugly, and they\u2019ve got red outlines, and you go to these squeeze pages, and there\u2019s no branding? They\u2019re just ugly. I want to have banners that are brown and yellow and that use my colors,\u201d and all of these things. I was trying to explain it to her, and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s a time and a place. Your initial goal is to get as many people in your front door as possible. Because of that, you\u2019ve got to use what works, and what works a lot of times is this cheesy stuff \u2013 headlines and color schemes that probably don\u2019t match your brand and your fill, but that\u2019s okay, because your initial goal is to just get them in the door.\u201d As soon as they come through that front door, for us at least, we immediately transition from a kind of a cold, high-conversion funnel to our branding stuff.</p> <p>That\u2019s the way that we look at the way that we drive our traffic. It\u2019s a two-step process. Step One, bring them in with whatever converts the best, and then immediately, now that you\u2019ve got them, they\u2019re on your list. Now it\u2019s time to start building your brand and your attractive character and all of those things, where now you\u2019re getting them to build the relationship. That\u2019s how you start getting people to convert better on the back end, because I agree one hundred percent. I think that branding on the back end is important. In fact, I think you\u2019ll sell way more.</p> <p>For example, this week we sold four people our $25,000 package, which is awesome. That\u2019s by far a record for our high-end coaching things in a week. We sold four of them on the phones. I never could have done that off of a cold campaign, where somebody comes in off of a cold squeeze page, and we call them to sell. No, they come in off of a cold campaign, and then after we\u2019ve got them, now we share our attractive character, and we share stories, and we share our branding. We do all of this stuff to warm up that relationship, and get us to the point where somebody will come in at a higher level.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m not sure how exactly that relates to Lindsey\u2019s concert, but it\u2019s just something that\u2019s interesting. The other thing, and again, this is me, from the marketing standpoint. I always look at situations and stuff from the perspective of, \u201cWhat would I be doing different if this was mine. If they hired me as a consultant, what would I do?\u201d One of the big things that I notice \u2013 oh, and there\u2019s a cop, a motorcycle cop, shooting people with his gun [laughs], and I think I clipped it.</p> <p>All right, I\u2019m back. I was looking at what they\u2019re doing, and they had this pre-band come out first, and they were great. They sang and got everybody excited, and then they took thirty minutes to reset the stage and everything. Then Lindsey came out, and again, she was just awesome, from the very first second she walked in. What was interesting is I\u2019m looking at this room. There were maybe five hundred to a thousand people, all jammed. We\u2019re all standing-room only, and it\u2019s a really cool facility, and literally, there were probably ten of us \u2013 my wife and I, and a couple of others who were jumping around, having fun, and everybody else was just kind of standing there looking at her. I think everyone enjoyed the experience, but we were at the equivalent of a rock concert or more, and nobody\u2019s moving around.</p> <p>I was thinking a lot about Tony Robbins, when we did his events, and when we were at his event, I\u2019m the kind of person who, I don\u2019t like dancing. We didn\u2019t dance at our wedding. I just don\u2019t do that. At my first Tony Robbins event that I went to, everybody was dancing like crazy, and for the first eight hours, I refused to participate in the shenanigans. I did not want to be dancing, right? [laughs] After a while, he broke me down to where we were all just going crazy, and it was awesome. I remember that next day was the first time I ever met with Tony. We had a little private meeting, and we were talking. We were in Toronto, and he said that it always takes a while to get the audience in a state where they\u2019re willing to jump around and dance and go crazy and leave their inhibitions behind, and he said that at some events, that happens really, really fast, and other ones take a long time. He said that Toronto took a long time. It took five or six hours before he felt like he\u2019d broken through and everyone was playing full out.</p> <p>So it took a process, but I was thinking about what Tony does. When you show up at his event, he\u2019s got thirty people on stage dancing, and they\u2019re trying to get the whole audience dancing, and everything\u2019s moving, so as soon as he walks out on stage, the whole audience is already dancing and moving and jumping around, and so it\u2019s easy to kind of step into that and start running with it.</p> <p>At Lindsey\u2019s thing, everyone was sitting around waiting, waiting, waiting, and then she comes out at level ten, but nobody had been moving and dancing and jumping, just people like my wife and I, who\u2019d been to Tony Robbins. We like jumping around now [laughs]. We\u2019re jumping around, and everyone else is sitting there, even after her seventh or eighth performance. It was insane. It was so good, and again, my wife and I are jumping around crazy, and she like comes out to the audience, \u201cYou guys are awesome. There\u2019s a pack of girls out there going crazy,\u201d and literally, there was probably twenty of us, maybe in the whole audience who were going nuts.</p> <p>I think for her I would look at, before she comes out, getting a bunch of people on stage, getting the audience dancing and moving and coach them and train them and get them to get in the right state that you want so that when you show up, their energy level\u2019s at a different level.</p> <p>Two times ago, when we were in New York, we went to \u201cThe David Letterman Show\u201d, and what was really interesting was the fact that before the show, we had someone who took our entire audience and coached us through the entire process and coached us through what we\u2019d need to do. \u2013\u201cThis is what David needs. He needs you laughing. He needs you moving. He needs your energy,\u201d and they\u2019d coach us through it, and when we got into the studio, and it was the same thing. They\u2019d coach us through it again, and they got us all prepped. Then Dave came out, and, \u201cBoom,\u201d we were at level ten by the time he showed up. I think from a marketing standpoint, that pre-frame is big.</p> <p>Now that concept can work anywhere. When I used to do teleseminars and webinars, I would get on there, and they were all quiet and then when we\u2019d get started answering, I\u2019d say, \u201cHi, this is Russell,\u201d and I\u2019d get started\u201d I remember five or six years ago, I was doing a teleseminar with Armond Morin, and I showed up ten minutes early. He was on there for ten minutes prepping the event, getting people excited, getting them fired up. \u2013\u201cThis is what\u2019s going to be happening. You\u2019re going to have a chance to listen to Russell, and it\u2019s going to be great. Thank you so much for coming,\u201d and then he had this loop, where he kept on getting people fired up for this thing, for ten or fifteen minutes before we started. Then, \u201cBoom,\u201d we started, and we were at a level ten.</p> <p>So that state, the state that whatever people enter into whatever experience \u2013 your teleseminar, your webinar, your event, your sales process \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of ways you guys can manipulate that. If Lindsey\u2019s crew were to hire me, that\u2019s what I would be focusing on \u2013 how to manipulate that pre-frame before she shows up, so that when she shows up, and when she stepped on the stage, it would be at a level ten from day one. And I\u2019d say that idea is for you guys too. Think about all of your sales processes, how to crank that up and get your audience at level ten before you start speaking or selling or teaching.</p> <p>I\u2019m back home. I\u2019m going to go eat and get ready for the day. I appreciate you guys. I hope you enjoyed this podcast. If you have a chance to go to a Lindsey Stirling concert, do it. It was awesome. Worst case \u2013 just go to YouTube and type in \u201cLindsey Stirling\u201d and watch some of her stuff, and you guys will be blown away by her talent, for sure. All right, guys. I\u2019m out. We\u2019ll talk to you again soon.</p>", "duration": "12:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/80_-_What_I_Learned_At_A_Lindsey_Sterling_Concert.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1400781600, "title": "Episode #79 \u2013 To Grow Or Not To Grow", "author": "", "summary": "<p>When is it smart to expand and grow your company vs keeping it small and lean?</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell, again, and welcome to \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>All right, guys and gals, and everybody else who\u2019s listening in, I\u2019m heading to the office today, and this is what\u2019s been on my mind, because we\u2019re about to do a really, really cool thing. As you guys know, I\u2019ve been talking and bragging and being super-excited about Click Funnels. Last weekend, as you know, we did our Mastermind, and we did our live event. Some of my buddies were at the event, Garrett and Scott \u2013 they run a couple of sites. They run TrustGuard.com, ShopperApproved.com, KartRocket.com, and they\u2019ve been really, really successful in the software space. In fact, I can\u2019t tell their numbers, but last month they did insanely well for themselves.</p> <p>What was cool is while they were sharing their pricing model and how they upgrade people and stuff like that, it opened a huge light bulb in my head, because the way our old pricing was structured, we really had some virtual limits on what we could do and how much money we could make. Anyway, that\u2019s where things were at, and after they showed us their pricing model, it opened up the door to a whole new world, and I\u2019m really, really excited. And then they showed us where they had this mini call center that ascends people who get a free trial, and sends them in to a yearly contract which goes from $0 up to, for a year, $3,000 or $4,000 for that contract.</p> <p>I really think that that\u2019s the route that we need to go with our company. We completely changed our pricing structure because of it, and with that, we started looking at, \u201cHey, if we\u2019re going to do this model \u2013 what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve got to have our own mini call center that\u2019s [? 49:24] ascending trial people, and doing demos, and upgrading them, and this whole thing,\u201d If we\u2019re going to do that, and we\u2019re going to do it right, we\u2019ve got to build a team to be able to do that [laughs]. We\u2019re about a month away from rolling out Click Funnels, and we want to have people in place so that when customers are coming in, we\u2019ve got to obviously have a support team, which is going to be big, but also a team to upgrade and to do demos and everything else. We were mapping it out yesterday. To do that, we\u2019re going to need a small team of people, initially, of, who knows? Four or five people, maybe, which now brings me to my own personal fears.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019ve got fears in business. Earlier in my career, I went and got excited, and we ended up building a company with over a hundred employees, and it was scary, but it was exciting. But it went down, and so now I\u2019m in a spot where we\u2019ve got something that I think is going to grow, and it\u2019s going to grow really, really rapidly, and we want to make sure that the infrastructure and everything\u2019s in place. So what do you do? Do you not build those things out, and try to keep it small and lean, and support suffers a little bit? Or do you put the extra costs in and try to go big? There\u2019re so many variables, and so the question on my mind today is to grow, or not to grow? What do you do?</p> <p>I\u2019m just kind of walking you guys through my mindset, because part of me wants to have this whole infrastructure in place from Day One so that we can scale, and part of me is nervous about that, and I\u2019m sure that a lot of you guys are kind of in that same spot. A lot of people are always asking me, \u201cRussell, we\u2019re building our company. Who should we be hiring first? When should we be hiring people?\u201d, and all of that kind of thing.</p> <p>Some of the best advice I got was from the book, \u201cREWORK\u201d. He talks about in there that you only hire when it hurts, and so anyway, I have these three or four different internal dialogs happening inside my mind, and I\u2019m not sure of the answer yet, so I\u2019m excited to say I\u2019m going to meet with the team and be going over that, and figure it out. Obviously if we do decide to take this span, we\u2019re going to start with the smallest team possible, but also big enough that we\u2019ll be able to handle the influx.</p> <p>Some of the cool things that we\u2019re planning when we roll this out, as you guys will see, we\u2019re going to have a Tesla club. We\u2019re going to be giving away a Ferrari. We\u2019re going to be doing a bunch of really cool things, and to be able to facilitate that, obviously, there\u2019s going to be a lot of growth, and we need to have things in place, and so we\u2019re in this \u2018chicken and the egg\u2019 kind of spot, and it\u2019s really fun, and it\u2019s really exciting. I\u2019m excited to see what comes from it, but anyway, that\u2019s the game plan today.</p> <p>One of my big focuses is to figure out, internally, are we going to grow or are we not going to grow? Are we going to figure out smarter ways to do it? Are we going to try to have this happen with people that are outside of the company, or are we going to try to do internal? If we do keep it internal, do we get a bigger office? What are the plans? What should we do? So instead of doing it the way I used to do it, where we would just start running \u2013 which there\u2019re benefits to the ready-fire-aim model, but I want to try to do this right this time. I want to make sure that as we\u2019re growing, that we\u2019re growing correctly, and that we\u2019re doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t put our company at any kind of risk or harm, but in a way that we\u2019re growing very organically, but very rapidly as well.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s a fun conundrum. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right word. It\u2019s a fun puzzle. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but man, business is so much fun. It\u2019s every day waking up and you\u2019re playing this game, and you\u2019re trying to figure out what goes where and what\u2019s going to be the best way of how to optimize it, but every single thing you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re always risking. You\u2019re gambling, and sometimes you\u2019re gambles pay off, and sometimes they don\u2019t.</p> <p>One of our 25K clients \u2013 I had a call from him yesterday. He\u2019s a young, 22-year-old kid who\u2019s crushing right now, doing over a hundred grand a month, and he\u2019s doing awesome. It\u2019s interesting. We test things, and he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ll run ten things, and eight of the ten will be losers, but those other two just blow up, and they make everything else worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, and so I look at us in our spot right now, and it\u2019s exciting and fun in trying to decide which direction we want to go, but doing it, again, more methodically this time, as opposed to just running and jumping like I often did in the past. For you guys, I hope that gives you some excitement, and helps you start thinking about your business. Is it time to grow? If so, what\u2019s the strategy? What\u2019s the right way? What\u2019s the wrong way? How do you do it virtually versus internally? \u00a0\u00a0 All of the fun things we\u2019re coming up with \u2013 I\u2019ll let you guys know in the future what we come up with, and where we\u2019re headed.</p> <p>Part of me would love to get a new office. Our office is nice now, but one that\u2019s a little bit bigger, where we could have more space for our team to be doing that kind of stuff, but then also, it would be fun to have our own little spot where we could do our own little video studio, and a couple of other things, and so I may call my old commercial real estate realtor up here in Boise and look around and see if we can find a spot that\u2019s a little bit bigger that give us the ability to have some cool stuff like that. So who know? I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go have some fun today. I\u2019ve got about two hours of work, then I\u2019m heading to jiu jitsu, which will give me about an hour and a half to go and try to beat some people up, which always helps me out, and then tonight, we\u2019re going to go watch Lindsey Stirling, which will be pretty exciting. If you don\u2019t know who Lindsey Stirling is yet, go to YouTube and type in \u201cLindsey Stirling\u201d, and look for the video where she\u2019s playing the violin in the fire. She\u2019s a rock star, and that\u2019s who we\u2019re going to go see tonight. It should be a fun day. I\u2019m excited. Thanks, you guys, and we will talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "07:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/79_-_To_Grow_Or_Not_To_Grow.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1400695200, "title": "Episode #78 \u2013 Amateurs Focus On The Front End", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A simple lesson that Russell learned from his carpet cleaner.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everybody. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to an amazing, beautiful outside day, and a new episode of \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>I just want to share. I had something that made me smile over the last day or so. I thought I would bring it up to you guys. As you know, we had a big, huge event out here in Boise for the last four days. It was awesome. People loved it. It\u2019s some of the best stuff we\u2019ve ever done, and I\u2019m really proud of it.</p> <p>One of the things we talked a lot about was funnels. We talked a lot about how to structure your funnel the right way, how to make a lot of money, and one thing I taught is that the concept of that amateurs focus on the front end, and smart business owners like you and me focus on the back end. How do we structure that? How do we put more of our effort over there? After that, I had a funny experience.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been getting our carpets cleaned for probably the last three years from this guy, and he\u2019s a really nice guy. My wife always talks about him, but I\u2019d never had a chance to meet him. So he was coming over to our house, and he was cleaning the carpet again. I\u2019d say this is the sixth or seventh time we\u2019ve hired him to clean the carpets. He\u2019s made some pretty good money off of us. So I was talking to him, and he said, \u201cYeah, so you used to own CitySmart.com, right?\u201d to which I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cCity Smart\u201dused to be, back before Groupon came out. When Groupon was only nine cities, we saw what they were doing, so we\u00a0 launched a Groupon here in Boise called City Smart, and we were growing it and everything, and then Groupon and Living Social came in and beat us out, unfortunately, but it was a lot of fun.</p> <p>Supposedly we ran his offer on City Smart, and I asked him, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. How did it go for you?\u201d and he goes, \u201cIt was horrible, the worst thing I ever did.\u201d I said, \u201cReally? What happened?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I did it, and from that I ended up getting like, I don\u2019t know, 150 customers. I went and cleaned the houses, and I made no money off of it. It was a complete waste of my time and energy.\u201d I said, \u201cReally? That\u2019s interesting. So how did my wife meet you?\u201d He goes, \u201cWell she bought one of the things off of City Smart.\u201d I was like, \u201cInteresting,\u201d and then I just kind of left it there, to see if he would pick up what I was laying down, and he totally missed it [laughs].</p> <p>I just want for all of you guys who actually understand marketing and business to smile with me, because that guy didn\u2019t realize that that little cheapy thing he\u2019d run on City Smart, that at least us, if nobody else, at least us \u2013 we came in so far, and have hired him at least six or seven times since then, probably spent $1,000 or more with him, and we will continue to keep doing that, because he\u2019s a nice guy and does a great job. I\u2019m guessing those other 150 people we gave him \u2013 clients that we drove to him \u2013 I\u2019m guessing a big percentage of those guys probably hired him to come back again and again. I would bet that if he looked at his stats from that City Smart promotion, it was probably the best thing that his business ever had \u2013 ever.</p> <p>And that wasn\u2019t even considering the fact that he\u2019s a horrible sales person. If it wasn\u2019t for my wife and the fact that when she meets somebody she likes, she just keeps hiring them over and over and over again, but he never follows up. If you look at one of my buddies, Joe Polish, he teaches carpet cleaners how to\u00a0 build these big businesses, and what he teaches carpet cleaners is that when someone comes in, get them on a continuity program where you go back every three months and clean their carpet. If he was to pitch us a maintenance fee, where we paid him ninety-seven bucks a month and then three times a year, he came and cleaned our carpets at a discount, we would have done it, and I\u2019m betting out of those 150 other people, a lot of other people would have done it as well [laughs].</p> <p>It just made me smile. It\u2019s unfortunate, but it made me laugh, that someone like that, who got all of these leads from us was upset about the experience, whereas it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s fueling his business right now. I just want all of you guys to know, and I want to make sure all of you guys understand that I know [laughs] that amateurs focus on the front end. I would rather lose $20, $30, $40, $50 on the front end sale if it acquires a customer, because that customer, as you\u2019ve seen with my wife and I and the carpet cleaning did buy, and we\u2019ve continued to buy it over and over and over again.</p> <p>So for you guys, think about your businesses. What are you being short-sighted on? What are you freaking out on because the front end is not quite right? What could you change around to make it a lot better for you and for your business?</p> <p>I\u2019m at the office. It\u2019s a beautiful day. I\u2019m excited. Remember, amateurs focus on the front end, and you guys, as people inside DotComSecrets and inside the \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcasts, you understand that we focus on the back end. That\u2019s it for today, you guys. Have a great day, and we\u2019ll talk to you guys all again, soon.</p>", "duration": "05:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/78_-_Amateurs_Focus_On_The_Front_End.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1399658400, "title": "Episode #77 \u2013 Transforming Your Art Into A Replicatable Science", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How coaching people, through what you do naturally everyday, can change your business forever.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>Hey, guys and gals. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done a podcast. It\u2019s just been nose-to-the-grindstone, going crazy, and I just haven\u2019t pulled up for a moment. I\u2019m driving right now to get my haircut. My hair also has not had a chance [laughs] to have anyone pay attention to it. I look like a wookie. My hair is huge, so I\u2019m getting it all cut down today, and getting prepared for an event that we\u2019re doing here in Boise next week for all of our Inner Circle members. It\u2019s going to be awesome. I\u2019m really excited.</p> <p>Here\u2019s some backstory on it. It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve wanted to write a book for [laughs] probably ten years now. I keep trying, and it\u2019s hard, so finally last year, I just decided, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d You look at the best people, and they hire really good ghost writers, so I went to out there and tried to find a ghost writer. My biggest thing is that I wanted the book to be the same things I teach at events, the things that I believe in, and that we do every single day, and I wanted it to sound like it came from me. I went and researched a bunch of people, and I found someone who specializes in writing in your actual voice. She\u2019s been awesome, and so I hired her. She\u2019s not been cheap, by any stretch of the imagination, but she\u2019s writing a book for me. It\u2019s important.</p> <p>She\u2019s been working on the book, and doing the book\u2019s been forcing me to set down, chapter by chapter, in excruciating detail, and record audios and mind maps, and everything in my core \u2013 the things I teach. It\u2019s been really fun, as I have been getting out all of these things. What\u2019s interesting is, she may have told me, or somebody else told me, \u201cWhen you start writing a book is the first time that you really start understanding what you actually do.\u201d It\u2019s been interesting because the mechanics behind what we do every single day, when you try to teach them to somebody at this level, it changes. You really have to dig deeper, and you start getting connections in things you wouldn\u2019t normally see or do. It\u2019s kind of fascinating.</p> <p>As I was doing this whole thing, I said, \u201cYou know what? I know on the back end we\u2019re going to want to sell something, so I want to do an event where I actually go through and I teach all of this stuff as well, plus it will force me to get into these thoughts much deeper,\u201d so I\u2019m putting them down, and we mapped out an event, which is the event happening next week. It broke down everything we were teaching into twelve core secrets. You guys know \u201cDotComSecrets\u201d, so it\u2019s \u201cTwelve Dot Com Secrets\u201d, and they\u2019re all focused around doubling your traffic, conversion, or sales.</p> <p>It\u2019s been really, really fun. If you guys haven\u2019t had that experience of writing a book yet, I really definitely recommend doing it. It actually reminds me a lot of my wrestling in high school. I was a great wrestler. I was a state champ, I think, second place in the country. I went to college, and then when I was in college, they started inviting me to come teach at wrestling camps.</p> <p>I remember my first summer after my freshman year, going to these camps and teaching younger kids. I remember the big epiphany I had on things. I can remember working with these kids and teaching them stuff and showing them stuff, and they wouldn\u2019t get it, so I\u2019d have to break it down and break it down until the point where it was just so simple that they\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, I can see how it works.\u201d When I would do that, it made me start realizing why the wrestling move worked. \u2013\u201cThe reason why this works for me is because of the way my positioning was this, the way my hips were this, my arm was here, my leg was here.\u201d You start seeing things you don\u2019t see at a level when you\u2019re in it all of the time, right?</p> <p>I really think that going back and teaching wrestling camps during the off season helped me a lot as a wrestler. I just was able to learn so much more about what I was doing. You never really see it, and after you realize that this is working because of this, this, and this, then you look at it like, \u201cWell, where else can I apply those principals, those things that are working?\u201d So that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening with this book. It\u2019s been interesting.</p> <p>One thing that I wanted to do was I wanted each chapter to be a stand-alone, yet they all kind of build on each other, but I wanted them to be like if you were struggling in one part of your business, you could take a chapter and just read it and learn something, but I was like, \u201cI want to go deeper than that. I want it to be like where you can just pick up an image and look at the image, and the image \u2013 like if you haven\u2019t read the chapter, you look at the image, and it won\u2019t really make sense, but when you read the chapter, and you come back to that image, it makes perfect sense.\u201d That way, it\u2019s kind of burned into your memory, so if you come back a year later, and you\u2019re flipping through the book, and you see this diagram or this sketched-out concept, instantly, everything you learned before will come back, and it will be just like a flood of memories \u2013\u201cBoom.\u201d It will be there really, really fast.</p> <p>And so, what\u2019s cool is that for every single core concept I teach and I do and I believe in that we\u2019ve been doing, I\u2019ve been breaking them down into these really cool, drawn-out process flows, where Step One is this, Step Two, Step Three, and so on. I literally went through an entire yellow pad of paper sketching out all of these different concepts, and I\u2019ve been taking pictures of them, and I send them to one of my designers, who then takes it, and makes it look like a really professionally hand-drawn image instead of my scribblings on yellow paper, but it\u2019s really cool.</p> <p>Today what was fun is one of the chapters \u2013 I have a whole chapter that\u2019s when we get to the sales and the copywriting and how we sell stuff online section, that I call \u201cInception Secrets\u201d. It comes from a presentation I actually gave at mine and Daegen Smith\u2019s event, where I was talking about how in sales and marketing how much business has changed.</p> <p>In the 1980s, the average attention span of a person was twenty minutes, and today, the average attention span is only nine seconds. Is that crazy? Every nine seconds, your brain\u2019s looking for the next text message or Facebook or e-mail or whatever, and so you can\u2019t focus. Because of that, that\u2019s the world we\u2019re selling in now. If you look at how sales has been taught for years, you know that these brilliant copywriters back in the day, Eugene Schwartz and all of these guys that you study and learn about, while what they taught was correct, and what they showed is true, it\u2019s not as relevant today, just because the environment that we\u2019re selling in is so different.</p> <p>They would have evolved and gotten to the point where they could sell something in nine seconds, but they didn\u2019t have to back then, and so the Inception Secrets is this evolution of copywriting and how it\u2019s changed. One of the big things is that people that don\u2019t want to be sold to. They love to buy things, and so if you can create a selling environment where they think it\u2019s their idea \u2013 you\u2019re basically showing them a process, and then all of the sudden they have this epiphany that they think is their epiphany. It\u2019s kind of like the movie \u201cInception\u201d, where they would place an idea inside of somebody\u2019s dream which would cause them to do or say or change something.</p> <p>That\u2019s what the whole concept of that chapter was. It\u2019s like, \u201cHow do you illustrate that? How do you create these epiphanies in people\u2019s minds so that they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being sold, that they\u2019re buying in?\u201d That was a concept at Todd\u2019s event, but it was like, \u201cHow do I materialize that in to a graph where you can look at it and have a process that you can follow to be able to create an inception?\u201d It took me about a day to sit down and really map that out and all of the pieces and all of the things, and it will come out and say, \u201cBoom. Here\u2019s the graph. This is how you do it. Here\u2019s how you create inception in somebody\u2019s mind in the sales process.\u201d</p> <p>In the next chapter, I go through the different sales scripts for different points in the sales funnel, and I think there\u2019re six core scripts that I use, and again, I go through and down and break those down into excruciating detail, like every single thing. It turned out so cool, like one of them is basically my copywriting template, and it\u2019s based off of \u2013 I can\u2019t remember who I learned it from initially. I think it was Gary Halbert, or it might have been Dan Kennedy, but anyway, I talk about the core fundamentals of a sales letter as a star, a story, and a solution.</p> <p>A star is the person the sales letter is about. The story is their story, and the solution is the product that you\u2019re offering, so it starts out with the three sections, but then inside each section, what\u2019s the process you take somebody through? In the star section, I think there were five things that you take somebody through, and then in the story, I think, there were twelve things, and in the solution there were eighteen things. When you write your copy, you pull out these three diagrams, you start at number one, and, \u201cBoom, boom, boom.\u201d By the time you\u2019ve gone through the whole thing, you\u2019ve got your sales letter written very simply and very easily, knowing that you\u2019re following a proven model.</p> <p>I just went through all of my old sales letters and literally, I just had like this huge table of everything I\u2019ve ever done or learned or created about writing copy and broke all of that stuff down into these little simple diagrams. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m excited for it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this podcast?\u201d you may be asking. Outside of getting excited to see the book someday, and then hopefully getting excited for the event, if you\u2019re coming \u2013 and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll sell recordings of that later on down the road, but what\u2019s the point of this podcast?</p> <p>I think that the real point of it is a couple of things. First off, it comes back to when I talked about back when I was wrestling. I was a good wrestler. I was a state champ. I took second place in the country. I was an All-American. I did great in high school, yet it wasn\u2019t until I started teaching other people what I was doing that I was able to break down things to a fundamental level where I really found out what made what I was doing work. When I learned that, I was able to apply it in so many different areas, and I think it\u2019s the exact same thing with businesses. I think for you, whatever it is that you do, or you teach, or whatever your business is, I think one of the most powerful exercises you\u00a0 can do is try to teach it to somebody else, even if you\u2019re not a \u201cHow to Make Money\u201d or \u201cHow to Start a business\u201d business.</p> <p>If you want to grow your business, one core thing that you can do is sit down and work with other people showing them how to fix their business, or change their business, and start getting your thinking at a different level. You start realizing why what you\u2019re doing is working, why your funnels look this way, why they\u2019re converting, and which part\u2019s not.</p> <p>I think one of the biggest strategic advantages I\u2019ve had over a lot of the other Internet marketing coaches is just first off, I\u2019ve run a lot of businesses. I do a bunch of stuff. The second off is because our coaching business has been so successful for so many years, I\u2019ve had a chance to work with hundreds and hundreds of different businesses every single year, so I have had a chance to look at different funnels and their processes and coach them through it. Again, I think I get a unique perspective on it because of that, and so I want to tell you guys that same kind of thing. If you\u2019re in business and you want to grow, then focus on helping somebody else\u2019s business, because it will help you so much more to start seeing those things. But then also from your content standpoint, whatever it is you\u2019re selling, how can you teach people more? Even if you\u2019re in a weight loss space, how can you get you more hands in, and teach you more, and break things down more so that you can become better and better at your craft and your art?</p> <p>That\u2019s the first big take-away, and I think the second one is, just because this was so valuable for me, is try to take all of the core things you teach, and again, if you\u2019re writing a book, it could be fifty pages on a concept and how can you map it, how can you break that down into one piece of paper, sketched out, like in a process for Step One, Two, Three, et cetera. \u2013\u201cHere\u2019s the way you do it.\u201d I was thinking about this as I was going through, like what I do in business is very, very \u2013 there\u2019s an art and a science. The art is the beauty, and you\u2019re tweaking and testing and trying all sorts of things. And then there\u2019s the science, which is like, \u201cHere\u2019s the specifics,\u201d and I think the Internet, at least in my business, is more art than science. I think there\u2019s so much art to it. It\u2019s me taking my art, but I have to translate it into a scientific process so that other people can model it, right? I don\u2019t know if that makes sense to you guys. I\u2019m rambling a little bit, but it\u2019s a really cool process.</p> <p>What you do in your business is art. It\u2019s hard to teach art to other people. I can tell people, \u201cHere\u2019s the conception,\u201d and go into things, and hope that a lot of them do the stuff, but most people don\u2019t, except for the other artists, right? For example, I remember teaching events, and I had a bunch of people there who just wanted to get a process down, and they can\u2019t. I\u2019m telling them all of these different ways they could do it, and they can\u2019t figure it out because of that. People like, for example a Daegen Smith, who was in the room. He\u2019s an artist. I could show him all of this stuff, and he could take that and turn it into his own art. But other people might take that, and it doesn\u2019t help them, so to really help other people, I think, for the masses, because you\u2019ll be able to help other people sharing your art, but if you can to tweak it so that you\u2019re turning your art into a science, again, into a process, now other people can replicate it. That\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be so much better.</p> <p>An example is one of my trainers that I work out with. I was asking him, \u201cWhat should I be eating?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWell it depends. There\u2019re all these elements, these variables, and it all depends on all of this stuff,\u201d which is all true, and I get that. That\u2019s the art of it, though. It\u2019s looking down and being able to look at the person\u2019s situation and their life and this and that, and we paint this picture of what\u2019s going to work for you. That\u2019s awesome, but for the masses, you can\u2019t do that. How do you create a template where you can plug people in? That\u2019s where I think the scalability comes in with your content, your offer, your art, and how you can scale it.</p> <p>I\u2019m in one of those kinds of things where I\u2019ve been sitting at thousands of things, and I\u2019ve been looking at them and mapping them out for the last ten hours, and so maybe I sound kind of weird to some of you guys listening, but I hope you got something out of it. I really hope that you guys take some time and take your art and break it down into a science. Try to make it something that\u2019s a process. As you will see when my book comes out, it\u2019s my best attempt possible to do that, and then second off, go and find somebody else who wants to be like you, coach them through it, because the process of coaching someone through your process and what you\u2019re doing will open up so much stuff for you.</p> <p>I am here, ready to get my hair cut. Ready for my head to be a little bit smaller [laughs], and excited for those of you guys who are coming out to the event next week. We\u2019ll be hanging out, and we\u2019ll be covering some stuff, and you guys will get the first copy of all of these worksheets I\u2019ve been working on. I\u2019ve been creating a huge book in a binder for everybody that has all of the stuff in there, and then the next time that it will be open will be when my book is done. Hopefully, we\u2019ll have that done by the end of summer. I\u2019m going to try to do one of those \u201cNew York Times \u2018Best Seller\u2019\u201d campaigns. That\u2019s one of those things on my list I want to accomplish someday, is to get on that list. That would be kind of fun. Hopefully this book will be the tool. I\u2019ve spent more time and energy on this, I think, than any other project I\u2019ve ever done [laughs], so hopefully this will be the tool to get us there, and change some people\u2019s lives, and help get everyone thinking a little differently about their business. I\u2019m excited, and I\u2019m here, you guys, so I\u2019ve got to bounce. I will talk to you all again soon. Thanks, everyone.</p>", "duration": "15:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/77_-_Transforming_Your_Art_Into_A_Replicatable_Science.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1399053600, "title": "Episode #76 \u2013 Rework Vs. Remote", "author": "", "summary": "<p>An interesting look on how to build a hundred million dollar company.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a very late-night \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>Hey, you guys, it is now 1:30 in the morning. I have almost officially been awake for twenty-four hours straight. I woke up yesterday [laughs] or today or whenever it was, at 4:30 in the morning. I came in early and spend three or four hours busting stuff out before everyone showed up. We worked all day, and we pulled mostly an all-nighter. I just started fading about twenty minutes ago. I just dropped Todd off at the hotel, and now I am driving back home to go get some sleep.</p> <p>But as tired as I am right now, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this fired up about a project ever in my life. We\u2019ve created and we\u2019ve sold a lot of stuff that I\u2019m passionate about \u2013 a lot of things that I think are awesome and life-changing and all of those kinds of things, but this is the first time that...Today, I literally spent twelve to fourteen hours just building out funnels and click funnels, and I can\u2019t tell you \u2013 I can literally do now what used to take me a programmer, a designer, and a webmaster \u2013 what it took three people to do, I can do now myself, and in a fraction of the time. I built an entire automated webinar in under an hour, and that\u2019s because I was writing all of the copy. I was doing everything \u2013 the entire thing, from scratch, and got the whole thing done. We built out membership sites. We built out funnels, and I can\u2019t even tell you how excited I am.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s going to change our industry. I think it\u2019s going to change my personal life. I told everybody, \u201cEven if we never sold this, what we\u2019ve created would still be worth it, because this will change our business forever.\u201d It just gets me excited and fired up about how we\u2019re creating something that is that big. I just started thinking about how in most businesses, I think a lot of the time we sell ourselves short. We think about how to make money or what\u2019s cool. How do we solve this problem for people? We create these little things. I\u2019ve been doing this for a decade now, and this is the first time I feel like we\u2019ve approached something and gone after something that\u2019s bigger than any of us, and the fact that we\u2019ve executed it as well as we have is just...I can\u2019t even tell you how excited I am. It\u2019s so cool.</p> <p>So anyway, what I wanted to talk to you about is tonight while we were working and talking through things, we kept referencing a guy named Jason Fried. He\u2019s a guy who I had a chance to actually interview a little while ago, maybe about two or three years ago now. He owns a company called 37 Signals. You guys have probably heard of him before. Actually they just changed their company name to Base Camp. They\u2019re the creators of Base Camp.</p> <p>A while ago they wrote this book called, \u201cREWORK\u201d. In fact, Stu McClaren, one of my favorite people in the world, was the one that recommended REWORK to me. We were at Pirate\u2019s Cove at my Mastermind meeting, and we were talking about books and stuff, and he said, \u201cHey, you should read this book, \u2018REWORK\u2019,\u201d so I went and bought it. It\u2019s a really quick read. You could probably read the whole thing in maybe an hour and a half to two hours. It\u2019s basically that Jason and the partners, when they were creating Base Camp, wrote a book about their experience with the business, and it was the exact opposite of what everybody else was doing.</p> <p>I remember that I read the entire book, and I remember there were simple, fast chapters \u2013 just one concept at a time, and I remember going through it and thinking that every single mistake that I had made in my business, they addressed in REWORK [laughs] as a thing, and I was like, \u201cMan, I wish we would have done this or that,\u201d and so forth. I\u2019ve probably read it three or four times over the last five or six years, and like I said, I had a chance to interview Jason on the book. He was a cool guy.</p> <p>I remember the same month, I tried to interview him and also Gary Vaynerchuk. Jason was like, \u201cYeah, man, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d and jumped on the phone. Super low maintenance, it was awesome. Didn\u2019t ask for anything, just giving back to the community, and Gary Vaynerchuk [laughs] said that he\u2019d let me interview him if I bought five hundred copies of his book, which was about eight or ten grand or whatever that was. It was like, \u201cHuh,\u201d and anyway, just a really cool guy.</p> <p>But some of the lessons \u2013 one of the things they talked about was when they created Base Camp. They were a website design company, and they were trying to do project management software, and there was no good project management software, so they went and they created their own. They created it the way they wanted it. They scratched through an itch, and created this thing that as it turned out, everybody wanted it, and, \u201cBoom.\u201d This launched their whole company. I think they have over a million users right now. I think that\u2019s what they said. A million users, paying up to ninety-seven bucks a month, which is crazy.</p> <p>We were talking about Click Funnels. We built Click Funnels to scratch our own itch, to try to speed up our process of launching offers and rolling out funnels. We created it for us, and now I have the privilege of sharing it with others. That\u2019s the way I really look at it.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, but anyway, there\u2019re so many good lessons in that book, I can\u2019t recommend it enough, you guys. I think the fact that we\u2019d read it \u2013 everyone on our team had read it multiple times. I think it\u2019s really influenced a lot of our thoughts and our decisions in how we\u2019re growing our company. We were looking at, as we started growing Click Funnels, the company\u2019s called Etison, E-T-I-S-O-N, we were talking about how to grow it, and we saw that there were two different routes.</p> <p>One route we saw was with a company called, \u201ciContact\u201d, where the owner, Ryan, went and took on funding and did the whole VC thing and brought in money and had millions and millions of dollars of investor money. He grew it that way and they weren\u2019t really profitable until he sold out. And man, he sold out. I think they sold for about seventy or eighty million dollars. I\u2019ve never built a company that way. I don\u2019t understand that way, but that\u2019s the way he did it, and so for a while, we were looking at it, and we were like, \u201cWow. Let\u2019s build a company like that.\u201d</p> <p>But then you look at the other side, and you look at 37 Signals. You look at the way Jason has built it, and all of the lessons they teach in REWORK about only hiring when it\u2019s painful, keeping it small, and that your goal isn\u2019t to try to grow. Your goal can be just to serve people and all of these lessons that are counter to what the rest of the world teaches, and I think we made a decision as a team that we wanted to do it this way \u2013 the way that the guys in 37 Signals did. That\u2019s the way that fits into our lifestyle and what we want to do. Like I say, I can\u2019t recommend that book enough.</p> <p>They also came out with another book recently, called \u201cREMOTE\u201d, and what\u2019s interesting about REMOTE is, if you guys watch \u201cTED Talks\u201d \u2013 I think it\u2019s at Ted.com \u2013 you search for Jason Fried. He gave a TED Talk about this as well, what the book\u2019s all about. He talked about [laughs] \u2013 and this week\u2019s been a perfect example of it. He talked about how when you need to get work done, where do you go? Nobody says, \u201cI go to the office to get work done.\u201d They say, \u201cWell, I come in earlier. I stay late,\u201d or, \u201cI do it during my lunch hour.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting how people at work don\u2019t get work done [laughs], right? They\u2019re talking. They\u2019re doing all of this kind of stuff, and he talked about the fact that if you send all of your employees home and have people work remotely, how much more stuff you can get done, because at work, people don\u2019t work. They\u2019re talking. They\u2019re hanging out. All of this other stuff\u2019s happening. I remember in the TED Talk, he\u2019s talking about, \u201cWould you rather have an employee...?\u201d like everyone\u2019s employees are at the office so that they can be focused, but what if your employee was at home watching TV all day while they were working? If they were watching TV, yes, they\u2019d be distracted a little bit, but that\u2019s a lot less distracting than the boss coming in, or the secretary, or the water cooler talk, or every single person passing through their desk area that wants to communicate and chat. It was interesting when he put it into that perspective, and the book, REMOTE, is all about that \u2013 having everybody start working remotely.</p> <p>As we\u2019re building this new company and thinking a lot about these types of things, and the direction we want to move with things, and how to structure things, and how to grow, I really think that the guys that we\u2019re looking at and I think that the guys that you should be looking at, as well, is 37 Signals, or Base Camp is their new company name. So definitely get REWORK, get REMOTE. It could be your reading for this weekend. Those books are worth their weight in gold, I can tell you that much for sure.</p> <p>Anyway, you guys, I am home. It\u2019s now 1:47 in the morning. I\u2019m going to get some sleep. I\u2019m taking my three-year-old son to the zoo tomorrow morning, which is super exciting. I\u2019m fired up. That\u2019s the game plan.</p> <p>Look out you guys. Click Funnel\u2019s coming soon. We\u2019re going to open our second wave of beta next week, and we\u2019re going to roll that for about a month, because we\u2019re going on vacation [laughs]. My family and Todd\u2019s family, and so when we get back from vacation is when we\u2019re going to do the big roll out, but it\u2019s all coming soon. All of the pieces are falling together.</p> <p>All right, guys, I am in my garage, so I\u2019m going to check out, and I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "09:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/76_-_Rework_Vs._Remote.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1398794400, "title": "Episode #75 \u2013 The Secret Pre-Frame", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The new pre-frame that almost always doubles conversions on any type of Facebook traffic campaigns.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a beautiful, sunny \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d.</p> <p>All right, everyone. I hope you\u2019re having an awesome day. My first question for everyone out there is, \u201cDo you guys think we should do new theme song for our podcast?\u201d [laughs] I keep getting comments about it. It\u2019s funny, because I bought the domain, MarketingInYourCar, almost ten years ago. When podcasts first came out, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019d be a cool idea for a podcast, so I\u2019m going to buy that.\u201d Then one of my buddies, Paul Colgin, had a friend who used to write jingles, and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou should have him write a jingle for your podcast.\u201d So he wrote that almost ten years ago, and then it was almost ten years later that I finally worked on a podcast [laughs]. We put it in there, and it\u2019s been kind of funny.</p> <p>Today, I have something fun to tell you guys about, because I think this is something that could be a game changer for most of you guys. I don\u2019t want you to dismiss it, because I almost dismissed it. I actually did dismiss it once. The second time, it was like someone hit me in the head with a bell, and I thought, \u201cAh, I see what I\u2019m missing.\u201d</p> <p>In my high-end $21,000 Mastermind group that Daegan Smith and I run, one of the guys in our group is a guy named Glen Ledwell. He owns MindMovies.com. At our first Mastermind meeting, he was talking about in their business how they never get traffic from Facebook to convert \u2013 that for whatever reason, it just wouldn\u2019t work, and so they were trying all of these different things. He said that finally they decided just to add a quiz in front of their landing page. They have their landing page, and all they did was add this little quiz, and the quiz is not even a real quiz. It doesn\u2019t do anything. It asks five or six questions about something, and then it lands on a page that has their sales video. Actually for them, it was landing on a webinar registration page, and then they just recently did one with an \u201cInvisible Funnel\u201d webinar page as well \u2013 [coughs] excuse me \u2013 so that was the concept, right?</p> <p>He showed us the numbers. At the first Mastermind, he said, \u201cHey, we did this, and it doubled our conversions,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, nice.\u201d I didn\u2019t think much about it. Then at the last one, he showed us, and he actually showed us some very specific numbers. It took these campaigns that were at break-even or losing on Facebook and instantly doubled them. Let\u2019s say he was getting a 1.3 percent conversion rate. He ended up getting 2.6 or higher conversion rate, not by changing anything, just by adding a quiz in the front of it. I thought, \u201cMan, isn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d</p> <p>So right now, I\u2019ve been working on this new campaign, and I thought, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to add a quiz in front of this campaign and just see what happens.\u201d That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. Hopefully in the next day or two, I\u2019m rolling out this new funnel thing that we\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ll notice in the front of it, it\u2019s got a quiz. The quiz asks six different questions, but it doesn\u2019t really do much, other than just ask questions, and then it lands them on a page to sign up for something that costs a little more money. I\u2019m really excited to see the test of that versus just going directly to the page, and seeing what happens. I\u2019m really interested.</p> <p>For you guys, especially if you\u2019re driving traffic from Facebook, I recommend trying that \u2013 try and put a little quiz. Again, the quiz is very simple. You\u2019ll see mine. Mine\u2019s basically, \u201cTake this quick two-minute quiz, and find out how to double your traffic, conversions, and sales.\u201d The first question is, \u201cWhere did you hear about us from?\u201d and they pick an option. The next step is, \u201cHow much traffic are you currently getting on your site?\u201d The next step is, \u201cHow many split tests do you run?\u201d The next step is, \u201cWhat are your...\u201d Just some basic questions just to get them engaged. It\u2019s an engagement device, where they start taking these little micro-commitments and clicking on something. They\u2019re taking this quiz, and for whatever reason \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to me \u2013 for whatever reason, it gets somebody in a state where more people now will take action, just because they\u2019re clicking on these buttons, and you\u2019re asking them questions.</p> <p>The other interesting thing, now that I think about it is, I went to this Mastermind group earlier this year. It\u2019s called the \u201cOcean\u2019s Four Mastermind Group\u201d, with a bunch of guys, and one of the guys, Ryan LeVeck, was talking about how he quizzes in all of the markets that he\u2019s in, as well, and how great of a big thing it is. I think it might be the new big thing, you guys, so if you\u2019re running campaigns on Facebook, try a little mini quiz ahead, before you land somebody on your sales video page, and just see what happens. I think you\u2019ll be amazed with the results. I know I\u2019m excited to find out, and I will return and report and let you guys know what we find out in the next week or so, after we run our first real quiz.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019m going to go implement this stuff, and I will talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "05:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/75_-_The_Secret_Pre-Frame.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1398708000, "title": "Episode #74 \u2013 Results From The Jujitsu Tournament", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Short message from Russell on his drive home from the tournament. And how, what he learned this weekend, relates to your business.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. I welcome you to the Marketing in Your Car podcast. As you can tell right now, my voice is almost gone. Hopefully I will make it for the next four or five minutes to share with you my weekend.</p> <p>Basically, I am guessing there are a lot of people listening for the very first time. I just finished my Jiu Jitsu tournament and everyone is asking me. I thought, \u201cInstead of telling them the answer, I am going to make them all go to the podcast and listen to hear what happened.\u201d That is the game plan here; I am going to tell you what is happening.</p> <p>If you are a first-time listener, welcome. You are going to love it. Every day I do a five or six-minute podcast as I am driving to the office. I share a couple of cool marketing tips. I want to welcome you as you start listening. Please listen to some of the backup episodes. Usually we talk a lot more about marketing, conversions, and sales and fun stuff.</p> <p>I want to welcome you. I had a very fun tournament. The last time I competed in Jiu Jitsu was a year and a half ago. I do not consider myself a Jiu Jitsu guy; I am still a wrestler who is trying to learn Jiu Jitsu.</p> <p>It was a lot of fun. I learned a lot of cool stuff. I won a couple of matches and lost a couple of matches. It is fun to get back out there and try to kill yourself.</p> <p>I have a couple of lessons I learned this weekend that are valuable from a marketing standpoint, as well. First, I am still kind of learning all the rules. In my first match I went out there against this dude with a long beard.</p> <p>Just to put this in perspective, I still cannot grow a beard. This dude had a six-inch long beard. We started rolling and I almost took him out at the beginning. I did not quite get it and he put me in his guard, so we had no points. It was zero to zero. Then, literally, he locked his guard so tight that I could not get out of it, so the match ended zero to zero.</p> <p>I assumed, as a wrestler, that we would go into overtime and I would have a chance to take him down again. I did not think he was that good. However, the match ended and he got the win and I was super confused. I found out the rules afterwards and that he basically won.</p> <p>The first lesson I learned was that when you go into any situation, you have to understand the rules. I wish I had understood because I would have done a lot of things differently. I would have scrambled better and tried to open him up more. I thought we were tied, so I thought, \u201cYou know what? I am just going to hang out here until we can break and go into overtime.\u201d Apparently, they do not do that in Jiu Jitsu.</p> <p>I think that many times in business people just do not know the rules either. You get into something and you are scared to do stuff. You think, \u201cShould I do this or that?\u201d You do not realize where your boundaries are. Marketing is one of those things where you have to understand your boundaries because you have to push them. You have to be a bit aggressive in order to get people\u2019s attention. It is interesting. You are competing against so many other people. It is kind of funny. In my first eight or nine years in business I never looked at it as a competition.</p> <p>In January, I had a chance to go to an event and hear Kevin O\u2019Leary from \u201cShark Tank\u201d speak, and it was interesting. He was talking. He\u2019s the bald guy on Shark Tank who\u2019s just always angry and that kind of stuff, but he was talking [coughs] \u2013 excuse me \u2013 and he was talking about how business is like a war. He was like, \u201cYou have to go out there and find out who your competitors are. Your job is really to go out there and figure out how you can beat them.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve never looked at business that way. I thought it was always just like, \u201cOh, everyone\u2019s happy. Let\u2019s all get along,\u201d and we\u2019ve done well with that, but if you want to dominate your space and become the number one person, you\u2019ve got to look at it more like a war, or like a wrestling match, or jiu jitsu, or whatever, where you\u2019ve got to beat them. You\u2019ve got to figure out the strategic things behind it, and part of it is understanding the rules \u2013 what you can and can\u2019t do, and then after you know that, go and push it. Push the envelope hard to beat them.</p> <p>Then the next is, because this is give and take, it\u2019s just like a wrestling match or a jiu jitsu match. You\u2019re going back and forth. I think more of us need to get more aggressive in our businesses a little bit and realize that we\u2019re competing with other people. Find out who your competition is now, and how you dominate, how you beat those guys. Just something to think about.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot over the last little while, especially as we\u2019re getting close to launching Click Funnels. We\u2019re going head to head against some big companies. One of our biggest competitors just got $5 million in VC funding, so they\u2019re starting out with a bunch of cash and people and a team and an existing customer base, and we\u2019re coming head to head against them. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to know what hit them. We\u2019re going to attack and it\u2019s going to be fun. We\u2019re going to try to take their customer base very, very quickly. It\u2019s war. It\u2019s going to be fun.</p> <p>Then some of the other software products we\u2019re going to be competing with are big companies \u2013 companies like Infusionsoft. It\u2019s a war that I\u2019m ready for, and a war that I\u2019m going to win, and I\u2019m excited for it. Think about that with your business. Think about how you can be more aggressive, who you\u2019re competing against, and how you can beat them.</p> <p>Now a lot of times, there\u2019re rooms for partnerships and friends and that kind of thing. At the same time, you\u2019ve got to look at this as a sport. Business really is a sport.</p> <p>Back to the jiu jitsu tournament. I lost that first match, and I won my next two matches. One guy, I came in for a headlock, and I choked him out on his feet. He literally went completely out, like passed out. He started attacking. I attacked once, and he was gone, and so I feel kind of bad. He just sat on the mat for four or five minutes afterwards trying to come to. That was kind of fun, and then the guy that I lost my first match to, he lost, so I had a chance to go against him again, and this time we wrestled. I wrestled a lot better, and then he caught me in this weird funky arm bar thing that I had to tap, which is no fun, by the way. Tapping\u2019s the worst thing in the world. And then I went to some other divisions. I went to this \u201cabsolute\u201d thing, and I had to wrestle some big huge dudes who were way bigger than me, but anyway, I had a fun time. I\u2019m glad to be back. My voice is shot. I\u2019m almost home. I\u2019m going to go take a bath and then pass out for three or four days and then get back to work, so it should be fun.</p> <p>Anyway, for all of you guys out there who are thinking about living your dreams. You\u2019re nervous. You\u2019re scared. Hopefully, you\u2019ll get some inspiration that me as a 34-year-old dude that hasn\u2019t really competed in ten or twelve years, just went up against a bunch of young guys who trained a lot more than me and just went head to head. I hope that gives you some inspiration to really just \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid of things. Just go out there and do it. What\u2019s the worst thing that could happen? You get tapped out. You lose some money. Whatever the worst case scenario is, it\u2019s really not that bad. It\u2019s more about the journey and the fun and having some joy in it.</p> <p>That\u2019s it for today, everyone. I am home. I\u2019m going to go pass out. Thanks for listening, and if this is your first time, please tune in. We\u2019ll share a lot more cool marketing and sales stuff, and I think you\u2019ll really enjoy it. Thanks, everybody, and we\u2019ll talk to you next week.</p>", "duration": "07:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/74_-_Results_From_The_Jujitsu_Tournament.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1398448800, "title": "Episode #73 \u2013 Lead Or Gold", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The only strategy you need to get stuff done today.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell and welcome to another episode of Marketing in Your Car! Yesterday I pretty much just talked about Jiu Jitsu and kind of spun it with some business at the end.</p> <p>Today may be kind of similar. No, there are some good lessons. Tomorrow I am fighting in a Jiu Jitsu tournament. I am in three different divisions, so I probably have ten to 15 matches tomorrow as long as I don\u2019t get tapped out. It is going to be a lot of work and a lot of fun.</p> <p>One thing, though, is that I weigh-in tonight. Tonight I have to weigh seven pounds lighter than I weigh right now. A lot of you are asking, \u201cHow do you lose seven pounds in a day, Russell?\u201d The reality is that I am going to lose seven pounds in less than an hour.</p> <p>We do it the old school way like we used to do it in wrestling. In fact, I went to my garage and I found a huge thing we had which had all of my old weight-cutting clothes. I had my plastics; I had my sweat suits; I had everything. For me, it was really exciting and nostalgic. It brought back so many memories. There were even my old t-shirts I used to cut weight were in there, my sweatpants, and everything.</p> <p>I had some fun today and put them on. The pants with my plastics are pretty tight now. I am not quite the size I used to be, unfortunately. It was very, very fun.</p> <p>Today I am going to work for a couple of hours and then head over to the gym, put on my plastics, and wrestle hard for an hour. In an hour\u2014especially for the fact that I am not fat but I have some stuff on me\u2014I should be able to lose the seven pounds in less than an hour. In fact, my record from cutting weight was 12 pounds in an hour. That was the most I ever did. My record for most total weight loss in a week was 30 pounds.</p> <p>It is not natural weight loss. Do not ask me to teach you the secret to losing 30 pounds in a week. It is all dehydration. You put these plastic suits on and they suck the water out of you. You literally do not drink for three or four days. It makes me laugh when people say, \u201cYou can live without food for a week, but you cannot live without water for more than a day.\u201d That is B.S. I have lived without water for multiple days while sucking water out of my body. It is definitely possible.</p> <p>It is interesting that when you start cutting weight you stop eating and you stop drinking. Then you start trying to suck the water out of your body. As soon as you start getting dehydrated, your hunger pains disappear. It is kind of cool. You are not hungry, but you are thirsty the whole time. As soon as you weigh in you drink something and boom! Your hunger pains come back. It is interesting. Thirst is definitely worse than food.</p> <p>Why am I telling you this? First, I am excited and I am going to cut weight today which is kind of a fun thing. The second thing is that I was thinking today about how we are in the middle of a huge project which we are about to launch. You have probably all heard of it, ClickFunnels. I am trying to get all of these things out.</p> <p>Last night at 10:00 at night I was not done with our stuff. I came back into the office and worked for another three hours to get stuff done. One of my buddies, Xan Spencer (some of you know him) is one of the students who went through one of our courses a while ago. They actually won a Corvette from us and built a huge business.</p> <p>He moved to Boise, he and his wife, a while ago and they are launching a new business. I showed up at the office last night at 10:00 and he was in there stuffing envelopes for these bracelets he is selling now. I thought, \u201cIsn\u2019t this awesome? We have entrepreneurs here late at night busting their butts to make their dreams come true.\u201d</p> <p>I was thinking about next week when Todd, our programmer for ClickFunnels, is flying in and we will probably pull five or six all-nighters in a row to get this thing done so we can roll it out and launch it the next week.</p> <p>I want to talk to you about the fact that you have to set deadlines, otherwise nothing ever gets done. If I did not have weigh-ins tonight at 6:00, I would never lose these seven pounds. Because I do, an hour before I am going to suck it out, I will make weight, and I will weigh-in. If I did not have a deadline for launching ClickFunnels, it would never get done. Because there is a deadline, we are going to pull all-nighters until it is done.</p> <p>I find it interesting that it does not matter if my deadline is a week from now or six months from now. Any way I do it, the week before I will be pulling all-nighters every single night to get it done. It is just the way it always works.</p> <p>There is a tape I bought a long time ago from John Carlton and Gary Halbert. They were talking about the concept of silver or lead, \u201cplata o plomo\u201d or something like that. The concept was that when the Mexican drug lords down in Mexico want to change a law, do they try to run it through congress? Congress would be, \u201cNo!\u201d We\u2019re not giving you that law. Are you crazy?\u201d</p> <p>What they do is break into their homes that night, find the people who are the decision-makers, and they come to them with a gun and a bag of silver. They say, \u201cYou have two options. You need to change this law. You can do it through \u201cplata or plomo,\u201d through silver or lead. Either we will shoot you and you will die or we will bribe you, give you money, and you will change the law.\u201d</p> <p>When you have those two options, \u201cplata o plomo,\u201d lead or silver, what are you going to choose? You are always going to choose the money, right? It is a no-brainer, so that is what they do.</p> <p>When I first heard that story, I started thinking of it for myself. I have to set \u201csilver or lead\u201d deadlines or else nothing will ever happen. Maybe it is just me, but if I do not have those deadlines, they will not happen. When I pick any project, I say, \u201cThis is the project and this is the deadline. This is when it has to be done.\u201d</p> <p>It is not like, \u201cOh, here is a soft deadline. Hopefully, eventually it will get done.\u201d When you do that, it will keep moving forever. The second you set a hard date and say, \u201cThis is the day it will happen, somehow, magically, it will happen. It does not matter if it is a week from now, a month from now, six months or a year from now. Those last two or three days you will be pulling all-nighters to get it done. It is just the way it is. I do not care how much you plan. The week before or a couple nights before, you are going to have to kill yourself to get it done.</p> <p>Most people just keep pushing it and pushing it. Because of this, they never get to their goal; they never actually hit it. It gets pushed into infinity.</p> <p>For you guys, I recommend that for all your core projects you set a \u201csilver or lead\u201d deadline. It does not have to be on the project as a whole. Sometimes it is so massive it is hard to do it. Set a goal for each element, though. You can say, \u201cThis is step number one in this process I am doing or creating. Step number one is this and my silver or lead deadline is June 16<sup>th</sup> and it will happen on that day. It is not allowed to happen on June 17<sup>th</sup>. If I cannot sleep for three days, I will not sleep for three days because it is silver or lead; either I am going to get cash from this or I am going to die.\u201d</p> <p>If you can trick your mind to really believe this, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish. People always ask me, \u201cRussell, how do you get so much stuff done?\u201d A lot of it is because of my \u201csilver or lead\u201d deadlines. This is it. In my head I know this is the date and we cannot miss it. Sure, we could miss it, push it, and bump it another week or two. However, when you do that, it just keeps getting bumped and keeps getting bumped.</p> <p>In my business, in my career, there have been the times I have been soft on my deadlines. We had a site we launched a little while ago and we literally kept pushing it for six months from our initial deadline. We said, \u201cOh, we will do it,\u201d and we kept pushing it and pushing it. Six months later we finally sat down and said, \u201cBoom! This is the \u2018silver or lead\u2019 deadline. It has to happen!\u201d Guess what? It happened.</p> <p>I hoped this helps you guys understand how to get stuff done. It is how I am going to make weight tonight. I am going to lose seven pounds in an hour. It is how we are going to get 10,000 people on ClickFunnels. It is how we are going to increase our coaching. All these things we are doing have \u201csilver or lead\u201d deadlines attached. If you do not have them yet, it is time to start creating them for yourself.</p> <p>This is what I have for today. I am at the bank and I am going to pull some money out because my wife has been remodeling our house and this is what husbands do, right? That is my plan for right now. I appreciate you guys and I will let you know how the tournament goes after it is all said and done. Talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "09:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/73_-_Lead_Or_Gold.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1398362400, "title": "Episode #72 \u2013 Thoughts On Russell\u2019s Jujitsu Match", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Structuring your business so you can do what you really love.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. Welcome to another exciting episode of Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>Hey, guys. Today it is kind of raining and I am heading to the office. I am actually excited because this weekend I have a Jiu Jitsu tournament. I am fired up! I have not competed in about 18 months or even more than that.</p> <p>Here is my Jiu Jitsu journey. As most of you know, I was a wrestler through high school. I was a high school state champ and I took second place in the country. I was an All American in high school. I wrestled with BYU for a year and they cut the wrestling team, so I went to Boise State for the last four years. My senior year I ended up being ranked 14<sup>th</sup> when it all ended, I think. I did not quite meet my goals, but I did have a lot of fun. Still, my favorite thing in the world is wrestling, by far.</p> <p>In my senior year, for all the UFC guys out there, I wrestled Johny Hendricks my senior year and I lost to him by one point. That little punk, I was actually turning him in a power half, I had the leg right and I was turning him, and he started screaming like a little girl. The ref stopped the mat and did not give me any points. If the ref stops something when you are in a turning position, you should get at least two, if not three, points. I did not get the points and he ended up winning by one point.</p> <p>For all you guys who are Johny Hendricks fans, he cried when I tried to turn him. There you go.</p> <p>Back to this, I got done wrestling, I got into business, and I got fat. I had a lot of fun and a few years later I decided I wanted to start wrestling again. We built an entire wrestling team out here. I did a podcast about it in the past, so I am not going to talk through the whole story. It went for a little while and then we had business issues and everything went crazy, so we had to shut it down.</p> <p>I did not doing anything for a couple of years. Then one day I was flying home from Vegas and one of my buddies who wrestled at Boise State was on the flight. We sat next to each other and we were talking. He said, \u201cYeah, I am doing Jiu Jitsu now,\u201d and he was really good.</p> <p>I said, \u201cWow,\u201d and he said, \u201cJiu Jitsu is kind of like wrestling for old, fat people. You do not have to be in good shape to be really good.\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! I might actually be good at that. My only thing is I could not take a punch. If I got punched, I would be pretty embarrassed. I would start crying or something.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cNo, there is no punching in Jiu Jitsu. It is like wrestling, except you can tap somebody or choke them out or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cAll right. That would be kind of fun. I might try that.\u201d I got home and I was talking to one of my buddies who did Jiu Jitsu and he said, \u201cThere is a tournament this weekend. You should go to it.\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cAll right. I have nothing else to do, so I might as well show up.\u201d I literally went to one practice the night before the tournament and I had somebody show me the basics of Jiu Jitsu. I did not know much other than that and I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d</p> <p>I went to the tournament the next day and my very first match I did gi. I had to borrow some guy\u2019s gi because I did not know what that was at the time. I put this gi on and I went out there. I was going against the first guy and I was beating him like a little girl and I thought, \u201cThis is the easiest sport in the world!\u201d I was picking him up and slamming him down.</p> <p>I found out if you put your knee on their belly you get four points. I thought, \u201cSweet!\u201d and I just kept doing knee on belly over and over. I beat this guy 16 to nothing and just thrashed him. All of a sudden he reached up and grabbed my collar on my gi and he did some weird, funky thing. Everything started getting dark.</p> <p>I thought, \u201cOh, no! What do I do?\u201d He was choking me out. My eyes started getting hazy and he started getting darker and darker. I thought, \u201cI don\u2019t want to tap out. This is embarrassing! I was killing this guy. I don\u2019t want to tap out!\u201d Eventually I was almost gone and I tapped.</p> <p>It was the worst feeling in the world. Getting pinned in wrestling is bad, but at least you can tell a story in your mind about how it did not really happen. When you tap, you have to tap and it is pretty embarrassing.</p> <p>After that in the next three or four matches in gi I won. I had to take second or third in the tournament. They had no gi afterwards which, by the way, I found out I loved much more. I did no gi and in the very first match I was beating a guy and then I got caught in a triangle lock. I had never seen this before and I had to tap out. In the next match it was the same thing. I got caught in a triangle lock and got tapped out.</p> <p>I thought, \u201cMan, this is frustrating.\u201d I was beating the guys on our feet every single time, but on the mat they triangle locked me. I remember walking out that day and a guy grabbed me. He was an old wrestler and he said, \u201cHey, just so you know, triangle is like kryptonite for wrestlers. All you wrestlers, when you take some guy and you cover\u2014which is the setup for a triangle\u2014if you just learn some basic Jiu Jitsu, you will be able to stop that from every happening.\u201d</p> <p>I thought, \u201cAll right, man. I am going to learn this thing.\u201d I went back to the drawing board and started practicing. I had some buddies that were doing it; it was not formal practicing. We did it once or twice a week for the next six months or so. It was just the basics of learning not to get triangle. That was the core concept.</p> <p>I participated in another tournament and I won both styles which is cool. Six months later there was another tournament and I won in both styles there. It was pretty fun, but then life happened and I kind of forgot about it for a while. I missed the next tournament, but I thought, \u201cI want to keep doing it.\u201d</p> <p>About eight months ago or so, I decided that I wanted to get good at Jiu Jitsu. I did not have anything else going on. I was just doing business and family and everything. There was a lot happening, but I thought I could carve out a couple of hours a week just to do this and it would be fun. It is close to wrestling and it would be fun to do.</p> <p>I hired a guy named Jason Flynn. He is a stud; he is a black belt dude. He had classes, but I thought, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do classes. I just want to do private one-on-ones with you twice a week.\u201d I started paying him for that and for the last eight months I have been twice a week one-on-ones with this dude who is one of the toughest people I have ever met.</p> <p>It has been very, very good. I finally learned the art of Jiu Jitsu which is fun. The tournament this weekend will be the first time I have competed in Jiu Jitsu where I actually know how to do Jiu Jitsu, so it will be fun. I am excited. I have to practice today and I have to cut weight tomorrow because I am a little heavy. I have to lose five pounds tomorrow. In about 45 minutes to an hour I should be able to lose that and have weigh-ins.</p> <p>The party starts on Saturday. That is what is happening. I know it has nothing to do with marketing, but it has a lot to do with what I am passionate about. For all of you out there who have a passion, for me, if I could go back, if I could give away my business and start wresting as a freshman in college, I would do it in a heartbeat, no questions asked. I would walk away in a heartbeat.</p> <p>I think all of you have something like that; a passion, something you love or you miss that you did in your prior life, right? I would try to look at your business as something that can facilitate that. All of us get into business for a purpose. You got in because you wanted freedom or time or whatever it is. After a while you get so addicted to the game that all the other stuff falls away and I think that is a shame.</p> <p>For me, it was almost seven or eight years where I completely forgot about the stuff I loved. Make it a priority that your business is created in a way to fuel your real passions. Your business can be a passion, but do not let it be the core driver. Otherwise, I think you will get burned out and you will not love it long term.</p> <p>There is my advice for today. For all of you guys out there, go get a workout in; go do some Jiu Jitsu; go do whatever it is you love to do and then get back to work and let\u2019s make some money.</p> <p>Thanks, everybody. We\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "08:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/72_-_Thoughts_On_Russells_Jujitsu_Match.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1398103200, "title": "Episode #71 \u2013 A Message From Russell At 4:13 AM", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Why Russell deleted his entire webinar and spent the last 4 hours rebuilding it from scratch.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Russell. It is 4:13 A.M. and I am just driving home from the office. I want to welcome you to a late-night, special edition of Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>You guys probably think I am crazy, but it is definitely 4:13 A.M. and I have a Webinar eight hours from now which I am very excited about. We have been pruning it all week long. Hopefully most of you\u00a0 will be on there because it is going to be awesome.</p> <p>This week has been so crammed with everything. I am working with a writer to write my book; we are trying to launch ClickFunnels, and a lot of other stuff. Every day I kept trying to find time to prepare the Webinar and I just have not had the time. It has been kind of crazy.</p> <p>As you know from my last podcast, I want to do Jiu Jitsu and lift weights and everything else. Eventually it comes down to crunch time and you just kind of do it.</p> <p>I worked on it today for a while and got my slides finished up. They are not finished, but I had four or five slides done when I left the office. I really needed to come back to the office to get some stuff done, so I came back to the office. It has been a long time since I have written a brand new Webinar from scratch. There was a time when I was writing a Webinar almost every month and I was very good at it.</p> <p>When Automated Webinars came out, we did a DotComSecrets local one. That one just blew up. I think we did a million dollars the first 90 days with it. That one went on to do about $3 million. For almost a year I did not write another Webinar and then I wrote the DotComSecrets X Webinar. This one has been crushing it now for almost two years now. Maybe it is more than two years.</p> <p>Anyway, I have gotten lazy. I have not had to do a Webinar for a long time and I have kind of forgotten how to do them. I am trying to get back into the flow of it and do stuff. I am going through a lot of notes and I remembered a guy who is really crushing it on Webinars. I almost paid him $50,000 to write a Webinar for me, for my Supplement Secrets offer. It kind of fell through last minute. I still may do it, but we did not end up doing it for this product.</p> <p>Wow, there is somebody else out here driving at 4:00 in the morning. How strange is that? I am on some random, small road, and we came to a T and we both came at the very same time. That\u2019s interesting.</p> <p>I almost paid this dude $50,000 to do Webinars. His name is Jason Fladlien and he is crushing it with Webinars right now. It kind of fell through at the last minute and I was wondering if he had anything to teach in his Webinar system. I would be very curious to look at it to get some ideas.</p> <p>I went to his Web site and there was a $1,000 product and a $50 product about how he does his Webinars. I thought, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have time to go through a $1,000 course in the next hour.\u201d It was probably about 10:00 at night when I got into the office and started doing this research.</p> <p>I bought the $50 course. It was an ebook, so I printed it out and started looking through it. Actually, before I printed it out I scrolled through the PDF to see if it was going to be of value. I started scrolling through very quickly and I thought, \u201cOh, man! This is really, really good stuff.\u201d There were different ways to present a Webinar which I have not done before.</p> <p>One core concept, I am not sure if I did a Webinar or a podcast on this. I may have just talked about it at our mastermind group. It was talking about finding the one core thing and focusing on one belief, not trying to get people to believe a lot of things.</p> <p>I was looking at the existing presentation I was creating. I was trying to get people to believe three or four things and Jason\u2019s template works very much on the one belief thing. I took all my slides, all my notes, everything I had worked on for four or five hours today at the office, plus everything I had done up to that point and I deleted it all. I read through an 80-page ebook in an hour-and-a-half or so and remapped the entire thing.</p> <p>I then spent from midnight until 4:00 A.M. building out the slides for my presentation. They are not quite finished yet. I would say they are probably about 80% finished, but I am excited.</p> <p>Anyway, I just got home. I am going to take a nap. My wife is going to lift weights in two hours and then the kids should get up in three hours. Three hours from now my kids will be awake jumping on me. I have to get them breakfast and then I will hopefully have enough energy to come back, and finish the slides.</p> <p>Also, we do not have the order page up or anything. I have to get the order sales page to flow\u00a0 and the product is not completely finished either. It is close. I have to do all that stuff before noon Mountain Time which is less than eight hours from now.</p> <p>Wish me luck! I am excited to see what happens. I will report back and let you know if I either bomb or if it is a huge success. I think it should be good, though. I think the pitch is pretty powerful. It is something I would pay for in a heartbeat. It should be good.</p> <p>That is the game plan. I am going to get some sleep. I appreciate you guys listening. Hopefully you get a kick out of the fact that I am still up. I will talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "06:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/71_-_A_Message_From_Russell_At_413_AM.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1397757600, "title": "Episode #70 \u2013 Random Ramblings From Russell On His Way To Jujitsu", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Four life lessons that Russell learned this week, that you can implement to, hopefully, make your life a little bit better.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everybody. This is Russell Brunson and I am doing a special Marketing in Your Car from inside the Mommy Mobile. Yes, I am inside my wife\u2019s car and I am ready to do a great podcast.</p> <p>I have no idea what direction we are going to go today on this podcast. Usually I have a theme I want to think about, but I have a lot of cool stuff happening and I am excited, so I am going to just start rambling. Hopefully something cool will come out of it and you will get some value out of it.</p> <p>First, right now I am on day seven of my modified juice fast and I feel amazing. I want to talk about this because I think I just stumbled on something new. I am not sure if it is totally healthy and I may very well die in the near future from it, but I think it is awesome.</p> <p>This is what I am doing. When I walk up in the morning I do my Bullet-proof hot chocolate which is the Mormon version of Bullet-proof coffee. It consists of chocolate, organic grass-fed Kerrygold butter, MCT oil, cocoa powder, and some Stevia. I blend it up and that is my breakfast in the morning. When I do this, I am not hungry and I feel pretty good the rest of the day. It is pretty awesome.</p> <p>The second step is that I have been juicing and I was making a gallon of juice per day. This was fun, but all my juices kind of taste nasty because I just juice everything I can find in one huge gallon jug. I carry it around all day and keep drinking it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mind it, but it is kind of gross, so I went to a place called Tree City here in Boise. They have this juice cleanse. Every day I go in the morning and they have six juices for me to drink throughout the day, so I have been drinking those. At night, just because everyone else is eating and I feel guilty (I don\u2019t feel guilty, actually; I just get hungry) I usually eat some eggs. I don\u2019t eat carbs, but just eggs.</p> <p>I have done this now for almost a week and I feel awesome. I am not as tired; I have energy; I am not craving food. Well, I am not going to lie. When I do crave something in the middle of the day, I have been eating Quest Nutrition Bars. From a nutritional standpoint, they are the best protein bar you can get in the world. From a taste standpoint, it is like eating candy. I could live on Quest bars alone. You can go to their Web site, <a href=\"http://www.questnutrition.com\">QuestNutrition.com</a>, and look for the cookies and cream one. Man! It is like eating Oreo cookies, but a thousand times better. They are all super high protein and very low carbs.</p> <p>This is what I have been doing.</p> <p>Second, I am actually driving right now to Jiu Jitsu. This week has been so slammed and so crazy. Typically, when I am this busy I cancel my Jiu Jitsu. Today my wife said, \u201cYou really should just cancel it.\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cYou know what? No! This is the thing I look forward to.\u201d This is the reward at the end of the tunnel for me. It is going to beat up dudes. I don\u2019t know why, but it is so appealing to me. This is what I want to do.</p> <p>So many times we cut out the part of our life that brings us a lot of happiness because of work and other things. I was thinking about this in the case of many of us. Everyone has the things they like to do, right? Many times life gets in the way of those things. We need to make it more of a priority and say, \u201cLook, this is what I do.\u201d</p> <p>For me right now it is Jiu Jitsu. Twice a week I want to do it, I am going to do it, and everything else has to fall to the side because I am going to do it; that is, outside of my family. With work, many times it fills the space you give it. If you have eight hours a day, it will fill eight hours. If you have 20 hours a day, it will fill 20 hours. Anyway, make sure you tie in those things you really want to do.</p> <p>The reason we became entrepreneurs is that we wanted to do a bunch of stuff. We wanted more time, more money, more freedom, or more whatever. However, we then shackle ourselves down with our businesses to the point where because of our business we cannot do the stuff we want to do. It is kind of interesting.</p> <p>There is another life lesson for today.</p> <p>What else? Oh, the next thing is ClickFunnels. We are almost done with our initial beta. I cannot tell you how excited I am. I literally built an entire membership site last night in 20 minutes from start to finish to everything. It used to take a ton of time.</p> <p>There is one limitation: You can only do a membership site the way we have it. If you want a fancy membership sites with a lot of other stuff, you have to use WishList Member (that\u2019s a plug for Stu, my man!). However, if you want a basic membership site, man! In 20 minutes, start to finish, I had a membership site that I could start selling.</p> <p>We were going through sales funnels that fast, automated Webinars; I am going through and creating all of these right now. Even if I never sold a single license to ClickFunnels, it will change my business forever. Now we can sell it and share it with everybody else in the world which is very, very exciting. It is going to be awesome.</p> <p>We also just hired a full-time accountant which is a crazy thing. She has been coming in. This is the first time in my business where I have had someone do tons of in depth, not analytics, but almost like an autopsy. It is like doing an autopsy of our books, digging deep and trying to figure out everything. Where is the money coming from? Where is it going? Which of our offers are profitable? Which are not profitable?</p> <p>Right now everything we do kind of gets lumped together, so at the end of the month we are thinking, \u201cYeah! We are profitable!\u201d I have been learning one thing from my favorite show The Profit. Today, by the way, is the season finale. It is interesting because he goes into companies and tries to find where the profit is on each of the things they are selling. He gets rid of all the low-profit stuff and tries to sell more of the high-profit stuff.</p> <p>Last night\u2019s episode they were in a pie company. This pie company had an 80% margin on their key lime pie and they had a 10% profit margin on everything else. However, everything else took up 90% of the store. He got rid of all of it and transformed the store to 100% key lime pie and nothing else. Boom! All of a sudden it became profitable.</p> <p>It was interesting like that. One of my big takeaways is looking at all of my funnels. We have a lot of them. Our support has to be in all of them and there are things happening and costs associated with each of them.\u00a0\u00a0 Which ones are actually making us money and which ones are not? We are trying to identify this, to drill down, and to figure out which products are profitable and which ones are not?</p> <p>We are also looking at advertising sources. We used to group everything like, \u201cHere are solo ads; here is Facebook; here is whatever.\u201d We are digging deeper to figure out everything about our business. We have always been pretty good at numbers, but now we are getting very, very good, stripping out everything that is not profitable and focusing on the good stuff.</p> <p>It is sad. We are shutting down Web sites, funnels, and pages that I love, but they are not making money or they are costing too much in time, energy, support, and headaches. It does not make a lot of sense.</p> <p>Anyway, I am at Jiu Jitsu now. I am going to go in here. The dude I am going to roll with is way tougher than I am. I am going to try to beat him up today. That is my goal. My goal, actually, is to not get tapped out today from him. He is a stud, but it should be pretty fun.</p> <p>Hopefully out of this you got something. If not, then just wait until next week and I will have some more good stuff. I appreciate you guys. Look for <a href=\"http://www.clickfunnels.com\">ClickFunnels.com</a>. It is coming out soon. We are not far from the public release. Like I said, this will change our industry forever. It will change my business forever and I am sure it will change yours, as well.</p> <p>That\u2019s it for today. Thanks, and we will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "09:25", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/70_-_Random_Ramblings_From_Russell_On_His_Way_To_Jujitsu.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1397498400, "title": "Episode #69 \u2013 The Butterjuice Cleanse", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell\u2019s new concoction to give him more energy, flush out his toxins, and loose a ton of weight in a very, very short period of time.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everyone. I want to welcome you to another exciting, awesome, fun adventure in the Marketing in Your Car Podcast.</p> <p>A lot of people actually who messaged me this weekend asking me about my cleanse, so I want to give you some updates on how it went. If you Google the \u201clemonade cayenne pepper cleanse,\u201d you will see what I started doing.</p> <p>I did that the very first day. I did the salt water flush. I just started drinking it the first day and it was pretty nasty. After drinking about half a gallon of it, one of my friends who was doing it with me started looking at what we made. There is lemon water, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup.</p> <p>He called me and said, \u201cDo you realize there are 55 grams of sugar in a fourth cup of maples syrup?\u201d We put a cup in and he said, \u201cThere are over 200 grams of sugar in here!\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d and I stopped drinking it. I said, \u201cDude, that\u2019s not good.\u201d I got rid of it, but I was already mentally into this cleanse mode. I thought, \u201cI have to figure out a way to keep doing this,\u201d so I kind of made up my own cleanse.</p> <p>The reason they probably did the cleanse that way is to give you some carbs to keep your energy throughout the day. I think I have talked about this before on some of our podcasts. I have been studying the benefits of fat and using fats instead of carbs for energy and so on.</p> <p>I thought, \u201cWhat if I blend some stuff? What if I do the Bullet-proof hot chocolate thing for my energy?\u201d I did it in the morning and the afternoon. It is organic, grass-fed Kerrygold butter and MCT oil mixed with some cocoa powder and some Stevia to make it taste good. I drink that and the rest of the day, instead of having this horrible sugar juice, I got a real juice.</p> <p>I went to the grocery store and bought a ton of stuff: carrots, apples, cucumbers, celery, fennel, and anything that looked like it could be shoved into a blender or into a juicer. I brought it home and produced a gallon of juice and I drank that throughout the day instead. I have done this the last two days, so it has been three days now that I have been on this makeshift cleanse.</p> <p>The amazing thing is that by doing the Bullet-proof and the juice cleanse and mixing those two together, I did not feel hungry the entire day. Right now it is the third day and I am supposed to be done, but this morning I woke up and I had no desire to pig-out like I normally would have done in this kind of situation. I just had some more Bullet-proof hot chocolate this morning, I juiced some more stuff, and I am just going to keep going with it.</p> <p>Also, I checked my weight before. I was 206 pounds before and I was 200.4, so I lost almost six pounds in the last three days. I think I am just going to keep riding it. I am going to get down about ten more pounds, so I will keep riding this for another week or so and see how it works.</p> <p>As I said, I am blending together the Bullet-proof hot chocolate thing with the juicing cleanse. So far I feel amazing. Who knows? This may be the new diet fad or the new cleanse, at least. I was thinking of names to call it like Butter Juice or something like that.</p> <p>Anyway, I woke up this morning and did it again and I feel awesome. I am almost to the office right now. I have a consult today. Somebody paid $2,500 for a one-hour consult, so I get to dive into their business for the next 60 minutes, rip it apart, have some fun, and show them how to take it to the next level.</p> <p>These guys seem really cool, so I am hoping they will upgrade and join our mastermind. If they want me to really affect their business it is the best way. I can then work with them throughout the entire year. That is the game plan.</p> <p>If any of you want a $2,500 consult like these guys, it gives us an hour. It may sound like a lot of money, but I promise you I will make you ten times, at least, in that hour. Just let our office know. If not, just keep listening in and hopefully you will get some more good ideas.</p> <p>I am at the office and my call starts in ten minutes. I am going to jump in there and give these guys a call and get into some fun, business-building activity. It should be fun.</p> <p>For all of you who are interested, let me know if you want to know more about the Butter Juice diet. Maybe I will write up a little plan and call it The Butter Juice Cleanse and show you what I am doing. It is awesome and I feel great. I have a lot of energy and I am excited to drink my juice today. You can hear it in my gallon.</p> <p>Thanks, everybody. I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "05:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/69_-_The_Butterjuice_Cleanse.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1397239200, "title": "Episode #68 \u2013 Converting Buyers Into Clients", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell shares his hypothesis for the best way to convert his buyers into actual coaching clients. Listen in to see if this will work for your business as well.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to an amazing day and another fun episode of Marking in Your Car.</p> <p>I just got back from a two-day mastermind event in Washington, D.C. It was amazing. We had such a good time.</p> <p>One of the guys in the mastermind group is one of my favorite people. He is super high energy and awesome and he is a mastermind junky. I think he is in seven or eight groups. After two days, he pulled me aside and said that it was the best mastermind meeting he had ever been to which meant a lot.</p> <p>We started early; we went late; and we did some awesome stuff for everybody. It was very cool. I had a lot of big breakthroughs, as well.</p> <p>The mastermind group is one we initially sold at an event called The Invisible Funnel. Some of you may know this concept and some of you may not. It is a cool way to sell things without selling. A lot of the attendees are doing Invisible Funnels, so we spent a lot of time talking about them, dissecting them, and figuring out ways to make it better.</p> <p>On my flight home yesterday, I was working on a book I am putting together called The Black Box. One of the steps in the Black Box is the Invisible Funnel, so I was writing out that whole process again. All of a sudden, I think a light bulb came on for me. A light bulb definitely did click. I have yet to see if it is a good light bulb or a bad one, but I think it is very good.</p> <p>Here is the concept behind it. We are selling a ton of our printed products. This is back in our coaching business, so I want to preface that. Our goal, obviously, is to convert people from a front end customer into a coaching client. That is the entire goal, right?</p> <p>We were trying to figure out how to convert those leads from people into someone who has applied and is kind of raising their hand for coaching. We have been getting a lot of coaching application leads, but not in the volume we want. I do not want to say they are not the quality of people we want, but half of the people applying really are not ready for it. They are not at a point in their life where they can afford it; they are just not ready for it.</p> <p>I want more of the qualified people, right? When I was writing the section of the book yesterday about the Invisible Funnel, I was thinking about how it came about. There is a story behind it.</p> <p>I was working with Tony Robbins and Chet Holmes on their company called Business Breakthroughs, International. Chet mapped out their business model for me. It was really cool. They would drive radio ads into a call center which they had built. The person would answer the phone and say, \u201cWelcome to Chet Holmes, International,\u201d and they would give the caller the report for which they had called in.</p> <p>Then they would say, \u201cHey, by the way, Tony and Chet are doing this event. It usually costs a thousand bucks to come to Vegas plus your hotel and your flight. Now they have a version where you can do it from home. It is really, really awesome and you need to be part of it.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of this, we are going to let you get on this Webinar. It is a $300 Webinar, but we want to make sure it is something you believe in, so we are not going to charge you anything for it right now. You can come for free. All you have to do is put your credit card in and we will bill you after the Webinar if you love it. If you do not love it, then do not worry about it.\u201d</p> <p>That was their pitch and their hook. I thought it was really, really cool. When you look at their model, it just crushed it with that. People would come in, register for the Webinar. They would get on the Webinar and stay on there for three hours. If they loved it, they would pay the $297. If they did not love it, they would not be billed for anything. This is how they ran this business. This is how they built this company.</p> <p>I do not know how much volume they are doing, but it grew into a very, very big company. This is where the Invisible Funnel concept came from initially. I could never figure out how to turn it into an online process, but Daegan Smith figured it out. He started creating Webinars where you would register by putting your credit card in and they would bill you $97 after the Webinar was over. He made a ton of money with it. We modeled it and we made a ton of money with it. It worked.</p> <p>This is a quick explanation of the Invisible Funnel. I could go on. We literally did an event earlier this year. It was a three-day event talking about the Invisible Funnel, so there is a lot more to it. This is the core, quick concept, though. It is a premium Webinar. Someone puts their credit card in ahead of time, but you do not bill them until after the Webinar is over if they loved it. At the end you can offer them your high ticket products, services, or things like that.</p> <p>I have been thinking about this as a tool to convert our buyers from buyers into applications. I was thinking that most of the products we sell now are tied to either traffic conversions or sales. I thought, \u201cWhat if every single week every Friday I did an actual live Webinar?\u201d This is what scares me, honestly. It is my biggest scary part. It would not be an automated Webinar, but an actual live Webinar. It would be three or four hours long and I would teach my entire process for doubling traffic conversions and sales.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I started doing this?\u201d This was my thought. I am kind of nervous about it, but I am going to do it. I will have people come on and try it for free. It would not cost them anything. They would put in their credit card for no charge and then, after the Webinar, if they loved it they would pay $97. That is the process I am going to go through.</p> <p>I will teach them all of our best stuff for three hours. Then, at the end, I would use it as a tool to get them to apply to be part of our coaching program. This is what I am going to test out and I am very excited about it.</p> <p>We have done Invisible Funnels on the front end before, but I want to use it as a backend tool for all of our traffic sources. If you look at my business model, I envision someone buying DotComSecretsLabs and DotComSecrets X or purchasing anything we have. They come in there and then the immediate sequence is, \u201cHey, Russell is doing a live Webinar! You need to get on it! Come here to register.\u201d This would be the core thing we are focusing on, pushing, and promoting.</p> <p>We would use this as our conversion piece. It would convert people from buyers into clients, I guess. Maybe that is the process. The first step is to get traffic to convert to buyers. This is the conversion. The second step is to convert buyers into clients, into people with whom I am actually working. Invisible Funnel is that conversion piece.</p> <p>This is an interesting way to look at it. I am learning this stuff with you guys as we are going. You always learn stuff when you start a fleshing it out like this.</p> <p>Anyway, I am very interested in trying this. It is my goal. Next week we have another Webinar and the week after I am going to test this process out and see if it works. If it does work, I think it is going to be very, very cool. It will be Operation Converting Buyers into Clients. Should we call them \u201cclients\u201d or \u201cstudents?\u201d It should be \u201cclients.\u201d That is the game plan!</p> <p>I want to issue you the same challenge. If you are listening to this right now, you have buyers that are buying stuff. Hopefully you have mastered Operation Traffic into Buyers, right? This is the first focus for us. The second is Buyers into Clients and we do this through Invisible Funnel. I think it is the perfect mechanism to get people to switch over.</p> <p>Anyway, I am excited! I am fired up to try it out! I will report back to you what happens after we do it. You guys can look out for it. You will see me promoting it here probably a week from now. I am going to test it out quickly to see if it works half as well as I think it will. If it does, it will be an exciting thing for us.</p> <p>That is the game plan for this week for me. It feels weird. It is Friday and this is actually my first day of working. I had a parent-teacher conference for my three-year-old this morning and I am getting my hair cut right now. I will get to the office about noon today to work for three hours and then I am kind of done for the day and done for the week. This is tough for me because I am a workaholic and I love this stuff! Hopefully my wife will not mind if I sneak away and work a little bit this weekend, but you never know.</p> <p>All right, guys, that\u2019s it. I am heading in to get my hair cut, so I will be a little bit lighter, hopefully.</p> <p>Oh, there is one last thing I want to tell you. It has nothing to do with marketing; it just has to do with what is happening today.</p> <p>I am typically a very healthy eater. I am pretty strict and I try to do stuff, but this year has been a travel year so far. We had a lot of stuff happening. We went to D.C. with Daegan and with Daegan, man, we had the best Indian food I have ever had. We had these crab cakes. I ate so much stuff that was not right for me to eat and I felt like garbage.</p> <p>I got back yesterday and I wanted to cleanse myself and start over. I think many times I say, \u201cI\u2019m going to start over on Monday,\u201d and it never actually happens. I really wanted to flush and reset. Some of you have probably seen this lemonade diet before. It is horrible. You make lemonade with cayenne pepper and you do salt water flushes. It is a horrible process.</p> <p>Last night I said, \u201cYou know what? I am just going to do it.\u201d I always talk about doing it and I needed a hard reset now that I am back. I am home for two or three months before I have my next thing. I want to start these next two or three months going on the right path as opposed to just continuing to eat out everywhere.</p> <p>This is my goal, to do a hard reset and boom! Start over. I am doing a three-day cleanse with this cayenne pepper and lemonade and salt water flush just to get all the toxins out of my body. I am basically not eating for three days while just doing this cleanse just to reset my body. From there I will move forward in a healthy manner again.</p> <p>I am not recommending that all of you do a diet, but I am recommending this: When you decide to take a step towards something like in business or relationships or health or whatever it is, most of us say, \u201cI\u2019m going to do that!\u201d and we start doing it. Then we slip back into our old ways.</p> <p>You have to do a hard reset; otherwise it is very difficult to stick with it, to keep going on. I recommend that whatever big thing you are moving towards in your life\u2014a relationship thing, weight loss, business, or whatever\u2014do a hard reset. If it is business and you are starting a new business, do a 30-day no-TV reset. You get no TV for 30 days maybe.</p> <p>One of the resets I am thinking about is one a couple of guys in the mastermind are doing. Daegan just did it, too. They are resetting their productivity. Before, they had Skype, Facebook,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cell phones, text, and all of these things. They said they wanted to reboot.</p> <p>Daegan changed the password on his email. He does not know it; he just gave it to his wife. He changed his Facebook password; he got rid of his cell phone. He got rid of any way for anybody to communicate with him. He just turned it off completely and he is hard resetting right now.</p> <p>He is going to do it for a month or something like that. I don\u2019t know how long he is doing it, but he is cutting off all internal communication to himself to allow him to only focus on doing proactive things. When he wanted to reach out, he will talk to his wife to log into his email and send an email. It will be much harder to do this. This is his process to completely reset.</p> <p>He did that and he has a couple of other people in the mastermind to do it. I am kind of tempted to do it, as well. I am nervous (I\u2019m not going to lie). He will do the reset and then start reintroducing things back into what he is doing.</p> <p>If you say, \u201cI am just going to take Twitter away for a day and then Facebook,\u201d it will never happen. It is like pulling off a BandAid, right? It is too slow. You just have to rip it off, go through the pain, and then slowly reintroduce things which you think are necessary. I promise you that during the reboot you will find out how many of the things you are doing are not necessary.</p> <p>It is kind of interesting, so I wanted to throw it out there for you. Think about the big changes you want to make and figure out how you can do a big reboot just to flush everything out. Then when you are focusing in that thing, you do not have lingering stuff that is keeping you from accomplishing your real goals.</p> <p>That is what I have. I went a bit longer today because I am driving to the hair cut. I am here now, so I am going to end for now. I appreciate you guys. Look for my Webinar over the next couple of weeks. We have two Webinars coming up. Next week we are going to talk about how we do our high-ticket selling. That will be fun. The next week I am going to test this Invisible Funnel to convert buyers into clients. I am excited and I will let you know how it goes.</p> <p>Thanks again, everybody, and we will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "14:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/68_-_Converting_Buyers_Into_Clients.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1396634400, "title": "Episode #67 \u2013 Max Out Your Tax Bracket", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A simple three step strategy to make sure you\u2019re in the highest tax bracket.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell. I want to welcome you to Marketing in your Car. I just got done meeting with the accountants, which if you've been listening for any length of time you know is by far my least favorite thing in the world. I would have rather gone to the dentist and get my teeth drilled but it is what it is.</p> <p>I met with the accountants to do our tax return stuff and sign a million papers, all that fun stuff. I also had the chance to find out that thanks to Obama, my tax bracket is now, I think we pay 47 percent. Isn't that crazy, almost half of our money. We're sitting there first and talking about obviously why it makes us angry.</p> <p>Then there are basically two options. One option is fire everyone and make less money, and just get taxed less or option number two is go and try to make tons more money. You get 50% of it so let's just double, triple, or quadruple what we're making. We thought, \u201cYou know what? Not only am I going, obviously set a goal to make a lot more money. I want people on my team to max out their tax bracket too.\u201d</p> <p>How cool, yeah, you maxed out your tax bracket but let's set a goal for our team. I want three or four people on my team to max out their tax bracket too, to make that much money as well. That's my new goal is to not only max out mine but everybody else's. It basically comes down to you got to make $450,000 to max out your tax bracket is my understanding, is what the accountants told me today.</p> <p>For all of you guys, I think that should be instead of looking at it as a negative thing because it is a negative thing but when you're negative about it, it just takes your focus off, it takes your eye off the prize and makes you angry instead. Let's look at it as a positive thing. For all of you guys, that should be your first goal right now.</p> <p>Everyone has, \u201cI want to make a million dollars,\u201d or whatever but let's make the goal I want to max out my tax brackets. I need my income to be $450,000 so that boom, I maxed out my tax bracket and the government is going to take half my money. As depressing as that is, that can now be a cool, exciting, fun thing to shoot for.</p> <p>After you've done it for yourself, you got any partners, then boom, that's your next one to get your partners to max out their tax bracket. Then let's get our employees. Let's get everyone on our team to max it out because then we're making a lot of money. That's fun. That was my big takeaway from the accountants was just let's shift our focus on what our goals are and figure out how in the world we can max out our tax brackets.</p> <p>There are a couple of ways you can do that. This is the education part of the podcast. I'm assuming that all of you guys here have your own business. If not, you need to start your own business. Let's get that out of the way. After you've got a business and you're focusing on growing it, there are only a couple of ways to grow a business.</p> <p>A lot of you guys know who Jay Abraham is. If not, he's a really cool guy to study. As a person, he's kind of weird but his products are really good. He talks about there's only three ways to grow a business. He says there's one way you can get more customers. That's the way a lot of us focus on. We're always talking about traffic, advertising, customer acquisition because that's the first way to grow a business, to get more customers.</p> <p>It's also the most expensive one. The second way to grow your business is to get your customers to give you more money, to get them to spend more. You can do that by increasing your prices, adding upsells, all these types of things to get them to spend more money. Then the third way is to get them to buy more often.</p> <p>You have more products, more services, more cool things for them. Those are three ways to grow a business. What's interesting is that most people, they focus just on the first one which is more traffic, more traffic. It's interesting because I'm relearning this lesson. It's fun when you know something and relearn it through the school of hard knocks.</p> <p>For example, last month, Neurocell, I don't know if I mentioned to you guys or not but we made more in Neurocell. Actually, I think it was pretty close to 50/50. It wasn't quite 50% but Neurocell was almost 50% of our income last month which is crazy, really exciting and cool. The problem is that we spent I think $85,000 in ads to get those things, our customer acquisition. We were getting new customers.</p> <p>We got tons of customers but that is the most expensive piece of the puzzle as well. We're usually doubling over on our ads but then we still have our product costs, shipping costs, fulfillment, support, call center, all the things that go into fulfillment of it. When all was said and done, we were probably making 20, 25, probably closer to 20 percent which isn't bad but that's what it is on our customer acquisition part of it.</p> <p>So if I want to grow it, there are a couple of ways I can do it. One is I can go acquire more customers but again, that doesn't geometrically grow your business. It just adds more fuel. You're getting more customers at that 20 percent. The next thing is how do we get them to do step two in the phase which is get them to buy more.</p> <p>What can we tweak or change in our upsell flow? What do we need to add? Can we add another upsell, can we increase the price, can we add a sixth bottle option? What else can we do? In the supplement space, it's about more products and bigger ticket. In the info product space, one thing I saw Daegan Smith do that was really cool, he had an upsell where the upsell was first I think $500 for this product. It did well.</p> <p>Then he was like, \u201cHey, what if I sold $500 for the product or $1000 for the license to sell the product?\u201d He did that boom, people started taking the license to sell the product. He doubled the prices and his customer value just shot up dramatically. Then he was like, \u201cWait a minute, what if I instead of doing that, there was a one-year option license or a three-year, or a lifetime option? The lifetime option is two grand.\u201d</p> <p>He added that in there. It's basically the exact same thing he's selling. He just put a license and time limit on it. Suddenly, all these people started taking the $2000 option because they didn't want to renew it after a year, and increased it as well.</p> <p>What things can you add to your existing sales funnel to increase the average transaction value? That's the second thing. The third thing is how do you get people to buy more often? What else can we sell them? That's been, for the last, we're in April right now, the last four or five days here since we got our month end reports, I've been looking at our sales and our profit.</p> <p>Man, for as much gross sales as we did, our profit was horrible on our supplement. I was like, obviously everything we sell after this to these existing customers, we don't have the customer acquisition costs. We don't have all the other pieces that are involved. That's why I'm like how else can we monetize this and get people to buy more often.</p> <p>We started looking at more products in our product line. For me, I don't want right now to go and buy more supplements because inventory costs drive me crazy but obviously the people that have supplements keep buying supplements. We found some friends that have supplement companies and we're partnering, selling some of their products.</p> <p>We won't have as much profit on them but I don't have to spend ads, do shipping, inventory fulfillment, any of that stuff. They take care of all of that for us. All we got to do is tell my customers about their products. That's what we're adding in this month. I was thinking about it. What's cool is let's say we sell 30, 40, 50, 60 thousand dollars of affiliate commission on these products? That's just pure profit to the bottom line. There's no fulfillment cost, no nothing.</p> <p>It will take that 20% profit margin we're running at right now with the supplement, and it will make it now 30, 40, 50 percent. That's how we grow a company.</p> <p>This is some fun stuff. I am sure you have probably heard the Jay Abraham stuff before. I am curious if you are looking at this in your business and thinking about it in this way. Again, I learned about this ten years ago and then again five years ago. Over the last three or four days it has become real to me again. I am looking at how we can grow this company and thinking, \u201cRats! We are focusing everything on number one which is good, but it is the most expensive by far. How do we add more of number two and number three?\u201d</p> <p>For us it is specifically about number three. With number two we are doing pretty well with the supplement.</p> <p>Let me step back and take a look at DotComSecretsLabs. At DotComSecretsLabs customer acquisition is doing awesome and our resell stuff and backend monetization is also doing awesome. However, in the middle our profit per sell is, I think, where we are struggling.</p> <p>In fact, you have heard me over the last two or three months. I have rebuilt the upsell process for DCS Labs probably three, four, or five times. We could not get the average transaction value high enough.</p> <p>Finally, we cracked the code with this last version and we got it now. This is kind of cool because for every free book we give away we are averaging $49 in cash from the upsell flow. This is exciting. Obviously, we still have to print the books and ship them, so there are still other costs involved. It is cool, though, because we can now spend $20 to $30 on a book and when all the costs are added we are getting pretty close to breaking even. This gives us the ability to buy more media, get more affiliates, and to do all the other fun stuff.</p> <p>It is kind of cool to look at each of our businesses, each of our funnels, and think about those three things and focus on all three of them. Like I said, the money is going to come more from number two and number three most of the time, but all our focus is on number one, including me. We focus our time on traffic, traffic, traffic! It is getting more customers, more people and more people as opposed to focusing on the other two.</p> <p>This is some interesting stuff that you guys can use in your businesses to help you max out your tax bracket, then your partners\u2019 tax brackets, and then your team\u2019s tax brackets and everybody\u2019s. I am not sure if I am going to tell all my people that this is my goal for them. They are going to really want that much money. However, I think it is a good goal to set. I am going to talk to them and have them set this goal for themselves, as well. They can start focusing on this and try to figure out ways inside of our company, inside of what we are doing, to increase what they are making. Together we can figure out other ways to add value to reach the point where they can max out their tax brackets, as well.</p> <p>It is a fun goal! I hope it gets you excited. It gets me excited! It is the one exciting thing I got from the accountant today. Everything else is what it is.</p> <p>I am almost to the office, you guys. If you like this podcast, please go to iTunes and let us know.</p> <p>Also, we have started our beta for ClickFunnels. A couple of you guys are in there and it is going crazy. I think there are about 30 people in this beta group. One guy listed off, \u201cThis means I can cancel Visual Web Site Optimizer; I can cancel Lead Pages; I can cancel GoToWebinar.\u201d He listed off all the things he could cancel and it added up to $300 or $400 a month in fees he could cancel by using ClickFunnels. He could get all of this at about a tenth of the price which is pretty exciting.</p> <p>Three or four people said almost word-for-word, \u201cThis fills in and solves all the problems I have ever had with Internet marketing; figuring out how in the world to get a sales funnel up.\u201d This is exciting, too. I am fired up about it and I think it is going to be exciting. We will spend two weeks or so in beta getting everybody in there. We are finding bugs in the templates and little things like that. We are knocking them out as quickly as we can. It is kind of a fun process. I have never gone through this before.</p> <p>This is what we are doing right now. We are cleaning it up and adding more and more templates. After that we are thinking about launch strategies. I do not want to do what a lot of companies do.</p> <p>Some of my friends own a company called Kijabi. When they launched they had a huge, Internet marketing-style launch. I have no idea how many members they got, but I am sure it was 3,000 to 6,000 people in there. People came in, but with that many coming in that quickly, you just cannot keep up with support. They had headaches, issues, and all the stuff that comes with that. A lot of people dropped out quickly, as well, and there were a lot of bad reviews written about them, about how it did not work and so on.</p> <p>Eventually, within a couple of months they had it all figured out and now it is a very, very good product. However, you have only one shot to make a killer first impression and they lost that. The people did not come back and they will not come back.</p> <p>For me, I was thinking that I should have joined Kijabi a long time ago. Why didn\u2019t I? During the product launch I read a review from someone who talked about how bad it was. That was four or five years ago and because of it I never opened an account. I am sure it is now probably the coolest thing in the world, but because of someone\u2019s bad experience, it kept me from even attempting to try it.</p> <p>We do not want to have that with ClickFunnels. We want to do it differently. I am thinking about more of a delayed rollout. It would be kind of like going to the DMV. You take those little stickers with the little number on it which tells you where you are in the line. We would have something like that where everybody takes their \u201csticker.\u201d</p> <p>Each day we would unlock it and say, \u201cToday we are going to let 50 people in, so that is numbers one through 50. Your number is now live. You can come in and get a beta account.\u201d We would let 50 people in and they could spend a day or two in there. We would make sure there were no issue or bugs and then boom! We would open it up and let the next 50 people through.</p> <p>This is how Gmail launched. You had to be invited by somebody. It was a slow rollout and it caused a lot more mystery, buzz, and excitement. I think we will make it where those 50 people come in under an agreement. You have to create a funnel the first day otherwise we kick you out. We want to make sure people are using it.</p> <p>Second, if they like it or hate it (I don\u2019t really care), either way they have to write a review about it on their blog or on their Facebook. We want to cause buzz, get people talking, and make everyone want it, right? I think this is the rollout strategy we are looking for. I want to make people go crazy.</p> <p>Also, we will have the ability from a support standpoint to handle it, to grow it, to scale it, and when we are ready to open the floodgates and allow a million people through, we will have the infrastructure and everything in place. All the bugs will be gone and it will be a rock-solid product from day one.</p> <p>This is kind of what we are looking at. I am excited. It will be fun to see how we end up deciding on the execution. This is what we were talking about yesterday a bit. I think it would be fun. It would be like a big game.</p> <p>In a couple of months I think we could get 4,000 or 5,000 very active, very solid customers this way. With Labs, I think we have sold 4,000 or 5,000 DCS Labs books now. We do not have any affiliates promoting it yet. We have a couple that have picked it up, but we have not asked any affiliates to promote it yet. It has just come from our own traffic and Facebook. I think we can do something similar with ClickFunnels.</p> <p>Anyway, I am at the office. I had a long drive from the accountants\u2019. I hope you did not mind me rambling this whole time. That\u2019s it for today. Have some fun! Go to max out your tax brackets and we will talk to you guys again soon.</p>", "duration": "16:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/67_-_Max_Out_Your_Tax_Bracket.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1396375200, "title": "Episode #66 \u2013 What Percentage Are You Taking Home?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell\u2019s new strategy to take home more money without increasing sales, and what\u2019s the #1 reason why business exists\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to a very rainy Marketing in your Car. It's raining today. I'm heading into the office and I'm really excited for today. This morning, I had my accountability call with Carl White. I talked about it in an earlier podcast about the power of accountability calls, and finding an accountability partner as someone to hold you accountable.</p> <p>So far, it's been going really good. What's fun is it's nice having Carl. He's such a very opposite personality from me. I think that what he brings to the table for me are just things I don't have right now that are really cool. One of the things he was talking about which I appreciate him so much for this. It's going to be my big focus for today is he was talking about in his company before, he would look at how much money he would make and then look at what he was actually taking home, and that percentage.</p> <p>He was like, I don\u2019t remember exactly, 15% or whatever. He was like, \u201cHow do I change that to 40 percent?\u201d That became the goal. That was his focus. It needs to be 40 or 50%, whatever the number is. He started working and working on focusing on that. How do I take home a bigger piece each month?</p> <p>He said that became one his key drivers, not how much money does the company make but how much money does he actually get to take home which is interesting to me because I think my problem is my focus has always been what's our top line revenue. It's a good goal to have. In fact, this month we just broke our record which I was really excited about. We had an awesome month. We did that literally without, I don't think we hardly emailed our list at all. We didn't do a product launch or anything and it was still probably one of the best months we've ever had.</p> <p>I think the only time we've had higher months was back when we had the call center. We had 100 employes but definitely since we've shrunk down to about 13 people now, definitely the biggest month we've had by a long shot. Being with that, what I took home from that wasn't that exciting to me. That was my frustration today on my accountability call.</p> <p>What I decided to do and I'm really excited for this actually, which is funny because the least favorite part for me in our business is accounting, and accountants and stuff like that but we just hired an accountant in house. What I'm going to be doing with her is going through all of our stuff and probably spend two or three days just going through and really trying to understand the numbers because again, they're like my enemy right now. I hate them.</p> <p>Understanding them a lot better and figuring out how do I change our business so that I can take home a bigger percentage, I'm not even sure right now what percentage I'm taking home but change that to whatever it is to how do I take home 30, 40, or 50 percent. In business, that's really the only thing that really matters. That's not true. There are two things that matter. One is that you're providing value to the end customer and number two is that the owner is getting paid, the owner is making money.</p> <p>It was funny, when I was at Boise State, I had this finance class. I also had an economics class. My economics teacher asked a question. He said, \u201cWhat's the purpose of a business?\u201d He was like, \u201cOh, to create jobs, do this, and do that,\u201d all these things. In my finance class, my teacher who I really liked, he said, \u201cThe only purpose of a business is to make the owner money, that's it. If it's not for that, what's the purpose of it?\u201d</p> <p>Obviously hopefully you're selling something that's going to provide value to the end customer but the only purpose of the business is to make money for the owner. I think I'm probably more in the middle of those two schools of thought but it made me think about that. Having a business, creating jobs and stuff like that is good but if you as the owner is not getting what you need out of it, what's the point of it? You just have an average paid job, depending on what you're doing.</p> <p>That's my big focus for this week. There's going to be less of how can I sell more stuff. I think we got that under control. It's going and growing. It's exciting, but more of let's look at the numbers and really figure out what we are actually making, take immediate costs away, this and that, and then what's it going to take for me to increase what I'm taking home. How do we change our commission structures, our profit share structure with our internal team so that everyone is incentivized to pay me more?</p> <p>It's kind of exciting. I'm not sure what's going to come of it. I have no idea. That's part of the fun of the creation of it all. That's my goal is to sit down in front of a whiteboard for four or five hours today and try to map that out and figure out a way to make that work. I'm excited.</p> <p>If I figure out the solution, I\u2019ll report back to you guys and let you know but just start thinking about that in your business. Start thinking about how can you set up things so that the goal of the business is to pay you, and one of your KPI, your key performance indicators should be how much money, what percentage of the money that the company is making, you're able to take home each month.</p> <p>I think if you do that, even if it doesn't increase your money, gross sales, it should increase the money you take home which is really the point of this whole game anyway. There's some advice for today. I\u2019ll let you know how it turns out for me. Other than that, I'm at the office. I got to get out in this cold rain and run to the door. I'm going to jump off now and I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "06:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/66_-_What_Percentage_Are_You_Taking_Home.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1396029600, "title": "Episode #65 \u2013 Look What Attraction Marketing Brought To Me", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Over the last 30 days we completely shifted our target market, our ideal customer, and how we communicate with our audience and the results have been amazing\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to the Marketing in your Car podcast. I hope you guys are having a great day today. I am fired up. It's the last day of spring break so I've been home with the kids. We were juicing, having some fun. Then I'm going to finally head into the office and get some work done.</p> <p>I want to talk about something that makes me mad that I'm excited about this because I always make fun of this. You know everyone that's into the whole law of attraction thing, attract, put out what you want and it will attract things to you? I remember when the Secret first came out. We all watched it, a bunch of my friends and I. There's parts of it, obviously putting out what you want and attracting stuff back or whatever but I've had an experience this last week that's been really interesting.</p> <p>I've been talking about this a lot. Those of you guys who have been listening know what I've been doing but we've been really trying to shift our business away from business opportunity seekers and more towards traditional, not traditional but more towards established business. I've spent the last probably eight or nine years focusing on helping people get started in business which has been fun.</p> <p>It's been fulfilling. You see people who go from nothing to something. It's exciting but it's so much easier to take somebody from good to great than it is from nothing to something. Kind of my big conscious decision over the last year or so has been we want to start working more with traditional business owners. Traditional is not the right word but established businesses, people that are already making money.</p> <p>That's more appealing to me. We can do a lot more cool stuff, all this advanced stuff that we're doing now. We can add those things to a business and see insane results. If they have a funnel that kind of converts, we tweak it a little bit, boom, we can take it from a one percent to a four or five percent conversion rate.</p> <p>Then we can come in and say, \u201cHey, now that you're at this conversion rate, now we can spend some more money on media,\u201d and introduce some media buyers through channels. We can take a company from $30,000 or $40,000 a month to a million dollars a month very quickly just by identifying those pieces, changing them, tweaking them, and scaling the traffic.</p> <p>I've seen in our business with our new Neurocell offer, we went from the last three months, it's tripled every single time. In fact, this month, one third of our income came from Neurocell which is exciting. It fires me up. My goal is to have at least half of our income not coming from coaching and internet marketing this year. We'll be there by next month which is exciting and fun. I'm really enjoying it.</p> <p>Our big goal was to start attracting the right kind of businesses, the businesses we want to work with, and not stop focusing on the beginners but not doing coaching with beginners, saying, \u201cHey, here's products that will help you but until you're at a certain level, we can't work with you.\u201d To do that, we had a couple of strategies.</p> <p>One was to dramatically raise our prices. We used to sell a $5000 coaching package and traditionally to beginners, which is a lot of money for a beginner but that's what it was. What I did is I stopped selling it at $5000. We made our lowest package $8000, and then we made a $15,000 and a $25,000.</p> <p>I told our guys, \u201cAll I want to do is sell $25,000 packages. That's the goal. That's who we want to work with. People who can write a check for $25,000 are the kind of people that can spend money on traffic and do other stuff. We can really scale their business quickly. That's who we want to work with.\u201d</p> <p>I think at first they were really scared to sell higher ticket things but as soon as we got one person at $25,000, boom, the next week, we got three more. All of a sudden, the belief level is coming where if someone can only pay $8000, we don't even talk to them on the phone anymore. We just want to work with people that have legitimate businesses. It's been interesting.</p> <p>I talked about this in one of the earlier podcasts. We changed our bait. We went away from here's how to make money on the internet to here's 180 split test results. Our next front end product coming out is a product for coaches and consultants. We're putting bait out there that attracts the kind of person that's going to come in, that's going to have the kind of money we need.</p> <p>The third thing we did, this still blows my mind. I've been sending out emails that are our inner circle program. Applications have been coming in really good. We have some good people that have come through it but yesterday, I did some Ben Settle style reverse marketing. I wrote an email, a daily Seinfeld email. Some of you may have seen it.</p> <p>Basically, we had this guy who applied. The way he applied and the way he went about it was weird. He had a really good business. We could have done some really cool stuff with him but he was rude to our salesperson and ended up hanging up on her. It ended weird. I wrote an email about that and called him out, and talked about what he did and the kind of people we like to work with and what I would have done in his business had he been humble enough to come through our process the way we have it structured but he didn't.</p> <p>Because of that, this happened and this happened. I shared this email. It was fun. I wrote it in a way that was entertaining, sent it out. What's happened over the last not even 24 hours yet shocked me. It's been really interesting. Using what Ben Settle calls repulsion marketing, talking, kind of calling out people, calling out your customers and setting a line in the ground saying, \u201cThis is what we believe and this is who we're trying to work with.\u201d</p> <p>I put that email out there. I tell you what, we've got over 40 new applications came in from that email. I would say over 20 of them, more than half of them are people whose businesses are doing over $20,000 a month right now which is my perfect dream client. It was really interesting. It's been a fun exercise over the last few months as we've been tweaking this, changing our front end bait, raising our prices so the people we don\u2019t want can't afford what we have, and putting out emails that draw that line in the sand.</p> <p>The results so far have been crazy. We have three new clients. That's $25,000 this week. I think that for this new group, we'll probably get four or five more. It's exciting. For all of you guys out there who are struggling or not sure about your business, or it's not where you want to be, or you don't like your customers or whatever it is, I heard people like Frank Kern forever talked about how he got tired of the beginner so he changed his business.</p> <p>It was funny because his initial business, he had a product called Underachiever Secrets which I had bought the whole company from. I heard this interview with him right after I bought it, \u201cYeah, I just got rid of my biz-op stuff and started focusing on consultants. Now I've got clients that I love.\u201d Dang it, I just bought the clients that he hated.</p> <p>It's interesting. Just think about that. You really can write your own destiny. You can pick whatever business you want to be in. You can shift it very quickly. I look at our business, ten years of business opportunity seekers and within a month, we've completely transitioned away and we're actually making more money easier and I had a chance to hang out with awesome businesses I can do so much more for. It's pretty cool.</p> <p>Anyway, if you're in that situation or around there at all, those are some strategies we're using that work really well. I'm at the office so I'm going to check out these applications coming through and see who I get to work with. We're doing our first big inner circle meeting here in Boise in May. It's going to be awesome.</p> <p>If any of you guys who are listening would like to be part of our inner circle, it's not cheap but I promise you, it's less expensive than going through the trial and error on your own. You can apply at <a href=\"http://www.InnerCircle.DotComSecrets.com/\">InnerCircle.DotComSecrets.com</a>. That's about it. I'm going to go hang out with my team, call some of these people, have some fun with them and see who we can work with. Thanks you guys. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "08:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/65_-_Look_What_Attraction_Marketing_Brought_To_Me.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1395770400, "title": "Episode #64 \u2013 A Tweak On The Daily Seinfeld Emails", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell just had an epiphany that changes the way he will forever communicate with his email list. Listen to this podcast episode to find out what it is and how you can apply it too.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell. Welcome to the Marketing in your Car podcast. I hope you guys are having a great day today. Some good news, I was right. If you listened to my podcast yesterday about the one thing, we did the tests and it is crushing it. I'm excited. I'm glad that my hypothesis is doing good.</p> <p>It more than doubled sales from the two other versions. One was written by me and one was written by a really good copywriter who is not me. I'm excited and fired up. That's good news. If you missed that episode, go back and watch it. Today, I had an idea.</p> <p>If you look at our business, we have a bunch of really cool front end products. My end goal is to get people into my inner circle. My inner circle is where you get to hang out with me, we get to do cool stuff, I get to work on your business, way more fun. I can change your business better than anything.</p> <p>We kind of set it up where anyone buys anything from any of my funnels, they come in and then we have a sequence that tries to push them to apply for inner circle. The applications have been coming in but I wanted to get more. I wanted to make it more consistent. I think today I had an epiphany, I think. Again, I'm going to test it out and I'll get back to you guys and let you know.</p> <p>It's been interesting. I'm looking at Ben Settle. If you guys know Ben, I talked to you guys awhile ago about the Seinfeld emails. Ben is the one I referenced that taught me that concept. He does these daily Seinfeld emails. It's really cool the way he does it. He just keeps pushing and pushing these emails to go out.</p> <p>Everyday, he's promoting one product. He has his email players where every single day, there's an email promoting that one product. I kept thinking in my mind, \u201cMy business is tough because I have so many different products and services. What do I send out? There's not just one thing I do, teach, or talk about.\u201d</p> <p>But when I started thinking about it this morning, but my one thing, my core thing I want for people is to be in my inner circle. I make the most money out of it. I help people the most. I have the biggest impacts on a business or company in there. It's like the best, I think it's the best thing we have.</p> <p>I started thinking, \u201cWhat if my typical auto responder sequence is someone comes in, they get some emails and I'm pushing everyone into this sequence where the daily emails are all pushing back to our inner circle?\u201d Everyday, I just find something really cool to share, talk about it, and then be like, \u201cHey, by the way, if you're on in our inner circle yet, join here.\u201d</p> <p>Then the next day, I share a story about someone in the inner circle, talk about how we helped him, boom, if you're not in our inner circle, go here, and just start emailing every single day, pushing people back to that thing. I'm really excited and intrigued and interested to see how that concept works and goes. That's what I'm going to be testing out.</p> <p>For you guys, I want you to think about that. What's the one core thing you want people to ascend to? What are you trying to push people to? I think I always struggle with this a little bit because Ben's main thing he's pushing people to was a $97 a month newsletter but that's like the only product he really sells. He kept pushing people and pushing people there.</p> <p>Again, because we have 30 different products, what do you do? Do you just push people to a different one everyday? What do you do? I think it's really coming back to how can you affect people the best. For Ben, that's his front end and his back end. That's his only product he sells. I always thought the goal of it was to push people to your front end but I think the goal of daily Seinfeld emails is to push people to your back end.</p> <p>That's an epiphany I just had today. I'm going to be testing it out to see if I'm right. I think I am. That way, I can bring people to any funnel I want but then I'm always pushing them to apply for our inner circle and the right people will weed themselves out, kind of interesting. I'm excited by that. I hope some of you guys, that gets you excited as well to start sending out daily emails.</p> <p>I'm excited because my daily emails are going to be awesome stuff. Some of you guys have seen a couple we've been putting out lately where I'm pushing really cool videos, content, and ideas. I'm going to put out the best stuff possible because I think that's what is going to attract the right people in the inner circle. I'm going to say something, teach something, or show something cool and people will be like, \u201cMan, Russell has taught me a little nugget. Imagine what he would do if he could work on my business directly. I'm going to go apply for his inner circle.\u201d</p> <p>Focusing on that every single day, I think everyday will get a new group of people coming through. I'm fired up. It gets me excited. I hope it gets some of you guys thinking about it as well. I'm at the office right now. For any of you guys who want me to look at your business and play around with it, tweak it and make it better, you should come to my inner circle. Maybe I\u2019ll start pitching that more on these podcasts.</p> <p>Look, these podcasts are fun. Hopefully you guys get good ideas and things from them but if you really want me to affect your company and your business, we have to play at a different level. There are two ways to really get to that level in life. One is to go and to work your way in which is what a lot of us do. You work hard and eventually over a couple of years, you get there or the second way is to buy your way in.</p> <p>I remember I was at an event one time and I met this guy. I can't remember, he had a weird name like Scovia Smith or something like that. He was a young kid. I remember meeting him at this event. He was telling me how he joined every mastermind. First off, I'm like how can you afford that. Second off, why did you do it?</p> <p>He told me, \u201cRussell, there are two ways to be successful in this life. One, you can work your way in and it takes a long time. Number two, you just buy your way in.\u201d That was the first thing he told me. Then he said, \u201cWhat I did, I had an email list of people. I emailed them all. I said, 'Hey, I'm single. I have nothing else going on right now. I can go to all these different events but I can't afford them. If you all want to pony up some money, I\u2019ll go to all these events and come back and teach you what I learn.'\u201d</p> <p>I think he got 10 or 12 people to send him 10 grand. Then he used that money to go sign up for everyone's mastermind groups, and he bought his way in. He got to know everybody, got direct access to his business and worked really quick. There's definitely a lesson inside of that. I've taken that lesson and bought my way into a lot of things. It's a lot faster sometimes than working your way in.</p> <p>If you're interested in the inner circle, it's just <a href=\"http://www.InnerCircle.DotComSecrets.com/\">InnerCircle.DotComSecrets.com</a>. Thanks you guys and gals. I'm at the office. I'm going to go check out some applications and see who I'm going to be working with today. I'm excited. Talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/64_-_A_Tweak_On_The_Daily_Seinfeld_Emails.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1395684000, "title": "Episode #63 \u2013 The One Thing", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to increase your conversions by un-muddying your offers, and a whole bunch more\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell and this is a special late night edition of Marketing in your Car. I hope you guys are doing awesome. I am actually driving home from the airport right now. I had a really fun weekend. Some of you know if you follow me on Facebook, you probably saw we just launched or created a brand new supplement for the MMA called MMA Ignite.</p> <p>I was actually in Dallas, Thursday flew to Dallas to go film us actually making the product because we also, sometime in the future, I'm going to be creating a product called <a href=\"http://www.SupplementSecrets.com/\">SupplementSecrets.com</a>. I just wanted to be able to have that footage of them actually making our first batch of MMA Ignite so I flew down there, brought a camera, and filmed the whole process.</p> <p>It was cool, you see them. We made our own formula. They go and buy all the raw materials. They have boxes and barrels of all these powders and stuff. Then they take them all, mix them in this huge mixer, and take them into the other room and put them in the machine that puts them into the bottles, and then the label machine puts the labels on, and the thing seals the top. It was a really cool process.</p> <p>We filmed the whole thing. I'm sure you guys in the next few months will see that when we come out with that product. It's a fun thing. I was just planning on doing that, then I realized that this weekend was the NCA Wrestling Tournament in Oklahoma and Daegan Smith was going to go. My birthday was two weeks ago, so Daegan was like, \u201cHey, I just bought you a birthday present. You're coming to NCAs.\u201d</p> <p>I flew from Dallas to Oklahoma and had a chance to go watch the NCAs yesterday which was really fun. Daegan came through. He got us front row seats so we were front row, right in the section where the wrestlers run out in the mats. It was pretty sweet. My wife and my kids were watching the tournament from home.</p> <p>Because we got such good seats, I guess they saw me on TV every couple of minutes so it was kind of fun. My little son Bowen texted and he was like, \u201cHey dad, you're on TV. You're famous,\u201d so that was fun. It was just a really fun weekend. It was cool on the flight home, I had some delays.</p> <p>It was probably ten hours I've been in airports. I had a chance to work on this new product we're putting out, another one of our free plus shipping products, just finishing up the front-end book for it. It got me excited and thinking a lot more about marketing and things like that. I want to share with you guys a concept that over the last four or five days, I've been thinking about this.</p> <p>I shared the concept with Daegan. I might have mentioned it on a podcast but I've just been thinking a lot about it. I have another probably 15 minute drive to get back home so I thought I would just dump it on you guys a little bit, and hopefully give you guys some ideas because I think I'm going to talk about this a little bit, the Dot Com Secrets Lab Funnel.</p> <p>I rebuilt it three different times. I think the next, I haven't seen the stats yet but I think the one we built right before I left out of town, I'm hoping that it converts a lot better. I think that the psychology behind what I was trying to do, I explained this whole concept with Daegan. I think that too often, we try to sell things, we're trying to sell stuff.</p> <p>When I first got into this business, people always talked about you create an offer and you create bonuses, and the more bonuses you have the better. Then you get your features and your benefits. You're trying to explain all the amazing stuff about this product. The theory is that if you drop 1000 different bullet points, that one of those little bullet points is going to speak to somebody and they're going to want to buy.</p> <p>Because you're not speaking face-to-face, when you try to sell somebody face-to-face, you have an advantage because you can see what their concerns are and things like that whereas in print and video and stuff, you don't so the theory is you're just giving everything you can think of and throw it out there. One of them hopefully will be the one that closes them.</p> <p>I've been thinking a lot about that. I don't necessarily think I agree with that concept. One of the big things I was just writing about in my book that we're going to be launching, talking about the different free plus shipping offers we've been doing and why they've been working so well, one of the things I've been writing about is the fact that the free plus shipping offers that do the best aren't the ones that are this free course or something big like that.</p> <p>The ones that do the best are the ones that are very singular focused, one concept, one idea, one thing that you're selling. I was thinking about if you look at, talking about concepts you guys probably don't know yet because you haven't read the book, but this funnel that we take people through, this free plus shipping, we put them through an invisible funnel. At the end of it, we sell them your coaching program.</p> <p>Your coaching program is the end-all, be-all, right? It's all the stuff you have, teaching them how to do everything. That's hard to sell because it's so big that it's hard for people to grasp that. Then you take your entire coaching program or whatever and pull one piece of that out, the one most sexy part of that. That becomes what you train on during your invisible funnel training.</p> <p>Then from your invisible funnel training, you pick the sexiest thing and pull that piece out. That becomes the free plus shipping thing, very much one focus. The new upsells that I did for Dot Com Secrets Labs, I kind of did the same thing. One of the upsells is a new traffic upsell. In there, there's a whole bunch of videos and things like that about different ways to get traffic. It's a good product. It's a great product.</p> <p>When I was writing the copy for it, starting the traditional way, talking about you're going to learn this traffic system and this, you dump on all these different systems, I was like, \u201cMan, I don't think people really want that. What people want is the one thing. What's the one thing that the product is going to give me if I buy it? That's what I want. How is it going to solve this one thing?\u201d</p> <p>I took all the, I think it was seven different traffic systems in there, and I just focused on one. I talked about one and made it so mysterious, exciting, intriguing, and cool. I talked about that and was like, \u201cThere's a bunch of other ones too but I don\u2019t have time to talk about this. This one alone is worth more than the price. You're getting that plus seven more.\u201d I just talked about that one thing, that one bullet point.</p> <p>I just went deep into that and made that the bait, the thing to get them to have the desire to come in, instead of throwing out every feature and benefit, a bunch of bonuses. I just picked the one thing that I think is going to be the best bait. That becomes the entire focus of the sales message, the same thing with the second upsell inside Dot Com Secrets Labs.</p> <p>The traffic one is a new upsell that I hadn't done before whereas this one is one that has been in every version of the upsell flow. We're selling the Seven Figure Shortcut, which is our automated webinar and sales training. I thought, \u201cI'm going to do the same thing on this. I'm going to figure out what's the one thing in this entire course.\u201d</p> <p>This course is big. I think it's six or seven days worth of videos. It's two different workshops and a whole bunch of other stuff, probably one of the best products I've ever created. The problem is when I try to sell it, people don't want to buy seven days worth of videos. There's just so much stuff, they get overwhelmed and it seems like a lot of work.</p> <p>Of all the seven days worth of content, what's the best thing? What's the one most intriguing or sexy, the one thing that had the biggest impact on me, the reason why I put that in the course? What was the one thing that had the biggest impact on me? I was thinking back. The one thing that had the biggest impact on me was when this guy named Armand Morin taught me a thing he called the stack.</p> <p>It's the way he did his close when he sold from stage. He taught me this way to close. I did it and I've always struggled to sell from stage or on webinars. I learned it and the very first time I did it, I closed 40% of the audience. Then I took that and added it to every presentation I've ever done. I think I counted 23 or 24 different webinars and presentations I've created that all use that.</p> <p>Every single one that I've used that has been successful. It was this one thing. I talk about that. I say, \u201cLook, I did this whole course that taught everything else I've learned about how to script a webinar and how to sell things. There's some amazing stuff that I don't have time to go through it all, but just this one thing alone, the stack, that one thing has made me millions of dollars. That's something that's inside of this course. I don\u2019t know anywhere else in the world you can get it, but you can get it in this course. For $297, you get the course. You're going to learn about that one thing but you\u2019re also going to get all this other stuff I'm not even going to talk about, a bunch of other things that can help you get traffic. That one thing is by far worth the price of admission.\u201d</p> <p>That's the way I pitched it. I'm not sure how sales have done over the weekend since we launched it. I've been out of communication with all the wrestling stuff and the supplements but it logically makes a lot of sense to me. I think us as product designers and developers, we get so into all of the stuff that we create and the packages that we create that have so many elements as things, whereas I think sometimes the power is just figuring out the one thing they desire the most and really focusing on that.</p> <p>If it's what they want, not what they need but what they want, that's going to be what drives them to buy. I think the other things will muddy the waters too much. I think all the other stuff, the bonuses and all that crap that we normally throw in just muddy the waters. It takes the focus off of the core desire they have. That's my thought process right now.</p> <p>It gets me excited because it changes the way that I present things and I pitch things. I was also thinking a lot about upsell flows, the right way to do them. I used to for years, I would just go and have my front end product. What's the upsell? I would pick a random product, and just do random different products in the sales process.</p> <p>For some reason, it used to work alright back in the day but today, it doesn't. Thinks have to be very congruent. That's the other thing I've been thinking a lot about. What is your front end offer? What are your upsells and things like that? This black box is turning into some of our high end clients. We're having everyone create a free plus shipping offer. The upsell is the invisible funnel that they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>As of a week ago, I would have thought that the best way to do it was have your free plus shipping be teaching this process, and then the invisible funnel is you going deeper into that process. What I've found from our testing with Dot Com Secrets Labs, I did that. We set it up where a free book was the front end product and the first upsell was invisible funnel style training where they got to be on this webinar where we went deeper into testing and all that kind of stuff.</p> <p>The take rate was horrible. It was really bad. I think it's because if your upsell is more of the same thing, it's not what people want. They want the next piece of the process. The new upsell flow, by the way, if you look at the Dot Com Secrets Labs one, if you look at Dot Com Secrets as a whole of my company, we have three missions we try to help people do, help them with traffic, conversions, and sales, those three things.</p> <p>Dot Com Secrets Labs is the conversion product. The upsell is the traffic product. Hey, we just helped you double your conversions. Now I want to help you double your traffic. The second upsell is the third pillar of our company which is sales. Hey, we just helped you double your conversions. If you took the first upsell, we helped you double your traffic. Now we want to help you double your sales.</p> <p>It's taking that path of logical next thing they need. By buying your product, what's the gap that they're missing? Not so much the gap but what's the next thing they're going to need after that. If you can figure those things out, it just makes your upsell flow work a lot better. Thanks for allowing me to brain dump.</p> <p>I've been thinking about it but it always helps me to put it out in words. I'm now at my home. It's late at night. I'm excited to get to my wife and give my kids a kiss. I appreciate you guys and hope you enjoyed this podcast. I hope you're enjoying the stuff we're doing now.

Today is an awesome day. I'm excited to be here with you guys with the Marketing in your Car podcast. Today is exciting because I'm flying to Dallas, first off, because our new supplement MMA Ignite is being produced and I want to film the whole thing so I'm flying to Dallas which is exciting.</p> <p>Then I'm flying to Oklahoma for the NCA Wrestling Tournament to go hang out with Daegan Smith and some other friends. It's exciting. I'm excited but today, I have about four hours at the office. I want to tell you what I'm doing today because this should hopefully give some of you guys encouragement who have been playing this game we call internet marketing and not having the success you want.</p> <p>I have been doing this for a long time, over a decade now. You would think that I would get really good at creating the perfect funnel and perfect offer every time. In theory, you would think that after doing this as many times as I have, I would be pretty good at it. I think I am pretty good at it but even with that said, there's still times it just hasn't worked.</p> <p>One of the funnels we have, we have a really good front end offer that's converting great. We had an upsell path that was doing alright. It wasn't doing great but it was doing okay. We wanted to tweak it and change it. We rebuilt it all last week, took a whole week to rebuild it, make new upsells, new sales videos, everything. I thought it turned out awesome.</p> <p>We rolled it out. Today, this morning, I just got back some stats. From almost 200, 170 front end sales, we only had 10% take the first upsell and one percent take the second upsell which is horribly bad for what I need the numbers to be. In fact, our old upsell is doing way better so I'm trying to figure out what my next step and my next move is.</p> <p>I think what I'm going to do is go back through today and rip the whole thing apart and redo it. It's kind of a pain but that's what it takes to make these things work. I know a lot of you guys, you tested out something. You created a product or offer, and you put up your sales video. You did everything and it didn't work.</p> <p>You're like, \u201cUgh, this thing is a scam. It doesn't actually work,\u201d but it's not. It's hard work. You've got to go in and tweak it, and change it, perfect it until you do get it to work. After you get something that works, it's just crazy. For example, our supplement offer, we ran it for 18 months. It was doing alright but nothing to brag about, 18 months before finally \u2013 and we had redone the sales letter. I think we paid two or three different copywriters to rewrite the sales letters. It just kept not working and not working.</p> <p>Then this last version, we spent a lot, 20 grand. Again, it was like rolling my dice, rolling the dice, \u201cPlease let this thing work,\u201d and luckily it's been working. Now we can scale it. Now that it works, it's literally like a slot machine. You put a dollar in, boom, ten come back out and it's really fun.</p> <p>It took us a year and a half to get that to work on our supplement. This offer, I'm hoping that it doesn't take me a year and a half to get it perfect because we're selling a lot on the front end. I just need the upsells to work. Anyway, just something to think about when you're creating your offers is just you've got to be persistent.</p> <p>If it doesn't work, then you tweak it. If it doesn't work, tweak it. Just keep working and working it. Eventually, if you stick with it and keep studying, keep learning, keep figuring out how to make it work, eventually you'll get the right formula where boom, it's going to start working but you can\u2019t just give up after one.</p> <p>I think too many people, they just give up. I think that's probably the difference between me and a lot of people is I just get angry and stubborn. I fall in love with my products so much, I want them to sell so I just keep pushing it and working it until it gets it. Man, after it works you guys, it's exciting.</p> <p>That's what I encourage you guys to do. Think about that today as you're going through your projects. Look at ones that are working, ones that aren't working and just figure out, \u201cWhat do I got to do? What do I got to change?\u201d Don't be discouraged by that. Be excited. I'm kind of excited. I've been thinking all morning now since I saw the numbers. How can I tweak this offer?</p> <p>For example, one of our offers was for this really cool webinar thing. I just don't think I made it sexy enough. I'm trying to think of what else can I add to it to make it really sexy, and then I remembered a couple of years ago, I did this interview with Gary Halbert. I've never shared it with anybody before. I have the audio file. It's talking about the same topic the front end product is talking about.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cMan, if I make my whole spin around that, the secret phone call with Gary Halbert literally months before he passed away where he passed the torch on this new concept that we were able to take.\u201d Everything that we've done has been based on this one conversation I had with him, this call has been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to me. How would you like to have it? You could only get it one way, boom, by buying this product, picking out one really cool sexy thing and using that as the hook.</p> <p>A lot of times, just changing the hook, changing the bait, that's what you're doing. We're basically out there fishing. I talked about that I think it was yesterday, to attract the right customers, you've got to have the right bait. A lot of times, if they're not buying what you want, you got to change the hook, change the bait, keep working it around until you find the right thing. When you find the right thing, man, it gets to be really fun.</p> <p>That's it. I'm at the office. I got to build a whole new upsell flow in the next four hours which is exciting. It will be a lot of work but I think it will be cool and I think it will pay off. Cross your fingers for me that this time, it will convert the way I need it to and for you guys, go back to the drawing board, do what you need to do. Don't get discouraged because man, when one of these things works, it's definitely worth it.</p> <p>I appreciate you all. Have a great day. I will talk to you guys all again maybe on my trip. Maybe when I'm out and about, I\u2019ll drop some ideas for you guys. That's about it. Thanks. Talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "06:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/62_-_What_If_An_Offer_Doesnt_Work.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1395252000, "title": "Episode #61 \u2013 Changing Your Bait", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Want to change your customers\u2026 Change your bait. A simple way to attract the right customers into your business.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell. I am driving behind my wife to take my kids to the dentist. We're going to do a very special Marketing in your Car. Like I said, we are heading to the dentist right now to take all of our kids to the kid dentist which is usually a lot of fun, but about a 15 to 20 minute drive so I'm going to do a Marketing in your Car.</p> <p>What I want to talk about today, this is probably one of the coolest phenomenons I think that I've had in my business for a long time, my own personal insight. If I look at my business, especially over the last probably four or five years, just because of what we were doing, I was trying to attract more people that are business opportunity seekers.</p> <p>You could tell by the products we've created and services we've created, they're very much geared towards that, how to make your first money online, how to \u2013 it was all starting, starting, starting type stuff. It's interesting because we were able to find a lot of traffic of beginners so we built a big business based on that but the problem that I've had is the beginners are so much more work, more effort, and it's so much harder to get them to where they want to go, even though I think our coaching programs and everything we have is awesome. It's just harder to get people.</p> <p>We always say it's easier to go from good to great than it is to go from nothing to something that's good. I've always wanted to work with people who have more traditional businesses. We've done some work with people like that but not to full scale. I think my biggest concern was always if I create an offer that's build towards business owners, they\u2019re harder to target. It's not as easy as people who want to start a business.</p> <p>It's really easy to find people who want to start a business. Finding people who already have a business and helping them to launch it and grow it, that's traditionally the harder part. Because of that, I think I've had a fear of doing that, being able to grow our business bigger and all those kinds of things. We keep going back to more the beginners.</p> <p>We were trying to create our new Dot Com Secrets Labs product. It was interesting, we first launched it as a print newsletter. It was $97 a month. We marketed it hard. It was hard to get people in. We had a couple hundred people but it never grew bigger. That was shocking to me because I really thought it was our best product we ever created. It was more valuable and more useful.</p> <p>The problem was I was really good at attracting opportunity seekers, but not as good at getting actual business owners. For an opportunity seeker, you talk about split testing and it doesn't really make sense to them. Why would I? I don't even have a website. Why would I split test? I have to get something to work for them to try to make it better, right?</p> <p>It never really took off. We ran it for six or seven months. Finally, I was frustrated because of how much effort and work had to go into it and how much money came out the back end, it just didn't add up. We couldn't keep doing it. Then the girl who was publishing it for us, she just had her second baby and she basically came to me and said, \u201cHey, I want to retire from publishing the newsletter.\u201d</p> <p>We decided to stop. The stuff we produced was the best stuff we had. It's super amazing and it's changed our company almost overnight. I think other people to look at it and model it, it could have huge impact on them. Because of that, I didn't want it to die. She gave us one month notice.</p> <p>I said, \u201cFor the last month, instead of making a whole new issue, let's just take the best of all of our tests and plug them into one book and sell it for $400 or $500. Because it's just for business owners, kind of a high end thing, we just won't sell a bunch of them but we'll have that there and that will be one of our products.\u201d</p> <p>We created the whole thing. When it was finished, it was amazing. Most of you guys hopefully have read the book. If not, go to <a href=\"http://www.DotComSecretsLabs.com/\">DotComSecretsLabs.com</a> and get it. It's literally the best thing. I have a copy on my personal desk. I have one next to my bed. I have one on my office desk. It's a product that we have actually used every single day.</p> <p>I'm always flipping through, looking at pages, copying and testing to get ideas for what I'm going to do. It should literally be the bible for everybody I think that has a website. You should have it on your desk at any given time so you can have it there and go through it. We created the whole thing and it turned out amazing.</p> <p>We were planning on selling it for a couple hundred dollars. That's when I had the idea, \u201cWhat if we just gave this away for free?\u201d Anybody who is on the newsletter who got the tests, of all the people that were on it, if people bought that book and saw it, they would become raving Russell Brunson fans.</p> <p>They would buy everything we had. They were coming to our events. They believed in us. What if we got this in the hands of everybody out there? We're going to lose money up front but if we got it in their hands, they're going to become a raving fan if they get this thing because it's our best stuff, and everyone who has seen it so far has become a raving fan. Let's just make it free and give it to everybody, get it in every single person's hands, which is kind of scary since this is a 140 page book. They're not cheap to print.</p> <p>We said, \u201cLet's just do it.\u201d We created it, went out there. We've launched it and we're averaging about 1000 books a week we're giving away. The even cooler, more amazing part of it is the type of people who are getting the book, they're not the opportunity seeker. The opportunity seeker is not going to be like, \u201cOh cool, a split test,\u201d but anyone who is a real business owner is going to\u00a0 flip out and get excited.</p> <p>What's been interesting is just because I think of how cool it is, we have people emailing us, begging us to promote. We haven't even let affiliates promote it yet and they're begging us, \u201cPlease let us, we want to promote this, we want to promote it.\u201d We're like, \u201cNo, we're still testing the upsell flow. We don't want to just give it away yet.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone is freaking out about it. We've just been mailing our list and buying Facebook ads. That's all we've been doing so far. Like I said, we've given away like 1000 a week which is pretty exciting. This week actually, hopefully today we're going to start turning on the heat and open it up to affiliates and partners.</p> <p>What's cool about it is again, the only type of people who buy this product are people who actually have a website, they actually have a business. They're 1000 times more qualified for any of our mastermind groups and everything else that we want to do. That's what we're finding is the people that are coming to our funnel now that are calling us and want to join our mastermind groups and things, they're like my dream client, the person I wanted to work with forever but I never could get.</p> <p>It's just interesting. What my big ah-ha was whatever that front end thing you put out there, I've heard it be called bait before but I never really thought about it that way but it literally is bait. The bait you put out there really does attract the type of person you want. There are times and places when you want to cast bait so wide that you bring in everybody. A lot of our business opportunity offers are like that where they're mass appeal so we can get a lot of people but there are times when you don't want that, when you know exactly who your dream client is.</p> <p>What my whole thought now is you've got to create an offer that specifically speaks to them. If you do and you put it out there, they will rise to the top. There may not be as big of a mass of those people. In my case, there's not as many people so it's harder for me to break even immediately but the quality of person that comes through, most of these that are coming through, they don't have an issue spending $15,000 or $25,000 on a coaching program whereas the opportunity seekers, we're lucky if we can get $5000 to $8000.</p> <p>The depth of your funnel is a lot deeper. It's just interesting. We started looking at who would be our dream clients. The next category of what we thought was our dream clients really would be consultants and things like that. We created a front end product. It's a new book that teaches our three-step system for consultants.</p> <p>That's going to be our next free plus shipping thing we launch and put it out there. Our whole goal is to attract a bunch of consultants. It's kind of interesting. For you guys, I want you to think about that. Think about what is your front end offer.</p> <p>First, think about who your dream client is. Write that person out, everything about them, and then figure out what's going to be the thing that's going to be the most sexy to them. Then create that thing and give it away for free, free plus shipping so that they pay to be on your list. Boom, you'll start getting your dream client coming in the door. Fish with the right bait, you\u2019re going to get the right type of fish.</p> <p>I'm at the dental office now and I'm going to go hang out with my four kids. Hopefully they don't have any cavities. I appreciate you guys. I will talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "10:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/61_-_Changing_Your_Bait.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1395165600, "title": "Episode #60 \u2013 My New Accountability Partner", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A very simple process, to double or triple how much you achieve every two weeks\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everyone, this is Russell. I want to welcome you to another beautiful day. Welcome to the Marketing in your Car podcast. It's nine o'clock in the morning. I've actually been up for four hours already. The reason why is kind of fun.</p> <p>There's this dude I've been watching for the last two years named Carl White, someone I've been really impressed with but I've never had a chance to get to know him. He doesn't know this yet, but one of the main reasons why, probably one of the top three reasons why I joined Ryan Deiss and Perry Belcher's mastermind group was I wanted to get to know Carl.</p> <p>We had our first meeting a month ago. Carl was there. It was kind of funny. When we began the meeting, everyone had to talk about the one main thing they're trying to get from this. I said, \u201cI'm trying to make more money without increasing any employees, staff, or overhead.\u201d Everyone laughed. Carl came over to me afterwards and said, \u201cWhat you said was dead on. Everyone laughed at you but you're the one who is thinking the right way. How do you make more money without increasing your costs?\u201d</p> <p>We hit it off then and went to lunch. We talked about some stuff and was really impressed with him and what he's doing. At the end of it, we started talking and he brought up, \u201cHey, how would you like to be my accountability partner?\u201d I was like, \u201cHow does that work?\u201d He said, \u201cThis is how it works. You write me a check for $2000. I write you a check for $2000. It's got to be a personal check, not a business check because it needs to hurt. We'll keep that. Every two weeks, we do a meeting for about an hour. We set goals, the next two weeks, I'm going to do this, this, and this. Then we go out there and do it. Two weeks later, we meet back again. If you didn't reach your goals, then I get to cash your check. If I didn't reach my goals, then you get to cash my checks.\u201d</p> <p>We got this thing on the line where we're basically holding each other accountable and it's tied to cash. I was like, \u201cThat sounds like fun, let's do it.\u201d We did our first one two weeks ago. It's kind of cool. We got to know each other a little bit and said, \u201cOkay, two weeks from now, this is what I want to accomplish.\u201d We're\u00a0 very careful not to set goals that were tied to things outside of our control like, \u201cI'm going to make $100,000,\u201d an income goal, a leads goal, or something that no matter how hard we work, it might not be dependent upon us but to do steps goals.</p> <p>For me, it was, \u201cI'm going to have this new funnel completed.\u201d This week, my big one is going to be building out a commission structure for our traffic team and getting them motivated. You pick very specific things that you either do or you don't. I had mine. He has his. That's kind of what happened.</p> <p>Today, we had our little check-up. It was good. It was painful a little bit. I had reached all my goals, and then some of the other ones that I had set last week which had to do a lot more with one thing that Carl is good at but I'm not is saving money and building up your wealth, all those types of things. He's trying to push me.</p> <p>I told him, \u201cOf all my issues, we can drive traffic, make sales and make money but I want to learn how to make it so that when I'm done with this game or this business, I have money in the bank and money for my posterity.\u201d That's what he's been coaching me through a lot is that, getting set up all these different investment vehicles, putting away a certain percentage and all these things.</p> <p>There's one thing I don\u2019t really want to do, I'm not going to lie but he keeps pushing me towards it. Two weeks from now, I have to have it done or else he's going to charge me two grand, which is setting up a separate bank account and putting 25% of my income into that that's untouchable. I can't touch it to buy a house, I can't touch it to do anything. It's just to have, to save and to be able to have for whatever comes up, either retirement, a rainy day, or whatever it might be.</p> <p>It's really good. I have somebody who is stretching me and pushing me to do things that I know I need to do but I never would do on my own, just a cool process. I had my second call this morning at 5:30 in the morning. We went through it and it was awesome. I just want to encourage you guys and gals, and everybody who is listening right now to go out there and to actually find an accountability partner for whatever it is you're doing for your business.</p> <p>I would do it similar to what Carl and I did where you put some cash on the table. Write them a check, have them write you a check for the same amount, and hold up where if someone doesn't fulfill on it, then the other person promises to cash that check and hold you accountable. Each week or the way we're doing it is every other week, twice a month we're meeting, and having our little meeting to report back what we did and set new goals.</p> <p>I can already tell just from this, I was anxiously trying to get projects done yesterday because I knew I was going to meet Carl today. If I didn't do it, it was going to cost me two grand so it got me pushing and running, and doing a lot of stuff that I wouldn't normally have done. I'm a pretty driven guy without that but even with that on top, it's really taking it to the next level for me.</p> <p>I want to encourage you guys to do that. Find an accountability partner, someone who is the same business or different business, it doesn't really matter, but somebody who you can trust and you can share parts of your business with or your life, whatever it might be that you may not feel comfortable with normally. Have them hold you accountable.</p> <p>Make it a set schedule where it happens every two weeks, you're holding them, they're holding you. I'm excited to see what the next three or four months comes from this on my side but I think from you guys, you can do some amazing things as well. That's what I want to encourage you to do.</p> <p>The cool thing about this too is it doesn't always have to be just business goals. Some of Carl's goals today had to do with exercise and fitness, and things like that, just really cool. I encourage you guys to find an accountability partner, put some cash on the table. Make it fun and see how fast you guys can get each other moving forward.</p> <p>That's what I got for today. I'm at the office. I have two weeks now to get my next set of goals done. I'm going to get to work and have some fun. I will talk to you guys again soon. Thanks everyone.</p>", "duration": "07:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/60_-_My_New_Accountability_Partner.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1395079200, "title": "Episode #59 \u2013 The Backdoor Method To Selling", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A unique way to close sales indirectly, and get more people to buy your stuff, without ever actually selling your stuff.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everyone, this is Russell. I want to welcome you to the Marketing in your Car podcast. Hey guys and gals, we are here today in Boise. It is a super windy day. It's going crazy. It's like a tornado is coming through. It's kind of fun. Hopefully I will not get blown off the road while I'm driving to the office.</p> <p>I want to talk to you guys today about something fun that we're doing, that maybe will give you guys some ideas. It's a way we've been trying to position and sell our high end coaching. We've been having some fun with it. We just added in a couple new levels and an opportunity for people to come to Boise a couple of times a year and hang out with me, and have me work with their businesses one-on-one, or I guess eight-on-one, ten-on-one, or whatever, but in a more intimate situation.</p> <p>I'm really excited about that. We're trying to figure out different ways to pitch it and sell it. Selling a mastermind by itself is kind of hard because there's a lot of people that have masterminds. What's the difference between yours and everybody else's? The real difference is the person who is facilitating it. What do they bring to the table? What do they know, and stuff like that?</p> <p>It's kind of hard to sell that. How do you brag about yourself versus other people? So I've been trying to figure out what's a better way to promote that and sell that. I remembered probably five or six years ago, I got sold. I love getting sold. I hate going to seminars and you hear speakers, and nobody is able to close. I'm like, \u201cI'm not that hard to close. You just have to give me a cool enough offer.\u201d</p> <p>It was Armand Morin's, I think it may have been his last or second to last big seminar. I went there and was hoping that somebody would sell me because I hadn't been sold for awhile. I just love that experience. I'm going through every speaker. Every speaker is like eh, eh, nothing really got me to move.</p> <p>Finally Armand got up. Armand is a legend, especially when it comes to stage selling. He was doing this presentation. It was fun watching him go through the whole thing. Sure enough, by the end, he sold me. What was interesting is that he was selling this seminar he was doing called Persuasion X which was his public speaking program.</p> <p>Like I said, he went through the whole presentation on Persuasion X and then he sold it. It was whatever price, like five grand or something, \u201cDang it, that's a lot more than I was expecting,\u201d but I really wanted it and was really happy. Then he came back and said, \u201cOr if you're a member of my AM2, you get it for free.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cSay what?\u201d I knew about AM2. I had heard about it for years but I had never signed up for it though, which was kind of like his inner circle thing that we're rolling out. I always heard about it and thought it was really cool but never had anything to really push me over the edge to have me join his mastermind.</p> <p>I think Armand is brilliant, but what am I going to get from him versus some of these other masterminds I'm in? Persuasion X though, that seminar or workshop that I wanted so badly, that I could have got for five grand or I could join AM2 and get it for free, what am I going to do? Sure enough, he closed me and I went and joined AM2.</p> <p>I think you pay $500 a month for it, and all this stuff but he closed me. I was so excited. This weekend, I was thinking about how to position our inner circle, trying to figure out the right way to do it. Again, every time I've tried to write the copy or try to do a webinar, or anything I was trying to create to sell it, I always come back to me, me, me and I feel so stupid.</p> <p>I hate that. I'm not the kind of person that likes to sit there and brag about themselves and why you should listen to me, why I'm the best person to run the mastermind, and all that kind of stuff. I was like, \u201cYou know, let me just not mention me at all. Instead, let's figure out something really cool. Let's close in our coaching program right now.\u201d</p> <p>We've been going through this it was supposed to be an eight week course. We've turned it into probably it will be a 20 week course, teaching our new Black Box concept which is just killing it for people. What I did instead is I wrote a four page sales letter talking about Black Box, how great it is, and how it literally changed our business and is changing other people's, and just talked about that concept, how amazing it is.</p> <p>I talked about right now, everyone in our inner circle is actually going through the coaching program for free with it. That's the only way to get it. Otherwise, if you're not part of my inner circle, you can't have it, and really sold this Black Box training but then said you can't get it unless you're in the inner circle. If you want to be in our inner circle, go apply here.</p> <p>When it was all said and done, when I looked at it, it was so cool and so refreshing. There were no income claims, no bragging, none of that other stuff that was selling. We just talked about this one really cool concept that I think is revolutionary, that I think is changing the way business works and if you want to know how it works, the only way to do it is being part of our inner circle. If you are that, then go apply over here.</p> <p>I finished the sales letter. It turned out really cool. It's four pages long. If you bought DCS Labs or anything else from us, you'll probably get a copy of it here in the mail in a little bit but we're going to start promoting it and sending it out with everything we do. I think that positioning is really strong. It's just different. It's a cool way to do it where you don't seem like a jerk and you don't seem like you're bragging about yourself.</p> <p>You just have one thing that's really powerful that people want. For you guys, think about that with whatever it is you're selling. A lot of times, we go directly and try to sell the product, sell the product or sell the mastermind, the coaching, whatever your thing is but sometimes it's more powerful to figure out what the bonus could be and sell that, and the only way to get that is by joining our program.</p> <p>I have a chiropractor that's one of my close friends. He's doing something like that right now. I'm really impressed with him, how he came up with the idea. He's been trying to sell people coming to get adjusted forever and he's been struggling with it. He went and created this presentation that teaches people this 30 minute morning routine you go through every morning.</p> <p>It has exercise, yoga, stretching, and all this stuff. Then what he does at the end of that presentation is he gives you a foam roller, a bottle of MCT oil and this meditation CD but only if you come to his clinic and get adjusted. He's just trained you for 30 minutes on why you need these three things. You can go out and buy it on your own, or if you're part of his program, you can get it for free, really powerful positioning.</p> <p>He just finished that whole offer and he's going to start presenting it to different businesses. That was cool. Think about in your business how you can do something like that. I think I'll find out really soon how well ours works but I think it will do really well. I think it's a cool way to sell something without having to actually sell it and get a lot of really cool, excited people in.</p> <p>That was my thoughts for today. I'm at the office and I'm excited. I have a fun week coming up ahead of me so it should be a lot of fun. I appreciate you guys all listening and we will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/59_-_The_Backdoor_Method_To_Selling.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1394046000, "title": "Episode #58 \u2013 My New Online Sales Revolution", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell just discovered a simpler way to sell to your already warm audience. Listen to learn how a simple iPhone video can change your business forever.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning, everyone out there in Marketing in your Car world. I want to welcome you to today and welcome you to the podcast. I just stumbled upon an interesting realization today. This goes back to this whole evolution of selling stuff for me. I look at when I first got started online, I did sales letters. Then we moved to me in front of a camera doing Russell talking trying to sell stuff.</p> <p>Then we did PowerPoint videos, then doing some sales letters again. Today and yesterday, we've really built out our Dot Com Secrets Labs Funnel. Instead of doing sleek PowerPoint style videos, I've just done iPhone videos, literally got my iPhone out. I bought one of these iPhone lav mics on Amazon for $60 and they're awesome.</p> <p>The one thing bad about iPhone videos is usually the sound so we got this little thing and it works. All of the sales videos that were in the sales process, I've replaced them now. I tweaked the offers a little bit too but we replaced them with me just in front of a camera and conversions are crushing it. It's interesting.</p> <p>I think I came into an ah-ha and I may be wrong. I'm going to test it out a bunch. I think that with cold, cold traffic, I think still having the PowerPoint style videos is probably the best because it gives you the most controlled environment to make sure you deliver the message correctly. It takes away people's ability to judge you and things like that because the one biggest problems with videos of you in front of the camera is people make instant judgments.</p> <p>If someone comes into my funnel and they see me, they're like, \u201cWow, he looks like he's 11 years old. There's no way he knows anything about internet marketing,\u201d they're going to prejudge me before they can hear my message. For cold traffic, I still think it's probably more powerful to lead with a PowerPoint style video just because, again, it takes away all the judgment of you as a person. It gets that person in.</p> <p>Then I think as soon as they have come through your funnel and they are introduced to you, and they understand your value, and you've been positioned as a spot of authority or whatever you want to call it, as soon as they believe that, I really think at that point that the most important thing, not the most important but the best way to convert on the next thing you sell them is through an iPhone video.</p> <p>I think at that point, they have a relationship with you and it's so much more powerful to have them just see you, see your excitement and passion, to see you unscripted where you're talking about this thing, showing it and making it tangible. I think if you do that, it's just going to crush it. It is for us right now.</p> <p>If you look at Dot Com Secrets Labs Funnel, it started with the PowerPoint video. I made a quick video of me in my office holding up the book and talking about it and posted that. I was going to use that just to send out to my list but then I was like, \u201cLet's just put that as the video,\u201d and sure enough, it beat the PowerPoint.</p> <p>Then we changed the upsell to where we're giving away a free shirt and they join a $20 a month membership site. We tweaked that. After we did that, it was just a video of me in the office showing the shirt, talking about it, putting it into a box. I tried to make it a tangible experience. They saw me putting the t-shirt in the box.</p> <p>I'm going to shoot this box, if you just click yes down below, \u201cOoh, I want that box,\u201d I was trying to make it a very tangible experience for them. Then the third one, I just went to my home office. I'm actually driving back to the office right now from my home office. I just filmed it and I'm excited to see how it does.</p> <p>We're upselling this webinar. Instead of having a PowerPoint of me talking about the webinar, I had the webinar up open on my screen and I show it. I show pieces of it. I made it tangible, \u201cThis is what I talked about and this is why it's important. This is what you're going to have a chance to see.\u201d</p> <p>I just really tried to open it up so they could see exactly what it was that we're doing and that they're going to get. It's interesting. I think I had a big paradigm shift today. I've definitely been in the process over the last four or five years to script out every video and have it all perfect. While I still think that's important when you're bringing cold traffic in, I think after you've got a relationship, I think the iPhone style videos are going to convert best.</p> <p>There you go, you heard it here first. You will probably see a lot more from me doing this in the future. I'm at the office. I'm excited to get this video uploaded and tested out in the funnel. I appreciate you guys and hope you have a good time, and make an iPhone video today. Throw it up and sell something and see what happens. Pretend like you're Billy Mays and you'll be amazed at what happens.</p> <p>In fact, here's a homework assignment for all of you out there in Marketing in your Car land. Go to Google and type in \u201cBilly Mays Rich Schefren,\u201d and it's going to pull up a blog post on <a href=\"http://www.StrategicProfits.com/\">StrategicProfits.com</a> where Rich Schefren wrote, right after Billy Mays passed away, Rich Schefren wrote this huge blog post about it.</p> <p>I tell you what, I would have paid $97 easily for that blog post. It goes over how Billy Mays was the best pitchman our world has ever known, his scripts, how he did it, all that kind of stuff. If you go through that, it will give you the exact outline of how you need to create an iPhone style video. You'll notice one of the big things he talks about is product demos. That's what I'm trying to do, even with digital products, I'm trying to do these product demos, showing them the computer screen, showing them the demo, giving them some kind of wow moment.</p> <p>If you do that, that's how it all works. I appreciate you guys and gals and we'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "06:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/58_-_My_New_Online_Sales_Revolution.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1393959600, "title": "Episode #57 \u2013 A Sneak Peek At Clickfunnels", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Listen as Russell tells you about a new technology that will literally change the future of your business forever!</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. Today, I want to welcome you to the Marketing in your Car podcast and I'm going to give you guys a glimpse into the future. It's been a little while since I've done a podcast. I've been traveling like crazy, learning some cool stuff and been finishing up a secret project that very few people know about. I've hinted towards it a couple of times so I wanted to announce it now to our faithful Marketing in your Car listeners so you guys get a sneak peak above everybody else, not a sneak peak but just know what's happening so you can prepare for it.</p> <p>I think it will change your business and honestly, I think it will change your life. That's how passionate I am about this. I think what we've created is probably the best, most needed software product in the industry. I'm fired up about it. It's almost done. I'm freaking out. I've had a demo of it to play with today. It's amazing.</p> <p>I'm going to tell you about it. The software is going to be called Click Funnels. What's cool about it is there's other web builders out there, right? There's ones like Lead Pages, you can create a landing page. There's automated webinar software out there. There's cool hangout software, there's membership site software. There are a bunch of things out there that are all good but you've got to daisy chain together a whole bunch of different products to make a real funnel.</p> <p>What Click Funnels does is you log in and look at all the different funnel types. If you say, \u201cHey, I want an automated webinar,\u201d boom, you click a button and it will create every single one of the pages for the automated webinar for you, boom, boom, boom. Then you show each page, you click on it, and you can pick a template, change the headlines, all the text, kind of similar to Lead Pages, how easy it is to edit stuff. We modeled them on their editor but instead of creating pages, it's a funnel.</p> <p>We have automated webinar funnels, we have membership site funnels. We're literally log back in, click a button, add a tab, copy, paste in your content, boom, the entire membership site is built out in ten seconds. We have micro continuity funnels, we have free plus shipping funnels, we have tripwire funnels. We have basically every funnel you can dream of.</p> <p>In fact, to launch this, I'm working on a report where I'm going to map out my top favorite funnels. I've actually been drawing them out on the iPad. I'm having one of my designers sketch and make them look really cool. I mapped out like 14 different funnel types last night. It's cool. Our software will create every single one of them in the click of a button.</p> <p>Let's say for example you wanted the micro continuity funnel. In that funnel, there's five different pages. There's a squeeze page, a free CD page, an upsell page, a thank you page. You click a button and boom, it creates all those pages for you and it also creates a micro continuity member's area so you can go in there and say week one, unlock this content, week two, unlock this, week three, and literally, you can build out an entire micro continuity site in 20 to 30 minutes.</p> <p>We also have them for product launches so if you've seen all the product launch funnels, boom, you've got a product launch funnel. If you want an automated webinar, we mapped out all the pages for that. You click a button, boom, it's done. If you want an invisible funnel like what we've been doing, boom, click a button, and you're done.</p> <p>It's super cool. I can't even wait to show you guys. Our goal is to have a beta out in the middle of March and then by the end of March, launch it. I'm going to call my shot right now. I really think this will be probably the biggest game changer product that has hit our industry. I think it will stretch beyond our industry. Literally people that have local businesses can use it. People that have network marketing companies, people that whatever it is, it gives you the ability to do anything.</p> <p>Right now, it takes me a team of four or five designers and programmers to get done. You can do it literally by clicking a button. I'm going to fire half my staff after I have this. No, not really but we're going to change my staff to where all they\u2019re doing full time is just creating new funnels, new templates, new pages. I'm really fired up for it.</p> <p>You will see we're doing a lot of really cool stuff. You'll notice I'm going to be doing some fun things over the next two weeks talking about funnel types where people can go, all these funnels I'm sketching out, we're going to have it where we'll actually ship you out a physical copy of each of these funnels so you can look at it and determine for your business what funnel is the most important.</p> <p>A lot of people lately, funnels is the hot topic of conversation in our industry. It's what everyone is talking about. Everyone has, \u201cThis is the funnel.\u201d They're talking about one but the reality is most businesses have multiple funnels for different reasons. I'm marketing to my list, I have to have pattern interrupts, different ways I'm selling different things, different price points just so you can engage with different people.</p> <p>I'm going to be giving out these hand outs so people can pick what type of funnel they need, and then right afterwards, we'll be rolling out the software to do it all. I'm fired up. I hope you guys are too. I think you're going to love it. We're setting it at a price that's cheap enough that anybody can use it. I want 20, 30, 40,000 people using this by the end of the year so it's going to be awesome. I'm at the office.</p> <p>I'm going to go implement this stuff and get it knocked out. It's going to be a lot of fun. I appreciate you guys. If you like this podcast, if you're getting good ideas, if you get excited by the future of what's coming, then please go to iTunes and let me know. I love reading those. It makes me happy to see the reviews. That's about it, you guys. Thanks so much and I\u2019ll talk to you guys again soon.</p>", "duration": "06:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/57_-_A_Sneak_Peek_At_Clickfunnels.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1392922800, "title": "Episode #56 \u2013 Soap Operas vs. Seinfeld", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Can two seemingly conflicting marketing techniques actually work together when used correctly?</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to another amazing, awesome, exciting episode of Marketing in your Car. Hey guys and gals, I had a really fun experience last weekend that I wanted to share with you. I joined a mastermind group called the Ocean's Four mastermind group. It was out of Vegas. I joined it because it was just a different type of mastermind group.</p> <p>It was only meeting one time. It wasn't one you have to join for a whole year so I knew the commitment timetable wasn't too big. The other reason was Ocean's Four was because there were four people that were in the mastermind group. Two of them I've been studying a lot for a long time. I was really intrigued to get their opinions and ideas.</p> <p>The two guys that I went to go see, one of them, his name is Andre Chaperon. He has a bunch of products. By far, his best and most prolific is a product called Autoresponse Madness. The other guy was a guy named Ben Settle who runs <a href=\"http://www.BenSettle.com/\">BenSettle.com</a>. He's got a print newsletter called The Email Players Club. What's interesting is I've been watching these guys for the last year, 18 months or so, and trying to understand.</p> <p>They have two very different perspectives on email. With Andre and Autoresponse Madness, his whole goal he teaches is that you need to create a soap opera sequence. If somebody joins your list and over the next 20 to 40, however many days you create this soap opera, it's bringing your audience in and engaging them. You're opening loops in one email and closing them in other emails, having many episodes and this big huge story line which I think is really cool. It engages people and pulls them in.</p> <p>You look at the other person, Ben Settle. His model is very different. You join his list. From that point forward, everyday you get an email with an email I call them Seinfeld emails. It's kind of like the TV show Seinfeld where they're basically emails about nothing. Everyday, he sends an email out about whatever, and somehow always ties it back to his core product which is The Email Players Club.</p> <p>He's relentless. Everyday since I joined his list, I've gotten an email. I don\u2019t think he's ever missed a day. Every single day, it tells you some random thing that happened that day and then boom, pushes you back to his product. Again, two very different styles. In fact, it was kind of funny, Ben at the mastermind said, \u201cIf you were to look at our styles, I would look at what Andre does as a sniper, getting up on the rooftop, aiming, and trying to make this perfect thing and crafting it so you can perfectly close the sale and close the deal whereas with me,\u201d this is Ben talking, \u201cit's kind of more like walking into the mall with a shotgun and just unloading as many rounds as possible as fast as you can.\u201d</p> <p>That's the difference between their two styles. It was interesting because from their perspective, what they do could conflict. I think everyone else in the room, they think it conflicts. What's interesting is as I've been building out our funnels over the last 18 months that I've been watching these guys, I'm a big believer in both of their styles but in a very specific and very important sequence.</p> <p>What I've been teaching our students, what we've been doing is when someone joins your list, you put them through a seven to day day email soap opera sequence with the core goal of that to build the bond, to build the attractive character, and build the audience's engagement with the attractive character, to help them to build that bond to get to know the person and to make them want to continue to open emails and purchase products, and be engaged with that person.</p> <p>After that initial soap opera sequence is done, then we drop people onto a broadcast list. Then we start doing the Ben Settle style daily Seinfeld emails. As you look at my whole philosophy and belief patterns with email marketing is you lead with the soap opera and after they watch the soap opera, then you dump them onto the Seinfeld emails. I think that as a one-two punch, I think it's the smartest. I think it's brilliant. I think it's the best thing to do.</p> <p>I think if you go directly to the Ben Settle style Seinfeld emails, the audience doesn't have a chance to build a relationship with attractive character. If you just do Andre's soap opera sequences, you do a soap opera but eventually, you just keep writing this thing and you want to kill yourself because they're intricate and it takes awhile to write these things out. If you're carrying on those story lines, they're lasting days, months, and years. I think it's really difficult.</p> <p>If somebody joins your list in the middle of this thing, they have no idea of all the back story. It's like trying to watch a show like 24 where you start halfway through the season. It doesn't really make any sense. What I think is the blending of the two things. If somebody joins your list, initially have a seven to ten day sequence that's a soap opera sequence that builds a relationship with the attractive character, and as soon as that sequence is over, then drop them on a broadcast list where you do the daily Seinfeld emails.</p> <p>I think the blend of those two worlds is the most powerful way you could possibly do email marketing. It was really fun to have a chance to go meet those guys and learn the system they have behind each of their businesses, but I think more importantly, how to blend those two things together into what I think is the perfect, most ideal way to your email marketing.</p> <p>I'm at the office now. I appreciate you guys listening to the Marketing in your Car podcast. I hope you get a ton of value out of it. By the way, if you want some help with your funnel, we have a new coaching program set up. We're doing some amazing things with it. You just have to go to <a href=\"http://www.BlackBoxFunnel.com/application.php\">BlackBoxFunnel.com/application.php</a>. If you do that and apply, you have a chance to work with me and we can look at your sales funnel and have some fun with it. That's about it for today, guys. I will talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "07:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/56_-_Soap_Operas_Vs._Seinfeld.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1392058800, "title": "Episode #55 \u2013 My Renewed Focus On Sales", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to shift your focus to the #1 most important aspect of your business, and how to use that to triple your sales this year.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning everybody. I hope you guys are all doing awesome out there. Welcome to the Marketing in your Car podcast. I'm heading to the office today. I'm excited for this week. I hope you are too. Some of you guys know if you listen to my podcast religiously, you know that over the last week, we've been pulling some crazy long hours. We had three nights in a row.</p> <p>The first night, we were here until three and then I got three hours of sleep. The next day, we were here until four and I got three hours of sleep. The next day, we were here until 6:30 in the morning working because we flew out our head UI designer and our head programmer, and we are about to take over the world with a new software product.</p> <p>Last week was a lot of development week, working on stuff, creating things, and it was really cool. Then this weekend, I started thinking, \u201cYou know what? As great as developing new stuff is, I've got to be focusing on selling stuff.\u201d Obviously as a business owner, my number one job is sales. I got to get back to selling.</p> <p>I was thinking a lot this weekend about Michael Masterson's book Ready, Fire, Aim. I think I've mentioned this before on our podcast. If not, everyone should go get that book just because it will get your mindset right. He talks about in the book what it takes to go from zero to a million dollars, a million to ten, ten to 50 and 50 to 100 million, and the different skill sets and mindsets you need at each level.</p> <p>What's interesting is he talks about the very first, going from zero to a million, so many businesses fail because they think they need an office and computers, and I need all this stuff they need. The reality is from the very first year, the very first however long it takes to go from zero to a million bucks, the only thing you should be focusing on is sales, sales, sales. Our company does well on autopilot. Thing are happening but I look at each new venture we launch.</p> <p>Every time we launch a new venture, I've got to look at that as a company that's starting at zero and just sit down and look at sales, sales, sales. What do we got to do today to sell? This morning, I woke up early and put on my sales cap to figure out how we can market and sell our products. I picked the three core things we're focusing on right now. One is our Dot Com Secrets Labs newsletter. One is Neurocell, and one is our coaching program and wrote a strategy today about what we could do to start focusing on selling.</p> <p>I'm excited. We're heading to the office today. We're going to have a quick powwow with everyone. Then all we're going to do is spend most of the day focusing 100% on how do we sell this stuff, writing Facebook ads and solo ads, affiliates, and just going crazy.</p> <p>It was interesting, I look at a typical business day for me. I would say I probably spend five or six hours a day focusing on building new stuff and then other time, my focus of actually promoting things, maybe 30 minutes a day, maybe. If I can get the mindset shift for me and everyone in my office where we spend two or three hours a day completely focused on how do we drive more traffic to our offers, how do we sell more stuff, how would that change our business?</p> <p>Within a week, we would be focusing the same amount of time we normally right now focus on in a quarter. That's really my big focus is I'm going to try to spend two or three hours a day, me and everyone in my team that's tied to any kind of traffic generation thing, just focusing on sales, sales, sales.</p> <p>It's fun, I think I talked to you guys before about this huge whiteboard like a scoreboard in our office. We have our big goal this year which is $10 million. We have daily goals, weekly, and monthly. We actually just hired, we've had accountants that have worked for us for a long time. We just hired an in-house accountant to start working in our office so every single day, when I walk in the office, she can say, \u201cBoom, yesterday we made $15,000 or 13 or 22,\u201d or whatever the number was.</p> <p>I can see that number and we can try to figure out that day, what do we do to outsell what we did yesterday, and just focusing on beating yesterday's sales. I'm really fired up and excited for that. Those are some of the things that are going on in my mind right now. For all you guys, whatever your business is, I want you to start focusing more on that, waking up each morning, and the number one thing should not be, \u201cWhat can I create today? What's my next project?\u201d or whatever it might be.</p> <p>The number one goal should be how do I drive more traffic, how should I sell more stuff today? I highly recommend creating some kind of scoreboard where every single day, you can see your sales so you know that when you wake up in the morning, I got to beat yesterday's sales. It's kind of like when you go to the gym.</p> <p>I used to go to the gym all the time and just lift hard. I got strong but I got strong to a level. A couple of years ago, I had a personal trainer and he keeps track of every single lift I do, and every time I go in, he tries to increase either the reps or the weight or both, or whatever. I look at the gains that I've made over the last two to three years. I'm stronger now than I've ever been, and I keep going up. It's because we're tracking and measuring, and seeing those things.</p> <p>I think it's the same with sales. I'm excited to start watching that. Today is the first day of this. It will be interesting to see what happens over the next month, two months, three months. Last week, we were looking at our sales and we were averaging I think around $16,000 a day or so which is good, but I was like, \u201cMan, what if we could get that to $20,000 and then $25,000, and then $30,000?\u201d</p> <p>I think we were doing the math. I think $30,000 a day is about $10 million a year. For me to hit my goal for this year, we got to be averaging about $30,000 a day. That's my KPI, my key performance indicator, the number I need to be looking at every single day when I come in. What did we do yesterday? Okay, what do we have to do more of today to increase that over what we did yesterday? That's my goal.</p> <p>I'm excited. I just got to the office. I hope that you guys are as fired up as me. Sit down, look at your goals, look at your daily sales and start figuring out how you can make that bigger. I don\u2019t care if right now, your sales are six bucks a day. That's fine. Look at that and say, \u201cHow can I get to $10 a day? How can I get to $20 a day? How can I get to $50, $100, $1000 then $5000, $10,000?\u201d and just start focusing on those numbers.</p> <p>If we're not focusing on it, it's not going to grow. I promise you, it's like going to the gym everyday and just lifting. You'll feel good and the ladies will check you out but you're not going to get any stronger. When you start measuring that daily and you look at that, the number just annoys you and bothers you.</p> <p>You've got to figure out how in the world to beat it. That's when you start seeing the big gains that you want. That's my challenge for you guys today. That's what I'm going to be doing today. I'm fired up. We'll talk to you guys again soon. Thank everyone.</p>", "duration": "07:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/55_-_My_Renewed_Focus_On_Sales.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1391713200, "title": "Episode #54 \u2013 A New T-Shirt Model", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How we\u2019re using a free t-shirt to launch a new membership site.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to a very snowy Marketing in your Car. It's been a little while since I've done Marketing in your Car. I want to tell you what's been happening. We are about to launch this new software as a service, or SAAS as they call it program, product. It's actually three products.</p> <p>We've been working on it for the last year or so, actually, a little bit longer than that on some of them. We're at a point now where they're almost done but they haven't quite gotten done. We really need a good UI designer to help polish everything off. There's this guy who I think is the best UI designer I've ever seen in my life, and I bribed him and paid him a whole bunch of money to come to Boise to work.</p> <p>We flew him out this week. He works typically, he wakes up at two o'clock in the afternoon and then hangs out and starts working at seven o'clock at night until six AM. That's his schedule. That's East Coast time so it's even later. Four o'clock my time, he's normally waking up. We flew him out here and he's still on that schedule. We're kind of working around him.</p> <p>The last two nights in a row, I have worked until about four AM. Then I go drop him back off at the hotel, I come home, sleep for three or four hours until my kids wake up, and then I'm back at it again. I'm running at almost no sleep but for the last two or three days, we've gotten so much stuff done. It's just exciting.</p> <p>For all you guys who are out there launching new companies or businesses, you probably know that there's days when you just go in there and kill yourself, when your body is ready to die but it's all worth it afterward because at least for us, our thing is almost done, and fired up and excited. Last night while they were working, Todd was programming, Dillon was designing, and I was writing sales stuff.</p> <p>I came up with an idea for a new business model. Because I had eight more hours while they were working to do whatever I wanted, I started implementing this concept. What we did, we've done a lot of membership sites in the past. My problem is I always charge $97 for them. While we made a lot of money, retention was never amazing on it.</p> <p>One of my close friends, Stu McLaren, I remember a couple of years ago, he told me, \u201cMan, if you had a membership site that was $20 a month, people would stay forever. You charge so much, people don't stay.\u201d I had an idea for a membership site, a $20 a month one that was basically like a forum where people could come online and talk about marketing stuff.</p> <p>Outside of that, there wasn't a lot of stuff in there, just that. I wrote the copy for it, not really good but I was like, \u201cWhy is someone going to pay $20 a month to get that? What's the hook to get someone in?\u201d I was looking at all these people doing t-shirt stuff. That's the hot topic right now. Everyone is selling t-shirts on T Spring.</p> <p>We tried looking at different models and ideas, and saw one guy in the real estate space who is giving away free t-shirts, like a tripwire offer, giving away a free t-shirt and then upselling them into his continuity program. I was like, \u201cWhat if I made a t-shirt, the coolest t-shirt in the world and the only way you get that t-shirt is if you're a member? You join and we ship you out this free t-shirt,\u201d kind of like Insanity does.</p> <p>You buy their product, and if you lose weight, they send you a t-shirt. We flipped that around. I wrote the whole copy, designed the whole letter last night and it turned out amazing where basically what we're going to do is print 1000 of these t-shirts and they're going to be limited edition. When they're gone, they\u2019re gone. The only way to get one is to become a member of our membership site, which is $20 a month.</p> <p>You pay $20, boom, we ship you out the t-shirt. When the 1000 t-shirts are gone, they're limited edition and they're gone forever. At that point, we'll design another t-shirt and do it again, and just keep doing this process until we get 3000, 4000, or 5000 members in the member's area. Every time we have a new\u00a0 t-shirt come out, we will offer it to the new members first so they can pre-order so we can sell 500, 1000, 2000, however many members which lowers our cost. Then we do this launch where we go and pre-print all the pre-ordered ones and then 1000 other ones, and give away these t-shirts for free and advertise them on Facebook, and a bunch of other really cool things.</p> <p>Like I said, it turned out amazing. The model is really cool. We're going to be replicating it I think across all of our niches. In our weight loss space, we're going to design an amazing t-shirt for the weight loss space, one for the jiu jitsu space, one for all these different markets we're going into, just an amazing t-shirt and the same model, $20 a month membership site and limited edition of that t-shirt, 1000 of them. When they're gone, they're gone, and then replicate that over and over again.</p> <p>I'm excited. It's a new model. It's a new concept, new idea. No one is doing it yet. I'm sure that people knock me off. I hope they do. I hope you do but just wait. We'll be rolling this out probably in the next seven to ten days. I'll get the t-shirts printed. We already have a design and they turned out amazing. I messaged the designer last night at three in the morning and woke up this morning, he had already designed it and it looked awesome.</p> <p>It's exciting, a new model, new ideas to think about. That's about it for today. I hope you're loving your business. I hope you're excited. I'm going to go pick up Todd and Dillon, get back to work. We get one more day of pounding out UI designs and back in programming before they leave. Then I get back to my regular sleep schedule because I am tired. I appreciate you guys and will talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "06:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/54_-_A_New_T-Shirt_Model.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1391022000, "title": "Episode #53 \u2013 The REAL Secret Behind Traffic And Conversion", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The two invisible lessons that I learned, that they didn\u2019t want me to know, while at the traffic and conversion event.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to a very slushy Marketing in your Car. Today, I woke up and came outside. It's kind of raining but it's freezing cold so we have this slush all over the road. My kids were running around in their clothes before school and got soaking wet, so we've had a fun morning but now I'm heading to the office to get some work done.</p> <p>I'm super fired up for today for a lot of different reasons. I just want to talk to you guys today about something I saw last week which was awesome. I was very impressed with Ryan Deiss and Perry Belcher, their Traffic Conversion Summit. I just wanted to share with you guys something really cool that I learned from it.</p> <p>It wasn't so much the teaching. The sessions were great and everything. The reality is the bulk of what they shared was a recap of the best stuff from Perry's Secret Selling System so the content wasn't really new or anything from that side, but watching the event orchestrated was amazing. I think there's a lot of things to be learned from anyone doing any kind of event. It can be online events, offline events, anything.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how much they actually sold at the event but if I was to guess, I would say probably sold anywhere from three to five million dollars from the event without anyone ever feeling like they got sold. It was really interesting, so some really cool stuff that all of us can learn from for our own businesses.</p> <p>One thing, if you watched the way they ran the event, there were about 2000 people there. They had a lot of different sessions and things that they were teaching but there were two core things they were selling. One was their war room which was their mastermind group. The other was their funnel consultations. War room was between $15,000 and $25,000 depending on at what level you get in. The funnel consulting was $17,000.</p> <p>What they did was they got up there and taught a session on tripwires for example which is a super cool concept they're talking a lot about over the last few times. At the end of the tripwire presentation, they said, \u201cLook, if you want one of our funnel consultants to look at your funnel, run to the back, fill out an application, and we'll set up a private one-on-one meeting with you during the event to meet with one of our funnel consultants.\u201d</p> <p>People run to the back and fill out the form for their funnel consultation. The next session, Frank Kern spoke about something. At the end of it, he's like, \u201cHey, by the way, if you want us to critique your funnel, run to the back and get your free funnel consultation.\u201d Every single presentation for the most part was talking about their free funnel consultation.</p> <p>They had huge monitors in the main ballroom that show people whose turn it was to do funnel consultations. Literally, the entire three days, there were probably 60 people up on the board at any given time, saying, \u201cYou guys, report for your funnel consultation,\u201d boom, next ones, next ones. Of the 2000 people in the room, unless they were horrible at closing, I would say they closed anywhere from 100 to 200 people in their $17,000 consult package.</p> <p>Again, that's between 1.7 and three million bucks. As I started thinking about that, in my business, can I do a lot more cool free stuff where I'm just giving, teaching, and showing stuff for free, and at the end, \u201cHey, if you want me to look at your stuff, go fill out this application form.\u201d In our business now, we re-set up a mini call center. We got two people who are calling and consulting, and then selling people on our higher end services.</p> <p>I look at every blog post I do, every teleseminar, every interview, everything I do, I could be pushing people to go get their funnel consult, or whatever it is that I'm selling and just keep pushing people to this thing. I thought that was really interesting. I think for all you guys, we're always putting out content, YouTube videos, podcasts. All the different stuff you're putting out there, every one of them, if you just focus on giving amazing content and then push people somewhere where they can get a consultation, it's a very powerful zero resistance way to sell. That's one thing.</p> <p>The next thing is their war room, which is their mastermind group. If any of you guys have any kind of masterminds or groups that you're running, I learned this originally from Bill Glazer. He did the same thing when I was in his titanium group. You go to his events, and the whole time, they're talking about their titanium group and having people from their titanium group get up on stage and talk about what they're doing and how much success they're having.</p> <p>By the end of it, all you know is you want to be in the titanium group. It's the same thing they did with the war room. They just kept bringing people up from war room and case studying, talking about them. Every presentation would reference the war room. People are just like, \u201cWhat in the world is the war room?\u201d</p> <p>Finally, \u201cOkay, we got some spots in the war room. If you're interested, there are applications in the back. You can go apply.\u201d Again, it's very zero selling, just talking and putting those people up on a pedestal and making you want to ascend to that level. I'm not going to lie, they closed me on a $25,000 war room package so it worked for me.</p> <p>Think about it guys, if you have a group, the biggest key is to talk about your students, talk about success stories and that will get more people to want to ascend and become like them. Those are some of the cool stuff that happened in Traffic Conversion outside of the actual seminars as far as watching them do. I usually learn more from watching people do stuff than I do from them teaching stuff.</p> <p>I definitely got a huge education watching them run and manage that event. It was very impressive. I hope you guys got some ideas from what I shared with you today. Give away free content, put your success stories and your students on a pedestal. If you do that, people will start flocking to you.</p> <p>I saw it this weekend and I've seen it in my own business. We're going to start doing a whole bunch more of it. I guarantee you guys will see a lot more of it coming through. Hope you guys enjoyed this. If you like this podcast, people go to iTunes and tell people you like it. Go comment on all that fun stuff. I\u2019d really appreciate it.</p> <p>I hope you guys are doing awesome. We'll talk again soon.</p>", "duration": "07:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/53_-_The_REAL_Secret_Behind_Traffic_And_Conversion.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1390330800, "title": "Episode #52 \u2013 Are You Ready To Scale An Offer?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Some of my thoughts after day 1 of our new supplement offer.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, good morning. This is Russell Brusnon. It's about 6:30 in the morning and I'm heading to the gym. I was too excited to not do a podcast. Welcome to the Marketing in your Car podcast. I got to admit, part of this whole episode is because of my good friend and faithful listener Stu McLaren.</p> <p>We had a chance, I know you guys have heard me talk over the last however many months about our supplement we have. We've been doing really well with it. We always have a free plus shipping thing where they get a free trial bottle. We auto bill them and all that fun stuff.</p> <p>We couldn't ever make that offer work very well like in mass media when we would take it to media buyers and stuff like that. We've been trying to figure out a way to do it. The media buyers said, \u201cIf you want to be successful buying big media, you have to change the way your offer is structured. It can't be a trial. It has to be up-front pay. It has to be all these things.\u201d</p> <p>They showed us some successful offers. We looked at all of them. I bought probably 20 different supplements to see their sales process and to see what they upsold and how much they upsold them for, what the price points were, and all that fun stuff. That was what I did about six months ago or so, and started reworking our offer.</p> <p>We hired a great copywriter. He wrote the copy and designed it all, put the whole process together. Yesterday, it actually went live. It was exciting. You never really know what's going to happen. You hope and pray that it's going to do well but yesterday was a big day for us. The ad we bought, we spent $1300 on the ad and within about three hours or so, we broke even.</p> <p>Within about eight or nine hours, we doubled over, meaning we had made over $2600. This is on cold traffic which is what makes it so exciting. It was the equivalent of putting a big billboard out in the street, and people driving by came in and either bought it or didn't buy it. I'm excited, to double over your money on the first day on a cold ad before any of the testing process has really started is exciting.</p> <p>I remember I've been wanting to do a supplement for years. Ever since I interviewed a guy named Vince James, and some of you guys, hopefully most of you guys have heard that interview. It's the 12 month internet millionaire where I interview Vince. He had made $100 million in 23 months selling a supplement. He wrote a really good book called The 12 Month Millionaire. In that book, he wrote a chapter called, \u201cWhat's it's like when one of these things explodes.\u201d</p> <p>He talks about how with his offer, the one that he did when he first mailed the first sales letter, he said it tripled over on the front end which for him had never happened before. He's like, since he had that happen, he knew it was game over. He took that letter that he was mailing and started scaling it to more magazines, making it wider and bigger.</p> <p>Again, with it, he made in 23 months $100 million. That's how I'm feeling this morning. I'm awake, I'm excited. Today, my only question when I get into the office is how do we scale this. What can we do? How can we increase the traffic and make it more consistent? How can we get more of it? That's going to be my focus today and probably for the next, who knows, next year if it keeps going this well, if we can keep scaling it.</p> <p>We've had a lot of successful offers. I think last I checked, we had six or seven products we had made that had done over a million dollars in sales but we've never had one that we could just really scale, take it, and grow it by adding tons more media to it. That is going to be a fun process to learn and try. That's what we're doing.</p> <p>For all you guys out there who are trying internet marketing stuff, don't give up. The stuff all works. I took a little break to go in and work out. Now I'm back in my car, heading back home. Anyway, I just wanted to add onto the end of this because I wanted to make this actionable for you guys, not just talk about a success we had.</p> <p>I've been doing this for a long time, over a decade now of creating and trying out offers. It's interesting, some fail, some do well, some do really well. You never know. That's why I think if you really want to be in this whole internet marketing/direct response game, a big part of it is you got to always be creating new things and testing stuff because you never know which one is going to blow up. It's kind of interesting.</p> <p>I remember hearing, I think it was on Shark Tank or somewhere, they were talking about how most people are trying to get a grand slam. That's their goal, trying to get a launch that makes them a million dollars and make a grand slam but tons of millionaires have been made by hitting singles and doubles. I think it's really key.</p> <p>We're always looking for grand slams but the reality is you've got to hit singles, hit doubles, single, double, triple, and then every once in awhile when you step up to the plate, you're going to knock one out of the park but you can\u2019t do that if you're only up to bat once or twice. You always got to be practicing, getting better, trying and testing.</p> <p>I don't know where our supplement is going to go but based off just day one, it's pretty exciting. I think we've got a lot of potential. Now it's going to be the fun part about learning how to scale it, grow it, and seeing how far, wide, and deep we can go. I just want to encourage you guys as well. Just keep on creating different offers until you hit the single, which usually the single is going to be the first one that gives you your big payday, hit a double which is probably the one that's going to let you fire your boss and make this thing a full time gig, then every once in awhile, and it might not be a year from now. It might be ten years from now but if you're consistent with it and keep getting better and honing your skills, you can knock one out of the park.</p> <p>That's about it for today. I'm excited and fired up for today. I hope you guys are as well. Make sure that you put yourself in a positive state for yourself plus the people you're working around. Your attitude I promise you is going to wear off on people around you, so put yourself in a good state. Go in there excited today, get fired up, and have some fun. Thanks everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/52_-_Are_You_Ready_To_Scale_An_Offer.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1390244400, "title": "Episode #51 \u2013 The \u201cMarketingInYourCar\u201d Blackbox In Action", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How we made $30,000 in four hours, training people on stuff we love to share, and how you can too.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson.

It's basically I was walking everyone through the process I've been using lately that's just crushing it where basically, we're leading with a free plus shipping something, a newsletter, a magazine, a CD, a DVD, an mp3 player, a knife, a something, some weird gadget or info, giving away a free thing.</p> <p>After they purchase that free thing, then you take them to a page that walks them through a really cool case study of something you've done or are doing. Then you have them sign up for an invisible funnel webinar which is a webinar where basically they pay zero dollars to attend. Then you do the training live. At the end of it, if they like it, then you bill them.</p> <p>They put their credit card in for zero dollars and you re-bill them at the end. At the end of the three or four hour long training that you teach whatever concept it is you're teaching, then you offer them an opportunity to work with you where you have them apply. We ran that last Friday. One of the tweaks we did this time with our invisible funnel which was kind of cool is we actually, up front, they can sign up for zero dollars and then pay $97 when the training is over. Or if they know it's going to be good and they can save $20 by just paying $77 now. We did that.</p> <p>What's interesting is 39% of the people paid the $77 now which was exciting. We made almost $10,000, just shy of $10,000 from people paying the $77 up front, and then today, probably here in about an hour, we're going to be re-billing everyone who didn't cancel. Based on that, we'll be making another probably $20,000 to $25,000 depending on how many people's cards go through.</p> <p>We made about $30,000 just doing the actual training which was exciting. It's always good to get paid to teach someone cool up front. Then now we got a hold of people that applied to work with us. We'll be signing them up as well for our high end thing which hopefully we'll make another six figures or more from that. It's exciting and cool.</p> <p>This whole black box concept is something that I hope all you guys have a chance to look at. That's basically the process. You create a really cool, take out your best tip, secret, or strategy or whatever, make a free plus shipping thing, and then sell that. They pay for shipping and then on the next page, you show them a case study of how that thing that they just bought, how it's worked for somebody else.</p> <p>Say a case study of how someone lost 30 pounds or someone made this much money, or someone saved this much money on their taxes, whatever your system is that you teach. Then tell them that you'll teach them that over premium training that is anywhere from $47 to $97 but they don't have to pay until after the webinar is over. They just put in their credit card now.</p> <p>If they hate it, they let you know. If they love it, do nothing and you'll bill them at the end. At the end of that, let them apply to get your more personalized one-on-one coaching program. That's what we did and taught. It's been exciting so far. People have been going crazy with this. I'm excited.</p> <p>The other reason I wanted to tell you this is the whole free plus shipping thing, we used to do it back in the day where we'd do free plus shipping and put someone on a forced continuity program but we stopped doing that because FTC and Visa and Mastercard did not like that, so we stopped doing forced continuity, but we kind of stopped doing free plus shipping stuff as well.</p> <p>Over the last three or four months, we brought it back, didn't do any continuity but we do upsells. Right now, that model is crushing it for us. I actually took the first 50 episodes of Marketing in your Car. We put it on a CD. You will see here in the next week or two an offer I put out where you get the first 50 episodes of Marketing in your Car for free, just cover six or eight bucks for shipping and handling and we'll ship it out to you.</p> <p>I hope a lot of you guys take it up because you'll have a chance to listen to the entire first 50 episodes on one CD. We cut out the cheesy audio songs so you don't have to hear it a thousand times. I think it would be really good. Afterwards, we'll upsell people into our funnel. I recommend you guys getting it for two reasons.</p> <p>One, you'll get all of the podcasts so far on a nice convenient CD, and number two, you'll have a chance to see this black box process in action. I'm at the office now. I'm going to go rock and roll, make some more black boxes for myself, for my businesses, and check to see how our supplements are doing this morning with our new funnel and the new ad that went out.</p> <p>Hope you guys are doing awesome and we will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "05:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/51_-_The_MarketingInYourCar_Blackbox_In_Action.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1388430000, "title": "Episode #50 \u2013 Building Your Scorecard", "author": "", "summary": "<p>If you don\u2019t keep track of your score in business, you can\u2019t win. Here\u2019s how Russell is building his scorecard today. I highly recommend you build one as well.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell, and welcome to another episode of Marketing in Your Car.</p> <p>I hope you're excited for New Year's. It's coming soon. Last night, I was up until about midnight and couldn't fall asleep so I got my clothes on, drove to the office, and worked until three in the morning, and then woke up again today at seven because I'm so fired up about getting ready for next year. I want to tell you guys my number one task for today because I think it's going to be probably one of the biggest things that I could possibly do to increase our business next year.</p> <p>I've never done it before. It shocks me. I should have been doing this for the last ten years of my business. I highly, highly encourage all you guys to copy me and do this today. What I'm doing is basically I'm making a scorecard. You know, the biggest problem that I think I have in my business is that I don't keep score. I don't watch the numbers as close as I should, revenue goals and things like that, mostly because I think I hate accountants. They stress me out. They just are really weird people.</p> <p>Because of that, I really shy away from looking at the numbers and all that kind of stuff. Over the last month, I worked with my accountants to have them completely change our profit and loss sheets because I hate the way that regular accountants do it and I had them make up one for me that actually gives me numbers that look like a way I can actually read and interpret them. That was one part of it.</p> <p>The biggest part is we're making a huge scorecard. I'm going and buying a huge whiteboard. We're mounting it in my office today. Basically, I'm going to break the scorecard into three different sections. One is going to be a daily section, Monday through Sunday, the time each day, and it's going to have our five core businesses, Dot Com Secrets, Edison, Neurocell, Body Evolution, Living on a Coupon, and other.</p> <p>Have those businesses and have each day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and what's going to happen is each morning, we'll wake up and I'm going to put in how much money we made in each of those companies, boom, right huge in front of our eyes so we can see, \u201cHey, yesterday we made $13,000 or $23,000,\u201d whatever we made, and we can see it.</p> <p>Then every single day of the week, we'll put that in there and we'll set weekly goals each week and see if we can try to beat the weekly goal. That would be the first section. Then what happens after the week is done, we'll clear it all out and on the right-hand side of the board, it will be a weekly number. We'll have week one, week two, week three, week four, week five, and have just the total now of the entire week for all companies.</p> <p>\u201cHey, last week, we made $160,000,\u201d or whatever, and put in the number for that week. Week number two, week number three, week number four, and at the end of that, we'll have our monthly goal. At the bottom of the whiteboard, or all across the bottom, we're going to have all 12 months and we'll have just the monthly. January we made $450,000, February we made $600,000, whatever it is, and we'll be able to start seeing it.</p> <p>What that will do is that will start getting me and everyone on my team and everyone here focused on those goals. Obviously we've done well and we always do well. We're focusing on just doing a lot of stuff but we never just focused on that number. I think that's going to be a really big thing for us is having a scorecard out in front of us all day long, every single day because if you can see the scorecard, you're more likely to keep working towards that and trying to increase it.</p> <p>One thing I've learned is that whatever you measure, you can increase. If you don't measure it, you can never increase it. I've looked at that over the last years. I looked through our numbers with our accountants. It was up and down, up and down. There was no ever steady progression, just ups and down. I think with this, it will give us a focus every single day of what can I do today to increase that.</p> <p>The big model that I'm going to have for our internal company and also for our website, in fact, I think I may change the tag line of Dot Com Secrets to just being, \u201cHow to give yourself a raise everyday,\u201d and how often do we look at it. Everyday, how do we give ourselves a raise? Yesterday, we did $13,000. How do we give ourselves $14,000 today? What do we have to do to give ourselves a raise today, always having that be the focus.</p> <p>That's what we're doing. We're building a huge scorecard. It's going to be fun. It's going to be on the board. We're going to look at it every single day. I'm excited for it. For you guys, you need to make a scorecard for yourselves as well. I recommending going to Home Depot. For $10, you can buy a big old whiteboard, go mount it on your wall, and make your own scorecard. Like I said, we're breaking our board into three sections, having our daily, weekly, and yearly numbers.</p> <p>For this, we're just focusing on revenue numbers. Then internally, what we're going to be doing is the same kind of thing where each key department is going to have their KPIs which are key performance indicators. Revenue will be one KPI, refunds will be another KPI. Obviously we don't want any of those. We'll also have how many opt-ins, how much traffic level, all these different KPIs as well.</p> <p>Each day, we'll mail out a report in the morning from the day before of, \u201cHey, here's how many opt-ins, subscribers, buyers, blah, blah, blah we got as well.\u201d We'll have a daily email scorecard that goes out as well as the big scorecard for our numbers on the wall. That's what I'm doing today. Isn't it exciting? I recommend for all of you guys as well to make your scorecard, put it up so you can see it and everybody in your team can see it.</p> <p>If you work remotely, you can do something like ducks board and build your own that way. I just want something that's out in front of you every single day, and just look at those numbers every single day because again, what you track, you can increase. That's it, guys. I'm at the office, about to go make my whiteboard. I'm excited. I hope you guys do as well. We will talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "06:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/50_-_Building_Your_Scorecard.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1388084400, "title": "Episode #49 \u2013 The Tripwire Offer", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A cool new strategy I learned from Perry Belcher, kept me up all night Christmas Eve. Discover how a \u201ctripwire offer\u201d can change your entire business overnight.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Everyone, good morning. It\u2019s the day after Christmas, and I want to welcome you to the Marketing In Your Car podcast. Okay, everyone, so, I don\u2019t know about you, but the last two days have been crazy. Partially because of Christmas, partially because I bought a course. And the night before Christmas, I only had two hours of sleep because I couldn\u2019t stop listening to it, and it was awesome.</p> <p>So, the product is called, it was Perry Belcher\u2019s Secret Selling System. And if any of you guys know me, you know that I\u2019ve spent close to $300,000 or more on my marketing education in the last ten years. And this product, I would say, would be one of the top three courses I\u2019ve ever gone through. Amazing. Anyway, the, not Christmas Eve, the night before Christmas Eve, I was listening to it.</p> <p>My wife passed out, and I was not quite tired yet, so I put it in. I started listening. I was like, 10 or 11 hours into it, and Perry started talking about this concept called The Trip Wire Offer. And that\u2019s what kept me up all night long the night before Christmas, and then the next night we had Christmas Eve. So, I\u2019m really tired right now, but I\u2019m so excited it does not even matter.</p> <p>So what I want to talk to you is about the trip wire offer, because this will change my business forever, and it should change your business forever as well. If you don\u2019t have Perry\u2019s course yet, go and find it. I don\u2019t know how to even buy it. It was an upsell for something but if you can get a hold of it, do anything you can to get it. It\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>Anyway, so, with that said, the trip wire offer, I want to talk about what this is. And this is not something that\u2019s new to me, but this is something I completely forgot. If any of you guys have been around me for a long time, you probably remember a course that we taught a while ago called Micro Continuity. It was by far our best selling product ever, and we launched it. What we did is, little did I know at the time, we had a trip wire offer.</p> <p>I actually went to Hong Kong, well, I didn\u2019t go to Hong Kong. I went online, I met this dude in Hong Kong, who sold these little MP3 players. And I took a six-hour trading course and I put it on this little MP3 player. And when we launched it, people bought this MP3 player for free, plus shipping. And then I would ship it out to them, and afterwards we would bill them $97 a month to have access to the Micro Continuity membership site.</p> <p>And like I said, we launched that, we did well over $1 million. We had, I think we had 8000 people pay $97 a month at the time. And it was awesome. And we, a little while later we did the same kind of concept with 12 Month Internet Millionaire. We got an MP3 player and sold it, and we had these little offers. We had this cool gadget, and it blew up.</p> <p>Now, there were two problems with the way we ran that before. Problem number one is we were cooking continuity in all of the things. Which isn\u2019t really a big problem, we made a ton of money. The big problem though was that a lot of people just didn\u2019t know they were getting billed. FTC came down, Visa and MasterCard came down, and just started hating those offers. And so, they penalized us, we lost our merchant account for a little while because of it.</p> <p>And they just didn\u2019t like the free plus shipping we put someone on forced continuity afterwards. And so, that was kind of frustrating for me. And because of that we stopped doing those types of offers. Because I thought that there weren\u2019t any good unless you had a continuity hook to it. But looking back on it now, what was amazing was we did the free plus shipping thing, and we would get so many more people in the front door.</p> <p>And then, because they made that first commitment, our upsells converted amazingly. We made insane amounts of money. Our ups, I remember for every free MP3 player we were giving away, we were averaging between $60 and $70 in sales from upsales.</p> <p>Then we have the continuity after that. Again, stupid Russell, because I lost my ability to do the continuity, I just quit doing those things altogether whereas if I had pulled continuity out of the equation and just gave away the free mp3 player and I had the upsells afterward, I still would have made a couple million dollars just from those offers yet I stopped stupidly. So Russell has decided to repent and start doing offers like that again, the tripwire offer.</p> <p>An example of the tripwire offer is something that's so amazing, so good, and super cheap that people just buy it. You get somebody in the buying mood, they've already said yes to the first thing and they start buying the upsells right afterward. Some examples from Ryan and Perry's business, I bought three or four of them this weekend and promoted one this weekend just to see how it went. One of them is in their survival business. They have these cool little credit card knives. Basically, you pay $2.95 and they ship you out a free credit card knife. It looks like a credit card and it folds into your knife. You keep it in your wallet. It's awesome.</p> <p>I bought one of those and boom, they hit me with three upsells afterward. Then I bought this other one that was this instant light match that lights 10,000 times in a row, boom, free plus shipping. I paid $2.95 shipping and handling, and boom, they had three upsells afterward. Then I bought another one that was this super magic gadget card. I don't even know, it opens cans and does a whole bunch of things like that. Same thing, $2.95, upsold me three things afterward.</p> <p>It's just brilliant because it's this really cool offer. People love it. They're very easy to put on Facebook. People pass them along a lot of times. In fact, the first time I found out about Perry and Ryan's credit card offers, because I saw it on Facebook, everyone is sharing it and passing it around, it had been shared 3000 or 4000 times, this cool free card. I went to contact them to become an affiliate for it and they're like, \u201cOh, we don't have an affiliate program yet.\u201d</p> <p>All these people were passing it and sharing it, and they weren't even making anything off of it, just because it was such a cool front end offer. I started thinking about that for my different businesses. For our weight loss business, I'm meeting tomorrow with some guys who do sourcing from China to try to find a couple different things that we can use this on. I'm going to have them look for a pedometer, those things you hold when you walk and it shows how many steps you take, looking for a skin fold tester, looking for a tape measure, different things like that that we can give away for free plus shipping, and then get people into our funnel.</p> <p>In the information business, I'm looking again for more mp3 players, for USB sticks, things like that. For our couponing business, we're looking for stuff. I'm trying to find as many things as I can because they're sexy to advertise. They go viral. You get someone as a customer, they're more likely to buy your upsells afterwards, and they're awesome.</p> <p>They don't have to be free plus shipping. Ryan and Perry, a lot of their tripwire offers are just like seven dollar reports that are based off one little thing, one trick, one technique, one hack. We're going to start finding all these little hacks, tricks, and techniques, and start making little tripwire offers to bring people into our funnels.</p> <p>In fact, for each one of our core offers, we're going to build five or six different tripwires around it. For example, Dot Com Secrets to Success, I have five or six different tripwires in mind that we're going to build for that. Dot Com Secrets Lab, in fact, I came in early today because I'm excited to build out this new tripwire offer I have for Dot Com Secrets Lab, all these little tripwire offers that get people into your funnel to start buying your upsells.</p> <p>They join your list, people promote these things, and you can make a lot of money. They're really fun for affiliates as well. Ryan and Perry with their credit card knife, they had an affiliate contest going on.\u00a0 Basically, you give away a free credit card knife and they give you $10 for every credit card knife you give away. You don't get anything on the upsells but I was like, \u201cYou know what? It's a fun thing.\u201d</p> <p>I emailed yesterday, on Christmas Day, saying, \u201cHey, check out what I bought myself for Christmas. It's this cool credit card knife. It was free. I just paid $2.95 shipping and handling. You guys should get one too because they're really cool.\u201d That was 12 hours ago, probably 18 hours ago I emailed that out. So far, we've had 99 people take the thing so I made almost $1000 by giving away a free credit card knife. People are excited. They love it and they're passing it on.</p> <p>It's kind of cool and kind of exciting. It got me refired up. You guys, tripwire offers. Start thinking about how you can make a tripwire offer or multiple for any of your core products. I promise you, there is power in that. Anyway, I'm at the office. I'm going to go work on my new tripwire. I'm fired up. I'm excited. I hope you are as well. Thanks you guys, and we will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "08:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/49_-_The_Tripwire_Offer.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1387566000, "title": "Episode #48 \u2013 The Power Of Saying \u2018No\u2019 To An Opportunity", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Last night, Russell cut the deals on a 3-5 million dollar a year opportunity, and woke up this morning feeling awesome. Find out why on today\u2019s podcast.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to the Marketing In Your Car podcast. Hey guys and gals, so we\u2019re not far from Christmas. I hope you guys are excited. I\u2019m recording this on a Friday, and Christmas is next Wednesday. And just, I\u2019m so excited, like, here I am, trying to get all the stuff done because January I\u2019m excited to hit the road running with kind of a whole new business model and new plans and new focuses.</p> <p>And some of the stuff I\u2019ve been talking about over in the last few weeks. And I\u2019m just fired up. And what I want to talk about today, though, was a little bit different, because, you know, marketers and entrepreneurs are always looking at, like, opportunities, right? And there\u2019s so many opportunities in this world. It always makes me laugh. I have some friends that are broke, and broke people always complain because there\u2019s no opportunities.</p> <p>There\u2019s not many opportunities, I don\u2019t have a job, I don\u2019t have blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? And I\u2019m in the opposite side, where there\u2019s so many opportunities I can\u2019t even sleep at night thinking about them. And one of my big a-ha\u2019s that I learned this year, I guess I kind of re-learned it this year, was learning how to say No to opportunities. And I think one of the best ways you can make money in this world is learning how to say no to a really, really good opportunity.</p> <p>And it\u2019s hard. You know, obviously there\u2019s going to be opportunities that \u2014 sorry, I\u2019m driving and the lady is crazy across the street. Anyway, there\u2019s going to be opportunities that are so good that are harder to pass up. For example, this year one of the big opportunities that came across my plate was Rippln. And it was something that I thought was going to be huge. In fact, it was huge, as you know.</p> <p>We got 1.5 million members, but after we did our heavy lifting on the front end, the back end didn\u2019t really kind of fulfil on the promises. And it just kind of went away. But I look at \u2014 I spent probably two to three months of last year focusing on that, spending off time and energy and effort. And when all was said and done, the amount of money they made was close to nothing.</p> <p>But you\u2019ve seen like Napoleon Dynamite, when he\u2019s out there, when Napoleon\u2019s out there and he\u2019s doing all the work with the chickens. And then he gets paid in like, change, and he adds it all up, and he\u2019s like, \u201cMan, I made like a dollar an hour.\u201d That\u2019s kind of how I felt afterwards. For the effort I put in, man, it was just tough. It took three months of the year. A third, or I guess that\u2019s a fourth of the year.</p> <p>But again it was, it could have been, and it should have been a huge opportunity. And so you never know which ones you are going to hit and miss, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s tough sometimes to realize, you know, what do I try, what do I not try. And I had a guy the other day promote with me, like, \u201cRussell, you need to be a part of this, this is the biggest new business opportunity in the word.\u201d</p> <p>And then trying to sell me on it, and how much money people were making and on and on and on. I remember I messaged him back, and I said, \u201cYou know what? I would love to, but the answer is no.\u201d I said, you know, \u201cI\u2019ve learned over the last year that I make more money by turning away opportunities than I do by chasing opportunities. Because I\u2019ve got enough. I\u2019ve got something I\u2019m focusing on that new opportunities don\u2019t always mean more money.\u201d</p> <p>And I look back over this last year, you know, two years ago I was back in the shiny object syndrome. We had set up I think 11 or 12 different new companies. Last December, a year ago right now, we had a big publishing meeting, we had all the people who were publishing came in. And we were so excited about the next year what are we going to do, how are we going to roll all these different offers, and all these new things.</p> <p>And this year, because we had so many different offers it was hard to focus. And so, slowly throughout this year I\u2019ve basically gone back to my partners. And although we had invested $20 or $30 or $40,000 for each of these offers, in some cases, I just gave them back to the partners who walked away and just said, \u201cHey, Marry Christmas, here\u2019s a gift. I\u2019m just going to give it back to you and let you run with it. Because I\u2019ve got to focus on the stuff that\u2019s making me money.\u201d</p> <p>And it was hard. Every time I made a call to those partners, and just said, \u201cHey, sorry, I have to step away from this, but here\u2019s all the assets you made, you can just have them, it\u2019s a gift to you.\u201d Every time, like, I was sick to my stomach to do it, because I knew how much money I was losing and missing out on. And how much money I had already invested that I was not ever going to recoup.</p> <p>Every time I gave one back and I stepped away, the next morning I woke up and it was kind of like, if you have ever broken up with a girlfriend or fired an employee, you wake up the next morning and you know it was the right decision and you feel just awesome. And so I basically, over the last year, have cut some huge opportunities that I focused on. That I had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on and never became fruitful.</p> <p>We just cut them. And I looked and there\u2019s probably three or four real good opportunities that we have that we\u2019re focusing on, and that\u2019s it. And so, that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re doing. In fact, this kind of came to a head, which is why I\u2019m doing this podcast about these topics, because yesterday I cut a project that I think could have made $2 or $3 million next year.</p> <p>And I cut it, and I walked away from it, and I was scared and I was nervous and I was frustrated. And today I woke up with a huge smile on my face, just knowing that because I said no to that opportunity, I didn\u2019t lose $2 or $3 million. I think that I will be able to make $5 or $6 or $7 million more in my core companies because I lost that distraction, that thing.</p> <p>And it was a big deal, something that I had been working on for two or three months, and run a bunch of friends and partners into it. It was a deal with one of the guys from Shark Tank. And so, it could have, should have been big, and it just kept, every time I get back into it, it just kept changing and morphing and not being quite what I had initially agreed to.</p> <p>And finally, yesterday, I just kind of said, you know, I just can\u2019t do this anymore, and I told him, I told the other partners, I told everyone. And like I said, I was nervous, I was scared. But man, today I feel great. I\u2019m going in today and it\u2019s one less huge project off my plate. I can focus again on the things that I know are going to make me money. Things that I\u2019m doing every single day.</p> <p>And so, I guess my bit of wisdom I want to drop on you guys today, and before the new year starts, is really look at the opportunities you have in front of you. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re probably chasing two or three or four or five different shiny objects, if you\u2019re at all like most entrepreneurs. And the best advice I can give you is cut all except for the one that you think is the best potential of being your big home run.</p> <p>And just focus 100% of your efforts and energies, and focus on that one thing. And if you do that, you say no to opportunities, and you just focus on the one that you\u2019re already committed to. That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see the success you want this year. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll go from, you know, floundering or doing well but not doing what you want to do, to being hyper-successful, is when all your focus is on that one thing.</p> <p>And this going back to keep, every few years I have to re-remind myself of this, because I get caught up in just like all the rest of us. Tony Robbins says, over and over and over again, where focus goes, energy flows, and it\u2019s true. So, pick your one opportunity, pick the one that\u2019s going to be your winner, focus on that, and cut out all the rest. And I promise you guys, you\u2019ll wake up tomorrow feeling so much better.</p> <p>So that\u2019s it. I\u2019m at the office today. I\u2019m about to go chase after my primary opportunity. I\u2019m excited. I hope you guys are excited as well. It\u2019s going to be a great year coming up. If you enjoy this podcast, please share on Facebook, Twitter, wherever you\u2019ve got avenues. So share it with other entrepreneurs because I enjoy doing it. I think it can help all you guys all a lot as well. Thanks again, and I will talk to you guys soon.</p>", "duration": "08:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/48_-_The_Power_Of_Saying_No_To_An_Opportunity.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1387220400, "title": "Episode #47 \u2013 Are You Publishing Or Promoting?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to make the shift from a \u201cpromoting\u201d company to a \u201cpublishing\u201d company!</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson, on a cold, foggy morning, here in Boise, Idaho, and welcome to the Marketing In Your Car podcast. Hey everyone, so I have not done a podcast in a while because I\u2019ve been listening to a new course on my drives that Perry Belcher put out called The Secret Selling System. And it\u2019s amazing, so if you\u2019re looking for a course to go through on how to sell better, I would say by far it\u2019s probably the best.</p> <p>One of them, like, the top two or three courses I\u2019ve gone through in the history of my life. It\u2019s really that good. So, I highly recommend it. Anyway, so I wanted to talk what\u2019s been going on in my mind, a little bit, because we are in December now. My twins just celebrated their eighth birthday, last Wednesday. We had a huge party.</p> <p>And the year is winding down. I have about one more week with my staff, also going on vacations for Christmas, and just planning and preparing for next year. And I wanted to kind of just share with you one of the big epiphanies I had for myself. And it may be an epiphany for you as well, so I thought I would share it.</p> <p>So I talked a little bit of our couponing company that we bought about a year and a half ago, and it didn\u2019t really do too much. We kind of fixed up the site and stuff, and it was sitting there. I didn\u2019t really have the time or energy to spend on it, so I really didn\u2019t do too much to it. And it was kind of stagnant. It was only making about $300 a month.</p> <p>And that was kind of frustrating. And then, I was able to recruit Xan Spencer and Jenn Spencer. Who, if any of you guys have followed me at all you know that they are one of our huge success stories who went into the hair bone niche. Now we\u2019re making $30,000 a month, and then they sold the site. Anyway, I recruited them to come and help us on this project.</p> <p>And they came in and the very first month they came in, we went from $300 to $6000. They sent me an income report last night for December, and we are officially half way through December and they\u2019re already at $3800 and it\u2019s growing rapidly. And I think that in the near future, that site will be making $40, $50, $60,000 a month. And it\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>And what\u2019s interesting is I look at the way we\u2019re monetizing that site and it has very little to do with selling your own products. It\u2019s all about publishing. And we\u2019re publishing offers for people in the couponing niche. People who are looking for discounts and deals. And all we do is we find deals and we post them. And we\u2019re posting 10, 20, 30 deals a day on Facebook.</p> <p>And then each day we send one email that recaps all the 30 deals we found for the day. And that\u2019s kind of the business model. And it\u2019s really interesting, because that was the big change we took, was going from where we were posting once or twice a day to like 30 a day. And Xan went in, and Xan is really good researching.</p> <p>He went to all the other couponing sites in our space, and looked at how many average posts per day they have. And most of them are posting 30, 40 times a day. That\u2019s how they\u2019re making so much money. And have huge followings, obviously. So our old strategy in business is, boom, first off, build a bigger fan base, second off, publish things more often. And that really got me to start thinking about my core dot com secrets business.</p> <p>And we\u2019re really a publishing company as well, except we have our own products, but what do I publish? What do I \u2014I mean, outside of the page stuff we have, like, we are not publishing that much stuff, you know? I may make a post to Facebook once or twice a week. I may send out three or four emails a week, and that\u2019s only when we\u2019re out there publishing, like free stuff.</p> <p>And I started thinking, like, if I started treating this less like an internet marketing business where I\u2019m selling stuff, and more like a publishing company, where we\u2019re publishing things. We\u2019re publishing offers, we\u2019re publishing information, content, and looking at it from that standpoint, I realized that, you know, because of things like Facebook, we don\u2019t have to \u2014 you know, email.</p> <p>If I were to send you guys 30 emails a day you would get upset. But on Facebook, if I post 30 times a day, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Only the things that really relate to you will rise to the top, and the ones that you click on and the ones that you scroll through. And because there\u2019s so much noise, so much stuff, like, the way to win in social media, I believe, is you\u2019ve always got to be top of mind.</p> <p>If you\u2019re posting once a day, you are not top of mind, okay? You need to go from $300 a month to $6000 a month in one month, and all it was, was being top of mind. Having, every time they\u2019re looking at Facebook page, we\u2019re there. Over and over and over and over and over again, which is exactly what they want. And so, I think one of the big changes for me, this upcoming year, coming January, is I\u2019m taking some outsourcers who were doing SEO stuff before, and I don\u2019t really believe in SEO anymore.</p> <p>And we\u2019re just going to kind of let them go, but now shifting to like we\u2019re a publishing company. Let\u2019s talk about this, and so I\u2019m going to have one of our guys who full time, all he does \u2014 because Filipinos are obviously different hours than me, is while I\u2019m asleep, he can go and research my topic. Let\u2019s say, like, this week I\u2019m going to be talking about copywriting or about whatever.</p> <p>And he\u2019ll go out and find blog posts and articles and just constantly, every day, be finding me 10 or 20 or 30 new resources on that topic. And he\u2019ll be pulling in all of this aggregate information for me. Giving it to me, so I\u2019ll wake up in the morning and look at it all, and from that, I\u2019m going to block about an hour to two hours a day where I\u2019m just focused on publishing stuff.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to take these articles, I\u2019m going to turn them into blog posts, I\u2019m going to turn them into Facebook posts and, you know, cue them up so that throughout the day there\u2019s 20, 30 posts going out. All there is, just giving me awesome information about that topic that we\u2019re talking about. And I will be pushing people to the thing we\u2019re selling. So, for example, we\u2019re going to be having a visible webinar, there\u2019s topic based ones, twice a month.</p> <p>So one of them is going to be Inception secrets, which is my copywriting course. So for two weeks, I have these guys find everything they can find about copywriting and ads and all this stuff I can be posting for free. And all these things will be pushing people to our live copywriting course, will be happening. And then I\u2019ll be publishing the stuff on Facebook.</p> <p>So 20, 30 times a day, everyone who is following me, people we\u2019re advertising to, that we\u2019re targeting on Facebook, will be seeing this content we\u2019re publishing, that again, all brings back to our core topic. And if you think about it, if 30, 20, maybe 10, I don\u2019t know how many times a day we\u2019ll do it, say 10 times a day.</p> <p>There is a new cool exciting copywriting thing that we posted, all of them pushing back to our thing that we\u2019re targeting copywriters. You know, within a week\u2019s period of time we should be able to get 2 or 3 or 400 people to join us on our live class. And that\u2019s kind of my game plan, and so, I think one of the big shifts for me is that I\u2019m going to be shifting away from my promotional company, which is where I think us and most information people are.</p> <p>And switching to a publishing company where we are actually publishing content and information, and putting it out there, consistently. And making us the lead magnets so we\u2019re bringing people back to our offers. And that\u2019s kind of where my mind has been at, and I\u2019m trying to kind of organize and create that machine right now. I still have one Filipino who all he\u2019ll be doing is just finding topic ideas and interesting things for me to write about.</p> <p>And then after I make the post, then I have another Filipino who, his job then will be to promote. We\u2019ve got John and Shirley who will put everything on Facebook, but then there are so many other avenues and ways and places to go and promote that. Each blog post, each content, everything at that, and he\u2019ll be focusing on the mass distribution from that side.</p> <p>And so, that\u2019s what I\u2019m kind of doing right now. I\u2019m shifting myself away from a promotion company and turning it into a publishing company. And I think that by doing that, where we\u2019re putting out so much value and information and ideas, that I think on the other side of it it\u2019s going to have a lot of big, hug, positive impact on everything, including our SEO, which is kind of funny.</p> <p>It will be the sneaky way we do SEO. So, that\u2019s my game plan moving forward next year, you guys. I recommend, and I highly encourage all of you guys to become publishing companies as well, in whatever niche you\u2019re in. We\u2019re doing the same thing with neuropathy, we\u2019re going to do the same thing in our weight loss. All the businesses we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing the exact same thing, and you guys should be too.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the game plan, everyone. Thanks so much and have a great Christmas. Hopefully I\u2019ll do another podcast before then, but if not, we wish you Merry Christmas, and thanks, you guys, and talk soon.</p>", "duration": "08:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/47_-_Are_You_Publishing_Or_Promoting.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1386097200, "title": "Episode #46 \u2013 Teachabilty And \u201cThe Profit\u201d", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Lessons learned from the dumb entrepreneurs on the new show \u201cThe Profit\u201d.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning, everyone, this is Russell Brunson. It\u2019s an early morning, and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey guys and gals, so I hope you guys are doing awesome today. I\u2019m actually, it\u2019s 6:30 in the morning and I\u2019m driving to go work out. And this is a testament of the power of hiring a coach. It\u2019s freezing cold right now, and I would be sound asleep right now, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I have a coach waiting for me at the gym.</p> <p>It\u2019s little things like, you know, obviously, I sell coaching so I believe in it a lot. We talked about why you need a good coach. But this is kind of just, you know, for me it\u2019s such a big thing. I know how to work out, I know how to lift weights, I know how to do all these kinds of stuff, but just the fact there\u2019s someone there waiting for me is what gets me out of bed and gets me to go and do the thing that I need to do.</p> <p>So, if you don\u2019t have a coach yet, in whatever area of your life you\u2019re struggling with, go get a coach. I\u2019ve got life coaches to help me in my personal life. I\u2019ve got business coaches. I\u2019ve got weightlifting coaches. Go find a coach as quick as you can. And if you need a coach in the marketing business, go to 30DayShortcut.com, we can help you out there.</p> <p>Anyway, so today what I want to talk about is the other reason why I\u2019m really tired today, is I found out about a new show, and I\u2019ve been up all night watching episodes of it. So I think I got like four or five hours of sleep last night. So the show is called The Prophet. It\u2019s on CSNBC. And I first, I remember seeing commercials for it and I was like, I didn\u2019t really think too much about it.</p> <p>And then Daegan Smith told me, he said, \u201cHey, that show is awesome, you should watch it.\u201d And so I went to my TV and we have, like, it\u2019s not TiVo, but it\u2019s like the generic brand of TiVo, right? So we TiVo\u2019ed it on our TV, and I never watched it. And then two nights ago, I was bored and my wife had already passed out. I was sitting in bed and I didn\u2019t want to fall asleep yet, so I went to our recorded shows list and I saw that.</p> <p>I saw The Prophet in there, I\u2019m like, I might as well watch an episode. So I pushed Play, I started watching it, and I have not been the same ever since. The show is amazing. It\u2019s all about this dude who takes struggling businesses and turns them around. It shows him going to these businesses and what he does, he basically comes in and gives them money, just to get in their business, to get things fixed up.</p> <p>He has his team come in and they turn it around. He takes complete control for a week, and then he re-launches it. And if the people, if the entrepreneurs aren\u2019t morons, and do his job, he turns them around into some amazing things. The first one I watched was, he went into this, I think 100carcash.com, or something like that.</p> <p>Anyway, and he took this business that had been struggling and turned it around. And then by the time the show had aired, maybe a little afterwards, he had already, he had turned them all to a franchise and franchised it. I mean, almost 100 locations around the world. Which is amazing. So, that\u2019s kind of the power of what he does.</p> <p>And then last night I watched two other episodes, and it was crazy. So, the first thing that\u2019s interesting is I feel bad for him, and for anyone who\u2019s coming in to entrepreneurs\u2019 business. Because entrepreneurs are like the most stubborn, hard-headed people in the world. Like, this lady last night, on the popcorn episode, she\u2019s like, \u201cMy business is $2.5 million a year. I don\u2019t need anybody, blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p> <p>You know, like, this total attitude. But her business is broke, it\u2019s on the brink of bankruptcy. She\u2019s borrowed money from everyone she knows, and you know, she made $2.5 million, but she didn\u2019t make anything. Like, the business is negative. There were like almost $400,000 in cash that was gone, they couldn\u2019t find it. There\u2019s no record of it.</p> <p>Anyway, and every single episode she\u2019s like, he\u2019s butting heads with these entrepreneurs who are so stubborn, because they\u2019re so in love with their baby. And so it\u2019s one thing that kind of made me realize as an entrepreneur, I\u2019m probably the same way. We\u2019re oftentimes not as humble or teachable as we should be, because we think we know everything because it\u2019s our business.</p> <p>And it was interesting, recently I was selling something to a group of people who were kind of more of my peers. And we were selling something that\u2019s not cheap, it was $25,000 or $100,000. And I had a lot of my friends who were on the webinar where I sold it. And they, afterwards, messaged me, like, \u201cHey man, can you hook me up for free, can I have some of the thing?\u201d</p> <p>I was just like, man, you guys are not willing to invest in your business. You\u2019re so hard-headed, you think you know everything, you\u2019re not willing to invest. And it just blew my mind, and entrepreneurs, I think, a lot of times are that way. So that was the first thing I wanted to kind of just put out there, is that all of us, as entrepreneurs, we need to not be so hard-headed.</p> <p>I was listening to a course from Kevin Trudeau, who is not doing too well in the news right now. But in there he talked about a concept called the Teachability Index. He talked about how people are more teachable during \u2014 like when you\u2019re a kid and you go to school, etc, you\u2019re super teachable. You\u2019re soaking up everything that\u2019s coming in.</p> <p>But somewhere along the line, usually about time you graduate college, you think you know everything and your teachability index drops to almost nothing because you know, you\u2019re just kind of set in your ways. You know everything there is. And I think entrepreneurs are the same way. When we begin, we\u2019re like sponges and we\u2019re soaking up everything.</p> <p>But somewhere along the line we think we know everything and our teachability index goes to almost nothing, and we are stuck in our ways. I think all of us, as entrepreneurs, could really benefit a lot from stepping back. And try to become more teachable and kind of forgetting, you know, forgetting you know everything. And trying to start over and find good coaches, good mentors, good books, good courses. Whatever you can to help increase your business and becoming teachable again.</p> <p>So, anyway, I had a lot of other cool stuff I wanted to talk about today, but I am at the gym and my session starts in two minutes, so I am going to jump in there. Just kind of one last thing I want to mention about The Prophet before I go. First off, go watch it, guys. Go find it, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s on Hulu or whatever, but go and find it and watch it.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably one of the best entrepreneur shows I\u2019ve ever seen. And second off, two of the three episodes I\u2019ve seen so far, the entrepreneurs screwed him in the end. Just totally unethical and just didn\u2019t hold up their bargain, their word. And it\u2019s just sad to me to see how quick they\u2019re willing to just, how low people\u2019s integrity is.</p> <p>I mean, it\u2019s especially interesting just the fact that they were live on TV. They were live on TV and still doing this, makes me always wonder. So, make sure you have integrity in your business. People will know if you have it or don\u2019t have it, and people \u2014 I mean, just be a good person, that\u2019s all I can say. Have integrity, do what you say you\u2019re going to do.</p> <p>And if you screw up, then tell people you\u2019re sorry and kind of go from there. So, that\u2019s it for today, you guys. Hope you have an awesome day. Go work out, if you haven\u2019t yet. It\u2019s good for your body, it\u2019s good for your mind. And go get a coach to help keep you accountable and help you doing what you need to do. Thanks, everyone, and I will talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "07:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/46_-_Teachabilty_And_The_Profit.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1385406000, "title": "Episode #45 \u2013 Lessons In Starting Over\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>After our latest startup, I realized that almost everything people are teaching online about startups online are DEAD wrong.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone.

I am actually taking my wife\u2019s car on a 25 minute drive to go get some stuff fixed. I have nothing else to do so you guys get to be entertained. I hope that\u2019s alright. I am excited for this podcast. I have been thinking a lot. I have known for a little while, Stu McClaren, one of my favorite people on Earth, called me out yesterday, and said, \u201cDude, when are you going to do another podcast?\u201d I just wanted to do this one. This one may be a little longer since I have a little more of a drive.</p> <p>I just wanted to talk to everybody at a different level than normal. Normally I am trying to share different tips and tricks and techniques to take whatever you are doing and make it a little better and make you start thinking different ways. I wanted to talk about what has been happening with some of my businesses over the last little bit. It is interesting. There are so many people that are teaching internet marketing. There\u2019s very few people that I really trust anymore. The biggest reason is because, and I outgrew myself in this same category, a lot of times we assume that whatever worked for us, is what is going to work for everyone.</p> <p>I\u2019ve built my internet marketing business. We have launched product after product and I know a good formula that works. I know that market really well. Over the last year or so, we have been putting out all these different products and different niches. Every time it surprises me how much new stuff I have to learn to make each of those businesses actually work. It is frustrating for me because I know all this stuff. I should be able to make it work right away.</p> <p>It always takes time. It takes more time than I ever think. I\u2019ve definitely changed the way that I think about business, and the way I teach business because of that. I understand that it\u2019s not all cookie cutter. It\u2019s not 100%. There\u2019s a lot\u00a0 you have to do, to figure out different markets. We are in the couponing niche. We have been doing well with it. Recently I brought on some of our friends. Initially they were students. They become really good friends. You guys probably heard of them if you have been following me for any amount of me, Xan and Jen Spencer.</p> <p>We have this couponing site, and I didn\u2019t have time to focus on it. I love the concept and the idea behind it. They just sold their hair bow site and made a ton of money selling it. They are looking for their next project. We brought them in to come work with us on this one. It has been\u00a0 interesting watching what they have been doing and how they are getting into the market and understanding what it is, and really trying to figure out that path and what we can do to make it successful.</p> <p>Holy crap. Sorry guys. You are getting this live. I am at an intersection, and the light is red and I am stuck in the middle. Holy cow. That was embarrassing. Let me pause this for one second.</p> <p>That disaster was averted. I was at a green light, and I was turning left and I was half way in the intersection turning left and all of a sudden all the cars stopped. I looked up and we were all stopped turning left. The street we were turning left onto was completely backed up probably about a mile and a half. Then, the light turned red and I was stuck in the middle of the intersection with two cars in front of me in the middle of the intersection and a car behind me in the middle of the intersection.</p> <p>I am back, and I am alive. Things are good. I was talking about how different it is. Same with our supplement. We have been doing really well with our supplement. Almost a year now. It is doing well. It is exciting. It inspires me just how we put out a little business like that, and by traffic and it works. It just keeps working and working. Because of that we decided to put a lot more energy and effort into it. We actually spent time to write a really good sales video.</p> <p>We are going back now and diving back into that business, which is a whole different market. It\u2019s interesting to me to start looking at. Obviously I could talk a lot about the differences in the market. That\u2019s not the point. The point is that there are differences. Used to be back in the day you could find a niche, put up a product, drive some traffic and make some money. I think those days are a lot different now. You have to understand there is a culture.</p> <p>There\u2019s stuff that is happening, and these markets. It\u2019s important to find those things. What I want to talk about today is more like the path that I am seeing a lot of commonalities among all the niches that we\u2019re in, and a lot of what I am going to be shifting dotcomsecrets over to in the new year. I wanted to throw some of this out to get you guys thinking and you can get some ideas for your business as well. We used to always think that we lead with a product, create a good product, drive some traffic and that\u2019s how you lead.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the smartest way to lead anymore. I look at that with our weight loss offer. That is what we did. The problem was that we didn\u2019t know the market well enough. We created what we thought was the best offer possible. We launched it and it didn\u2019t do well. We are going back and doing the stuff we should have done first to really understand the market. I think we will do well this time around.</p> <p>We could have saved almost a year worth of time had we gone this direction the first time. If I, and any business I am in, or getting in like dotcomsecrets, like the relaunch for the entire brand and company and really starting from the beginning where the goal is how much value can you provide. I think that the smartest way to begin in any niche, this is even ecommerce. I am not just talking infoproducts, but anything, is start with value can you give people.</p> <p>The simplest way to do that is blogging. Set up a blog and start sharing really cool stuff. That\u2019s the first step. After your blog is set up I think you should start up a fan page. I have been fighting social media forever, but one of the other episodes you saw, you see I am starting to see the value of it. You can set up ads for five or ten dollars a day. It will add people to your page. Just set that up and let it run and get people adding to your fan page and watch this community grow from two people to 10 to 50 to 100 to 500 to1,000.</p> <p>Consistently be doing that. When you are blogging, after you blog, the biggest thing you have to do is how do I promote this blog post now? There\u2019s a lot of things you can do to promote it, but the best I think is Facebook. As soon as you make a post, you go to your fan page and boost that post and push it out there. You spend maybe five or ten dollars doing that.</p> <p>The next day you make another blog post. You go to Facebook and post it and boost it. Just following that pattern. At first it will be super slow and aggravating and you probably won\u2019t get a lot of traction from it. You will have the ads on there, and people are being added and just consistent. Months from now, three months from now, six months from now you are going to have five, six, ten, fifteen thousand people and it will start growing very quickly from there.</p> <p>It is all about putting this value out first. Then, you start seeing what people are responding to. A little while ago I was watching a video that Jeff Walker put out there. I don\u2019t typically watch Jeff\u2019s stuff. I like him as a person, but I not particularly interested in product launches. The last thing I want to do is a product launch. I don\u2019t look at that anymore. I was watching one of his videos, and one thing he said that really struck out to me, he was talking about how he said that the biggest thing for him is when he first got the publishing thing. He said, \u201cI recommend all you guys just go publish something.\u201d Put stuff out there. It wasn\u2019t until I put stuff out there that I saw what people responded to.</p> <p>What things do people like? What things do they share? What things do they talk about? What things do they not care about? What things cause no emotional response what so ever? For example, we know that on our couponing site the last two weeks, we have been posting the model in that market is different. It is how many offers can you get in front of people. We are posting tons over and over, 20, 30 offers a day.</p> <p>Supposed to put those out there. Some of those get nothing. Other ones get some shares, some get tons of shares. This week had something interesting where Jessica posted on her blog this picture of these homemade dryer sheets that she makes. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t put it on our Facebook page. We put it on our blog. Somebody came to our blog and saw it. The took the picture, they posted on their Facebook page and luckily they linked back to her site saying, \u201cCheck out this picture I found on livingonacoupon.com.\u201d They posted it out there. Within four days that image had been shared 350,000 times.</p> <p>Not liked, shared. 350,000 times. We found out about it from one of her friends. She said, \u201cLook at this sharing your picture.\u201d She saw it, and we missed it. We went back and over that two day period of time, the 350,000 shares, we had 50,000 people that came to our blog per day. Our revenue was over $400 each day, which is awesome.</p> <p>We found out that was what something responded to. They wanted homemade stuff, like how to make homemade dryer sheets. I never would have launched a course on how to make homemade dryer sheets. Now we know that people are interested in that market and that type of a thing. Instantly now we know.</p> <p>That is the thing Jeff was talking about. You need to start publishing something. Until you do, you have no idea what people are going to respond to. If you want to start leading with your sales message first then you spend so much time and energy before you know what people actually want, what they are listening to. I would start with that. Making cool blog posts, put it on Facebook page, boost them. Rinse and repeat over and over again. Have something in place where your fan base is growing, growing through paid ads. You are talking five bucks a day, ten bucks a day maybe to implement that strategy. That\u2019s the first step. You are putting this stuff out there. Again, there are a lot of other things you can do to promote your blog posts.</p> <p>For simplicity sake that is where I would start at.</p> <p>The second thing I would do, and it makes me laugh. This is my belief now. Six years ago podcasts were brought to my attention, maybe even seven or eight years ago, and I thought they were the dorkiest, nerdiest things in the world and they would never catch on, kind of like RSS feeds, and I was right.</p> <p>Podcasts I was wrong. They are the thing right now. I keep hearing it. It\u2019s funny because I used to be a faster adapter of things. Now I am more stubborn. I am an old man now. I am a little more stubborn in adapting things. I didn\u2019t want to adapt this for a long time. Recently, one of my friends had a podcast that he wanted me to listen to. I downloaded the podcast app, and I downloaded the podcast and started listening to it, and I got hooked. I suddenly realized that podcasts are the radio of the future.</p> <p>You can subscribe to the people\u2019s stuff that you want, and you have a chance to listen to it. One of my friends, Stu, I mentioned him earlier. He was telling me one of his clients who works for him said that each podcast listener is worth more to them than an email subscriber, which is crazy to me, but instead of fighting that, let\u2019s go with it, right? Who knows how long email is going to keep working efficiently.</p> <p>Let\u2019s have distribution channels\u2026as many as we can. I started thinking more about that. This is a distribution channel, these podcasts. I remember about two years ago I had a guy that wanted to interview me for a radio show. We went down to the radio station, and it was the coolest thing in the world. I felt like Frasier Crane. I had a big microphone. He had a producer. I asked the producer if I could call her Roz. She said no.</p> <p>I felt like Frasier Crane. After I did that, I wanted my own radio show. That was my entire goal for the next 6 months was my own radio show. If I do a radio show locally and it goes good then we could try to pitch it and get syndicated nationally. I had this whole strategy. You got a big, famous radio show. You can sell ads, you can make money, you can push your products, books and make a fortune. For years I kept thinking about that and wanting to do it. After I got the podcast thing, I was like, \u201cThis is the radio of the future.\u201d Radio will be dead soon if it\u2019s not already. I don\u2019t listen to radio. I hook up my podcasts that I want, and I am driving and I listen to them. I think again, that\u2019s the direction that we are all going. I have been studying a lot. I am going to keep doing the Marketing in Your Car Podcast because I love it, and it\u2019s fun. It is low maintenance for me to fulfill on. I am going to keep doing that. I am also going to launch another podcast underneath the dotcomsecrets brand.</p> <p>It is more of an actual radio show where I have people that I interview and I am sharing things. I have to do my first interview for my first one this coming Tuesday. Mark Joiner is my first mentor and Mark is going to come on and be my first guest so I am kind of excited for that. Because I have been setting podcasts to what people are doing and it\u2019s really intriguing. I was listening to the guy who runs the entrepreneur on fire podcast.</p> <p>He basically interviews an entrepreneur every single day, seven days a week. He was sharing some of his stats, and what I didn\u2019t get it until he went to this. He said, \u201cI ran the show for free for a long time and got a big following.\u201d Now he gets 10 or 20 or 30 thousand downloads each episode. You basically get paid on CPM so every download, every 1,000 downloads, you make whatever. Ten bucks or thirty bucks. Showing the math, each of my episodes, I have three sponsors. This guy, this guy and this guy. He is paying this. He is paying this.</p> <p>That means, every single day that I do my podcast, because I know I\u2019ll get 20,000 downloads because people are subscribed to it and they are waiting for it, because of that, every single day just to do my podcast, I make $1,200 in advertising revenue, $1,200 just by the fact that he is podcasting. I was doing the math, and $1,200 a day times 30 days, I can\u2019t do right now in my head, but $1,000 a day times 30 days is 30 grand a month, 30 grand a month, and all he is doing is interviewing awesome people.</p> <p>He launched this less than a year ago. Okay? Start thinking the blog obviously is a great platform. The blog is a great platform to get people who are on Facebook and reading and those types of things, but there is also this huge, untapped market of podcasting. You get these people to download and you are sharing content and ideas. You are building a following and you have your own radio show. People actually pay to sponsor the radio show when you get a following.</p> <p>You start just like we talked about before. You start out by giving content, putting stuff out there and seeing what things people attach to. What concepts, what ideas you share, what things get other people interested. Only way to know that is to publish stuff. Put it out there like Jeff Walker was saying, seeing what gets people to respond.</p> <p>That\u2019s the first step, and trying to build your audience like that. I think any market I get in the future, that will be my first two steps before we ever create an offer and see if we can get enough of an audience based on that, then we can go and start getting sponsors for our podcasts and promote products as an affiliate on our blog and get sponsors for our blog.</p> <p>You know over the last three, six, nine months, what people have been responding to, what things they are interested in, what things get shared, what things get passed around. You find out what doesn\u2019t. As soon as you know that, now you can go back and create the right offer. The offer than people actually want. The thing they want to give you money for. I think that\u2019s the right way to make a business. That\u2019s the right way to start a business. Again, because every market is different, you won\u2019t know what that is until you are in there.</p> <p>You see the responses. The flip is people will love you because you are giving your best stuff every single day and when you come back and decide to monetize it, there\u2019s different relationship level there. They are going to trust you over someone else because they have been listening to, they have been reading you or seeing you on Facebook. You have established yourself as someone who is credible and cares and someone who is trying to provide value in the world.</p> <p>That is what I have for you guys today. I hope that gives you some things to think about. Those are things that I have been thinking about a lot. We are relaunching dotcomsecrets. The podcast, we are also launching, a new blog. A new blog you guys will be shocked. My goal is every blog post is for every post to be more valuable than a $97 product. We are going to change some stuff. It will be good.</p> <p>That is our game plan. I am at the car dealership. I am getting my wife\u2019s car fixed. I have to jump off. I hope you enjoy this podcast. If you like it, please come and comment, but also please share it. If you like it, go on your Facebook account and check out Russell\u2019s latest podcast. It was awesome. I would appreciate getting it in the hands of more people. That\u2019s about all I ask for. Appreciate you guys. Thanks everyone who is listening and paying attention. Good luck with your business and we will talk to you guys all soon.</p>", "duration": "19:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/45_-_Lessons_In_Starting_Over.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1384455600, "title": "Episode #44 \u2013 Shifting All Things Into One", "author": "", "summary": "<p>An idea that sparked when I heard Tim Ferris speak in New York has dramatically changed the structure of our business.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hello everybody who is listening to our podcast today. This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to the marketing in your car podcast.</p> <p>I am having the most fun week I think I have had in a long time with business. Awesome stuff is happening. We just signed a deal Kevin Harrington and Click Bank and Traffic and Conversion summit that was amazing. A bunch of cool stuff is happening. Our living on a coupon site, we relaunched it using a bunch of social media, and we have gone from\u2026it has gone from\u2026it was making about $10 a day to now, $200 a day in two weeks period of time.</p> <p>It is scaling rapidly, which is fun. Tons of fun stuff is happening. I want to talk about one little thing that I have been doing that we are doing right now that I think is, it is probably one of the smallest, yet the biggest breakthroughs I have had in a long time. Some of you probably remember I signed up for Joe Polish\u2019s, 25k group. I didn\u2019t join the group. I just went to the $10,000 thing out in New York. My wife and I went out there.</p> <p>I had a couple of podcasts when I was out there. When I was out there, one of the speakers was Tim Ferris. One thing that Time Ferris said that has been resonating in my brain for the last couple months since then was someone asked him, \u201cShould I be on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube? Where should I be at?\u201d He said, you need to pick one. Pick one that is going to be your home. That is going to be your desired way to share stuff with your audience. Forget about the rest. People try to do things on 30 platforms, but they are never successful. Pick one that is going to be your thing that you know you can go to and focus on and go to over and over again.</p> <p>If you do that then you are going to be successful. Again, that\u2019s just a little thing that makes a lot of sense, but I have been thinking about it. I have been looking at my own business, and my business is all over the place. Some of you guys probably know. I hate going into Facebook, yet I have eight Facebook groups. I have a Facebook group for our local group, for dotcomsecretsx, for Russell Brunson fans, things like that.</p> <p>I think we have five or six different continuity programs that are all separate. We have multiple blogs. All of this stuff out there. It\u2019s confusing for me because of that, I never, I get overwhelmed logging into Facebook because I had 12 groups I needed to look in and check and communicate with.</p> <p>Because of that I don\u2019t log in and talk to anybody. I have a blog except I never blog because I know that I should blog. Twitter and tweet, and I never do anything. Because of that, because there are so many thing to do, I just don\u2019t do any of them. I started thinking, I need to centralize everything and make everything simpler and easier for me and for our customers. That way they have a very clear path. Because of that we have been shifting a lot of things.</p> <p>We decided what social media platform we are going to focus on. We are taking all of our eight or 10 or how many groups we have, we are deleting them all and create one group. It is going to be like the dotcomsecrets group. We are going to push everybody to that. As far as all of our products, we are merging multiple continuity programs into one.</p> <p>If you join one, you get access to all of them that way people aren\u2019t like, \u201cShould I join this one or this one?\u201d I don\u2019t want to make my customer confused and feel like they have to sign up for multiple things. I want everything into one, singular focus. We have been doing that. From that idea we decided instead of right now we have tons of products all over the place. What if we created one customer center?</p> <p>Somebody bought something and logged into any of our sites, and it takes you to this one, centralized customer center that has all of our products that they purchased. They can see, click on it and boom, get the information. Again, we had this idea and it seems so simple now. I am like, why didn\u2019t we think of this years ago. It is brilliant.</p> <p>People come in and see all the products they have access to and also the ones they don\u2019t have access to. Click on them and buy them right there inside of our customer center. We already have the credit card on file, yes I want this product, and boom we ding their card and it unlocks it for them.</p> <p>These are some of things we are doing all from that one little idea of communicating it to one platform. How can we shift all these things and move them into one platform? It\u2019s been a fun process. Anyway, you guys will start seeing this come out soon.</p> <p>We are probably two or three away from having the customer center done. We also have merged the customer affiliate center together. Those two accounts are basically one account. You log in, and you have your customer stuff and you have your affiliate stuff all tied there together.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty fun and pretty exciting. I am excited for it. For you guys, think about for your business. Same kind of thing. What platform are you going to publish on? Just pick one. Is it going to be your blog? Facebook? I think blog and Facebook you can tie those two together because I look at Facebook more as like a way to amplify a blog, but what \u2018s your home base? Some people, Facebook is their home base. Some people it is YouTube. They post videos all day. They use Facebook to promote it.</p> <p>Where is your home place that you are publishing stuff all the time so people can find it, see it. They know if they are on here for Russell it is all right here. Same thing for you. Where are you going to publish at? If you looked by our products where can they find them at? Are they consolidated in one spot where they can find them easily? Can they upgrade and buy other things very quickly? That\u2019s what we are doing. I am excited. It is going to be fun to see this whole thing roll out.</p> <p>Before the end of the year you guys will see a new blog, new customer center, new affiliate center, a whole new strategy, a consolidation of our continuity programs into one continuity program, which we are lowering the price on.</p> <p>I think it is crazy, but I think it is going to be really good too. I am excited. Hope you guys are excited about your business as well. If you are not excited then listen to these podcasts again and get refired up and reenergized. One of the times I was not excited was when I was not learning and growing. Get back into learning mode, the education mode. Learn some stuff. Get excited. Go apply it, and have fun with your businesses you guys.</p> <p>I am at the office now. I am going to get some work done, get this stuff all consolidated so soon I will have a cool blog that you can actually read all the stuff I have to share with you guys. Thanks you guys, and I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/44_-_Shifting_All_Things_Into_One.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1384282800, "title": "Episode #43 \u2013 The Rebirth of the Sales Letter", "author": "", "summary": "<p>As we transition from a YouTube generation to a Pinterest generation, this new type of sales letter is going to win.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning. This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to Marketing In Your Car. Hey guys and gals and anyone who is out there in podcast land and listening today. I am excited today because today I am going to be working on our supplement. A lot of you guys know if you have been listening to this or following me, we have a supplement. I have been wanting to do a supplement for 10 years now, and finally about a year ago we put one together and launched it and it\u2019s been great. We are having a ton of fun with it.</p> <p>We have been testing a lot of different things. Initially what we started doing with it, we started with a free plus shipping type thing where they would get the first bottle for free. We would charge them shipping, and after 14 days we would start billing their card and ship them out a new supplement, which has been working good.</p> <p>We are at point now where our recurring is around $50,000 a month from it. Not too bad for a little side project. Right? We should do half a million bucks or so this year from that supplement. So that is kind of cool. I want to grow it big. I have been people who got supplements who are doing half a million dollars a month or more.</p> <p>I am on this eternal mission to figure out how in the world do I scale it. I think it is how it goes. The weight is really hard to scale immediately. We are spending $80 or so to get a free customer. In some cases we are able to break even by day 14, which is awesome. Sometimes it takes to day 45 or beyond to break even. I don\u2019t know about you, but I have a risk. I am pretty into taking risks and stuff, but I am risk intolerant with my money.</p> <p>Day 45, if we haven\u2019t broke even by that point it kind of scares me. How do we create something where we can break even at day one or make a profit at day one and go from there? That has been the mission that we have trying to look at. We are looking at all the other people that are doing really well with supplements right now.</p> <p>Ed O\u2019Keefe has a really good supplement that I take now. I bought it to go through the sales process, and I am actually addicted to it. There are bunch of really good supplements as well. I have been watching their funnels. What has been interesting is that most of the guys that killing it right now aren\u2019t doing free plus shipping type things anymore. They are selling one, three or four bottles off their order page and upsales for other things.</p> <p>We are working on that. What I really want to talk about today is an interesting thing that I have been looking at. The shift from the sales video back to the sales letter. For the last two year, sales videos have been the thing that has been crushing it. I don\u2019t think it is going to go away at all, but it is interesting. For a while it felt like the market was in this YouTube generation where everyone is watching videos.</p> <p>Over the last year or so it seemed like it shifted more to the Pinterest generation where we are looking at images and text, if that makes sense. For example, if you post a video on YouTube or you post an image on YouTube, traditionally you are going to get way more comments, shares, likes, things like that from an image than you ever would from a video.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that interesting? Where forever it was video, video, video. With our supplement we created a sales video version and sales letter version. The sales letter, we also did it a lot different than we normally do. We are trying to test some things that go against what I have always believed as the norms. I am testing to see if maybe I am wrong. If I am wrong, that is cool.</p> <p>I would rather be wrong and rich than right and broke. We are testing this out, and I have been looking at, if you guys know Miconi, he owns Mind Valley, and if you look at them, they are crushing it right now in the personal development space. If you look at the way they design their websites and sales letters, they are very different. They are not a traditional sales letter, or even the sales letter way that I have done them and I have taught them where you are starting with a star story and a solution and you are going through this process.</p> <p>They are more like these blocks of stuff. That\u2019s the best way to explain it. If you look at one of Mind Valley\u2019s sales letters, go to MindValley.com, and look at their sales letters, he sells theirs 10 or 12 blocks. Each block is its own little message. People can scan it. It almost looks like infographics. You scan it and see the things. Each block has a topic. They have bullet points. They have pictures and the next block and the next block and the next block. There is not a logical story progression throughout. It is just like we are talking about the benefits. This block we are talking about the guarantee. This block we are talking about what other people have said about it. This is the ingredient block and stuff like that. We design this sales letter to go that way.</p> <p>We are going to be doing tons of testing and video versus sales letter versus video with sales letter versus tons of different things we are going to try out. It is really interesting to me right now that I feel like, I look at different markets. If you look at the warriors for example, all of the offers that are in there, none of them are video, very few of them are video.</p> <p>The majority are all text. I am wondering if we are going to start transitioning back to a spot where people prefer more text based sales letter so they can scan more. They can get their information. If so, I am curious and I am interested to see if it will change the way the sales letters are built because the old school, traditional sales letter is a long story.</p> <p>You can\u2019t just scan because you are going to miss the point of the story. Whereas the way that Mind Valley is doing theirs and the way\u00a0 we are doing this one, is it very scannable. Each block is independent of itself. If you are looking at that chunk, that block whatever you want to call it. It has one message. Each block has its own core message.</p> <p>Anyway, it is just very interesting. I am excited to test this and see what is happening. I definitely think that we are transitioning away from the YouTube generation and transitioning towards the Pinterest image, text generation. Beware of that in your marketing. Look at how else can you add more text elements. At least, if you don\u2019t have, you don\u2019t want to make text sales letters, at least have an option that has a text version of your sales video.</p> <p>I think people are getting now where they don\u2019t want to watch videos as much. It was intriguing for years, but now it\u2019s like, \u201cOh crap. A video.\u201d Whereas you have text, they can scan, they can find what they want. It is interesting. I don\u2019t know if I am right or wrong, but I am predicting the rebirth of the sales letter. The rebirth will be much different from the old sales letter. I don\u2019t think it is going to be story based. I think it is going to be block based.</p> <p>That is what I have for today. I am at the office. I am going to go play with my new sales letter. The smackdown will begin. Video versus sales letter. Maybe it will be a combination of both that wins. I don\u2019t know, but we are going to find out. We are going to put it to the test because I want to see where people minds are at right now. It will be interesting. I am here at the laboratory. I am going to step in, and I will report my results back to you guys in the next week or two or three when we get some testing done, drive some traffic and see what people are responding best to.</p> <p>Thanks so much everybody, and we will talk to you all again soon.</p>", "duration": "08:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/43_-_The_Rebirth_Of_The_Sales_Letter.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1383937200, "title": "Episode #42 \u2013 Pleasure vs. Pain", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to finally get past your sticking points and finish your projects once and for all.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell, and I am actually driving to the office, and I wanted to do a really quick Marketing in Your Car Podcast so here we are.</p> <p>Today\u2019s podcast is because, this is something probably a lot of us deal with. I just dealt with it, and it was very painful and it is over now. I want to talk about it because it will make some of you guys get some crap done that you have been waiting on doing forever.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been working on a relaunch of our dotcomsecretsx site for probably three or four months now. It has gone way too long. The biggest reason why is because instead of things that everyone is waiting on me to get done. It is stuff I really, really, really hate doing. I realize I associate so much pain with this one piece of the process that I just avoid it at all costs.</p> <p>No matter what is happening I block out time. I will come in super early in the morning, a million different things that I try to do to get it done, and I can\u2019t figure out ways to not do it. I have so much pain associated with it that I don\u2019t get it done. I think, and I bet that a lot of you guys are probably the same way. There\u2019s things in your marketing journey or your entrepreneur journey that you know that you have to do, but there\u2019s one or two things that you associate so much pain with that you never do it.</p> <p>Probably the biggest one that I have seen people do, and it blows my mind. Honestly, it has been good for me and my business, but it\u2019s not so good for you and your business. A lot of people are willing to spend money on training, information programs and seminars and things like that where they are learning, they feel like they are getting value. They are scared to death. They have so much pain associated with spending money in advertising. What if the ad doesn\u2019t work?</p> <p>What if whatever we click on, nobody buys? There is so much pain they never do it. We just finished a group of coaching students. One of the students came back and was like, \u201cHow come I haven\u2019t made any money yet?\u201d I asked if he finished anything, and he asked why he wasn\u2019t making money. The last step was I showed you how to buy ads, and I asked if he bought any ads yet. He said no. That\u2019s the reason you aren\u2019t making money yet. It is up to you at this point.</p> <p>I think about the things in my life that cause me pain that I avoid them at all costs even if they are things that I need to do to be happy or more successful, whatever it might be. I have been trying to isolate those things, write them out. Look at what they are and why my\u00a0 brain subconsciously creates so much pain associated with them. Then, I start thinking about, I learned this originally from Tony Robbins and since then I study it through NLP and a bunch of other things, was just the concept of pleasure versus pain.</p> <p>Our brains will always either move away from pain or towards pleasure, towards pleasure, away from pain. When we have a task like that, that is holding us up, the problem is that our brain sees that as pain. It moves away from pain and towards pleasure, tries to find what I can do? I can go to Facebook. I can find pleasure there. I can go eat. I can find pleasure. I can go talk to my friends. I can find pleasure there.</p> <p>Our brain tries to shift us to pleasure as fast as they can because it doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with pain. For me, I realize forever this has been looming. What I tried to do, and it worked effectively, because I just finished my big painful task that I have been dreading for six weeks now. Six weeks I have been delaying this task that took me 20 minutes to do because I associated so much pain with it.</p> <p>What I had to do, is I had to go find out, I had to create something that had so much pleasure, so much more exciting that my brain was like, \u201cI want that. I want that more than I am scared of the pain.\u201d I created this thing that I wanted. I am not going to tell you what it is because it stupid and childish, but it\u2019s a pleasure thing for me. It was something that I actually wanted. I created that thing, and I said, \u201cYou cannot have that until this task is done.\u201d</p> <p>It made that pleasure so big and so exciting and so big that the pain of that task just got smaller and smaller and smaller, and I finished it. I just did it you guys. I am excited. I just want to throw that out there for you guys because I am sure that you have, each of us, all of us. I have this in a lot of other areas of my life, and I am sure you guys do too. You have this thing that is causing you so much pain, and you are avoiding it like the plague, even though it is the thing you need to do to get to the real pleasure, the true pleasure, the real happiness.</p> <p>What I want you guys to do is think about that and figure out how can I create something so pleasurable and so great as a reward for myself that I will go through anything to get it. Think about wrestling. I used to go three, four days in a row without eating any food, two days without drinking any water, going through this horrible, physical pain. I would do this while I wearing plastic suits in wrestling, trying to lose 20 pounds in a three day period of time. I would do that every single week for 10 years.</p> <p>Why would I do that? I had so much pleasure in winning a wrestling match. That pleasure, that high whatever you want to call it, was so big, I was willing to sacrifice food and water and social life and everything. Everything I had just because I wanted my hand raised after a match. That\u2019s how much pleasure that created for me.</p> <p>If you can start doing that in your life and look at and find those pain points that are keeping you from what you want to and create pleasure to help burst you through it, I promise you guys will see a ton of success, just like I just did. I feel great right now. Now, I am at the gym and I am excited. That is it for today. I am at the gym, and I am going to go work out. All you guys find out what your sticking points are and smash through them this weekend and have some fun. Thanks everybody. I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "06:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/42_-_Pleasure_Vs._Pain.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1383850800, "title": "Episode #41 \u2013 Raspberries On The Box", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How a tiny shift in your packaging can dramatically increase your sales.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everybody! It is rainy here in Boise today. This is the Marketing in Your Car, Podcast. Alright, so my wife had a really cool experience that has some definite marketing benefits, so I want to talk to you guys today. A couple years ago I was at the Tony Robbins event, and he talked about the evils of cow milk. Not really, but he did talk about how he isn\u2019t a really big believer in cow milk, and gave some good compelling arguments why.</p> <p>I am not saying he is right or wrong, but we decided at that point to try and wean off of milk. We shifted from milk. We initially tried soy milk which was nasty. Then, we tried the rice milk. Then, we fell in love with almond milk. We have been drinking almond milk probably two and a half, three years or so. Took us a little while to get our kids weaned off regular milk. Finally got it. Tried different brands, and finally my kids and my wife and everyone settled in on this one brand, which I think is Blue something.</p> <p>Anyway, so yesterday my wife went shopping at the grocery store. When she\u2019s there, she walks in and there\u2019s these three dudes in big suits, like tall guys in suits. My wife is shorter anyway. These guys are walking around, and she is going around shopping. She gets back to the milk section, and she is going to buy some almond milk. These three guys are standing right in front of the milk and staring at the milk.</p> <p>She\u2019s like, how am I going to get in there? She said excuse me, excuse me and squeezes through the guys and goes in and opens it up, and grabs four or five of these big cartons of almond milk, and puts them in her cart. The guys turn around and says, \u201cExcuse me m\u2019am. Do you mind if we ask you a question?\u201d She says, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHow come you bought the Blue Diamond brand as opposed to Silk?\u201d She picks up the Blue Diamond brand, and she shows the picture on the outside and says, \u201cThere\u2019s raspberries on the picture on the front of this box.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She said, \u201cWe tried to buy Silk, but my kids wouldn\u2019t drink it because there\u2019s no raspberries on the box. This one has raspberries, and they thought it looked good, so that\u2019s the one that they will drink.\u201d</p> <p>The guy said, \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s the reason you bought that over the other one?\u201d She said, \u201cYeah. The only reason why is because it has raspberries on the box.\u201d The guy says, \u201cIt\u2019s a dollar cheaper than Silk.\u201d She said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll pay a dollar more for it. It is the fact it has raspberries on the box.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cWhatever. I don\u2019t believe you. How about this? I will pay you a dollar for each bottle of Silk you buy or each box of Silk milk you buy right now.\u201d She said, \u201cIf I was to do that I would be out 10 bucks because my kids wouldn\u2019t drink this milk, and it would sit in my fridge and go bad.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cThat\u2019s so interesting. We are actually representatives of Silk. We work for Silk, and we are here just trying to figure how to increase sales and placement, and stuff like that. That\u2019s just very interesting. That\u2019s the reason why. It wasn\u2019t because it was cheaper. It was because the picture on the box had raspberries on it.\u201d</p> <p>I just wanted you guys to think about that, the power of perception. Isn\u2019t it strange that my wife, we buy four or five boxes of almond milk a week, probably spend three or four grand a year on this almond milk. We buy one brand over the other is not because of the cost. It is because of the packaging, what it looks like on the outside. It is just really interesting.</p> <p>I have seen people who have products who just change the cover of the product, and they see sales change. For example, Matt Furey. He created a product. It was actually the very first product I bought of his. It was called the Martial Art of Wrestling. I bought it, and it was this glossy book, and it looked really nice and exciting. I read it, and loved it and everything.</p> <p>Five years later when I found out what he was doing, and I was learning about internet marketing and all this stuff I went\u00a0 listened to an interview. He was talking about his first product failure. He said it was this book he created called The Martial Art of Wrestling. He was like, \u201cI spent all this money. It was nice and glossy. It was great, and nobody bought it. I had a huge bedroom filled with thousands of these books that nobody bought.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out I was the only person that actually bought it. Anyway, he was like, \u201cLater on, I knew the content was amazing. Anyone who did read it, loved it. My next run of it, before the other one ever ran out, I decided to change the packaging, and made it more secretive and underground, and less like a book.</p> <p>I made the cover black and white, non-glossy. Just paper. Instead of the Martial Art of Wrestling book, The Martial Art of Wrestling. Just made it more secretive and underground, just tweak the packaging dramatically increased sales.</p> <p>If you have a product you are selling, and it\u2019s not doing well maybe you just have to put some raspberries on the outside of the box. Maybe it\u2019s not so much the product or the marketing or the sales funnel. Maybe it\u2019s just you have to wrap it a little different, and make it so it\u2019s a little more appealing to people.</p> <p>I spend a lot of time in our businesses, I try to figure out the right hook and the right angle and the right thing. That stuff is very important. I can start working with somebody, and they have a product or business and they are struggling. We come in and not touch anything, just tweak their angle and hook a little bit and blow it up overnight. It is important. Think about that. Think about the raspberries on the outside of your box, what you can tweak and change to make it more appealing to your customers. That is it for the day. I am at the office. I am a little nervous to get out of the car because it is raining. I have a two foot step into the office.</p> <p>Going to have a good day today, hope you guys will as well. We will talk to you all soon.</p> <p>You are listening to Marketing in Your Car with Russell Brunson, the best podcast to help you easily launch and grow your own online business. Grab the wheel.

This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to the Marketing In Your Car podcast.</p> <p>Hey guys, so last night I had a chance to do something really fun. My wife and I went to this thing called the \u201czombie apocalypse.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s called Zombie Acres, where basically [laughter] I\u2019m sure some of you guys, hopefully, have had a chance to do paintballing, which is very fun.</p> <p>Where you go out in a field, and you have teams, and you shoot each other and try to kill each other, right? So what Zombie Acres was, was kind of like that except for backwards.</p> <p>Instead of us going and shooting our friends, there\u2019s a whole bunch of zombies attacking us, and we get to shoot them with paintballs, and it was a really fun thing, so we showed up there.</p> <p>They had this huge bus, the Zombie Acres bus. And we get inside, and the windows are all busted out of the bus, and there\u2019s a paintball gun out of every single window.</p> <p>And so you go and you sit in the bus, and they drive around this haunted cornfield, and you get to shoot zombies.</p> <p>The zombies are attacking you and jumping on the bus and coming in the doors and the windows, and you\u2019re just pounding them in the face with paintballs, as fast as you can go.</p> <p>And anyway, it was like, seriously, one of the most fun things I\u2019ve ever done in my life. You know, I\u2019ve been to a lot of haunted houses and stuff, and this trumped that by ten times.</p> <p>So that was kind of what we did last night, it was super fun, and the reason why we did it, one of the guys who lives by me, he actually just started that as a company this year.</p> <p>And I\u2019m not sure how he got the whole idea behind it or anything, but they put the concept together and they found -- first, they were trying to buy a lot, but it was too expensive to buy someplace to do it.</p> <p>So they partnered with some people, and they found some land to do it at, and they started doing it, and they promoted on Facebook and did a bunch of cool things. And it was just fun watching this little startup growing, and them using Internet marketing and all these things to kind of grow their business.</p> <p>What was interesting is, I\u2019ve been watching these guys. This was their first season doing it, and last night was actually the last night. So I\u2019m watching them, externally, kind of seeing what they\u2019re doing from the marketing.</p> <p>And before it launched, they did a big pre-launch through Facebook, just locally here, and they were getting people to guess where it was going to be at, and it\u2019s caused all this hype in pre-launch, which was awesome, and then boom!</p> <p>They announced where it was going to be at, and then they did their first day, and then from there they posted pictures and videos and got people excited and more people started coming.</p> <p>And then about half way through the season, they hit an obstacle -- and as most entrepreneurs, we know we hit obstacles a lot, right?</p> <p>Yesterday, I hit like four new obstacles in my business that all are seemingly insurmountable. But we\u2019ll figure out a way to break through them, right?</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of what happened to them. The city they were doing it is called Meridian, which is right next to Boise, and the Meridian City Council or whatever it was, came down and basically said, hey, you can't shoot paintballs outdoors in Meridian or whatever.</p> <p>So they had to basically shut down, and they were shut down for about a week or so, and I felt really bad for them. But I just kind of watched it just to see how\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I like seeing how entrepreneurs react.</p> <p>You know, it\u2019s interesting. You go to a store, if the employee behind the counter has a little issue, they just give up, right? But the entrepreneur in a business is always a lot more stubborn and pigheaded, and they figure out ways to get crap done, right?</p> <p>So I just kind of watched them, and I just assumed that they were going to be done for the season, and then boom! About a week later, they\u2019re back up and running.</p> <p>And sure enough, he didn\u2019t let that obstacle stop him, and went and they found another place in another city, set up shop over there, partnered with this farm.</p> <p>That\u2019s a farm called Linder Farms, and they already a ton of people coming for their corn maize and things like that -- and they set up shop right out there in the corn maize and kept going and finished through the season.</p> <p>I just was impressed with their perseverance to kind of break through those sticking points.</p> <p>And then, last night, again the first time that I had a chance to actually go. I had meant to go throughout the whole season, and things came up and then boom! They got shut down, and then it got re-opened, and just things keep happening, and we never got to make it.</p> <p>Finally last night, we had a chance to go on the closing night, and we were on the very last bus. And it was awesome because when I was going there, I remember sitting there at first, and I showed up and I saw these two huge buses they had, like school bus style buses.</p> <p>They\u2019re all painted. The windows had been busted out. They basically had a paintball in every single window, and I was just looking at it.</p> <p>And then, I saw like the staff that was, you know, doing tickets, and I saw the staff inside the buses, keeping people\u2019s guns loaded and enough ammo, and I saw like all the zombies, and I was like, \u201cthere are a lot of costs involved with this little business that they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>I was kind of doing the math, and I was, you know, looking at it. It was $30 a seat to be on the bus. Look how many windows there are, you know, and I\u2019m looking.</p> <p>They were making $600 -- $500 to $600 per busload -- and I was like, you know, that\u2019s not bad money. But they\u2019ve got a lot of costs, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI wonder how this is doing?</p> <p>And I was noticing some things, you know, like when we went there. Like it was cold and I think they could have had some profit opportunities, if they would have sold hot chocolate or hand warmers or a bunch of things like that.</p> <p>At the end, you know, they could take a picture, a lot of little things like that they could come back and really monetize.</p> <p>But the brilliance came when I got on the thing, so I think it was, like I said, $30 per person to get on the bus, and then they give you 150 paintballs, which I assume 150 paintballs would last a pretty good amount of time.</p> <p>I found out later, 150 paintballs lasts about three seconds, and so I\u2019m at the brrrp boom! Balls gone! And they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, if you want more paintballs, you know, the next 100 paintballs is five bucks.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah! Give me some more paintballs.\u201d Pull out five bucks. Boom! Give me more paintballs. And about 10 seconds later, those are gone. So I paid another five bucks, boom!</p> <p>Anyway, we ended up spending every penny that was in my wallet in paintballs, and by the end we were completely like\u2026 we were still not finished, and I was completely out of money, and I couldn\u2019t buy any more paintballs.</p> <p>And next to me there was a kid that was, man, probably 14, 15 years old, and he went and bought four refills of paintballs, so he spent an extra $20 on paintballs.</p> <p>Again, everyone on the bus was doing this, and I started doing the math and that\u2019s when I saw the brilliance of their business model: You\u2019re getting in $30 is basically kind of covering their costs, and then when you\u2019re in the bus, just keep buying more and more paintballs, is where they\u2019re making money.</p> <p>I mean, off of me they probably made an extra $80. They got us in and made $20, so there\u2019s $100 between two of us, then there are 20 other people on the bus.</p> <p>I was really impressed to see like how they were monetizing internally with the selling of additional paintballs, and I probably would have spent $200 or more if I wouldn\u2019t have of ran out of cash.</p> <p>They only take cash when your on the bus. I thought, you know, if they would figure out a way to do more, like a bar tab, where I\u2019m like \u201canother one, another one!\u201d At the end bill me, I mean, I probably would have spent and extra\u2026 Goll, who knows, hundreds of dollars? I was having so much fun.</p> <p>Anyway, it was really, really cool, and I started looking at that business model, and I started thinking like it\u2019s kind of like the razor blade business.</p> <p>You know, like if you go to the store, you buy razor blades, like the actual thing, the actual shaver thing isn\u2019t that expensive, right? You can get those for like a dollar or two.</p> <p>A lot of times they just give them away, you know, kind of like the bus ride. Then after you\u2019ve got it, you got to buy razors, and you run a razor for a week or two weeks, and then it starts getting dull, and starts hurting, so boom!</p> <p>You get a new one, a new one, and these keep replacing these razor blades, and that\u2019s how that business makes a ton of money, and razor blades happen to be expensive.</p> <p>Just like the printer business, right? They give away printers for free, and they sell ink over and over and over again. And that\u2019s kind of the concept, and I thought it was brilliant, and executed perfectly.</p> <p>Like I said, a couple things they could do, I think, to extract more money from me and the other customers.</p> <p>At the end, I wish they\u2019d had a professional photographer for taking pictures of us and the zombies; like that would have been something I would have definitely paid for, and I think most people there would have paid for.</p> <p>Plus you could have used those pictures on Facebook, to help spread the message even further.</p> <p>But as a whole, it was a fun night. An awesome to see entrepreneurship thriving and just see some people, who, obviously, went through a lot of trails and headaches to accomplish what they did, but to see them succeed last night.</p> <p>And like I said, we were the very last bus, the last thing of the season, and afterwards they were out there taking pictures of all the zombies by the bus, and it was just cool -- and I was proud of them, to see them succeed with their new little business.</p> <p>So that\u2019s kind of what I wanted to just talk about today. Just to share a really fun experience that we had here, and then to share some of the outward entrepreneur things that they were able to do to succeed.</p> <p>I hope that gives you guys some motivation in whatever business you\u2019re in because you\u2019re going to come into all sorts of troubles and issues.</p> <p>You know, you may not be kicked out of your city because of your business, but you\u2019re probably going to lose your Internet or you\u2019re going to get your autoresponder shut down.</p> <p>I can't tell you how many issues I\u2019ve run into in my business every single day, and the entrepreneurs are the ones who figure out ways around it and figure out how to succeed.</p> <p>And, man, that was a lot of fun! So if any of you guys are in Boise next October time, let me know and I\u2019ll take you guys to Zombie Acres, and we will shoot some zombies and have some fun. It\u2019s a good time.</p> <p>So with that, I appreciate you guys. I\u2019m at the office now. I\u2019m getting back to work, and I\u2019ll talk to you guys again soon.</p>", "duration": "09:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/40_-_The_Zombie_Entrepreneur_Apocalypse.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1383591600, "title": "Episode #39 \u2013 Inbound vs. Outbound Marketing", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Is it possible to find a happy medium?</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone! This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to the Marketing In You Car podcast.</p> <p>Today, I\u2019m not in my Ferrari because it\u2019s freezing! But we\u2019re here and we\u2019re having some fun.</p> <p>Hey guy and gals! So I appreciate you guys all being here today on the podcast and listening in. We have a very fun and exciting day today happening. It starts off, actually, yesterday. Well, maybe like even a month ago.</p> <p>A month ago, for those of you who know me, I\u2019m not like a very big video game guy. But I love like the old-school video games, and so I found this Nintendo controller, like one of the original ones, but it\u2019s a USB based one.</p> <p>So I bought it, and I really didn\u2019t know what to do with it, and then last night with my kids I went and I found how to download an emulator, and I downloaded all of the original games that we used to play.</p> <p>So I had \u201cMario 1, 2, 3.\u201d We had \u201cDouble-Dribble,\u201d \u201cContra,\u201d \u201cMilon\u2019s Secret Castle,\u201d \u201cLegacy Of The Wizard,\u201d anyway all the fun games, and we started playing it last night, and I was up till forever playing it.</p> <p>And it\u2019s Daylight Savings, and so I was actually up even\u2026 I was up to like 2:00 or 3:00, technically. I think it was like 1:00 or 2:00 I went to bed, but it was like 2:00 or 3:00 in my brain because of Daylight Savings.</p> <p>So anyway, that was fun and I\u2019m excited to get back tonight. I have to get home from the office and keep playing. I got to beat some of my old games again. Oh, \u201cMike Tyson\u2019s Punch Out,\u201d I have that one too.</p> <p>Anyway, so it\u2019s been a lot of fun. But I want to talk to you guys about what I\u2019ve been thinking about this whole weekend. Because I\u2019m kind of having a big shift, and it goes against everything that I thought I believed about marketing, and I think that I just sold myself on it.</p> <p>For those who have been following me for any amount of time, you know that I\u2019m kind of like a hard-core like Dad Kennedy style, outbound marketer, right? We\u2019re very aggressive with our emails and our banners and our direct mail and our -- everything that we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>And it works! Okay, like we\u2019ve been very successful with it, but I keep watching like all these newer type companies that are coming out, and watching their huge growth they\u2019re having. And what\u2019s interesting, as I watch what they\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s very\u2026 kind of the opposite of what I\u2019m doing.</p> <p>In fact, they all kind of call like, what I do and what we focus on, the \u201coutbound marketing,\u201d what they do \u201cinbound marketing.\u201d And I\u2019ve seen infographic about like how outbound marketing, you\u2019re like \u201cspammers\u201d and \u201cthe email marketers,\u201d and, you know, all these guys.</p> <p>And the inbound marketers, the ones who \u201ccreate good content\u201d and \u201cpeople come and listen to them,\u201d and bla, bla, bla, and while I don\u2019t completely agree with them, there are some valid, really, really, really good things that I have been getting from them that I enjoy.</p> <p>I think there\u2019s a blend of the two that you can really find a happy medium, and I think that using, you know, they would call outbound marketing techniques --- promote your inbound marketing -- is really where the magic is if you can find that sweet spot.</p> <p>And so, I\u2019ve been looking for the last month or so, for those of you guys who know, we\u2019ve been publishing the DotComSecrets Labs print newsletter for, man, for a long time!</p> <p>I think it\u2019s been seven years we\u2019ve been publishing a print newsletter. In the last five or six months, it\u2019s been the DotComSecrets Labs Newsletter, and people will have loved the Labs newsletter.</p> <p>They\u2019ve been going crazy for it. Anyone who gets their hands on it, it\u2019s just like \u201cthis is the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d And the problem is, though, it\u2019s really a hard product to sell. It\u2019s kind of like insurance, right? Like everybody needs insurance, but nobody really wants insurance.</p> <p>Now if they get it, they\u2019re grateful for it. It\u2019s kind of like this: like we just really have a hard time getting mass appeal, and then about a month ago the girl that\u2019s been doing our newsletter, she\u2019s had her second baby and she just said, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t have time now to keep dedicating to this.\u201d</p> <p>And so, I\u2019m kind of at this crossroad, and what do we do? Do we find a new publisher? Do we just cancel it altogether, or what do we do? I kind of have this weekend, what I\u2019m leaning towards, and I may not do it, so don\u2019t hold me accountable to this if I don\u2019t.</p> <p>But I was like what if -- like anyone who gets the newsletter in their hands and sees the split tests and the results and all this stuff, I get -- it instantly makes them raving fans.</p> <p>Mark Call said, \u201cBy far, it was the best Internet marketing product he\u2019s ever purchased in his history online.\u201d You know, everybody else that sees it, loves it. Like our Facebook reviews are just raving, from David Frey, from just everybody, right?</p> <p>And so, I was like, \u201cWhat if we just stopped selling that and just started giving it away? Like what if I made like a real blog, like people do in the blogging world, and I just every day blogged split test results? It showed cool thing, after cool thing, after cool, after cool thing?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m always just like have a kind of fear. I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, why should I actually give all this stuff away? Like people will pay for it.\u201d But I\u2019m like, what if I did, though? If I give that away, it would create these raving fans who then come back and purchase everything else we have.</p> <p>That\u2019s been kind of my thought process over the weekend. I\u2019ve got to talk to my guys and see what they think about it. They may think I\u2019m crazy.</p> <p>But I really think that, you know, one of the big shifts in my business over the last month or so is, bringing in all the social media and bringing in all these things that we haven\u2019t been doing.</p> <p>And I think that the reason why it\u2019s so powerful is because, first off, it makes you relevant. Second off, it\u2019s really rebuilding our platform.</p> <p>You know, like I said, we\u2019ve been building our platform for the last 10 years, but the platform shifted. And I\u2019ve got to be honest: I\u2019ve been slower to change over than I probably should have been.</p> <p>So these are all the things that we\u2019re trying to do to really rebuild our platform from the social media standpoint, and just doing cool stuff to get everybody raving fans where they just spend more time with us, and, in return, hopefully, spend some more money with us.</p> <p>So that\u2019s the kind of the game plot. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re excited, and anyway I appreciate you guys listening. I just got to the office. I\u2019ve got a fun-filled day of stuff I\u2019m going to be doing. I\u2019m fired up, excited. I found this company that does infographics.</p> <p>You know, I\u2019ve got tons of processes that we teach in our company, and I was like whiteboarding out. But I was like wouldn\u2019t that be cool if we have an infographic for each one of them? So like the DotComSecrets X process, we take someone through it. You make an infographic of that.</p> <p>Our DotComSecrets Local, our Micro-Continuity, our Underachiever, like making infographics of each of these different topics. The people can print them out. You know, put them on the wall, whatever. Pass them around.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m excited about that too. I\u2019m going to be having them do a DotComSecrets X infographic today, so I\u2019m fired up! I\u2019m excited for today. It\u2019s going to be good.</p> <p>I hope you guys are excited as well. If you\u2019re liking this podcast, please go to iTunes and let me know. I love reading the reviews. It gets me excited, and other than that, you guys, I will talk to you all again very, very soon.</p> <p>Thanks, you guys, and this is Russell signing off.</p>", "duration": "07:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/39_-_Inbound_Vs._Outbound_Marketing.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1383242400, "title": "Episode #38 \u2013 It\u2019s Finally Time To Get Social", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Here are the core reasons why Russell is finally getting involved in social media.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone! This is Russell Brunson, and I want to welcome you to a very special Halloween Marketing In Your Car.</p> <p>Everyone, so this Russell and today is\u2026 It just happens to be my favorite holiday, which is Halloween, and a lot of people think, \u201cHalloween is your favorite holiday, Russell?\u201d</p> <p>But yes, I don\u2019t know why. I just have so many fond memories of getting candy, and smashing pumpkins and everything else fun I did as a kid, and now it\u2019s fun to take my kids out -- not smashing pumpkins, I try to teach them respect.</p> <p>We\u2019re definitely going out and getting candy, making some witches brew, a bunch of other fun stuff, so it\u2019s going to be a fun day today. Anyway, I\u2019m really excited.</p> <p>So today I want to talk about just the kind of stuff that\u2019s been happening in our business. What\u2019s been interesting is, as we\u2019ve been trying to kind of shift up our business model and change a whole bunch of things, you guys will start seeing a bunch of changes happening over the next two months in our business.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been, you know, about six months worth of back-work, and doing stuff that no one can really see yet, but you will all be able to see it very, very soon, a whole new re-brand of all of our sites, all of our brands, things like that.</p> <p>And one of the big pieces that we\u2019re doing is focusing a lot more now on social media, things like that, and it\u2019s interesting because I\u2019ve always fought social media. I\u2019ve never wanted to do\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to tweet. I didn\u2019t want to do Facebook.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to do all that kind of stuff, but it\u2019s getting to the point now where I just can't ignore it anymore, and we\u2019re getting more and more involved. And it\u2019s been interesting like, for any of you guys who are SEO type people or curious about SEO, it\u2019s really interesting how much SEO has been changing.</p> <p>We used to have full-time teams of people who did SEO, and now we\u2019ve pretty much canceled and let go of all of them.</p> <p>What we\u2019re finding, and it\u2019s interesting -- and I think that this will be the trend, moving forward with SEO -- is like it\u2019s having a lot less to do with like backlinking and things like that. It\u2019s having a lot more to do with like the actual social interactions that people are having.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard stories and read things that talk about how the new future of SEO is, basically, social media. Where instead of someone going to Google and typing in, you know, \u201cwork at home,\u201d instead of finding whoever has gotten the most backlinks, it will look at you and look at your social profile.</p> <p>See the people who you care about, and then see if any of the people you care about, if they\u2019ve liked something. Or they\u2019ve commented on something, they asked who\u2019s making work at home make money.</p> <p>And if they have, then boom! That will show up on top, and it\u2019s just interesting that that\u2019s the direction that things are going, where search and social are now becoming one.</p> <p>So I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re now focusing on that and trying to learn the game and trying to be engaging, and trying to build a Fan Page, and trying to tweet and all these nerdy things that I never wanted to do.</p> <p>But we\u2019re doing them now, and I think that right now they\u2019re important but soon they\u2019re going to be essential. I mean, look at like back in the day we\u2019re used to go spend a ton of money for a backlink, right?</p> <p>You get the perfect backlink and almost instantly you can get ranked very, very quickly. Where I think now it\u2019s going to be a lot more like networking, and finding the social influencers in a space.</p> <p>For example, lets say I\u2019m in\u2026 like let\u2019s say I\u2019m in the diabetes market, right? Which we are\u2026 and so, you know, and now I want people searching for diabetes to show up.</p> <p>So what I\u2019ve got to do is I\u2019ve got to go out there and network and find people who are big, prominent names in diabetes, whatever, and get them to comment about me on their social media, on their Facebook or Twitter or Google Plus or LinkedIn or whatever.</p> <p>But if I get that person to do it, now all those people\u2019s followers, in the future when they start searching for stuff, I\u2019m going to pop up, and so I really think it\u2019s interesting.</p> <p>It\u2019s moving away from like the technical SEO, you know, to get rankings where it\u2019s X amount of links, and the link quality and the link density and latent SIMATIC index and all these things we used to focus on to try to beat the search engines, right? And now it\u2019s not. Now it\u2019s being social. It\u2019s getting people to talk about you. It\u2019s networking. It\u2019s gone back to like organic business.</p> <p>It\u2019s really interesting, and so again despite the fact that I\u2019ve been fighting it for years, we\u2019re now jumping in and trying to focus on that because I think that\u2019s going to be the future for all of us.</p> <p>And I also look at like when I first got into this business, the way that I grew my business was networking. Like I was out there on the forums, meeting everybody in my industry. I was getting to know them.</p> <p>I was going to events and meeting them, and I became very, very social, and then somewhere along the line I had kids and a wife and a company and we just stopped being as social, and so\u2026</p> <p>Oop, I\u2019m pausing because I just drove past a cop in the Ferrari, and he\u2019s looking at me now.</p> <p>Anyway, we basically, as I said I stopped being as social, and luckily I built a lot of deep connections and relationships, and I had a lot of really good partners.</p> <p>But if I look at my business now, and I think that nothing is stagnating at all. We\u2019re still growing, but it hasn\u2019t grown as it should because I haven\u2019t been out there networking, and the new place to network is not the events, it\u2019s not the forums -- it\u2019s social media. It\u2019s Facebook, and I hadn\u2019t been putting in my time there.</p> <p>And so, just for you guys, you know, think about the same types of things. This networking stuff that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s good from so many standpoints. It\u2019s now good for the social traffic, obviously.</p> <p>It\u2019s good for future SEO rankings and things like that, and it\u2019s also really good just for finding partners and friends and networking and things like that, and so I just want to stress to you guys that now is the time to get social, if you haven\u2019t yet.</p> <p>Jump on the bandwagon with me. You know, I fought it for years, but now we\u2019re jumping in and I think that all you guys should, as well.</p> <p>So, anyway that\u2019s what\u2019s happening for our Halloween today. I\u2019m really excited. I just got to the office. I\u2019ve got my fake biceps. My Halloween costume is these fake biceps, and then a blonde mullet wig. [Laughter] Which is kind of fun.</p> <p>I had it the other day, and my daughter said that I looked like a muscle woman because my mullet was long and blonde. So anyway, I\u2019m dressing up like a muscleman, with a long mullet, and going to have a fun day today.</p> <p>So I\u2019m excited. I hope you guys are as well, and we\u2019ll talk to you again soon.</p>", "duration": "07:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/38_-_Its_Finally_Time_To_Get_Social.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1382378400, "title": "Episode #37 \u2013 Asking The Right Questions", "author": "", "summary": "<p>The question that Russell asked that helped him raise an extra $500,000 in extra cash by the end of the year.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everybody! This is Russell Brunson, and welcome to today\u2019s Marketing In Your Car podcast.</p> <p>Hey guys, so we just finished a two-day mastermind here in Boise. I just actually drove my brother, who\u2019s our audio-video guy, back to the airport. He\u2019s flying back home, and I\u2019m driving back, to go hang out with my kids and my wife and stuff, and so I\u2019ve got probably 15 minutes or so in the car.</p> <p>I just wanted to talk to you guys about some cool stuff I\u2019ve been thinking about. And what I want to talk about is probably one of the most important things that I think any of us could ever think about. It\u2019s had a really profound impact on me the last like week, so I\u2019m excited to talk about it.</p> <p>So earlier this week -- my wife and I have been planning on building a house for a while. We\u2019ve been looking at a lot of stuff, and we finally found some land we like and everything.</p> <p>And then just like last minute, I think it was on Tuesday, we saw this house. It looked really cool. So we\u2019re like, \u201cOh let\u2019s just call the realtor and go check it out.\u201d</p> <p>So we go check out the house and it\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s 11,000 square feet, it\u2019s on five acres, it has everything we could dream of in a house.</p> <p>Plus like the yard is amazing. There\u2019s a swimming pool, there\u2019s a hot tub, there\u2019s like a full orchard worth of trees. Like seriously, the coolest house like I think I\u2019ve ever seen, and so I want it really bad, right?</p> <p>And the only problem is, to buy a house that size, we had to have a down payment of $500,000 to be able to move forward on the house, and I don\u2019t care who you are, a half a million bucks is a lot of money, right?</p> <p>So I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, how can I?\u201d Anyway, so I started to just\u2026 like my wife is like, \u201cI want this house. I want this house.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWe can't really afford it.\u201d But I was like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll start thinking about it, and I\u2019ll figure out a way that we can get it.\u201d</p> <p>And so, all of a sudden I started asking some interesting questions. The question I asked was: \u201cHow can I make a half a million dollars in extra cash before the end of the year?</p> <p>So the next two and a half months, and typically if someone says something like that, you\u2019re like, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. There\u2019s no way you can make a half million dollars in two and a half months extra on top of what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>I was like \u201cthere\u2019s got to be a way,\u201d so I kept thinking about it and thinking about it, and my wife\u2019s like, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about something like that. It\u2019s not good.\u201d</p> <p>You know, she thinks it\u2019s like you. What I\u2019m going to do is illegal or something, that she\u2019s just kind of funny like that. She doesn\u2019t like when I plot and scheme ideas, so I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, there\u2019s got to be a way that we can do that.\u201d</p> <p>So, I went back home and went back to the office, and we\u2019re all working and I kind of told those guys, \u201cYou know, I love the house. I want to move in.\u201d</p> <p>And Brent and John share an office with me, and I kind of asked them, \u201cYou know, like how can I make an extra half a million dollars this year?\u201d And they kind of just like are working and kind of commenting, and they\u2019re not paying attention.</p> <p>Finally, I was like, \u201cGuys! Stop what you\u2019re doing, like this is actually really an important thing. We need to be asking ourselves questions like this more often. Like how can we make an extra million dollars or half a million dollars cash in the next like two months?\u201d</p> <p>And so, they kind of put everything down and started focusing, and we started asking questions. We started kind of evolving this thing, and within about 45 minutes we created a very realistic, concrete plan that I honestly think we could execute to make a half million dollars in the next two months, and we got it done. And then I kind of stopped, and said, \u201cYou guys, we need to ask ourselves questions like this more often.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cYou know, an hour ago, we were working on these projects, and we never asked the question how can we make an extra half a million dollars. We just\u2026 we\u2019re were just working on our thing.\u201d</p> <p>And I started thinking like, if we look at a squeeze page, and we say, \u201cHow can we improve the conversion on the squeeze page?\u201d and we ask that question, we\u2019ll figure out a way to make it better.</p> <p>If we do a sales letter, how can we make this better? If we ask that question, we\u2019ll figure out a way to make it better, and what I was thinking is like when you ask the right questions, the right things will come.</p> <p>If you ask big questions, you\u2019ll be able to figure out the solutions to big things. So kind of an example of what we were figuring out for our $100,000 offer, or to make a half million dollars, I was like:</p> <p>\u201cYou know, we do a product launch and try to sell a $1,000 product, and sell 500 of them, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, that sounds like so much work!\u2019 I was like, \u2018We could do this\u2026 We could do this\u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And all of a sudden I was like, \u201cWhat if we\u2026 What if we created a $100,000 package and just sold five of them?\u201d and like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good idea. What can we sell for $100,000?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, think about this\u2026 Like we launched this call center. We launched this little mini call center in our office. We\u2019ve got two sales people. We hardly generate any leads.</p> <p>It\u2019s very few leads, very targeted. And right now, with two sales people, we\u2019re averaging, not quite, but pretty close to $100,000 a week in sales.</p> <p>And I was like, \u201cThink about this. If we found five people who have a business, but they don\u2019t have this little like mini call center thing that we just built, and it could literally make them $100,000 a week.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if we come in and say, \u2018Hey, pay us $100,000, and I will come to your office, and my team will come and build out the whole thing. We\u2019ll train sales people for you. We\u2019ll get the whole thing done, and you will leave with a business that can make you $100.000 a week.</p> <p>\u201cWould you pay me $100,000 if I gave you business that made you $100,000 a week?\u201d Everyone was like, \u201cYeah! I would. That\u2019s a no-brainer. Of course I would.\u201d</p> <p>You know, obviously, it was just like, yeah, it\u2019s a good deal. But I\u2019m like, but still the same thing is I\u2019m kind of scared. Like if you\u2019re going to write a check for $100.000, there\u2019s so much risk in that so much fear. And like, is that actually going to work or not work? I was like, \u201cWell, what if we did this. What if we came back and said:</p> <p>\u201cHey, give us $100.000, but don\u2019t give it to us, put it in an escrow account. And we\u2019ll look at it, and then we\u2019ll come in, and we\u2019ll build this entire thing for you for free.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll set it up. We\u2019ll launch it. We\u2019ll run it, and we\u2019ll watch it, and we\u2019ll help make sure it works, and we will wait until it\u2019s made $100,000.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as soon as it\u2019s made $100.000 in gross profits, then that $100,000 that you put escrow will be released to me, and then you\u2019ll have a business that you can keep running to make $100,000 a week.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, who would say no to that? Like as long as you have the ability to put $100,000 in escrow, who would not do that? Like I\u2019m going to make you $100,000 before you ever give me any of the money, and so it starts being like that.</p> <p>I\u2019m like this is actually really good. Like this is something I would have paid for in a heartbeat, and it\u2019s got to be the right business, the right company, right?</p> <p>But if it\u2019s the right fit, we could literally come in and in less than a week we could build this whole thing out for somebody, and have a new asset hooked to their business and make them $100,000 a week.</p> <p>And so, I started getting excited. So I was talking to some guy, and this guy, I kind of mentioned it to him. And he was like, \u201cDude, I know tons of people who would go for that.\u201d</p> <p>So he started calling some people, and we got two or three people lined up that may do it. Then by mastermind group, when I kind of pitch it, and soon as I do everyone\u2019s going crazy, and one person is like\u2026 they\u2019re like:</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not on spot yet. We can\u2019t do it, but I know somebody who would be very interested, who wants to do it,\u201d so then we got one potential client.</p> <p>Then Daegan told me, he\u2019s like, \u201cThere\u2019s a guy who was talking to me two weeks ago, who said, \u2018All I want is the call center. I want somebody to come and set the whole thing up for me, and I\u2019d pay anything -- any amount to do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Boom! We got a lead right there, and then the guy in the room also said he wanted us to do it for him.</p> <p>So within two days of me just asking that question, of how I can make a half a million dollars in a month, I\u2019ve already got six people, potentially, who are able and interested in giving me $100,000, for me to come set this thing up for them, and I was just like, how cool is that?</p> <p>And it\u2019s just interesting like, most of us -- the difference between successful people and not successful people is successful people ask the right questions -- and I\u2019m really kind of ashamed of myself. I haven\u2019t been asking better questions lately.</p> <p>My questions lately have been stupid. They\u2019ve been like\u2026 they haven\u2019t been big enough questions, you know, and so I\u2019m going to start every single morning, waking up, and like asking a big question or multiple big questions, and then using that throughout the day, try to answer those questions.</p> <p>Because my question is like how can I get my work done today, or how can I whatever, nothing good is going to happen. If my question is like how can I make an extra million dollars, how can I change more people\u2019s lives, how can I double the size of my list?</p> <p>Like if I ask questions like that, then suddenly my focus goes there. And as Tony Robbins says, \u201cWhere focus goes, energy flows,\u201d and we just started to start picking the right questions. And if you pick the right questions, you\u2019ll start growing correctly.</p> <p>I think we focus too much on trivial things that don\u2019t really matter, as opposed to picking the right questions to help us grow our business the right way.</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of funny\u2026 and then later that night in the mastermind -- seriously I need to learn to take my own advice sometimes. But we were at dinner, and I was talking about how the Ferrari, we would probably do a contest and give away the Ferrari, and do a fun kind of thing like that.</p> <p>I was talking about that, and one of my friends, who works for ClickBank said, \u201cHey, you should have ClickBank. Use part of ClickBank to give away your Ferrari.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to do that.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy not?\u201d and I\u2019m like, and I told him all the reasons why it wouldn\u2019t work. He\u2019s like, \u201cDude, you\u2019re just not asking the right question.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThere\u2019s no way that will ever work.\u201d</p> <p>And he kept like making fun of me. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou just ask. Ask a better question! Like you\u2019re asking the wrong question.\u201d And I kept telling him, I was like -- his name is BJ.</p> <p>I\u2019m like, \u201cBJ, this\u2026 ClickBank would never in a million years go for this. Like it\u2019s a mute point. Doesn\u2019t even, like it\u2019s not worth even discussing.</p> <p>And he kept saying, \u201cDude, you\u2019re the one who talked about, say, ask a better question,\u201d and I was just kind of upset and annoyed with him, so I kind of ignored him.</p> <p>Anyway, the next day we\u2019re sitting in the mastermind meeting, and all these discussions are happening, and then after talking to BJ, and all of a sudden boom!</p> <p>It hit me. A way that we could partner with ClickBank on the Ferrari launch, and I said, \u201cBJ, like I just answered the question.\u201d I said, \u201cBecause you forced that question into my head, annoyingly, it was in there and my brain figured out an answer.\u201d</p> <p>And within a day we had the answer to this thing that, potentially, can make me insane amounts of money -- an actual quarter million dollars a month -- because I had that question forced into my head.</p> <p>If I would have asked the question, I probably could of figured it out a lot quicker. So I just want you guys to all just start thinking about the quality of the questions you\u2019re asking, and how often you\u2019re asking them.</p> <p>I teach a Sunday school class today, and I teach the 15 and 16-year-old kids, and so today in class I was just talking about this concept about questions, and I was like, \u201cWhat are your goals and your dreams and your desires?\u201d</p> <p>And they kind of were telling me things they\u2019re trying to accomplish, what they\u2019re doing, and so what we did is we took a minute. I had everyone pause for just a minute, and I actually timed it.</p> <p>I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a minute right now. I want you to pick one big goal or one big question to be your focus for this week, and then I want you to come back next week and report back to me what happened, because you focused on that question for an entire week.\u201d</p> <p>And so, we paused, and then had everyone sit there and think for a little bit, like what would be their question, and I didn\u2019t have them tell me what they were because I don\u2019t want to\u2026</p> <p>You know, since with people that age, they\u2019re embarrassed to show their real desires and their dreams, what their questions are, so I didn\u2019t ask them to share it with us.</p> <p>But I gave them a full minute to think about it, and I ask them, \u201cDo you all have your question?\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay, I want you guys to go home tonight, think about a question, and when you wake up in the morning, I want that question to be the first thing on your mind.</p> <p>\u201cAnd throughout the day, I want you to be thinking about that question, and then tomorrow, the next day, I want you to wake up in the morning and for an entire week I want you to focus on that question.\u201d</p> <p>And I said, \u201cFor most of you guys, I promise you, by day one or day two, this big, huge question that you didn\u2019t think was even possible to answer, you\u2019ll be able to answer, and it won\u2019t take you a whole week.\u201d</p> <p>I was like my \u201chow am I going to make a half a million dollars extra in the next two months,\u201d which -- it\u2019s a big order that I was asking my brain to come up with -- but sure enough, within hours, we had the answer, okay?</p> <p>The question of how can I get ClickBank to completely promote my launch to all their affiliate base is a big question! Not even logical! And within a day we had the answer.</p> <p>Okay, so just start thinking big, thinking way bigger than you\u2019ve ever thought before, and figure out that question that you never thought you\u2019d ask and you probably shouldn\u2019t ask.</p> <p>If somebody knew you were going to ask it of yourself, they would make fun of you, and tell you it\u2019s not possible. Or tell you that things like that don\u2019t happen to people like you. And if you do that, I promise you cool stuff is going to happen.</p> <p>And I think about the Ferrari\u2026 I\u2019m like when the Ferrari contest came out, at first I looked at it and I was like, \u201cI imagine a lot of people competing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to win,\u201d and then the second I looked at it, I said:</p> <p>\u201cHuh! How can I win this?\u201d and as soon as I did that, it opened up my brains to a pathway, and suddenly a month later we won a Ferrari, okay?</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, he talked about the difference between financially rich people and financially poor people. He said, \u201cPoor people say, \u2018I can\u2019t afford that,\u2019 and rich people say, \u2018How can I afford that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Just a change in the question, how do you position it differently, how do you do it so that your mind doesn\u2019t say, \u201cOh good! I\u2019ll think about this\u201d and relax, but instead, you put your mind in a state where it\u2019s got to think, and got to figure it out.</p> <p>And our minds, our subconscious minds, are so much smarter than we give them credit for. We just don\u2019t ask because we\u2019re so lazy, and it doesn\u2019t want us to ask. It wants us just to hang out and watch T.V.</p> <p>But if you turn the T.V. off, ask the question, then ask the question and keep asking and keep asking it, you\u2019ll be shocked at how fast the answers will come.</p> <p>I\u2019m convinced of that. I\u2019ve seen it twice this week, with seemingly impossible goals and dreams, coming about in reality in a matter of hours, after we asked the question, so ask the question and see what happens.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s it for today you guys. I am actually just back from the airport, and I\u2019m grabbing my wife and my kids from church, and then we\u2019ll be heading home.</p> <p>I hope you guys had a great weekend. It depends when you\u2019re listening to this, but I hope everything has been great for you guys.</p> <p>If you\u2019re enjoying these podcasts at all, please share them with your friends.

Russell also shares with you what it\u2019s like being a super hot girl!</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone! This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to an exciting edition of the Marketing In Your Car podcast.</p> <p>It is actually 2:00 in the morning. I just dropped off Todd at the hotel. Todd is our developer. You guys heard about him in the last episode, and I\u2019m in the Ferrari driving home at 2:00 in the morning. It is freezing cold! And the top\u2019s down, and I just passed a cop.</p> <p>But the top will remain down because we\u2019re driving a Ferrari. You don\u2019t put a top up. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s two in the morning, if it\u2019s freezing cold, that\u2019s how we roll and run the Ferrari.</p> <p>So in the last episode, I was talking about developing software is a service type product, and what\u2019s been fun is basically the last two weeks Todd has been here in town.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been developing a brand new product, and I\u2019m super fired up about it because I think it\u2019s going to change the way that people do marketing. I know it\u2019s going to change the way I do things.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to make it where, basically, I can do all the marketing by myself without any webmasters, developers or anything, which is exciting. So anyway, I\u2019m excited for it. But I\u2019m more excited just to talk more about you guys, about software as a service.</p> <p>And we talked about it last time, just some of the benefits of it. But the reality is like it\u2019s been interesting is we\u2019ve developed this product.</p> <p>You know, in the past when we developed products, we tried to give it so many features and so many things that it\u2019s just overwhelming to customers and to us to support it, and to create.</p> <p>And we\u2019ve really been following this model just like making a strip-down, bare bones, as simple and as easy as possible, and as we\u2019ve done that it\u2019s just making a tool that I think people will use and stick with long-term.</p> <p>One of the cool concepts we talked a lot about tonight, that I think I want to kind of focus this on with you guys is, when you\u2019re creating, if you decide to create your own software -- if and when you\u2019re creating your own software.</p> <p>One of the biggest keys in the long-term success of your program, whatever you\u2019re creating, is if you can create something that has pain and disconnect.</p> <p>And it makes me laugh\u2026 I\u2019ve been doing membership sites now for, man, seven or eight years. We\u2019ve made millions of dollars off membership sites. But one of the constant dilemmas we have is there\u2019s always this constant churn and burn. We\u2019re always just adding people into the funnel.</p> <p>I just passed another cop, so I might go onto the side street here. Anyway, it\u2019s a constant burn and churn when you have a typical membership site because content is good, but it\u2019s not essential.</p> <p>Like when somebody -- you know, their credit card comes up, and they\u2019re looking at their bills -- like when they look at like \u201cOh, it\u2019s a membership site. I enjoy it. But, hey, you know, it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t have to have it.\u201d</p> <p>So it\u2019s creating something that if somebody wanted to cancel, there\u2019s huge pain and disconnect. And that\u2019s really what -- you know, not that we\u2019re trying to develop things that cause pain, that would hurt our client\u2019s business.</p> <p>But is something that is so valuable and so useful that if they ever canceled it, would be very painful. So, you know, if for some reason their credit card failed, they\u2019re just going to think, \u201cOh my credit card failed, no big deal.\u201d</p> <p>If their credit card failed, within two minutes they would call you because they\u2019re using your service so much that they have to have it to function. And that\u2019s the kind of product that you\u2019ve really got to create, and I think that\u2019s really the big secret.</p> <p>I really think that next year, with this product rolling out, I think we could do $10-million pretty easily next year. And it\u2019s just because we\u2019ve created something that\u2019s so powerful and so useful that the pain and disconnect is just so much, and so I really want you guys thinking about that.</p> <p>Like if you do decide to develop a software program, like what kind of product or service can we create that ties our customers in so deeply that they just love it so much that they can't cancel?</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of like our supplement. Our supplement has been interesting because I think it\u2019s kind of the case with any supplement you have. There is a percentage of people who it doesn\u2019t work for, and there\u2019s a percentage of people who it works great for.</p> <p>And that\u2019s how it is right now. If we have people, we have clients who are literally calling us saying:</p> <p>\u201cMy bottle is empty, and my new next shipment hasn\u2019t come in! I will pay you whatever it costs to overnight this thing. And make sure that I have that bottle here tomorrow because I don\u2019t want to go through a single day without this in my system.\u201d</p> <p>We get those kinds of calls all the time, which is awesome and exciting. And so, again, it\u2019s pain and disconnect. If those clients stop having our supplement, they\u2019re in so much pain that they can't function, and so they don\u2019t want to go without it.</p> <p>And I think that, you know, in the past in the Internet marketing world, what people have taught and talked about it is just, you know, \u201ccreate something that\u2019s good and people will stick on it.\u201d</p> <p>But I think you\u2019ve really got to create something that has such a big pain and disconnect that they can't leave you. They won\u2019t leave you because it\u2019s so important.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the kind of businesses we\u2019re really trying to focus on, and I think you actually should be focusing on as well, and so, I just want to kind of throw that out there because that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about right now, and it\u2019s been a lot of fun.</p> <p>The other thing that we are kind of playing with that I think is interesting that I want to throw out just an idea for you guys is:</p> <p>If you do have a membership site or something that doesn\u2019t have that big, huge pain and disconnect, you know, one thing that we\u2019ve been looking at a lot recently is like, what\u2019s our average customer value?</p> <p>You know, and we did this before on our membership sites. You know, the average customer stays for one month or three months or six months or whatever it is.</p> <p>When you find that number out, it\u2019s very important to kind of just start focusing on that. Say, \u201cokay, our average customer is staying for just three months at a time, you know, or six months at a time, whatever that is, if you know what that dollar amount is.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to be instituting one of our membership sites coming up next month, and I\u2019m really excited for is\u2026 We\u2019re going to give people the ability to buy out their membership site.</p> <p>So if we know the average person stays for three months, that means that month number two or two and a half, we\u2019re going to start a campaign basically saying:</p> <p>\u201cHey, you\u2019ve been a member for two months. So far, I hope you\u2019re really enjoying the site. What we want to do is, we want to offer you the ability to buy out your contract.</p> <p>\u201cSo basically, for an extra $100 or $200 or whatever it is, you can get a lifetime access to the site. So longer do you have to pay us $97 a month, just pay $200 and boom! You get lifetime access.\u201d</p> <p>And suddenly for anyone who takes that, we just basically increased, you know, we took that person from the average two to three months, to six or eight or twelve months of revenue.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s a cool concept I\u2019m really excited for, and I can share stats and results, as we get deeper into it and kind of see what happens.</p> <p>But just think that. Think about what\u2019s your average stick rate, and right before that average stick rate, give people the ability to buy out a membership at a discount.</p> <p>Or people who cancel give them the ability to buy out the membership at a discount. Same kind of thing that, you know, they\u2019re probably just tired of seeing the monthly payments. They probably still like what you have, so you said:</p> <p>\u201cHey, you know, you may not like paying $97 a month. But for how about $200, we\u2019ll give you lifetime access. You never have to pay again.\u201d</p> <p>And just some fun things to start looking at, just different ways to look at your numbers when you\u2019re doing reoccurring revenue, continuity, and things like that. So anyway, I hope these are just a couple fun ideas.</p> <p>Again, you know, I am so tired right now. We\u2019ve been going like, literally the last two weeks that Todd has been here, we been going late nights like this almost every single night.</p> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure my wife is ready to kill me, but sometimes that\u2019s what you do as an entrepreneur. You burn the midnight oil to create something really cool that will pay you for the rest of your life.</p> <p>And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing and just having that kind of fun, so my brain is kind of all over the place. I just wanted to share with you guys some interesting ideas while I\u2019m driving home, so it\u2019s been a lot of fun.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also had a lot of people email me, asking what it\u2019s like driving the Ferrari, now that I\u2019ve been in Boise driving it for the last week or so. It\u2019s been interesting.</p> <p>Like the first day we had it and parked at the office, we probably had four or five different sets of people who came to the office, parked, came to the door and asked like, \u201cWho\u2019s Ferrari is that? Who\u2019s Ferrari is that?\u201d</p> <p>Like it wasn\u2019t just someone driving by, like they actually came into our office, and asked to see and ask me questions about it. This one kid that drove by, and the guy got so excited he called all his friends.</p> <p>We had this group of like all these teenaged boys outside our office just checking out the car, and they literally sat outside for over an hour, taking pictures and just looking at it. I thought it was the funniest thing!</p> <p>And then, the other thing that\u2019s been interesting is I kind of know what it feels like now to be a really super hot girl. Like, literally, when I\u2019m driving down the street, I have guys driving -- be honking their horns, waving, yelling catcalls at me.</p> <p>I had people like, pulling into parking lots and asking me questions, like I\u2019ve never felt that. I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to be a super, smoking hot girl, but I could imagine that\u2019s probably what it\u2019s like for them.</p> <p>Like they get approached, they have people yelling at them; here people are just like staring. Literally, I can watch as I drive down the road and almost every guy has this like really weird like whiplash, you know, where they\u2019re following the car.</p> <p>And so, I can kind of empathize now with super hot girls, and I feel bad for them sometimes because that would be really, really hard and annoying. At first it\u2019s kind of cool and flattering, but after a while it would be annoying.</p> <p>So anyway, I\u2019m still in the stage where I like being the super hot girl, and I\u2019m enjoying everyone yelling at me in my car. But I\u2019m sure it will go away, and we keep talking about, you know, what are we going to do with it?</p> <p>Obviously, I don\u2019t think I want to drive a Ferrari the rest of my life. I would like to, but\u2026 You know, winning a Ferrari is cool, but I think we told you guys in one of the other episodes, it\u2019s just the tax liability is like\u2026</p> <p>Basically, Joel, he won. You know, he gave me the car so he wrote it off on his taxes as a $130,000 loss. We basically incurred a $130,000 gift, and so I had to pay taxes on $130-grand. Which in my tax bracket is like $60-grand or something crazy like that, so by winning the car I\u2019ve got to pay $60-grand, plus I\u2019ve got to pay sales tax. I\u2019ve got pay like another eight or nine grand as soon as I register it, which I\u2019m doing tomorrow.</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of just an expensive machine, so I think after like the thrill of driving, it wears off. We\u2019re going to do a contest and give it away. We talked about selling it, but selling it\u2026</p> <p>Let\u2019s say I sold it for $130- $150-grand, you know, after paying taxes I still would make $70- $80-grand. Whereas, if I did a contest, and if I execute it correctly, we could make a lot more than that.</p> <p>So we\u2019re actually going to, using the Ferrari in a contest, to give away our new software we\u2019re launching. So who knows! We\u2019ll see. Time will tell. It\u2019ll be a lot of fun.</p> <p>Anyway I just got home, you guys. I\u2019m ready to crash and go to bed. I hope you guys are having a great day, having a fun time being an entrepreneur.</p> <p>Think about some of these cool things I\u2019m sharing with you. Hopefully, you guys implement it in whatever your business you\u2019re in, and I will talk to y\u2019all again soon.</p> <p>Thanks so much, you guys!</p>", "duration": "11:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/36_-_Software_As_A_Service_2_-_Pain_Of_Disconnect.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1380823200, "title": "Episode #35 \u2013 SAAS Smackdown P1", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What I learned when launching our first real SAAS program.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>This is Russell Brunson and this is the Marketing in your car Podcast.</p> <p>I hope you guys are having an awesome day today. I\u2019m actually not driving to the office today. I\u2019m driving to a hotel to pick up our programmer. He is a stud. Some of you guys may know him.</p> <p>He is in town for the next couple of weeks working on some cool projects, so I am going to grab him from the hotel. I have kind of a little longer drive today, so I thought I would do a podcast and talk to you about what we are doing right now, because it\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>Just to get the wheels in your head turning if you are doing any software as a service products, SAAS (software as a service). This is kind of an interesting time in the internet world.</p> <p>When I first got online, the thing to create were these little .exe files, desktop-based. I remember Armen Morne things like E-cover Generator, Header Generator, Sales Letter Generator, all these different products.</p> <p>When I first got online, I saw all the things that Armen was doing, and I was like, \u201cI want to do software too.\u201d I did Zip Brander and Form Fortunes and all these other little software programs.</p> <p>Back then, the cool thing to do was create these little downloadable software programs to download and run on a computer. That\u2019s what we did. People would pay for it one time and we would end at that point.</p> <p>I remember the very first software as a service we ever had was called Digital Repo Man. It was this really cool product where basically if you had an ebook or some product that you were selling, you would use Digital Repo Man to lock it down. Then you could give it to your customers and when your customers wanted a refund you could turn their license key off so they couldn\u2019t give it to other people.</p> <p>It was a cool thing. For whatever reason, it didn\u2019t sell that well. I think it\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s a prevention versus a cure. People don\u2019t really want to buy a prevention. They want to buy a cure.</p> <p>They wanted to buy something for after someone steals their book so they can go out there and beat up the customer that did it, but they\u2019re not willing to pay money to lock it down ahead of time.</p> <p>Anyway, it didn\u2019t do that well, but it was the first time I had sold software as a service, where people log into a members area, they pay you monthly. It was kind of cool.</p> <p>My favorite thing was that if I made an update to the software, it automatically made the update for everyone. Whereas with Zip Brander when I made an update I had to contact all my customers, give them something to download a new version.</p> <p>90 percent of our support questions were because people hadn\u2019t downloaded the newest version. It was kind of a nightmare. Software as a service became really big for a while, and we started doing some things in it, but I never really paid a lot of attention to it.</p> <p>Then a little while later WordPress came out and we started building three or four different WordPress plugins and themes and stuff like that, because the WordPress is so big. I\u2019ve got a friend who is probably listening to this podcast, Stu McClaren and he runs a site called WishlistMember where they sell membership plugins for WordPress.</p> <p>They\u2019re doing awesome. They\u2019re making an insane amount of money with it. I was talking to him back when we were in Kenya and he told me one of the biggest issues with it is that their support is kind of a nightmare.</p> <p>Everyone has different servers and different hosting and different version of WordPress, all these different things that can happen with WordPress. Then if you make an update, everyone with your software has to go download the update.</p> <p>In January this year, we kind of mapped out this idea for a really cool plugin, and that\u2019s what we were going to do. Then we found someone who had something kind of similar and they went and looked at it. The service we had created is a really cool thing that will go and backup your entire website.</p> <p>It\u2019s this really cool thing, but it\u2019s kind of hard to explain. It\u2019s awesome. The company saw they had something similar and they built a WordPress plugin. They had it for about six months and then they took it down.</p> <p>We contacted them and said, \u201cWhy did you guys take down the WordPress plugin?\u201d</p> <p>They were like, \u201cOur software doesn\u2019t need the WordPress plugin. We just used it to get into the WordPress community. But it\u2019s a nightmare. We have to support a billion different website. It got so support-intensive that we just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Now we\u2019re back to our normal software as a service thing.\u201d</p> <p>I was like, \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d A company like that had huge VC money and they couldn\u2019t even support a WordPress plugin. Again, this year we were planning on building this WordPress thing out and we finally decided not to go that direction.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been focusing on three software project simultaneously, which probably isn\u2019t the right way to do it, but they all go hand-in-hand so we did it that way.</p> <p>One is a shopping cart that we are calling Backpack. One is an analytics and follow-up tool called Actionytics. Then one is this really cool front-end website creator, and we don\u2019t have a name for it yet. Hopefully we\u2019ll think of a name soon.</p> <p>After these programs are finished, we\u2019ll be excited to start rolling them out. My focus for next year is 100 percent this new software company and these three products we have. I think the potential is really big with it.</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of the direction that we\u2019re focusing on. As we\u2019re developing software programs, for any of you guys who are thinking about developing software, I wanted to give you some tips and tricks and ideas to think about that we have found helpful and might be useful for you guys if that\u2019s the way you\u2019re going.</p> <p>By the way, if it\u2019s not the way you\u2019re going, you should look at it. If you get one really good software program, it will feed you for the rest of your life.</p> <p>One of the big things is the first version of our landing page creator was actually an automated webinar site. It was called ClickFusion.com. I loved that domain name, I love the logo, I love everything. We built this automated webinar software which I think is the best out there by far.</p> <p>I think the problem is we have way too many features. We can do anything for everyone. Because of that, no one ever adopted it. It was too much stuff.</p> <p>A little while ago I read a book called Rework by 37 Signals. Of all my marketing books, it\u2019s probably the one I\u2019ve read the most times. Stu, who I was talking about earlier, actually recommended it at Pirate\u2019s Cove.</p> <p>Rework is a book written by the owner of 37 Signals, and they have Base Camp and a lot of other products like that. They\u2019re all software as a service kind of things, and they were talking about their methodologies to create software.</p> <p>One of the big takeaways I had is that they draw out their feature list, and they cut it in half. Then they cut it in half again and again, and they try to make the most bare-bones, simple thing as possible.</p> <p>When customers come and ask for features, they say no. If people are looking for this or that, they tell them to go try their competitor. They basically say they try to keep things so simple and easy that you really can\u2019t mess it up.</p> <p>It\u2019s a different mindset. Most software people I know look at software like Bill Gates and they want every feature in the world like Microsoft Word with a billion features that no one knows how to use except the bold, italics and underline.</p> <p>I just kind of thought about that from our side. Let\u2019s make things that are simple, easy, that everyone can use. As we\u2019ve rebuilt this new automated webinar/landing page/funnel generator, this time around we\u2019ve built it way differently, where it\u2019s stripped-down, bare bones.</p> <p>It does one or two core things really well, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s turning out amazing. I\u2019m excited to start marketing, because I think people are going to really jump on it, because of how easy it is to use.</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m doing right now. I\u2019m at the hotel, going to grab Todd right now. I may do part two of this tomorrow or even tonight. I want you guys thinking about first off, creating some software, but second, creating it very simply, very easy.</p> <p>If you\u2019re thinking about that at all, I would go read Rework by Jason Fred. You should read that no matter what. Every mistake I\u2019ve made in business, when I read that book I was like, \u201cCrap, I made that mistake and that mistake.\u201d I found tons of them.</p> <p>That\u2019s about it for today. I hope you enjoyed this podcast and I will talk to you all either later today on part two of this one, or tomorrow. Thanks everyone.</p>", "duration": "09:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/35_-_Software_As_A_Service_1_-_Smackdown.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1380736800, "title": "Episode #34 \u2013 Teleseminars Are Back", "author": "", "summary": "<p>There\u2019s no school like the old school. Start using the old marketing methods that still work.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>This is Russell Brunson and this is the Marketing in your car Podcast.</p> <p>I am doing something exciting today. I am promoting a teleseminar. The last time I did a teleseminar was years ago. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve done a teleseminar. Let me tell you why I decided to do a teleseminar instead of a webinar.</p> <p>I\u2019m lazy. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but webinars take a lot of work to create and design and get the slides and all this kind of stuff. While I could do that, I don\u2019t have enough time. I\u2019m too busy right now to go and create another webinar.</p> <p>I was thinking, \u201cHow do I do this a lot easier?\u201d and I thought of teleseminars.</p> <p>It was funny to me, and maybe this is just me, but I think a lot of us do this. We find something that works really well, and for some reason we stop doing it. I made my very first million online by doing teleseminars. Every single week I was doing teleseminars.</p> <p>When I started creating the registration page for this teleseminar, I was looking at my old hard drive that had all my old websites and stuff on it. I found one that had every single one of my old teleseminars. I started looking at all these pages.</p> <p>I remember seeing a teleseminar page with Marlon Sanders, Matt Basac, Vince James, all these people I used to do teleseminars with. We made so much money doing teleseminars, and it wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as doing a webinar.</p> <p>We would get on a teleseminar, we\u2019d start talking and hanging out and at the end of it we would sell something and we always did awesome with it. It makes me laugh because I haven\u2019t done a teleseminar in years and years and years.</p> <p>It\u2019s this tool, a profitable tool that we have that we never use. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re like me, but if you are, I want to challenge you guys to do a teleseminar for your list. Again, the prep time is about a thousandth of a percent what it takes to do a webinar.</p> <p>Just see what happens. I\u2019m doing one this Friday. My plan is, now that I\u2019m back from winning the Ferrari and everything, is I want to just do a breakdown with my list going over the seven or eight steps of what they need to do in the next 30 days.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to show them that blueprint. At the end of it, I\u2019m going to have an application for them where they can apply for our coaching program. It will be fun, it will be no stress, we\u2019ll hang out, we\u2019ll have a good time and I\u2019m excited for it.</p> <p>I want to throw that out there as another marketing tool for you guys to bring back into your arsenal. If you haven\u2019t been doing them for years like me, we should try them out.</p> <p>We talk about pattern interrupts. Pattern interrupts are huge. If we are doing webinars every single time, webinar, webinar, webinar, after a while our audience starts realizing there is going to be another webinar and this is how the process works.</p> <p>You\u2019ve got to interrupt the pattern every once in a while. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited for teleseminars. I\u2019m not positive, but I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019ll see me doing a lot more teleseminars over the next few months, just because it\u2019s going to be fun to mix it up a little bit.</p> <p>When everyone else is zigging, we\u2019re going to zag. Same thing as right now: everyone is doing email and social media and we\u2019re going old-school with direct mail and telephone.</p> <p>Just have some fun mixing up your marketing messages, hitting people with different media, different ways. I think you\u2019ll be surprised at the results. I know I\u2019m excited for this, excited to see the results. Maybe I\u2019ll share with you guys on a future podcast.</p> <p>My recommendation for today is to start thinking about the telephone, start thinking about teleseminars. The service we use is www.InstantTeleseminars.com. It\u2019s a really simple, easy system to use to do a teleseminar.</p> <p>They probably have a trial, so go test one out, make a bunch of money with it and then pay the first month\u2019s bill. That\u2019s about all I\u2019ve got today. I\u2019m actually not heading to the office. I\u2019m heading to the gym right now. This is Russell Brunson and I will talk to you guys all again soon.</p>", "duration": "04:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/34_-_Teleseminars_Are_Back.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1380650400, "title": "Episode #33 \u2013 Russell Wins A Ferrari", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Hear Russell\u2019s story about their drive in the Ferrari from Las Vegas back home to Boise.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone, this is Russell Brunson and I want to welcome you to a very special episode of the Marketing in Your Car Podcast. Today I am driving in my brand new Ferrari.</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not brand new, but it\u2019s brand new to me. I don\u2019t know if you can hear that. Can you hear that? That is the engine. It is very loud.</p> <p>Anyway, I wanted to tell you guys the story of the Ferrari, because we\u2019re having a lot of fun. Give me one second and we\u2019ll get started.</p> <p>This will be less content and more entertainment; because I thought it was a fun weekend. We won this Ferrari in the Pure Leverage contest, which was pretty cool.</p> <p>I\u2019m driving and everyone is staring at me. It\u2019s kind of fun. At the event, they called us onstage at the last day and said, \u201cWe\u2019re taking a break. You can take a break if you want to, but we\u2019re going to go down and give Russell a Ferrari.\u201d</p> <p>They took me and my wife outside and we had about 250 people following us down the hall, out into the lobby, out in front of the hotel. Then Joel who gave us the Ferrari pulled it up next to everybody, revved the engine.</p> <p>Then we got in and literally our car got surrounded by 250 people, all with cameras and iPads and iPhones. It felt like paparazzi, like I was someone famous or something like that.</p> <p>Then we got in the car and took off and sped around the corner just to kind of hide. When we got around the corner, it was just this dead-end parking lot, but they told us to wait until the crowd came back in. We sat there just waiting for the crowd to come back in.</p> <p>When we got back, sure enough, there were some lingerers who came over and ambushed us and wanted pictures. It was kind of crazy. That was what we did that night. Then we took it to the valet and they parked it.</p> <p>The next day we decided we were going to drive home, all the way from Las Vegas to Boise in it. We came back to the valet and they brought the car back to us.</p> <p>It was funny because this sweet car pulls up and everybody is waiting to see who it\u2019s for, and it\u2019s my wife and I. I look like a little kid with my backpack, and we walk over, jump in and take off.</p> <p>I\u2019m not much of a car person, so I don\u2019t really know how to drive a car like this. It\u2019s kind of different. We\u2019re driving away from Vegas and we need gas, so we pull into this gas station outside of Vegas.</p> <p>As soon as we pull in, we get swarmed by people from in front, behind, all of them coming around taking pictures of the car and asking if they can look at the engine. I even had a guy ask me for money, which was really exciting.</p> <p>It was kind of creepy though. We weren\u2019t ready or used to that attention. After we filled up with gas, then all these people are swarming us. We were trying to start the car and leave.</p> <p>The way you put it in reverse is weird. I was trying to put it in reverse to back up because there was a car in front of us filling up with gas and it wouldn\u2019t go in reverse for anything I would try. I was like, \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p> <p>Then another car pulls up behind us and we\u2019re stuck here with all these people taking pictures, cars in front of us, cars in back of us and I can\u2019t reverse the car. I start the car and then it dies. I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, the car in front of us started pulling forward so we started the car again and took off. We were kind of at a truck stop, so we were stuck behind all these trucks. We got out the owner\u2019s manual and spent 30 minutes reading and trying to figure out how to put the car in reverse, how to put the top back up and all these things.</p> <p>We finally figured out how to learn it. We jumped on the freeway and started driving. Three times, people would speed up next to us and take pictures of us while we were driving. It was kind of crazy.</p> <p>We brought a Go-Pro camera and mounted it to the front of the car, so we\u2019ve filmed the entire drive home. On our way home, we were going through Utah. I grew up in Utah, so we stopped in St. George and saw my sister and her family and took them all on rides. Then we stopped and took all my cousins on a ride.</p> <p>We ended up stopping eight times in two days and gave everyone rides in the car and everything. It was fun. It was a long drive, though. It took us pretty much two days to get home.</p> <p>Then when we got home, it was raining in Boise, so we got home in the rain. Then we picked up my kids and took each of them, one at a time, for a ride. We found this little place behind our house where there are no cars, and I took it there and I just floored it.</p> <p>We took off and my youngest kept saying, \u201cDaddy, I want to go in the racecar.\u201d That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing and it\u2019s been a ton of fun.</p> <p>Anyway, there\u2019s not much content today. I just wanted to tell you guys a story about the Ferrari. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. I\u2019m at the office now and I\u2019m having a guy come to detail it today. We\u2019ll get it all detailed up and I\u2019ll have a nice car to drive around town, so that will be fun.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s about it. I hope you have a great day today. This contest was interesting. Even though everyone was competing for it, there were a lot of people who had no chance. Why should they even try to win a Ferrari? Why should they even try to win it?</p> <p>I just say, for you guys, think about 10 years ago. 10 years ago I was in the exact same situation you guys are in. I was looking at these contests and I never had a shot to win them, but I tried. By trying, I learned different things. I learned that if I give bonuses, more people will buy.</p> <p>If I do webinars, more people will buy. I tried to figure out different ways to sell stuff. To win the Ferrari I had to basically do a blend of most of those things. We gave away bonuses, we did webinars, we did teleseminars. We did all sorts of things to do this.</p> <p>It\u2019s taken me 10 years to get to a point where I can win a prize like this. For some of you guys, I would start now. Look for contests that are happening online in your market. I guarantee most markets have some kind of online contest happening. Go enter and try to win them and see what happens.</p> <p>We had a chance in Vegas to hang out with my buddy Dave Gardner. Dave is an interesting guy. He came to Kenya with us last year. He won a prize that we were doing to take one of our students to Kenya. He won that.</p> <p>I was reading this book he wrote, and he was talking about how he won that prize and he won three or four prizes. I\u2019m like, \u201cHow do you win all these prizes?\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cI just enter them and do my best.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of people don\u2019t enter because they don\u2019t think they can win, so they don\u2019t, whereas someone like Dave tries a lot of them and he wins a lot of them.</p> <p>I guess that\u2019s my motivation for today: go out there and try. You never know what\u2019s going to happen a year from now, five years from now, ten years from now. Heck, one of you guys might win this Ferrari when I give it away in a year or so. Who knows?</p> <p>Thanks, you guys. I will talk to you all tomorrow.</p>", "duration": "07:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/33_-_Russell_Wins_A_Ferrari.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1380132000, "title": "Episode #32 \u2013 No Success Can Compensate For Failure In The Home", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Most entrepreneurs get into business to create the perfect lifestyle, but within a year or so have created nothing more than an over-worked, underpaid job. How to structure the lifestyle of your dreams while you are building your business.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>This is Russell Brunson and this is the Marketing in your car Podcast.</p> <p>Hey, guys and gals, this is Russell. Today is an exciting day. I am actually heading to Vegas to go pick up my Ferrari that I won, which is pretty exciting. Then we\u2019re going to jump in the car and drive it all the way home.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if I told you guys this or not, but I had a really cool idea. I went and bought a Go-Pro camera. I\u2019m going to mount the camera on the dashboard of the Ferrari looking out and I\u2019m going to record the whole trip driving home.</p> <p>After I get home, I\u2019ll take the footage of that and make a time lapse video of the footage and use it as a background of a sales video. I thought that was kind of fun.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m about to go do this really cool, exciting business thing. I actually went and dropped my three-year-old at pre-school. All that\u2019s going through my head right now is a quote from a religious leader named David O. McKay.</p> <p>He said, \u201cNo success can compensate for failure of the home.\u201d</p> <p>Today I want to talk about that, how important our families are. I\u2019m as guilty as anyone, but we get in this business initially because we\u2019re like, \u201cIf we do this, we\u2019re going to have time freedom and we\u2019re going to have money and we\u2019re going to do all these things.\u201d</p> <p>We get into that with that goal. But what happens at first? We quickly find out that being entrepreneurs is not quite as easy as we thought it was going to be when we get signed up, which is a good thing. If it was super easy, then everyone would do it, right?</p> <p>We go from doing the typical thing where people are working 8 hours a day to working 20 hours a day. The goal is, \u201cAfter I make it, I\u2019ll cut my hours back to a 4-hour work week or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s kind of what our goal is. The problem is, there are a lot reasons, but I think we get addicted to the business. You get significance out of it. You get love and connection. All these needs you have are being met by your business.</p> <p>Because of that, it starts growing, you start having success, and after a while you realize, I like this and I\u2019m having a good time. I\u2019ve been spending 20 hours a day building this business up to this point and I really enjoy it, I\u2019m going to keep on doing it.</p> <p>The next thing you know, one year turns into two, two turns into three and eventually it\u2019s been 10 years and you\u2019re just killing yourself over this business. The reason why you got in, to be able to have the time freedom and to be able to spend more time with your kids, what you get is the exact opposite of that.</p> <p>You get basically a glorified job where you\u2019re working more hours. You\u2019re probably making more money, but not having the freedom that you got in this business for. I\u2019ve been really recently thinking about that.</p> <p>I was listening to this really cool course that I found on eBay. It\u2019s actually J. Abraham, Chet Holmes and Jake Carter Livingston. They put this product together called Gorilla vs Gorilla. I found the cassette tapes on eBay. I couldn\u2019t find the actual product anywhere, but I found the cassette tapes.</p> <p>I was super excited because I love new marketing courses. All three of those guys are awesome. I was listening to it and Jake Carter Livingston said something interesting.</p> <p>He said all of us get into a business thinking, \u201cAfter I do this, I\u2019m going to start working four days a week. After I do this, then I\u2019m going to do this.\u201d</p> <p>He said the problem is we\u2019re creating habits. Whatever habit you create right now, that habit is going to stick with you even after you\u2019re successful. If you make a habit of working 20 hours a day, you\u2019re going to continue to work 20 hours a day.</p> <p>When I listened to that tape set, after I went and found a tape player to listen to it, it made me think about myself. What are the habits that I\u2019m in? I realized that for probably five years I\u2019ve been saying that myself: \u201cI\u2019m going to do this after this happens,\u201d but that thing never comes.</p> <p>I kind of made a conscious decision a little while ago. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to start crafting my day the way I want it to be when I feel like I\u2019ve achieved whatever dream I\u2019m chasing.\u201d I want to do that now because I want to create that habit.</p> <p>I readjusted some of my life, and it\u2019s bene really cool. You can probably tell my voice sounds kind of funny. It\u2019s because part of it is I realized I missed my wrestling. It\u2019s hard. There\u2019s no one who really wants to wrestle a 33-year-old dude. It\u2019s hard to find any wrestling partners.</p> <p>But it turns out everyone in the world wants to be a cage fighter, so everyone wants to do Jujitsu and grappling and stuff like that. I was like, \u201cThis will be fun. I\u2019ll find someone who\u2019s really good and I\u2019m going to start adding Jujitsu into my weekly routine.\u201d</p> <p>I hired a black belt and twice a week I go in and I get beat on by a black belt. I\u2019m learning Jujitsu from him. That\u2019s why my voice is so scratchy today. He brought in some other dudes to roll with me. I\u2019m not a slouch. I was a top 15 in the country wrestler in college. I took second in the country in high school.</p> <p>I can hold my own, but this new sport may be similar to wrestling, but it\u2019s not the same. He brought in some brown belts who have been doing it for 15 years and we rolled yesterday. I did all right, considering all things. I hung with them well, but as a whole I got beat bad.</p> <p>I jammed my ring finger and it\u2019s swelling up to the size of a watermelon. I can\u2019t fit my wedding ring on right now. I got chocked out probably eight or nine times. Typically you do a carotid artery choke, a blood choke. Those aren\u2019t that bad. It cuts the blood off from your brain and everything goes dark and you pass out, or you tap out.</p> <p>But he caught me on three front chokes, which are more like windpipe chokes, which cuts the oxygen off, and it thrashed my voice. It\u2019s kind of crazy since I\u2019m going to be speaking tomorrow at a seminar with 1,000 people. Hopefully my voice will last.</p> <p>I made it a part of my day. I said, \u201cWhen I\u2019ve arrived and I\u2019m happy with where I\u2019m at, that\u2019s what I want to do. I want to be wrestling and doing Jujitsu and lifting weights.\u201d So I crafted my day to kind of do those things.</p> <p>I said, \u201cI want to spend more time with my kids,\u201d so I changed the time I come home every night. I changed what I do when I get home. I started changing up my life to be what I want to be when I get to wherever I\u2019m going.</p> <p>I would encourage that for you guys. That quote from David O. McKay is powerful: \u201cNo success can compensate for failure of the home.\u201d</p> <p>I truly believe that. For all of you guys, I want you to take that to heart. Start today to create the lifestyle you want, because it\u2019s going to be a habit, whatever you do.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get caught in the whole 20-hour workdays that most entrepreneurs do. Obviously, there are times you need to do that, especially when you\u2019re first growing and first building, but really make sure that you structure your time and structure your life so it will be the way you want it to be when you get there.</p> <p>Otherwise, you\u2019ll get so addicted to this journey, because it\u2019s fun, this whole entrepreneurial journey. If you get addicted to it, you\u2019ll miss out on what it was you were actually going for to begin with.</p> <p>That\u2019s it for today. I\u2019m going home, I\u2019m packing up my bags and I\u2019m about to jump out and head for the airport. All I have for you guys is remember, \u201cNo success can compensate for failure in the home.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks so much.

It\u2019s really dark outside today. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but it looks like the seasons are changing. I hope you\u2019re having a great day. I\u2019ve got some cool things to talk to you about today.</p> <p>I actually want to talk about the coolest strategy in the world to learn anything you want and make a whole bunch of money while you\u2019re doing it. The reason why this was brought to my attention was I had done this two or three times when I got started in this business, and it\u2019s how I learned a lot of my internet marketing stuff and it\u2019s how I started making money.</p> <p>For some reason that still makes no sense to me, we stopped doing them, which is always smart. One of my friends and mentor David Frye, he went on and took this concept and did two and a half years\u2019 worth and made over a quarter million doing it.</p> <p>The thing that I\u2019m talking about is telesummits. You guys may have seen or heard of telesummits. I actually have two telesummits I\u2019m planning on doing with the sole purpose of learning a whole bunch of stuff from really smart people, and I want to make money while I\u2019m doing it.</p> <p>This is an alternate route to going to college. I think it\u2019s a lot better and will serve you way better. This is kind of like my college alternative. I think you should go to school, mostly because that\u2019s where the girls are at if you\u2019re a guy, and where the guys are at if you\u2019re a girl. If you\u2019re in sports, there are a lot of good reasons for college.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t think learning how to make money is one of the things on the list. This is the process. For example, two things I really want to learn more about right now: first is the Kindle. I want to learn how to publish better on the Kindle. Second, supplements. We\u2019re doing well with our supplement business, but I really want to take it to the next level.</p> <p>That\u2019s the two businesses I want to grow. What I plan to do is basically do a telesummit. This is how it works: for example, in the supplement space I know maybe 10-15 people who are doing really well in supplements, anywhere from $100,000 a month up to $1 million a month and beyond.</p> <p>My goal, my plan is to basically contact each of them and say, \u201cI\u2019m doing this really cool supplement telesummit where basically I\u2019m going to pick the brains of people that are doing well in supplements and ask them a bunch of questions. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019d be willing to jump on and let me interview you for an hour.\u201d</p> <p>Usually, most people when you ask them something like that, will say yes. You\u2019ll get some no\u2019s, some people are very secretive, but for the most part they don\u2019t really care. They don\u2019t mind sharing their business because it\u2019s fun for them and they like talking about it.</p> <p>I say that the big famous gurus, when they go home at night, they go home to a wife who doesn\u2019t really care what they do. They usually enjoy talking to people who actually care what they do. It\u2019s fun for them.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to line up basically 10-15 interviews with the top supplement guys in the world. Again, I could just do it and have that be it, or I could do a telesummit where I can say, \u201cThis is a supplement telesummit. If you\u2019re interested in supplements, come register. It\u2019s free to register and you can listen in on these calls with me.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards we can either sell the transcripts or the mp3 versions. There are a lot of different ways you can monetize it. There\u2019s that, plus you get the chance to pick the brain of 10-15 people that are doing exactly what you want to be doing.</p> <p>Same thing with Kindle. I really am intrigued by the Kindle stuff. I haven\u2019t done any of it yet. But the way I look at it, it\u2019s an easy way to publish products. It\u2019s a really good way to do lead-generation and stuff like that. I really want to learn the ins and outs before I dive into it.</p> <p>Instead of what most people do, which is try to just figure it out, I\u2019m going to find the 10-15 best people in the world who each have their way they do Kindle stuff. I\u2019m going to interview them all and pretty quick I\u2019ll get a picture of how I want to go and attack that world.</p> <p>If I was going to go into SEO, I would do the same thing: find 10-15 people who are the best in the SEO world, do a telesummit, make some money selling tickets to it, and I have a chance to learn from 10-15 of the smartest people in the world.</p> <p>I learned this concept from Howard Berg. He\u2019s the world\u2019s fastest reader. We\u2019ve done a lot of work with him. Some of you were in the course we did with him. What was interesting was he told me most people will go and buy a book and they get that author\u2019s perspective on the topic.</p> <p>Usually, after reading one book that becomes their truth. \u201cI read a book and it said this.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cWhat I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll go and read 10-15 books on the topic. I get 20 people\u2019s opinions, and from there I can base and create my own opinion.\u201d</p> <p>I really thought that was a powerful thing. I really like that. That\u2019s how I try to approach things: not to just read one dude\u2019s thing and go out there and follow it, but to go out there and find 10-15 different people, different ideas on how something works.</p> <p>Then, after learning from all of them, take that and figure out what my game plan is, what my strategy is, based on that kind of stuff.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t done a telesummit yet, I recommend doing it. Again, I\u2019m doing it for a couple reasons. One is to make a little extra money. Number two is just to have the ability to learn very, very quickly a topic that is very specific and learn directly from the horse\u2019s mouth, directly from people who are actually making a ton of money doing it.</p> <p>And it will be a lot of fun as well. If you haven\u2019t had a telesummit yet, they\u2019re very easy to execute and pull off, and they can be very profitable for you. Go and do a telesummit.</p> <p>I could tell you stories and stories about how much money people made doing telesummits. David Frye just started doing over 100 telesummits, and now he\u2019s selling off all his domains and telesummits.</p> <p>I have a friend, Sonja Ricotti, she makes millions every year doing telesummits. It\u2019s a very good business model. Worst case, you have the opportunity to pick the brains of some of the best people in the world. I really think that\u2019s the power behind these telesummits.</p> <p>Go out, try one, get some information, learn some stuff, and we\u2019ll talk to you all again next time.</p>", "duration": "07:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/31_-_The_Power_Of_A_Telesummit.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1379959200, "title": "Episode #30 \u2013 How To Ascend Your Customers", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell maps out how he has structured his coaching programs to automatically ascend his customers to the next level of coaching!</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>This is Russell Brunson and this is the Marketing in your car Podcast.</p> <p>Hey, everyone. I am driving to the office now this Monday morning. I am very excited for this week for a couple reasons. First off, I\u2019ve got some fun projects I\u2019m working on. Second off, I am actually this week flying to Vegas to go pick up a Ferrari I won.</p> <p>I won it in a sales contest for Pure Leverage, a new auto-responder company that was launching. We sold 1,100-1,200 people to it within a month, which was enough to win a Ferrari. I\u2019m going to go pick it up and we\u2019re going to drive it all the way from Vegas back to Boise, which is going to be pretty fun.</p> <p>In fact, I bought a Go-Pro camera and I\u2019m going to mount it on the dashboard of the Ferrari looking out and record the entire drive home. Then I\u2019m going to time lapse that drive and have it as the background of a sales video. I\u2019m pretty excited. It\u2019s going to be fun.</p> <p>What I want to talk to you guys today is I want to give you guys an idea and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot as we\u2019ve been rebuilding our coaching programs. One of the last podcasts talked about how we have been dabbling with starting back up some of our coaching programs, selling high-ticket stuff but doing it much differently.</p> <p>Instead of having 60 sales guys like I did back in an earlier version of Russell, we\u2019ll do it pretty small where we pre-qualify and basically only call a few people who make the cut to work with us. So far, it\u2019s been really good.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been learning a lot along the way and it\u2019s exciting. One concept I wanted to talk to you guys about, since it\u2019s something I\u2019m implementing and anyone can implement it, is really focusing on your value ladder.</p> <p>You\u2019re bringing someone through some sort of chain of offers. Someone comes in initially at a smaller price and then you upgrade them to a higher price and you\u2019re trying to get them up to your high-ticket things.</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking at the Dan Kennedy world, where I used to spend a lot of time with Dan Glazier and stuff, he calls it the ascension model, how to get your customers to ascend naturally.</p> <p>As we\u2019ve been building this whole program out, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about that ascension strategy, how we get them to move from one to the next to the next.</p> <p>When we create our packages, our first coaching package that we have is about $5,500. It\u2019s really like a fast-start 30-day coaching program where they get 30 days working with me directly and with one of our coaches to get their business launched. I don\u2019t think it takes more than 30 days to launch most businesses if you have some sort of product already. It\u2019s just marketing and that kind of stuff.</p> <p>That\u2019s our initial offer. After that happens, my goal is to put people through a program called Decade in a Day. I you look at Tony Robbins, at his events he talks about how you can compress decades into days.</p> <p>For example, you have someone who spent the last decade learning about the stock market or whatever their passion is, and they spent a decade learning that stuff and they wrote a book. You take that book and you can compress what they learned in a decade down into a few days.</p> <p>I thought it was a cool concept, so we launched our second tier, which is called Decade in a Day. It\u2019s not as expensive. We\u2019re only charging $3,500 for it. Basically it\u2019s a one-day program with me virtually, where you and the five or six or ten other people who signed up for Decade in a Day get on a virtual webinar with me.</p> <p>For an entire day, I sit down and I rebuild your business, and then the next person\u2019s business, then the next person\u2019s business. You have a chance to have your own business re-tweaked and rebuilt on top of going and watching me critique and rebuild nine or ten others\u2019 during that day.</p> <p>The whole goal is to compress a decade of learning into a day. Basically, to kind of take you on whatever path you\u2019re going, lift you up and shift in the right direction or make the tweaks or whatever it is. That\u2019s our second program: a Decade in a Day.</p> <p>The goal at the end of Decade in a Day is to upgrade people to our $25,000 a year mastermind group. That\u2019s the progression we\u2019re taking people down. What\u2019s cool about it, if you look at what we\u2019re doing, each program is designed to sell the next program.</p> <p>It goes from quick-start, and after that 30 days their business should be done. The next offer is, \u201cNow you need our Decade in a Day so Russell can go and critique your business. Now that we\u2019ve built this thing, let\u2019s put it on autopilot.\u201d</p> <p>We give them a voucher toward that so they get a discount on the second if they bought the first. Then after Decade in a Day it\u2019s like, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve done this, let\u2019s go over to this yearly program so we can do this more frequently with me meeting you in person, etc. etc.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going in. The takeaway I want you guys to have is positioning and creating your program so that each thing sells the next thing.</p> <p>The first time I really saw this was with Tony Robbins and Chet Holmes\u2019 business, the Business Breakthroughs. Basically they sell you into a webinar, and on that webinar they sell you into their coaching. In their coaching, they sell you into their high-ticket coaching.</p> <p>Each one is created and structured to ascend you to the next one. I don\u2019t think many of us think of our business that way. I know even when we had our call center of 60 people and we were doing crazy numbers, we were never trying to ascend anybody. That was the end of the value ladder. It ended there.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s important to look at something and say, \u201cHow can I help someone? How can I take them to the next step?\u201d and really focus on how to ascend up and providing enough value that they want to and are able to.</p> <p>Especially if you\u2019re in a how to make money business, they should be able to make enough money during the first program to afford the second one and so on. If not, there\u2019s probably something wrong.</p> <p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m working on in my business. I think it\u2019s interesting and I hope you guys found it interesting as well. Just think about how you can create your product line so that each offer makes someone want to ascend up to the next offer.</p> <p>That\u2019s about it for today.

Welcome to the Marketing in Your Car Podcast. I am so excited to be with you today. Today I want to share with you guys a story of what happened to me a little while ago in New York. There was this group I wanted to check out and join. It\u2019s Joe Polish\u2019s $25,000 group.</p> <p>There was an initiation meeting in New York where you pay $10,000 to go there for two days. If you like it, you pay the extra $15,000 to join the $25,000 group.</p> <p>I wanted to go out there, but there were a couple issues. One, it was the same time as my anniversary. Two, it was in New York across the country. And three, I had to convince my wife that we should be in New York instead.</p> <p>I pulled off an elaborate scheme to convince her that we needed to be in New York for our anniversary, me and her, then I could go to the meeting. Luckily for me, it all worked out and we were able to do that. We went like four or five days early to New York.</p> <p>My wife and I got to hang out and have fun the first couple days. On Monday morning we went to the today show and we jumped around behind Natalie Mirales and the others. It was cool, we were on TV. Our kids thought we were rock stars.</p> <p>That night, we went and saw Wicked the play, and that was really cool. I had never even heard that story before, so that was really fun. The next morning we went to the Kelly and Michael Show. Kelly was gone, but Michael was there, and the co-host was Rebecca Romaine, which was awesome.</p> <p>The guest was Carrie Underwood, so we got to be two feet away from Carrie Underwood, which was cool. And once again, we were on TV and our kids saw us.</p> <p>That night we went to a taping of America\u2019s Got Talent, so that was really cool. That was the fun part of the trip for my wife and I. Then the next two days we had the mastermind meeting.</p> <p>We were there and the mastermind was really good. At the end they had a guy who a lot of you guys have probably heard of. Tim Ferriss got up and spoke.</p> <p>I really enjoy reading Tim\u2019s stuff, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a very good presenter. When he speaks, he\u2019s a little dry and boring for me. I remember he was talking about venture capitalists and stuff that doesn\u2019t really interest me at all. I was zoning out a little bit.</p> <p>At the end, he opened it up for Q&amp;A, and one person got up and I\u2019ve had people ask me this question before so I kind of almost rolled my eyes when they said it.</p> <p>They said, \u201cTim, what question should we be asking you?\u201d</p> <p>Tim sat there and thought for a minute and said, \u201cAsk me how come I will never let the media follow me around for a day, because they ask me all the time. They want to see a day in the life of Tim Ferriss.\u201d</p> <p>The guy was like, \u201cAll right, how come you never let the media follow you around for a day?\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cBecause if you look at my day, I wake up in the morning, I do some meditation, then I eat cereal, then I go on a walk. Then I read some books, then I surf on the internet. If you were to look at what I do every day, you\u2019d think I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t work like most people. Most people have a to-do list of all their tasks for the day. They try to go knock out each to-do one at a time, and at the end of the day if they\u2019ve knocked them all out, they feel accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cI work way differently. I like to sit back and look for the one big, huge domino that if I push that domino down, it will knock down and make every other domino obsolete. That\u2019s how I can accomplish so much. I\u2019m not racing and running into the next thing and the next thing. I sit back and I look for the big domino.\u201d</p> <p>That was his advice. It was interesting because I am very much the opposite. I am someone who sits there and just tries to get tasks done. It has served me well in life, just doing thing after thing after thing. But it also has gotten me in trouble multiple times.</p> <p>One day I woke up and I had 100 employees working for me, and it was because of that: me running and running and running and not really sitting back and looking at the strategy behind things and waiting to find that one big domino.</p> <p>I remember when I got back from New York I went on a trip to the Dominican Republic. After I got back from that, I came back and I told my team that. I spent the next three or four days sitting in front of a whiteboard.</p> <p>We have a wall in our office that is just a big whiteboard, and there\u2019s a couch in front of it. I sat in that couch for days, trying to figure out what is our big domino. What is the one thing we can do that makes everything else obsolete?</p> <p>It was hard, because I wanted to go and check my email and check the next task. I\u2019m always a hustler, trying to go on and speed to the next thing, and in this case I didn\u2019t do that. I tried to sit back and look at it strategically. It was interesting.</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of cool if you think about it. I\u2019ve been doing Jujitsu for the last little while, and Jujitsu is kind of a similar concept. In wrestling it\u2019s very aggressive and you\u2019re always going, going, going. But in Jujitsu it\u2019s a lot different.</p> <p>Jujitsu is a lot slower, a lot more methodical. You\u2019re just looking for the next strategic thing. I enjoy it a lot, but its way different than wrestling in that way.</p> <p>This kind of feels like the Jujitsu style, where you\u2019re slowly looking for that move that will get them to tap out, as opposed to trying to score point after point after point.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting, the different mindsets. I\u2019m in the wrestler mindset, the to-do mindset, let\u2019s knock things out as quick as we can and accomplish stuff fast. I\u2019ve been trying over the last month or so now to focus on what is that one big domino that I\u2019m going to knock down.</p> <p>It\u2019s been interesting. It\u2019s been fun to look at my business from that standpoint. I just encourage you guys to slow down a little bit, sit back and think about what\u2019s the one big domino you can knock down that makes all the other dominoes obsolete?</p> <p>If you can find that, you can make a lot more money in a lot less time. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve got for you guys today. I hope you enjoyed it. If you do like these podcasts, please go to MarketingInYourCar.com or go to iTunes and give some feedback. I\u2019d love to see it. It\u2019s exciting for me.

It has been a little while since we\u2019ve done a podcast, mostly because I\u2019ve just been gone. We did some crazy trips, spent some time in New York. I went to the Dominican Republic. I was gone for all of August. It\u2019s just been crazy.</p> <p>I apologize, I\u2019ve not been as faithful. But I am back now and ready to rock and roll. It\u2019s been an interesting last couple of weeks or so. We\u2019ve been trying to figure out ways to separate our businesses. I didn\u2019t really think about my business very well when it got started.</p> <p>We launched DotComSecrets.com and this other thing and this other thing, and now we have like five or six other brands under DotComSecrets.com: DotComSecretsLocal, DotComSecretsX, DotComSecretsLabs.</p> <p>Every one of those really caters to a different market. DotComSecretsX is more for beginners and internet marketers, whereas DotComSecrets is more for startups. We\u2019re trying to think about how to separate everything and still keep it together.</p> <p>We finally figured out a way. I\u2019m excited. Over the next month or so you\u2019ll see us roll out this new model I am really excited about. That\u2019s cool.</p> <p>Another thing I want to talk about today because I\u2019ve been in the middle of it for the last little while: some of you know we had a call center that we built up to about 60 sales guys with about 12 coaches fulfilling what the sales guys were selling.</p> <p>It was a big operation. It was kind of a nightmare, not going to lie. But it was fun and we had a good time with it. About three years ago we shut it down. There were a lot of reasons why we shut it down. Liability was one of them. It was interesting.</p> <p>For the last two and a half or three years, we haven\u2019t sold really high-ticket back-end stuff. I always missed that money. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what is the best way to do it. I tried selling high-ticket stuff off of webinars. It didn\u2019t work so well.</p> <p>One of the nice things about the phone is you can sell really high-ticket stuff, but I do not want to sentence myself into having 60 sales guys.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been watching a lot of different people and a lot of different markets. I\u2019m one of those guys who buys from everybody and watches what they\u2019re doing and listens in to see what is working right now.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen people in a bunch of different industries who are doing call centers and doing similar revenue numbers to what we were doing when we had 60 people, but they\u2019re doing it with one or two people.</p> <p>It\u2019s really interesting. Basically it comes down to just a couple little things. The first one, and this is the big key, is laser targeting who it is you want to sell to.</p> <p>When we were doing the call center with 60 sales guys, we made our offer so low-barrier that it opened up the world to everybody. Everybody would want it.</p> <p>We called every single person in the world trying to sell this coaching. The hard thing about that is we had 60 guys to call every single lead and filter and find out who these people were, whereas most people are doing it very small-scale.</p> <p>They are laser targeting their audience, primarily through Facebook and direct mail and things like that. When we had our call center, I had to get between 5,000-8,000 buyer leads a month to keep the floor open, which is crazy.</p> <p>With this new model, you only have to get about 60 applications a month to make similar numbers. In laser marketing you\u2019re not trying to sell to everybody in the world. You\u2019re trying to figure out who is your perfect ideal client who would really want this. That\u2019s who you go and you target. That was the first thing that was interesting.</p> <p>The next thing is that, instead of trying to sell them something, when we would call them blindly and try to upsell them to coaching, you switch around and you make them apply for it.</p> <p>You make them fill out this huge application. The more questions, the better, because you want them to actually think about it. Again, it\u2019s just another filtering technique that pulls out more and more people.</p> <p>Then we do the call. The call is a lot easier, because at that point they know they\u2019re going to be sold something. They are interested in the topic anyway and it becomes really easy.</p> <p>We launched our first new call center yesterday and it\u2019s been interesting. We sent out some messages and we got about 100 and something applications back so far. We are calling those and the conversation is really different.</p> <p>It\u2019s not us trying to convince them to buy something. It\u2019s about just trying to see if it\u2019s a good fit. It\u2019s been interesting.</p> <p>I\u2019m really enjoying it so far. I\u2019m sure over the next few weeks and months I\u2019ll report back as we sort of master this thing. So far, that\u2019s where it\u2019s at. Anyway, if you\u2019re looking at selling high-ticket stuff, it\u2019s interesting for me to look at these models and play with them a little bit.</p> <p>Look at that. Look at putting up an application for some high-ticket thing you have. Send an email to your list or go on Facebook and target the perfect, ideal buyer for yourself, and then have that application for them to call on the phone and have that happen.</p> <p>It\u2019s been working pretty good for us so far. I just got here to the office. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re going to close a whole bunch of deals today and change people\u2019s lives with the stuff we do for them. It\u2019s going to be exciting. Anyway, I appreciate you guys. I hope you enjoy this podcast and I dare, you I double dare you, to go out and test some of these strategies. Thanks, everybody, and I will talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "06:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/28_-_The_New_Backend.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1373306400, "title": "Episode #27 \u2013 Banner Ads At The Parade", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How you can use your online influence to make money from advertisers.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>This is Russell Brunson and this is the Marketing in your car Podcast.</p> <p>Today I\u2019m heading to the office and actually my son Dallan is coming with me today. You guys heard about Dallan on yesterday\u2019s podcast. Dallan has been saving up money for the WiiU. He asked this week if I would hire him, the day after the 4th of July, which is today. I just hired Dallan and he is coming to the office with me today. He\u2019s got his chalkboard with him and his crayons and his whiteboard and he is going to make some money. He\u2019s excited.</p> <p>The other thing I wanted to talk to you today about is, yesterday we had our 4th of July parade and there were some lessons that were really fun with it. I remember as a little kid going to parades, and they were insanely awesome. There were big ole floats and all kinds of crazy stuff. Yesterday we went to the Boise parade. The Boise parade was a little disappointing, not going to lie. It was mostly cars with banner ads stuck to the side of them. I realized very quickly that all a parade really is, at least the kind of parade we went to yesterday, is a marketing tool. They talk about getting excited and hyped up.</p> <p>A whole bunch of people show up in this one spot and these cars with banner ads come by that basically tell you to go do things. We saw banner ads for all sorts of things. Every float had some kind of advertisement on it, and there was no purpose for a float other than they were trying to advertise for whatever their thing was.</p> <p>I thought it was interesting. Then what was kind of cool was at the end we saw the Costa Vita car drive by and we were hungry and said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s go to Costa Vita.\u201d We thought the only one was far away, but we saw on the car an address for one that was about a block from where we were at. We walked over and had lunch at Costa Vita. It actually worked. The advertising worked on us. It made me think about, there\u2019s a lot of ways to make money online. There\u2019s a thousand different ways to make money online.</p> <p>One of them that works really efficiently and really effectively is to get a website that has tons and tons of visitors just like a parade, and have good content or good floats or things that are there that get people\u2019s eyeballs there. Then on the sides and middle and all over the place you just sell banner ads. It\u2019s kind of interesting. That is an amazing business model. That\u2019s how parades work. That\u2019s how a lot of businesses offline work. It\u2019s the same thing online.</p> <p>For a lot of you guys, if you think about it that way, for you to make money online is kind of a two-step process. The first thing, just like the parade, you\u2019ve got to get a whole bunch of eyeballs there. If you get a whole bunch of eyeballs there, the advertisers will come.</p> <p>There\u2019s a really cool book that I read recently. It\u2019s called Trust Me, I\u2019m Lying. I highly recommend it, you guys should read it. It just talks about how media is passed through online, back to the traditional media outlets. It\u2019s a pretty controversial book, very interesting to read. One of the things he talked about is how bloggers make their money. They write unique, interesting stories that get a lot of attention and get a lot of views, because bloggers make money for every view that comes to their site, or if they work for a company it\u2019s the same thing.</p> <p>They get their base salary, but they get a penny for every person who comes and looks at it. They are not incentivized by sharing true stories; they are incentivized by sharing controversial stories to get people talking. That\u2019s why the media channels are so messed up these days. It\u2019s kind of interesting. I\u2019m saying that because for you, if you want to start getting eyeballs, you can start selling advertising on your site. You\u2019ve just got to be exciting or controversial or whatever.</p> <p>That\u2019s the biggest key. If you put out that content and put out videos and start blogging and all those things, that\u2019s when you start getting eyeballs. It\u2019s like a parade, and at that point you can go and sell advertising, either your own products or other people\u2019s products. That is the key.</p> <p>We are now at the office. Dallan and I are here and we are ready to work hard. I hope you guys are as well. That\u2019s about it for today. If you enjoyed this podcast, please go to iTunes.com and look for the Marketing in Your Car Podcast. We would love to hear from you. That\u2019s about it. Thanks, everybody.

Welcome to the Marketing In Your Car podcast. This is Russell Brunson, and I\u2019m going to welcome you to today.</p> <p>Okay, so today\u2019s a beautiful day. Yesterday it was 108\u00b0 here in Boise, which in insane, and it\u2019s supposed to be 108\u00b0 again today. It\u2019s going to be hot, but I woke up this morning to a really funny experience.</p> <p>About 7:30 the phone rang, and I picked up and answered it and it was a lady asking for Dallin. Dallin is one of my twins, he\u2019s seven-years-old, and I said, \u201cWell, Dallin is one of my seven-year-old sons. Can I help you?\u201d</p> <p>She said, \u201cOh, sorry. Somebody had filled out an application for a job for him, and I was just calling to return the call. I\u2019ll take him off our list.\u201d</p> <p>And I was like, \u201cWhat in the world? Someone filled out a job application for my seven-year-old son?\u201d and so then my wife stumbles out of bed to come find out, who it was that called, and I told her.</p> <p>She starts laughing hysterically, and anyway\u2026 So here, let me tell you the backstory to this story because it\u2019s actually pretty awesome. So Dallin, actually both my kids, Dallin and Bowen, both my twins.</p> <p>A little while ago, whenever I\u2019m like dad, my wife\u2019s out of town where she gone wherever, I like to take the kids treasure hunting. Which basically means we go to pawn shops, and I try to find silver coins and then they try to find treasures too, so it\u2019s really fun.</p> <p>So anyway, one of the pawnshops we were at, probably six months ago, they found Super Mario Brothers U, which I thought that meant Super Mario Brothers University.</p> <p>And anyway, it turns out all it means is it\u2019s Super Mario Brothers for the Wii U, and the Wii U turns out to be a whole separate console, so I bought this game at a pawnshop, take it home. We can't play it, and we find out we have to spend another $350 to get the console.</p> <p>Now, I already think my kids play way too many video games, and I\u2019m not really into having them go and have another console. So I said, \u201cHey, well, if you want this money, you\u2019ve got to earn it.\u201d</p> <p>So I went and got a jar and on the front of it we wrote \u201cWii U $350,\u201d and they\u2019ve been saving all their pennies and their coins and their money in this jar to try to earn enough money for the Wii U.</p> <p>And it turns out one of my sons, Dallin, is a lot more entrepreneurial than the rest, and is just trying all sorts of things to figure out how to make money. For example, we went down to St. George, and we found this gypsum mine, and we found these gypsum rocks. We collected all these rocks, and he\u2019s been trying to sell these really cool looking rocks to everybody he sees, to get money for the Wii U.</p> <p>In fact, he sold one of our neighbors a rock for $10, which was amazing. So he\u2019s out there closing sales, and hustling and doing deals. He keeps telling me like, \u201cLet\u2019s just go to the store, and we\u2019ll just give them all these rocks. They\u2019ll trade me for a Wii U.\u201d</p> <p>But he can't quite understand that, so we keep trying to do stuff. So on Sunday night, this was two days ago, he wanted to figure out how he could make the money, and so my wife put together a chore chart for him.</p> <p>So he\u2019s been waking up early every single morning and scrubbing the toilets, folding the blankets, making his bed, dusting the house, everything in the world he can do to figure out how to make money.</p> <p>And so, he\u2019s working, you know, all day yesterday and he earned a dollar from all his work, and he\u2019s all excited. Then he realized like, \u201cMan, it takes a long time to earn a dollar. I\u2019ve got $350 I\u2019ve got to make.\u201d</p> <p>So he\u2019s talking about doing garage sales. He asked me if I had any work, he could come and work for me, and he says he\u2019s really good doing drawings so he can draw for me.</p> <p>But every morning he\u2019s been begging me to come to the office so he can make money. And anyway, it\u2019s just fun seeing this little entrepreneur.</p> <p>So I guess yesterday, he was on the computer and he went to Google. He typed in \u201cjobs for kids.\u201d He clicked on some link, and a form came up, and he went and told my wife, and just said, \u201cHey, I need\u2026\u201d</p> <p>You know \u201cwhat\u2019s our address,\u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s our phone number,\u201d and just asked all this stuff, and she didn\u2019t really know why, but right now they\u2019re at the age where they\u2019re learning how to spell and how to do stuff.</p> <p>So they always come and ask us like, \u201cDad, how do you spell roses?\u201d \u201cHow do you spell this?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s my phone number?\u201d so didn\u2019t really don\u2019t think too much about it.</p> <p>He wrote down all this, you know, then the address or the phone number and wrote down everything. Went back into the computer on this form, and actually filled out a \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d for online, and that was the phone call, was them following up with his call.</p> <p>My guess, it was probably some kind of call center trying to sell him a business opportunity, but it made me kind of laugh. So that was my young son\u2019s entrepreneurial journey, so far today.</p> <p>It\u2019s two days into his thing, and he\u2019s trying to make money for this Wii, and it just made me smile, because it reminded me of me when I was his age.</p> <p>I was doing everything I could think of to hustle for money, because I just had these dreams of all the stuff I wanted to buy, and what I wanted to do and be in life, and I knew I needed the money to do that.</p> <p>And it kind of makes me smile because I know that\u2019s how I got to where I\u2019m at today, is because of those types of things, and I just want to encourage all of us right now, depending on where you are in your life.</p> <p>Look at my son, Dallin, look at his example, and I want you guys to emulate that. I want everyone to be out there hustling and striving, and trying to figure out ways to start businesses, and make money and work extra hours and things like that.</p> <p>Because that\u2019s how you get ahead in life, that\u2019s how great things start happening. It\u2019s always interesting to me how many people tell me that they don\u2019t have time to start a business because they don\u2019t have, you know, the resources or things like that.</p> <p>Where I\u2019ve got a seven-year-old out there scrubbing toilets to try to earn money so that he can get what he\u2019s looking for, and I think too many people -- too many of us -- use copouts and use excuses like, \u201cI don\u2019t have time\u201d or money or resources or whatever it is to start a business.</p> <p>Whereas, if you just go out there and do it and hustle and try and stay up late, and work a second job and do extra work for, whatever it is, to be able to get to whatever it is your dream goal is at the end of the rainbow.</p> <p>So I just want to kind of leave off with that, and the other thing is I was writing a sales letter yesterday. One of the things I wrote in there was about how good is the enemy to great, and I just want to kind of touch on that as well.</p> <p>You know, like a lot of us, if you\u2019re not where you want to be in life in whatever aspect, it could be business, it could be personal life, it could be religious life, whatever it is, the reason why most of us don\u2019t live great lives, the reason why most people don\u2019t have great marriages is because they have good marriages.</p> <p>The reason why most people have great business because they have good business, and if you\u2019ve ever read the book Good to Great, that\u2019s what it talks about is just how good is the enemy to great, and it keeps us a lot of times from achieving what we want.</p> <p>And I just wanted to let everyone know that you shouldn\u2019t settle for \u201cgood.\u201d There\u2019s too much amazing stuff that this life has to offer, and good really is the enemy to great. So set your goals high and work like crazy. Do whatever it takes.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a kid who can't even type yet, figure out how to get online, get your address from your parents, whatever it takes. But do what Dallin is doing and go out there and hustle, and if you do, good things can happen.</p> <p>So that\u2019s where I leave it off today. I appreciate you guys listening to my podcasts.

I want to talk about something kind of fun. Last weekend, my family and I had a chance to go down to St. George, Utah which was fun. We had a great time.</p> <p>While we were down there, there's a place called the Tuacahn Theater where they do plays every single year. This year, they had four or five different plays they were doing. While we were there, the play they were doing was Mary Poppins. I got to admit, I was kind of disappointed.</p> <p>I heard last year, they had Aladdin, and Princess Jasmine flying through the air and all sorts of stuff. The year before was Little Mermaid, and they flooded the stage and water came down. I was like, \u201cWhat can you do cool with Mary Poppins?\u201d</p> <p>I wasn't really excited to go see it outside of the fact that it was fun to go to an outdoor theater and be with my family, my kids came, and everything. We went to it and it was actually \u2013 the production was amazing but just the story of Mary Poppins, I hadn't heard that story for a long, long time since I was a kid. This one was based more off of the book so there were a lot of things that were in that that weren't in the movie.</p> <p>Just a couple of really cool things that popped out to me that I wanted to share with you guys, I think they relate to us. They relate to business. They relate to your personal life. They relate to whatever it is you're dealing with. The first one that was fun was when they sang the song, \u201cA spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,\u201d when I was a kid, the only meaning I got from that when I was a kid was if you have medicine and you put some sugar in it, it will taste better going down.</p> <p>As I saw the song and the play and everything like that, I realized that there's so many more meanings to that, just talking about any kind of work you do that if you can add in the element of fun, if you can add in that sugar into it, it changes it from being work to fun. It talked about how a spoonful of sugar changes toast and water to cake and juice or whatever it was.</p> <p>I started thinking about that. How many things in our life, if we look at it and it's miserable but we go back and add in a spoonful of sugar, how do we make that now a fun activity? I think that we've had three or four people that have come and done internships in our office. That's one thing they consistently say.</p> <p>I had a call with one of them the other day. I was talking to him after he left. He just said, \u201cYour office environment is so much fun. It's fun to come to work, it's fun to be there. Just the environment, the atmosphere you've created has been a lot of fun.\u201d I thought that was kind of cool.</p> <p>That's one lesson I learned from Mary Poppins. The next lesson I learned from her, this is actually more from Bert, just talking about the chimney sweeps, when he was doing the whole chim-chimney, chim-chim chiroo song, and them on top of London dancing around made me really think about you look at somebody like a chimney sweep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You're like, \u201cOh, he's in dirt, he's in mud all day. It's horrible.\u201d Then for him, he's looking at it like, \u201cI have the best view in the world. Chimney sweeps are happy as happy can be.\u201d I just thought about that in our lives. Wherever we're at, you can look at a chimney sweep and it seems like a miserable thing but if you look at the positive parts of it, how cool and how exciting, how fun is that.</p> <p>I thought that was kind of cool too. Then the last big one, this one really had an impact on me in that I don't remember it from the movie. It may have been in the movie but it was part of the play, where the kids, Michael Banks and I can't remember the daughter's name. They went to the bank to go see their dad.</p> <p>The dad was all flustered because he didn't want them to show up. He was there with a client trying to get a loan. The client was there trying to get a loan from the bank or whatever it might be. The client, the guy who was in there, walked over to the kids and said, \u201cHere, I'm going to give you guys sixpence. I want you to have your first money.\u201d</p> <p>Michael said, \u201cI know what that is. That's worth sixpence.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no.\u201d He said, \u201cIt may be worth sixpence but the value is what you do with it.\u201d I thought that was really cool, not just money financially but any part of our life. It may be worth this but the value is what you do with it. The value is how you help someone.</p> <p>What are you going to do with that money? Are you going to give it to go feed the birds? Are you going to give it to go start a charity? Are you going to give it to help your dad? We know what it's worth but its value can be completely different. I thought that was a profound thing if you think about it.</p> <p>Just a couple of fun things from Mary Poppins; if you guys haven't watched that movie yet, we went out and bought the movie. I'm going to watch the movie again. It was really a cool thing. Everywhere you look around in life, there's always these cool little lessons you can learn that you can relate back to your business and back into your life.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed that. I'm at the office now you guys. Have a great day and we'll talk to you all tomorrow.</p>", "duration": "05:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/25_-_Mary_Poppins_And_Marketing.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1371664800, "title": "Episode #24 \u2013 Dabbling Your Way To The Olympics?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>You may have heard the first part of Russell\u2019s Olympic journey, would you like to hear the \u201cbehind the scene\u201d story?\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is the Marketing in Your Car podcast. I'm Russell Brunson. I'm excited to talk to you guys today. I just got back from the Boise State football stadium today. We picked out our season tickets. We were planning, last year, we got season tickets that were clear on the very back row of the stadium.</p> <p>Because we got season tickets last year, we were able to go in earlier this year and pick some and we got third row tickets, so we have six seats on the third row about the 35, 40 yard line, and it's going to be awesome so if anyone wants to come visit Boise, let me know, and we'll take you to a game. Just kidding.</p> <p>Today, what I want to talk about, I got up early this morning and started working out and just thinking about life and about things. I was thinking about what I should talk to you guys about today on the podcast. I thought I would talk about something that I have no idea if it's going to relate to you or not but I thought it would be kind of fun.</p> <p>It's kind of something I'm nervous to talk about because I haven't talked about this publicly too much, mostly just people that I know that have asked me. A lot of you guys, if you've been following me for the last four or five years, you know some of my back stories but I was a wrestler. I wrestled in high school.</p> <p>I was a state champ in high school, and then went to the high school nationals, took second place in the country there, got a scholarship to BYU and I wrestled for a year at BYU. Then they cut their wrestling program and I transferred to Boise State and wrestled my last four years at Boise State.</p> <p>One of the sad things for me was I had some big goals. I wanted to be an All American in college like I was in high school, and ended up not making it. In fact, my senior year before the Pack 10 Tournament which is where you qualify for nationals, I lost and it was one of those things where I wasn't ready to be done yet.</p> <p>I was planning on going to nationals, planning on doing well. I had my last match and I lost. That was the end. My dream just got taken away from me. There was nothing else I could do. It was over. Something I didn't know was going to be my last match was suddenly my last match.</p> <p>For anyone who has ever gone through something like that, it's hard. You've focused 10, 12 years of your life on a goal, and then all of a sudden, it disappears overnight. It was hard. For me, I think my release, my outlet was business. I jumped into business and started trying to build a business like crazy.</p> <p>That's how I got my mind off of the pain from losing and being done with wrestling. I did that and jumped into business. Luckily, I had a lot of success. Just like anything in life, I didn't just dabble. I jumped in a million percent and just went crazy with it.</p> <p>That's how I think I became successful in the business world. I built the business and got to the point where our company was really big. We had about 100 employees. We had a big sales team. We had everything. It was fun. Everything was going really well.</p> <p>About that time, I started thinking about wrestling and thought, \u201cI really miss wrestling a lot.\u201d One of my buddies had been competing for the Olympics. Three different cycles, he had tried or two cycles at the time. The last thing, he was favored to win American and go to the Olympics and in the Olympic trials, he lost to a guy that he had beaten very easily multiple times.</p> <p>He ended up not qualifying for the Olympics, so the other guy got to go. I didn't really know what had happened to him. He kind of disappeared and I hadn't heard much from him. Then one day, I went to his blog. On his blog, it had been about a year since the trials. On the blog, he was saying that after the trials, he was really depressed.</p> <p>He left. He moved to Wyoming and started doing some work there. One night, he came home from work. He went on YouTube and he was looking for stuff. He saw a video of the match that he had lost. He said he watched that match, and afterwards he said he started crying uncontrollably for hours. He couldn't stop.</p> <p>He said, \u201cI've got to try to do this Olympic thing one more time.\u201d He said, \u201cBasically I'm trying to figure out a way to do it so if anyone has ideas or can help support me, whatever, let me know and I want to try to compete again.\u201d I read that blog post and was really touched by it.</p> <p>Because he's a close friend, I was like, \u201cMan, what can I do to help?\u201d Anyway, a couple of weeks later, I was at a movie with my brother who is another wrestler. We were talking about how cool it would be to start wrestling again and how much we missed it and stuff.</p> <p>That night, I went home. I was looking and said, \u201cWhat would it take for me to be able to compete in the Olympics?\u201d I went to the freestyle Olympic stuff and looked at everything. The Olympic list was really big. The weight class was deep, how good people were.</p> <p>I was looking at people who were three and four time national champs who were tenth string in freestyle. I was like, \u201cWow, that's going to be tough.\u201d Then I went over and looked at the Greco. Traditionally, Greco is a much harder and actually a much more fun type of wrestling but in America, a lot of people don't wrestle Greco.</p> <p>I looked at the lineups in Greco, and the weights were not nearly as deep in America which was interesting. I knew a lot of the guys who were ranked in the top two or three, and I thought, \u201cWow, this is kind of cool. I could do Greco.\u201d What else was cool was I actually knew the Olympic Greco coach.</p> <p>We were good friends. He used to coach my little brother. I just thought, \u201cYou know what, I'm going to try to compete for the Olympics. I'm going to do it in Greco. I think it will be really fun.\u201d The next day, I called up the Olympic Greco coach. His name is Ivan Ivanov. I hadn't talked to him in like 10 years.</p> <p>I was like, \u201cHey Vaughn, I want to start wrestling again. I want to hire you to have you move to Boise and train me.\u201d He kind of laughed and said, \u201cRussell, I'm training the Olympic team. Everything is really good. I get paid a lot of money. I'm not interested.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cMaybe if you had a team or something or there was more than just you. I don't want to get involved and six months later, you decide you're not going to do the Olympics and I'm out of a job.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, that makes sense.\u201d Instead of giving up, I hung up the phone and then I started thinking.</p> <p>I said, \u201cYou know what? I should. If I'm going to really do this, I should go get a team of people.\u201d The first person I called up was Justin, my friend who had lost in the Olympic trials. I called and left a message for him. He called me back a few hours later.</p> <p>I said, \u201cJustin, I have a crazy idea. You're not going to believe but I want to compete for Olympics and I want you to move out here to Boise and train with me, and I think we should get a gym and bring up a bunch of guys. If we have a bunch of guys, I think we can convince Ivan to come out here and coach us. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled on the phone and said, \u201cI'm in, let's do it.\u201d I don't think I had even told my wife at this time what was happening. This was on a Friday. Justin and his wife jump in the car from Montana or Wyoming, wherever they were at, drove eight or nine hours. The next day, they're at our house.</p> <p>My wife is sitting there like, \u201cYou told me this six hours ago and now these guys are in our house talking about starting an Olympic club. Are you really doing this?\u201d I said, \u201cLet's do it. I'm in 100 percent.\u201d Justin moved up here. We launched the club. He called a bunch of people he knew. They moved up as well.</p> <p>We created some jobs for these guys so they could make money while they were here. After we had a bunch of people, we called Ivan up, flew him up. He saw everything, made him an offer. He moved to Boise, and that was where we were going.</p> <p>For about seven or eight months, it was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever been through. We had our own Olympic team here in Idaho. We had our own facility, we had our own mats. We were training everyday. It was so much fun. I was having the greatest time in my life.</p> <p>I think I was getting to the point where I was doing really well. I remember in December time, I was wrestling a guy who actually ended up taking second place in Olympic trials. I wrestled him and actually beat him for the first time. I was like, \u201cThis is amazing, I'm not that far away from the goal, and we still have two more years before the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p>That was in December. I was just fired up, really excited for this whole thing. Then what happened after that was kind of crazy. It was a whirlwind of events. In January, again, I haven't told this story publicly but here it is. In January, about the 15th of January, one day we're at the office.</p> <p>Everything is cranking and all of a sudden, one of my programmers comes in and says, \u201cHey, all of our sales are failing.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d A few minutes later, the call center guys run up, \u201cHey, we're trying to bill people's credit cards. All of our credit cards are failing.\u201d We looked and I couldn't figure out what had happened.</p> <p>Our merchant accounts weren't working so I called our merchant account provider. We had 16 different merchant accounts with them and they had shut down every single one of them without any kind of warning. If you can imagine, at the time, we had 100 employees. Our overhead was north of $600,000 a month which means I had to make $600,000 before we broke even.</p> <p>All of a sudden, we had no ability to process money. People wanted to give us money. People wanted to buy our stuff but we couldn't process their money. It took two days before I could get someone on the phone to actually tell me what was wrong. Basically what had happened, this is the time, for those of you who are familiar with what happened, anybody who was doing any kind of continuity trial, continuity based offers all got shut down.</p> <p>I think PowerPay shut down 300 or 400 merchants overnight without any kind of warning. It took us three days to find out what happened. After that, they turned our merchant accounts back on but they put us on 100% reserve. We were scrambling.</p> <p>In the next seven days, we made $200,000 and PowerPay had 100% reserve which means they wouldn't give us any of that money. We kept calling them and begging them. Finally, after about seven to 10 days, they said, \u201cOkay, we'll take you off reserve and put you back on normal 10% reserve because you've proven you're a legitimate vendor.\u201d</p> <p>They did that but they said, \u201cBut we're going to keep your $200,000 you just processed in reserve,\u201d which means that $200,000 we had made, I couldn't use to pay salaries or anything. It was just thing after thing after thing like that. For the next year, it was just a nightmare. Costs were so high. We had no money.</p> <p>We had money coming in but we had no money to process. Because there was money coming in and we didn't get the money, we couldn't pay salaries so sales guys were quitting, we lost programmers, we lost designers, we lost coaches, and it was a nightmare. For a year, we tried to keep everything open.</p> <p>I paid every penny out of my own pocket to keep things open. It was really the toughest year and a half to two years of my life. It was crazy. Eventually it ended with us shutting down the call center completely. The wrestling team, basically, I was paying for it out of my pocket, my personal pocket because the business couldn't support it at that time.</p> <p>I was paying about $30,000 a month to keep it open. After about a year of that, it had depleted my personal accounts. I couldn't keep supporting it anymore. I still remember by far the most depressing day of my life, worst than when I lost my wrestling match was me calling up Justin and the coach and saying, \u201cI can't support this anymore. I have no more money. We have to shut down the wrestling program.\u201d</p> <p>That's all from one December to the next December. It was December when I wrestled that guy and beat him, and it was a year later that I had to call and shut down the whole program. It was really tough. Then after that, we came back and we had to leave our office. We shut down the call center. We fired most of our staff.</p> <p>We moved to a small office and had to start rebuilding. It was about another year of rebuilding before we were back to where we were really doing well but it was the most stressful time of my life. It was hard but we were able to keep pushing through that. We restarted our business, relaunched it, and now we're at a spot where it's kind of fun.</p> <p>We're actually with six employees, we're doing the same volume we were doing with 100 employees before. It's been amazing. Now, I'm a thousand times happier than I ever could have dreamed about being before but the reason why I think I wanted to tell you guys this story, and surely there's different messages you can get out of it.</p> <p>One of them is don't hire a bunch of staff. Another one is being diverse with your merchant accounts; make sure for any product you have, make sure you have at least two different merchant accounts and two different banks. I can't tell you how many people I know that have gotten merchant accounts shut down.</p> <p>There are so many lessons I could talk about and share with you guys along the way about hiring and the people that stick beside you, and those that walk away when adversity comes. The main lesson I really want to share was when all is said and done, as horrible and tough of an experience that was, the fruits of what happened have been amazing.</p> <p>I think that the reason why I've had ups and downs in my life, the ups and downs are interesting because ups and downs are the things that define you and the things that make you who you are. The reason I've had the big ups and downs is when I get into something, I go in 100 percent. When I was wrestling in high school and college, I was in 100 percent.</p> <p>When I started my business, I was in 100 percent. When I wanted to do the Olympic thing, I was in 100 percent. I didn't say, \u201cI'm going to wrestle for the Olympics,\u201d and then go and sit down and watch TV. I went out and within a day, I had hired the Olympic Greco coach, I had built the team, I had gotten a facility. I had done everything.</p> <p>Again, sometimes it bites you in the butt but that's the nature of life. Those who risk a lot are the ones who reward a lot. I just want to encourage you guys, whatever it is in your life you're doing, and this could be in everything, in your relationships, in your family, in your religion, in your business, whatever it is, if you decide you're going to do it, do it.</p> <p>Don't just dabble. Nothing drives me more crazy than people that dabble. We had an event a little while ago and I had someone come that had been dabbling in internet marketing for as long as I've been doing this stuff, and they're still not successful. It's because they dabble.</p> <p>I want you guys to commit to yourselves to whatever you want to do, whatever you're passionate about, be all in. I don't care if it's business. I don't care if it's weight loss. Whatever it is, don't just dabble. Commit yourself and be all in.</p> <p>Do what I did and go in, hire coaches, do whatever it is, just commit and go 100% in. If you do that, you'll be amazed at what happens. The journey you go along is so much more exciting. I had someone tell me the other day, \u201cMan Russell, you're only 33 years old and look at how much stuff you've experienced, seen, and been able to do in your life.\u201d</p> <p>I really think it's because when I get into something, I go all in. Most people, they don't. They dabble and they sit on the sidelines, and they don't want to get hurt, and they don't want to screw up, and they don't want the pain that can be associated with things but I promise you guys that that pain is there for a reason.</p> <p>It's there because it makes the other stuff so much better and so much happier. Don't be afraid of it. Embrace it. Go all in with whatever you're doing, and quit dabbling. That's my message for today. It's a little longer than normal but I hope you guys got some good ideas, and we appreciate you guys.</p> <p>Everything we do in our Dot Com Secrets business and our other businesses is because we care about our customers. As scary as it is for me to share stories like that, I'm hoping that it will get you guys some thoughts and insights, and some things that you can apply in your life and in your business.</p> <p>Let's go from there. Again, if you guys like this podcast, please share it with others. I'm doing it for free just because I enjoy it and I want to help people, and if you guys are enjoying it, please blog about it, leave a comment about it, whatever it is. Thanks so much and we'll talk to you guys all again tomorrow.</p>", "duration": "15:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/24_-_Dabbling_Your_Way_To_The_Olympics.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1371578400, "title": "Episode #23 \u2013 What Are Your KPI\u2019s?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Are you curious what Russell\u2019s doing today to double his business? If so, listen to this episode and copy exactly what he\u2019s doing.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson from <a href=\"http://www.DotComSecrets.com/\">DotComSecrets.com</a>\u00a0and this is the Marketing in Your Car podcast. Today, we're going to be talking about a thing called KPIs. In the theme of my podcast from yesterday, I know it was a short one, but just talking about taking stock of where you are in your life right now and making a whole new list of what you need to be happy, and then going and just getting it, and not letting anything get in your way.</p> <p>I hope a lot of you guys took that to heart yesterday and did that. I know I'm having a ton of fun with mine today. I got a bunch of things on my list I'm doing today, just because I wanted to to be happy, and now I'm going to go do them. I hope you guys do the same thing as well.</p> <p>Today, what I want to talk about though is now tying that back into business a little bit and I want to tell you basically what I'm doing today. You guys should copy me because it's going to work and make me a lot of money.</p> <p>One of the things that I've noticed in my business is when I have something that I'm tracking and I'm looking at, and I'm watching the numbers on, it tends to grow. When I just forget about them and I don't have those things, then it tends to not grow. I've always looked at things from month to month, our numbers and our profit and loss, stuff like that.</p> <p>In fact, that's what the accountants were at my office yesterday showing us. They come once a month and go over all those things but recently, we hired these guys to do some traffic generation stuff for us. Every Friday, they send us what they call a Friday report. It shows us how many clicks, how much money was spent.</p> <p>It shows a really detailed report of how many sales came in. It was really exciting to get that. I thought, \u201cYou know what? We have a lot of divisions in our company and a lot of different offers we're running, and things like that yet we never really, I don't have numbers like that in front of me all the time.\u201d</p> <p>What we decided to do and what our task for today is to kind of sit down and figure out what our KPIs are for each of our different sub-companies. A KPI is a key performance indicator. For example, in most of our businesses, the key performance indicators are similar. One of them we're looking at very heavily obviously is traffic, how much traffic are we getting in, from what source.</p> <p>A KPI could be we need 500 visitors a day from search, 500 visitors a day from Facebook, whatever that number is. That's a key performance indicator. As soon as we started tracking that, then we can help improve it, making it go up and down.</p> <p>Another one would be how many subscribers we get each day. Are we getting 100 a day, 1000 a day, 5000 a day, whatever it is? The next one is how many sales we're making, and not just random sales but what is the front end product we have. I don't know about you guys but we always have for each of our businesses, Dot Com Secrets X, Dot Com Secrets Local, Dot Com Secrets Second Up-line, Girlfriend in a Week, all of our websites, all of our properties, whatever you want to call them, they each have a front end product that we're trying to put people into.</p> <p>Usually for us, it's a dollar trial type product. That's one of our key performance indicators is how many dollar trials did we give away today. Is it 10, 100, 1000? That's a big thing we look at. That is a key performance indicator.</p> <p>The next one is how many active members. If we have 3000 active members right now, or 2000, whatever that number is, and then how much we sold other back end products, those are the KPIs that we have for basically each of our companies. What I'm doing today is making a little template that basically has those KPIs, and each person in our office is in charge of different sections.</p> <p>Basically each Friday, I'm going to have it where everyone on my team goes and puts together their Friday KPI reports and send them in. That way, we can see week by week how we're improving, what's going up, what's going down, and those types of things. That's what we're doing.</p> <p>I'm really excited for it. What I've noticed is that any time we track something, it tends to get bigger because we see it and our brain automatically starts thinking about, \u201cMan, I got 100 visitors yesterday. How can I get 120 tomorrow? How can I get 150? How can I get 200?\u201d</p> <p>Just the fact that we're tracking it, I guarantee we'll see numbers go up. I want to recommend the same thing for you guys. If you aren't tracking stuff yet like that, it's time to sit back and start looking at what those key performance indicators are in your business, and everyone's businesses are different.</p> <p>Figure out what those things are, and then track them and plot them. Look at it so you can see day by day what's happening, has it gone up, has it gone down, and things like that. Another fun thing that you can start doing is after you do this for like a year or so, and we're doing this with our revenues, profit and losses and stuff, is looking year by year.</p> <p>Last May, we did X amount of dollars. This May, we did this amount of dollars. We increased from month to month, year by year which is fun. The biggest thing I think is having the tracking ability so you can see it and improve it every single day.</p> <p>There is your homework assignment for today, you guys. Figure out your KPIs. Figure out your tracking system, and start watching those numbers because when you watch them, then they can improve. That's about it, you guys. I'm at the office today. I'm going to go start making some KPI sheets. It's going to be a ton of fun.</p> <p>If you're enjoying this podcast, please tell other people. Go ahead and blog about it. I won't mind, or just go into iTunes and leave a review. I love seeing the reviews. It makes me happy. I would appreciate that. Thanks so much. We'll talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "06:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/23_-_What_Are_Your_KPIs.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1371492000, "title": "Episode #22 \u2013 Radically Change Your Pattern", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell just got back from vacation and wants to challenge all of us to radically change at least one pattern in your life and see what happens.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and this is the Marketing in Your Car podcast. Hey everyone, this is Russell. I know it's been a little while since you guys have heard from me but I was actually on a vacation with my family down in St. George and had an awesome time. I'm back now, ready to get back to work.</p> <p>I don't know about you guys, but when I leave for a little bit and I come back to get back into working, it gets me so excited and fired up, and today, I'm pumped to be here. A couple of things, I'm actually late for a meeting with the accountants. I completely blanked it.</p> <p>Going to the accountants for me is like going to the dentist. It's the most painful process of the day so I'm heading there right now, but just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things I've been thinking about this weekend, or actually this whole week. It's been a lot of really fun stuff.</p> <p>One of them is just at the beginning of the year, we always set New Year's resolutions, and then we never keep them. About two years ago, I remember one day I put together a list. I was like, \u201cWhat I needed to do to be really happy in my life,\u201d and I listed everything I could possibly think of. Then I made a conscious effort to go out and get all of those things.</p> <p>It was amazing what I was able to accomplish during the next month or so afterwards. It was all sorts of things like I want to whiten my teeth, I want to lose some weight, I wanted to go to an acupuncturist, everything I thought of that I thought would be cool to do, I listed all those things out and then went and actually did them. It was fun.</p> <p>I haven't done that for about two years, so I actually just this weekend did the same thing. I said, \u201cI'm going to go back through and figure out everything that I wanted to do to be a little bit happier in life.\u201d One of them was juicing. This morning, I woke up, cranked out the old juicer which I haven't used in years, and juiced some stuff.</p> <p>It turned out really nasty. I put way too much of something in there but I did that. We just got a Whole Foods here in Boise, and went to Whole Foods. I bought some quinoa because one time, I had that and it's a really good grain with lots of protein, so I bought that. This morning, I woke up at five o'clock in the morning.</p> <p>I remember going to Tony Robbins' event. He talked about jumping on a trampoline every morning, so I woke up, jumped on a trampoline, and he talked about trying to be grateful every morning. I sat there for about 10 minutes while I jumped on the trampoline, thinking about my kids, my wife, and everything I could be thankful for which was really cool.</p> <p>Then I did some studying this morning, both from a religious standpoint and also from a marketing standpoint, and resetting my whole life. It feels amazing. It's 8:41 right now. I've been up for almost four hours already and I just feel fantastic. I feel fresh, I feel like I have a ton of energy, and it's awesome.</p> <p>I want to give you guys that same gift that I gave myself. Right now, we're about the middle of the year. Use this as your New Year's resolution or your midyear resolution, and go home tonight or today, whenever it is, and sit down and write a list of the 10, 20, or 30 things you want to do to make yourself happier right now.</p> <p>It could be dumb things like I said juicing sounded like fun and jumping on the tramp in the morning, and just things like that. Then go and start doing them. Give yourself permission to do it. It's amazing what you'll feel like.</p> <p>Just some recommendations for you guys, one recommendation is I recommend trying something different with your eating, just totally radically different. If you're a hard core meat eater, become a vegetarian. If you're a vegetarian, become a meat eater.</p> <p>I don't care what it is, just something radical, shift what it is what you've been doing, and see what happens. See how your body feels by the change. I recommend waking up earlier, and using that time, not so much to check your email or to work but use it as a time to sharpen your saw.</p> <p>What I mean by that is focusing on learning something, either for your business, for your religious life, whatever it is. Just focus in the morning on doing more of that, doing some exercises early in the morning. If you need to get a gym membership, just do something to radically change your physiology, to change your mindset, change your eating behaviors, your patterns, and just see what happens.</p> <p>I promise you, if it's at all like what I'm feeling like this morning, it's going to be amazing for you as well. That's the gift I want to give you guys today. Just make some radical changes, and if you do that, I promise you you're going to feel a lot better.</p> <p>I'm at the office now. I'm late for my meeting with the accountants. I'm going to go talk to those guys. I'm going to do a lot more podcasts this week because I got some really cool stuff to share with you guys but that is your task for today, to radically change the patterns that you're doing in your life right now for the better, and test it out and see what happens. Thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "05:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/22_-_Radically_Change_Your_Pattern.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1370455200, "title": "Episode #21 \u2013 Switching Sales Modalities", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Are you using a sales video, a sales letter, or a webinar to sell your product? We suggest testing out a few of these unique options to increase your conversion rates.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the Marketing in Your Car podcast. Today, I want to talk about a topic that I think is really fascinating. I've never really seen anyone else talk about it before but it's been a big part of our business. The basic concept is people learn and consume information in different ways.</p> <p>I'm not talking so much like the products that you sell but more so about how you sell them. For example, what we found is there are some people who love to watch webinars. That's their favorite thing in the world. They'll sit on webinars all day long. They get on every webinar that happens. They buy off webinars. They love webinars.</p> <p>There are other people who can't stand webinars. No matter how much benefit is going to be on a webinar, they're not going to get on it. That's kind of like me. I think webinars are cool. I love selling through webinars but I don't like getting on webinars. I can't take an hour, two hours, three hours of my time usually during the day to watch a webinar, so I don't typically like that.</p> <p>That's one sales style. Another sales style is sales videos. Some people love watching sales videos, and they'll watch them all the way through, and that's how they prefer to consume the information. Me on the other hand, I normally can't sit down and just watch a sales video. It drives me crazy.</p> <p>The third modality is reading. Some people like to actually read a sales letter. That's the way that they consume and are more likely to purchase the product. There's other things as well. There's phone calls. There's a lot of different things you can do.</p> <p>What I want to talk about is just the importance of selling your clients in multiple different modalities, meaning for example, we're tomorrow launching a product in the weight loss industry, and we're also launching a product in the internet marketing industry. Both of those products, we're leading with a sales video.</p> <p>We've found that traditionally, a sales video will make us more money than a sales letter or things like that so we're leading the front end of both of those offers as a sales video, which is kind of cool but a lot of people, like I said, aren't going to actually watch a sales video for whatever reason. It's too long, they drive them crazy. Maybe they're at work and they can't have the volume up. There are a million different reasons why someone may not.</p> <p>What we've found is that we'll lead with what we think is our strongest modality, the version of the page that's going to be the best, and we'll put it out there, and then what we'll do is if somebody doesn't purchase from that, we'll have an exit pop-up. The exit pop-up will pop-up the sales letter version for those people who don't want to sit through a video.</p> <p>Boom, it will pop it up, and they can read the whole, it's basically the transcript of the sales video. We've found by doing that, we've seen huge, huge increases in response rates. I think it's because, like I said, people like to consume things in different ways. When we first launched our Dot Com Secrets local webinar about two years ago, the way we launched initially was an automated webinar.</p> <p>That did really good. After I think 10 days, maybe seven days, something like that, if they hadn't purchased from the webinar, then we sent a sequence of emails pushing to a sales letter version of the webinar which is basically the same message but in sales letter format. That dramatically increased our sales from people who just didn't watch the webinar, didn't have time to watch the webinar, whatever the reason was.</p> <p>Then boom, they saw the sales letter, and that gave it to them in a format and a fashion they could actually consume. We also for a little while there, we stopped doing it mostly because it was a hassle but it worked. It's one of those things we probably should have kept doing but when people would opt into the webinar, we'd have a small upsell for five dollars.</p> <p>If they bought that upsell, we would actually ship them out a DVD of the webinar which was kind of cool so they could watch the webinar through DVD, and we'd give them a printed out version of the sales letter of the webinar, just a couple little cool things like that just to get our message in people's hands in multiple different ways because you have no idea what the person that clicked on your ad, what type of person they are, what type of way they like to learn, what form of communication is going to be the most likely to close and sell something like that.</p> <p>I guess my message for today is just have a little fun with your sales stuff. Don't just have a sales video, just a sales letter, just a webinar.\u00a0 Take those elements and make other versions of it. Traditionally, our sales letter is just the transcribed version of our sales video or our sales webinar so it's the same message, just in a written out format so they can actually see it.</p> <p>We've even done it before where we had people pay for the transcripts of a webinar and it was amazing, people pay for the transcripts. They would get that and they would basically be reading the whole sales letter, and boom, those people were more likely to purchase as well. That's just my message for today.</p> <p>I'm at the office now and ready to have some fun today with our two product launches we're working on, but again, both of those, we're using different modalities, and you should as well. Have some fun with it, you guys, and we'll talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "05:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/21_-_Switching_Sales_Modalities.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1369418400, "title": "Episode #20 \u2013 A Student Of Marketing", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What is the secret message I\u2019m trying to get to you?\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, this is Russell Brunson and I want to welcome you to the Marketing in Your Car podcast today. It is a beautiful day. Hey everyone, this is Russell again. It's Friday today and I'm excited because we're heading out of town for Memorial Day weekend. We're going to have some fun out at the lake with my family, so I'm excited for that today but on my drive in to get some stuff done this morning before we head out of town, I want to give you guys a quick message.</p> <p>This message has to do with becoming a student of marketing. There's this guy I got some text messages from yesterday. He's someone who I met in the last six months or so and someone who I think is a really cool guy, who wants to be an entrepreneur. He's trying to learn this stuff. He's got his first app he's been creating, and I've been helping him, steering him the right way.</p> <p>When Rippln came out, which obviously a lot of you guys probably know what Rippln is. It's a new viral app that we're helping launch and stuff like that. I showed him that. He got excited and signed up, and started talking about it to some people, and started doing some stuff. Then last night, he texted me and said, \u201cHey, can you take me and my wife off of Rippln?\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He said, \u201cI'm tired of getting all the text messages and emails, and it's not for me,\u201d all this stuff, \u201cplease cancel it.\u201d So I wrote him back and said, \u201cYeah, just go contact <a href=\"mailto:support@rippln.com\">support@rippln.com</a>. They can take care of it.\u201d I sat there. It really bugged me. I wanted to write him back but I didn't because I knew if I did, it would be kind of out of me being upset a little bit.</p> <p>It just makes me sad because I know someone like him, he's trying to learn this internet marketing thing and trying to learn apps, trying to learn how to launch his own app. I gave him behind the scenes access to the fastest growing social network app launch in the history of the world. He got behind the scenes access to watch it going live.</p> <p>He's getting all the marketing material texted and emailed to him every single day, and instead of looking at that and saying, \u201cWow, this is a really good case study about how to launch an app,\u201d he got annoyed with it and asked to leave and to cancel it. It just blows my mind how many times people who are trying to learn marketing get upset at marketing.</p> <p>It drives me crazy. I can't tell you how many emails we send out doing cool marketing, showing cool marketing, and actually marketing to people, and instead of people looking at that and saying, \u201cWow, that's a good idea. I'm going to go and implement that in my business,\u201d people come back a lot of the times and just get upset and say, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t believe you keep emailing me. I can't believe this.\u201d</p> <p>They're upset about whatever it might be, and it just makes me laugh because the reason why they joined my list, the reason why they listen to this podcast, the reason why you come to my teleseminars is to learn how to make money. Sure, I'm going to be selling you stuff along the way but watching the process is worth as much if not more money than the actual thing we're selling every single time.</p> <p>For example, yesterday, we did a webinar that in the first 90 minutes or whatever, in the 90 minute webinar, we did $80,000 in sales. Now, a lot of people were on that webinar and they got excited by the product and they bought it, but if you were just to have watched the process about how we got people on the call, what happened on the webinar, the words we said, the slides we used, the process, the close, the takeaway, the offer, I would have paid $1000 just to have seen behind the scenes of that webinar, what I did.</p> <p>Everybody had a front stage pass. Everyone is on my email list. They all got the emails. They all sat there on the webinar. They're watching the replay cycle right now. From this webinar, we'll probably make a quarter million dollars and there will be people unsubscribing from my list because they're annoying I'm marketing to them.</p> <p>Why did you get on my list in the first place? You're trying to learn marketing from me. Watch what I'm doing. Anyway, I just wanted to stress that because so many times, I think that we're looking for something and we're missing what's right in front of our eyes. If you want to learn marketing, you cannot be annoyed by people marketing to you.</p> <p>You need to watch that and study it. With my friend, I started texting this back but then I deleted it but I wanted to tell him, \u201cLook, if you want to be passionate about this career, you should be throw away all your marketing books, quit going to college, whatever it is but every one of those emails that Rippln is sending out or that I'm sending out, you should print those out, put them in a binder, and study them every single day because that will make you more money than anything you'll ever learn in college.\u201d</p> <p>I feel bad because he missed the mark. He's so focused on trying to launch his app that he missed the marketing lesson I was trying to give him about how to launch his app. It's a shame and a tragedy but that's what happens with so many people. Please you guys, be students of this game, the marketing game.</p> <p>If you do, you will succeed. You've got to become passionate about it. Daegan Smith and I talk about this a lot. Until you become obsessed about marketing, and obsessed with how we drive traffic and how we do conversions, and cool sales processes, and that kind of stuff, until you become obsessed with that part of it, you're not going to become successful online, at least not to the level you want to be.</p> <p>Everything else is just going to be a chore. It's going to be a headache. It's going to be whatever it's going to be but if you really focus on that part and make it a passion and a love, then you can be successful. On a Hangout I did the other day, I was on a Hangout with Anthony Morrison who had one of the best running infomercials for four or five years straight.</p> <p>I told everybody, \u201cLook, Anthony's infomercials are awesome, so awesome that I recorded them, I had them transcribed, and I've read the script over and over again to learn what he said and why he said it.\u201d There's so much value for me in watching the infomercial. You can ask my wife. It drives my wife insane but when we're watching TV, guess what? My favorite part is the commercials.</p> <p>She always wants to fast forward. I'm like, \u201cNo, this is why we're watching the show, so I can watch the commercials.\u201d When we listen to the radio and the commercial comes on, she wants to change it. I'm like, \u201cNo, you know this is the part of the show I'm here for, to listen to the commercials.\u201d That's where I learn, that's where I grow.</p> <p>It's because I've become a student of this marketing game, and you need to become a student too. Quit getting annoyed when people market to you and look at it as saying, \u201cWow, that's a cool idea. That's a cool way I can implement something in my business.\u201d When you start doing that and your perspective changes to that, you guys can become even more successful, but it really takes that leap from I'm trying to figure out how to make money to I'm becoming a student of marketing.</p> <p>When you do that, like I said, everything else will change. For all you guys who are out there, for every email list you're on, don't get annoyed anymore. Please start printing out the emails, putting them in a binder, studying them. That is your homework. If you do that, I promise you guys you'll be more successful.</p> <p>That's it for today. I hope you guys all have an awesome Memorial Day weekend. Maybe, if my wife and kids pass out in the car, I\u2019ll give you guys a four hour long podcast while I'm in the car driving. If not, I'll talk to you guys when we all get back.</p> <p>If you're enjoying the show at all, please go to <a href=\"http://www.ITunes.com/\">ITunes.com</a>\u00a0and leave your comments, leave your feedback. I love seeing it. It's probably the most exciting thing of the day for me right now so go back and look at the comments. If you're having a good time with this, please leave feedback and let everybody else you know know about the Marketing in Your Car podcast. Thanks you guys, and we'll talk to you soon.</p>", "duration": "07:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/20_-_A_Student_Of_Marketing.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1369245600, "title": "Episode #19 \u2013 What Type Of Opportunity Are You In?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Are you an A level marketer in a B level opportunity? \u00a0Let me show you how to change!</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson and we are on my way to work today. This is the Marketing in Your Car podcast. In today's podcast, we're going to be talking about what type of opportunity are you in right now. Today, I want to talk about types of opportunities that we're in. this is something that I've never really thought about.</p> <p>When I first got in the business, I just started moving forward. I didn't know what I was going to do. I didn't know what was happening. I had an idea for this software, so I made that and I started selling it. Then I had this idea for potato gun DVDs so I made that. Then I had an idea.</p> <p>I started having ideas, and then just making that stuff and trying to sell it. I had no real plan or purpose or anything. It was just things started happening. We started moving forward. I think that a lot of times happens with a lot of us in our businesses.</p> <p>Last summer, my wife and I had a chance to go to Kenya for about 10 days. We were doing a project with World Teacher Trade which is a really cool charity that two of my friends, Stu and Amy McLaren started. We had a chance to go out there. It's one of the most amazing experiences while we were out there, helping build schools. It was a really cool thing.</p> <p>While we were out there, there were probably I think 10 or 15 other high end internet marketers who had all donated money to build these classrooms that were all there with us. We were building schools and hanging out with the kids, and having a great time together. I remember one day, I was sitting next to Bill Harrison.</p> <p>If you guys don't know Bill, he's a brilliant marketer, one of the coolest guys from a marketing standpoint. He and I sat and talked for 20 hours straight without even a break because the guy has read more books on marketing than anyone I ever met, a really cool guy. I really enjoy my time with him every time I have a chance to talk with him.</p> <p>When we were in Kenya, he started talking about the type of opportunity he was in. He said, \u201cIt's kind of frustrating me. I feel like I have A level skills but I feel like I'm at a B level opportunity.\u201d He said, \u201cI have these friends who have B or C level skills who aren't that good at marketing or business, yet they somehow got plugged into an A level opportunity, and a couple of them just sold their businesses for $100 million.\u201d</p> <p>He's like, \u201cOur company does well. We do $10 to $12 million a year but that's kind of the peak. We maxed out everything that's possible in our business because it's a B level opportunity. We can't really get outside of that.\u201d He's like, \u201cAlso, the other issue is that I built a company that was based off of,\u201d actually his brother's brand so it's based on his brother's.</p> <p>He's like, \u201cIt's a business that's very difficult if not impossible to sell. The problem with that, when you build a company completely off of your face and your name, at first, it's a lot easier to get traction and make sales, and to grow a business but long term, it's harder to sell because you sell it, then the personality dies behind the business.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cI always felt like our business is like a rental. No matter what, we'll never own it to the point where we could sell it. It's like a rental home. We could make good income on it, have good cash flow but it's not something that we own and could sell someday.\u201d Between those two things, talking about the opportunity and talking about basically we're in a rental business if it's that type of business, I really took that to heart.</p> <p>I thought a lot about it. That was last summer. In January, I was at the traffic conversion event and I saw Bill again. We started talking. I told him, \u201cWhat you talked about really had a big impact on me with the whole level, what type of opportunity are you in.\u201d He asked me, \u201cWhat are you doing about that?\u201d</p> <p>I said, \u201cYou know, I'm not sure yet.\u201d I remember I had this conversation with the guys on my team. We were all there at the event together, and kind of said it looked like we're in a good business. We're at a I feel a B level opportunity.</p> <p>First off, our business does well. Our best year ever, we did over $10 million so it's a really good business but I feel like our skill set, what we bring to the table is a lot more than that. I really feel like we were in the same situation as Bill where we had a B level opportunity with A level skills, and we wanted to figure out a way to increase that.</p> <p>We strategically sat down and figured out with what we have right now, how could we change our business to actually make it an A level opportunity where we could apply our A level skills, and really make what we think what we're worth in what we can do. Because of that, we basically took a business that was doing $10 million a year and completely transformed it and changed it.</p> <p>Some of you guys probably on the outside can see a few of the changes happening but you'll see more and more over the next six months or so, and where Dot Com Secrets is not the focus of our business. Again, I think Dot Com Secrets is a B level opportunity. Sure, it makes us $10 million a year but I think that there are bigger opportunities. That's what we're pursuing right now.</p> <p>You'll start seeing these transitions and changes as we're trying to shift away from a B level opportunity into an A level opportunity where we can really start scaling it. My thought process for this podcast I wanted you guys to think about is what type of opportunity are you in right now? Just because you're in the business you're in right now doesn't mean you have to be in that.</p> <p>You can change it or you can sell it, or you can move onto something different, but make sure that you're in an opportunity that can reward you sufficiently for your level of skill. If you're in a business, maybe you're doing a million bucks a year and you feel really good about that. Just by tweaking the business you're in could completely tweak how much money you're making, just by shifting the opportunity.</p> <p>I want you to be aware of that because until last summer, I wasn't even aware of that. I was just moving forward in the opportunity that I'd fallen into and didn't even think much about it. I was good at making money but now that we've made a shift and we\u2019re focusing on an A level opportunity, it gets me more excited because I can see the big vision, my team can see the vision, and we get more excited because what we\u2019re building is ten times bigger.</p> <p>Again, that's my focus for you guys. Just look at the opportunity you're in now and realize that if you're not happy or it's not what you think it could be, or it's not big enough, whatever it is, you can change. I remember two years ago on New Year's Eve, Tony Robbins put out this video. It was very inspirational for me, and it was actually the catalyst for me firing a ton of employees, shifting my whole business model around, and moving my offices, and shifting.</p> <p>He basically said, \u201cAs New Year's is coming up, this is the time when people can make changes and do whatever they want.\u201d He said, \u201cLook, if you're not happy in your relationships, change them. If you're not happy with your weight, change it. If you're not happy with your business, change it.\u201d</p> <p>It really gave me permission, saying, \u201cYou know what, why do I have to keep doing this? If I'm not happy, I can change.\u201d I think that that's something that a lot of people, as simple as it is, you don't give yourself permission to do that. Look at your life right now, all aspects of it.</p> <p>Look at the opportunities in everything, not just business, but your relationship opportunities, your spiritual opportunities, things like that. Just look at are you at an A level opportunity in all areas of your life? If not, then change it. I'm giving you guys all permission right now to make that change because I know it's a scary thing but you have my permission to do it and my encouragement to go do that as well, and seek after the A level opportunities.</p> <p>Guess what? It takes the exact same amount of effort as the B level opportunities. That's what's interesting. When Bill was talking to me, his buddy that sold his company for $100 million, he didn't work as hard as Bill is, he didn't work as hard as I'm working but the opportunity he was in allowed that.</p> <p>Just realize that the conscious choosing of your opportunity is huge because most of us don't consciously choose it. Most of us just go out there, and whatever we stumble upon, that's what we start running with. I'm giving you permission right now to consciously choose the opportunities in your life, again, from relationships to business to personal life to spiritual life, whatever it is.</p> <p>Consciously make the choice and then I also give you permission to make those changes because I know that a lot of times, we just need that permission. You have my permission. Go and do it. I hope you enjoy this podcast. I hope it gives you guys some inspiration.</p> <p>I know that this little concept has changed our business, the direction of our business substantially and it's made what we\u2019re doing a million times more fun and more fulfilling. I hope it will do the same for you. Thanks, everybody.</p>", "duration": "09:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/19_-_What_Type_Of_Opportunity_Are_You_In.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1369072800, "title": "Episode #18 \u2013 Polarity", "author": "", "summary": "<p>How to use controversy to create a\u00a0fan-base\u00a0and to sell more of your stuff.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everybody, welcome to the Marketing in Your Car podcast. This is Russell Brunson and I'm excited for today's podcast. I hope you all had an awesome weekend. I had a chance to go on a family trip down to a wedding, which was always fun. While I was driving, my thoughts were upon marketing.</p> <p>I wanted to give you guys an eight hour podcast. That's how long I was in the car but I was dealing with a bunch of crazy kids and a beautiful wife, so was not able to do one but I was thinking a lot about it. I got some good topics for this week coming up. I want to go through a bunch of them.</p> <p>Right now is the one that I was most excited about, and it's the topic of polarity. This is one of the keys in your marketing. If you learn how to master this, it will mean more traffic, more sales, and a lot more repeat sales and raving fans. The back story behind where this concept came from today, I got a Skype from one of my close marketing buddies who makes a lot of money but is very conservative, very neutral type personality.</p> <p>He Skyped me and said, \u201cMan, I can't believe how much drama you've been involved with in the last month.\u201d At first, I was trying to remember, \u201cWhat drama was he talking about?\u201d Then I remembered all the drama we've been involved with in the last month. It's been really interesting.</p> <p>One thing in the drama, some of you guys remember I was competing for a Ferrari which I won. I thrashed the guy who took number two, and the number two guy did not take that very happily. The last four days of the contest, he went out there and started this whole hate smear campaign against me which was kind of funny. It was like a two year old girl crying after getting beat up by a bigger kid. That's kind of what it reminded me of.</p> <p>He was doing all this stuff, and there was all this controversy was caused, and there were people that were really upset at him, and people upset at me but what was interesting is the last day of the contest, I didn't really say much. He was the one out there ranting and raving, and posting stuff all over Facebook and trying to trash me, and tell everyone he was a better person than me.</p> <p>We had three times the sales the last day than we had the entire prior last week combined, so it worked in our favor tremendously. In fact, I had a bunch of JV partners who were so annoyed at what he was doing, they actually went out there and were promoting, without me even asking, were promoting my bonus package just so that he wouldn't win which was kind of funny. It all kind of comes around.</p> <p>Then we were in the middle of this launch of Rippln which I'm sure some of you guys have had a chance to see that. I was brought under to write the whole sales and marketing part of the company launch, help orchestrate all that stuff. It's been going amazing. We've gotten over half a million people to sign up in the first 30 days. It's been fun, but with that, there's been a lot of controversy written about it.</p> <p>We had Tech Crunch, this big huge tech blog, go and write. They don't really write anti articles but they wrote a huge anti article about my video, the pre-launch video which made me proud. Then we got Salty Droid did a write-up on it, and some other guys who think they're cool wrote big write-ups about how we're scam artists, and all this stuff.</p> <p>It kind of made me smile because all this fuel has just been great for our business, for our brand, for everything that we're doing. The controversy behind things has been awesome. Now, what I want to talk about today is the concept of polarity. Polarity is the opposite of neutrality. A lot of people in their marketing want to be very neutral. They don't want to offend anybody.</p> <p>They are very careful not to step on anybody's toes but the problem with being neutral is when you're neutral, you're boring. Nobody listens to you. Nobody pays attention. As much fun as it is to make everybody happy, that's not the way to make money. I don't know about you guys, but I'm not in this business to make everybody happy. I'm in this business to make money.</p> <p>The neutrality behind most people's marketing is what keeps them from really succeeding. It makes them irrelevant. It makes them so that people don't really talk about you. You may have some people that are interested but nobody talks about you. That's what causes your business and your brand to grow.</p> <p>It was interesting, I was talking to Mike Filson about this awhile ago, and Mike said one of his biggest things he's always trying to do is figure out how can I stay relevant. He said, \u201cYou know, guys like me and him have been in this market for 10 years and so, and you look at how many people and personalities have come and gone in that time,\u201d and he said, \u201cmost of them just aren't relevant anymore. What are we doing to stay relevant, to stay top of mind, to stay on people's radar?\u201d</p> <p>Because literally, in the internet world, if you're quiet for a week, you're pretty much gone. You've disappeared off the radar, which is a whole other story in of itself, why it's important to contact your audience more often, email at least daily. Daegan, one of my close buddies, he preaches emailing twice a day.</p> <p>Staying relevant is a big thing. Back to the neutrality part of it, I was reading this thing awhile ago. This is a couple of years ago so I'm sure I don't know the stats but the concept, I remember. It was talking about Howard Stern and about people that watch his show. They did surveys.</p> <p>They found the average person who liked his show listened for 35 or 40 minutes at a time, and the average person who hated his show listened for over an hour at a time. When they surveyed both audiences to find out why they listened, the reason was the same in both cases. It was, \u201cWe wanted to hear what he was going to say next.\u201d</p> <p>That's really a key here. You look at the great figureheads, you look at the people that have the big brands, just in the celebrity world. We just watched the finale of Celebrity Apprentice last night. Look at Donald Trump. When he was doing this whole campaign against Obama when he was going to run for president, this whole thing about Obama, trying to bring out his birth certificate, that for me, I don't care which side you\u2019re on or anything like that, but it was interesting.</p> <p>It got people talking and noise, and all this stuff. People hated Donald Trump for it, people loved him because of it but he caused polarity. What happens when you cause polarity is there will be a group of people who despise you and who hate you. Most people don't do that in their marketing because they're scared of that. They don't want that.</p> <p>That was always really, really tough for me. It was really tough for me to see people talk bad about me. In fact, it's still hard for my employees when they see stuff like that. For me, it doesn't bother me anymore. It's been happening long enough, I get it. There are going to be people that don't like me. I'm okay with that.</p> <p>The other interesting fact about polarity is when you create a group of people and make them dislike you, it also takes another group of people and makes them love you 10 times more. That's the power of polarity. When you switch from being in a neutral state where you're trying to please everybody to a polar state where you pick the things you want to do and not want to do, stuff like that, again, you get people who despise you and you'll get people who love you.</p> <p>Those people who love you will spend so much more money with you because of that. They're attracted to that polarity. I look at all the people that I spend money with. I buy things in a lot of different niches. The people I buy from are always the kind of crazy people a little bit. I always joke the crazy people have the best ideas.</p> <p>I always like to subscribe to what they're doing and they\u2019re talking about. That's what I spend my money on because me and everybody, even if they won't admit it, you like the people on the fringes. You like the heretics. You like the people that are kind of pushing the envelope because it's more interesting. It's a more interesting conversation to talk about, to think about, to participate in, and people are attracted to that.</p> <p>At the same time, like I said, there are going to be people who are not attracted to that but if that's happening, that's a good thing. Dan Kennedy, one of my mentors, he said, \u201cIf you haven't offended somebody by noon each day, then you're not marketing hard enough.\u201d I know that's going to be hard for a lot of you guys but it's the key.</p> <p>One thing I want to mention about polarity is there's a right and a wrong way to do this. The right way, at least the way that I subscribe to is I don't go out there trying to pick fights. I just do what I'm going to do, and then I stand behind it. For example, the whole Rippln thing, we did it and I stood behind it.</p> <p>The launch for Pure Leverage that we won, we did our thing, I stood behind it but I wasn't going out there picking fights. I look at the guy who we thrashed in the contest, and I look at the way that he was trying to create polarity. I think it backfired on him. He went out there and started a hate smear campaign against me and made videos, and posted on Facebook every 30 seconds for two days about how much he hated me, and how he was going to steal my Ferrari, and all this stuff.</p> <p>It was really distasteful, and maybe he got some audience from that. He probably did but all I know is that he was polar so far to the other opposite, to the other extreme, that the people in our market, our peers were so turned off by what he was doing that they started promoting my stuff without me even ever asking.</p> <p>I think there's a level where you can go way too far and you outcast so many people that they don't want to become part of what you're doing. There's kind of a fine line there. With the two campaigns this month that caused all of our controversy, I wasn't doing anything really. I was just doing my thing.</p> <p>Because we were doing it and we were doing it aggressively and we were doing it well, it caused people to become upset and it caused people to become huge fans. That's what I want to say about polarity. Don't go out there. You're not trying to be a thug. You're not trying to go cause fights and that kind of thing.</p> <p>People can see through that. It's not the right way to do it. It's just coming out there and being yourself, not being nervous about who you are, and just doing it. It was interesting, two days ago, I was in our garage. I rented a power washer and power washed our whole driveway. It was super fun. If anyone hasn't done that, it's a fun project.</p> <p>I power washed the whole driveway. Then I found these boxes that got wet. In some of the boxes, there was this tube. I pulled the tube out. I remember seeing when I was a kid. I pulled it out and there was a picture of my ninth grade graduating class inside of it. I opened it up and saw all of my friends, all these people that meant so much to me.</p> <p>I looked at it, and there wasn't a single person in that picture that I've kept in contact with over the last, I guess ninth grade was probably 13 or 14 years ago now. There wasn't a single person that I kept in contact with. I remember sitting there looking. I remember being the shy, awkward ninth grader who was so concerned about what everybody else in that picture thought.</p> <p>It's all I could think about, \u201cWhat if they don't like me? What if they make fun of me? What if whatever?\u201d Because of that, I didn't thrive in that environment. I was an awkward, shy teenager. For me, I didn't start thriving until I started wrestling in high school. That's when I found my thing. I just stopped caring about everybody else and focused on that thing.</p> <p>I think that so many of us in our business, we're like that shy, awkward ninth grader in the picture who wants everybody to like them and because of that, they stop bringing their own personality into the game. They're so concerned about nobody making fun of them that they're just neutral and just sitting there.</p> <p>Because of that, nobody knows who they are. I was so neutral and I was so boring in ninth grade, that I guarantee you if I showed that picture to everyone in that graduating class, most of them would have no idea who I was because I was that shy, awkward, neutral person who didn't want to offend or talk about anybody.</p> <p>You look at the high school graduation, it was different because I had picked my thing. Wrestling was my thing. I focused on that, and people knew who I was because of that. It's the same way in your business, you guys. Quit worrying about what the haters, what the people who don't like you are thinking.</p> <p>Quit worrying about everything else. Just be yourself. Who are you at your core? Just go out there and do that. Whatever it is that gets you excited in the morning, go and do that kind of stuff. The way you talk to your audience, listen, this podcast was me talking in my car. It makes me laugh because I did a news segment the other day on Huffington Post.</p> <p>It was really cool. Our PR person afterwards messaged me and said, \u201cRussell, you really need to learn how to clean up your ums and your ahs.\u201d I thought, \u201cYou know what? Yeah, I could do that but then I\u2019d be losing who I am.\u201d I want to connect with you guys at a personal level because that's where you're coming to me.</p> <p>You're coming to me with personal issues. You want your business to grow. I could give you the textbook answer or I could give you what actually works. That's my goal is to be real with you guys. I want you guys to do the same thing, to be real with yourself and not be scared of polarity. It is a good thing that's going to help you win this game.</p> <p>Step off your neutral line. Quit trying to please everybody, and just be yourself. If you do that, like I said, you'll find a group of people that don't like you and they're going to be mean to you, and there are going to be hate blogs about you. Who knows how extreme it will get.</p> <p>The more aggressive you get, the more exciting you are, the more people will come out of the wood works to write hate blogs about you. It makes me laugh nowadays when I see the ones that people write about me but at the same time, because of that polarity, just by the nature of how polar opposites work, while one group will move away from you, another bigger, larger group that's more passionate and more willing to spend money will move towards you. That is the key, you guys.</p> <p>That is the key to this whole attraction marketing game. That's what I had for you guys today. I hope you enjoyed it. I'm at the office now. I have a fun day. I'm going to try to ruffle some feathers, do some fun marketing, and hopefully it makes people angry and in the interim, makes some people really, really happy. If I can do that, I've succeeded.</p> <p>If you can do that, you've succeeded as well. Thanks you guys.

I wanted to thank everybody who left feedback and comments over the weekend on the podcast. I think it was like 174 people commenting which is awesome. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. We even hit, I think we're at number fortieth top podcast last week which was pretty cool. Thank you guys all for that.</p> <p>I got some funny comments in there I'm reading. One person said that because of me, it's the first time they ever subscribed to iTunes which was pretty cool, so Apple should be giving me a percentage of anything you buy in the future. I also saw somebody say that the loved the podcast because they have the ability to slow down my voice on their phone. That's a good thing I think.</p> <p>I obviously have about a six minute commute to the office but I try to cram in about 15 minutes worth of content, just how fast I talk. That should give you guys the ability to slow me down if your commute is longer and get all the stuff out of it. Today, my podcast is going to be a little different than normal.</p> <p>Usually, I'm sharing marketing tips or tricks, things like that but I want to talk about something that's a little different but some of you guys may even be like, \u201cThis has nothing to do with anything exciting for me,\u201d but I promise you that it has everything to do with marketing in your business.</p> <p>What I want to talk about is the word awesome. We've got this little guy, he's about 22 years old that lives by us. He's got, I'm going to pronounce it wrong, he has cerebral palsy so he's handicapped. His legs don't fully function. He can walk with braces on his legs but very, very slow.</p> <p>In fact, every time I pick him up, he wants to walk from his doorstep to my car and he wants me to time him. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to walk that distance. He tries to talk but his speech is really hard for him to talk and get things out. I have to listen very, very hard to be able to understand what he's saying, just this cutest little kid.</p> <p>We take him every week to church and hang out with him there. About once a week, we bring him over to our house for dinner. His name is Jesse. I just want to talk to you a little bit about Jesse because Jesse is someone who is amazing. Every time I call him, I say, \u201cHey Jesse, how is it going, man?\u201d and his response is always, \u201cAwesome.\u201d</p> <p>Everyday, every time I hang out with him, he says, in his broken language, he says, \u201cRussell, I love my life.\u201d It's really amazing to me because he's someone who has so many things against him, so many disabilities. He can barely walk, can barely talk yet any time I ask him about how he's doing, he's always doing awesome.</p> <p>I think it's such a great lesson. I started working on my kids. I told my kids, \u201cLook, most people live their lives everyday in a state of good. You ask them, 'Hey, how are you doing today?' 'Good.'\u201d Have you noticed that? Every single person you do says, \u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>About three or four years ago, the first time I went to a Tony Robbins event, I made a conscious decision that any time somebody asked me how I was doing, I would never say good again. I would say awesome. I started doing that and I started saying awesome. It's so funny what happens.</p> <p>When you're at the airport at five in the morning and the person is checking your ID, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d \u201cI'm doing awesome,\u201d and it always catches them off guard, \u201cWow, what happened to you today?\u201d What was interesting is it just changes the whole entire dynamics of your day and about every situation you're in when somebody asks how you're doing.</p> <p>Instead of saying good, you say, \u201cI'm doing awesome.\u201d I started training my kids that. I said, \u201cLook guys, when someone asks how you're doing, you can't say good. Everyone else in the world is good. We don't want to be good. We want to be awesome.\u201d I got all my kids doing that now.</p> <p>It's funny when they hear somebody saying, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d they say, \u201cDaddy says we are awesome,\u201d and they always tell everybody we're awesome. You may think that's such a little insignificant thing but what's interesting is I don't think it is.</p> <p>I think it has to do with everything about how you produce, how you perform in life because everything we're doing, every situation we're in, we're bound by the state that we're in. If I, for example, when I was wrestling, if I would go in a wrestling match and if I was in a bad mood or if I thought I might lose, or if I wasn't excited and I walked down the mat, a lot of times, I would lose because the state that I was in.</p> <p>What I found is it really correlates over into business, athletics, business, relationships, whatever it is. The state that you're experiencing whatever you're doing in has so much to do with your outcome.</p> <p>If I got a hard day of work that day and I show up, \u201cOh man, I got a lot of work to do,\u201d instantly, because of the state I put myself in, \u201cUgh,\u201d I can't perform to my top level. It's just impossible. If I come back and I shift it where I wake up in the morning and I walk in the office and say, \u201cAwesome, excited to be here today,\u201d suddenly the state you're in is different and your performance level completely changes.</p> <p>It's shocking. You'll notice how little of a thing that is but how huge of an impact and how big of a result it is. I remember when I was wrestling in high school, I had a coach. His name was Mark James. I remember I think it was my sophomore or maybe my junior year, we had a really hard practice.</p> <p>Afterwards, he took everyone in the back hall. He was talking to us. He talked to us almost an hour. I don't remember a lot of what he said but there were a couple of things that really stuck out to me. One of them he said was just talking about the power of our attitude. He said that the attitude you have is going to drive everything one direction or the other direction.</p> <p>He said, \u201cLook, everyday we're coming here for practice, we're working out anyway.\u201d He said, \u201cYou're going to be doing the work no matter what so you can either do it with a negative attitude and make the whole thing miserable or you can have a great attitude and everything feels positive.\u201d</p> <p>He's like, \u201cYou're going to be here for two hours a day anyway in the room working out hard. Just choose your attitude. Choose the right one because if you do, your results will be 10 times better because of it.\u201d I remember taking that to heart.</p> <p>For those of you who know much about wrestling, in wrestling, we used to cut a lot of weight. This was back when I was in high school, it was before, it was actually my senior year in high school, there were three kids that died cutting weights so they changed all the rules and made it a lot more difficult but prior to that, we used to cut a lot of weight. I was cutting about 30 pounds every single week of water weight.</p> <p>That was a lot of work. It would take about three or four days to lose 30 pounds of water weight, and then we'd go weigh in, boom, we'd eat, and three hours later, we were back to the same weight we started but I was doing that every single week for an entire season. It was draining. It was hard.</p> <p>I remember thinking about Coach James, what he told me about, \u201cYou're going to be here no matter what. Just have a good attitude and everything will be different.\u201d I remember I used to put my plastic gear on. I\u2019d put my sweats on, and I started jumping rope. I\u2019d try it with a big smile on my face.</p> <p>Everyone is like, \u201cWhy are you smiling? You're cutting weight.\u201d I remember I used to tell people, \u201cLook, I've never lost with a smile on my face.\u201d I said, \u201cWhen I lose a match, I'm depressed, I'm angry, I'm frustrated. I might be crying, whatever it might be but I've never lost a match with a smile on my face so I'm going to have a smile on my face while I'm doing this because I don't want to lose.\u201d</p> <p>That was the attitude that I had in wrestling. It took me very, very far in high school and also at a college level. It's also really helped me a lot in business as well. That's something I've tried to do when we've had ups and downs. What's interesting about my business is we've had some big, big ups and some big, big downs.</p> <p>I know everybody out there struggles in business. Some of you guys are struggling to make your first dollar. Some of you are struggling to figure out what product to sell. Some of you guys are trying to struggle to figure out how to get to the next level but I've had some big wins and big losses.</p> <p>We were at the point with our company, we were doing a million dollars in sales a month and all of our merchant accounts got frozen. If you can imagine making a million dollars in sales a month with over 100 employees, that's a lot of overhead. I think our overhead at the time was about $700,000 to $800,000 a month.</p> <p>When suddenly your merchant accounts get shut down, you have no ability to collect cash, man, that's a scary situation. There are different ways to look at it. One is depressed, frustrated, and the world is picking on me type thing but what happens when you put on that attitude? As soon as you do, everything shuts down and you can't produce, or you can step up and wake up in the morning and say, \u201cToday is awesome, I'm going to go attack this thing and figure out how to beat this thing,\u201d and you walk in.</p> <p>Suddenly, the state you're in is a little different. Because of that, you can produce, the ideas come faster, the energy of the people that are around you changes, and it just changes the whole dynamic. For all you guys out there, I guess my point of today's podcast is I want you guys to be like Jesse.</p> <p>I want you guys waking up every morning and when somebody asks you how you're doing, don't be good. Good is the enemy of greatness. Don't be good. You be awesome. Next time somebody today asks you, \u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d just see what happens. Tell them you're doing awesome, and look at the strange looks you'll get on their face.</p> <p>A couple of things will happen. First off, you'll put yourself and keep yourself in a peak state of performance that you need to be in in order to be able to produce in whatever you're doing. Second off, you'll start raising the level of people around you, whether it be your employees, the people you're interacting with but as soon as you tell somebody you're doing awesome, it puts a smile on their face and changes that person's attitude as well.</p> <p>You'll start affecting other people and kind of like a bee that flies around from flower to flower, all they're doing is trying to get their nectar, trying to get their pollen but because they're doing that and they're spreading the stuff around, that's what makes all the other flowers blossom and bloom, and makes it all possible. Do that for yourself. Do it for the people around you but give yourself that gift of awesomeness.</p> <p>Just be excited. Be happy. I don't care how depressed you are or what situation you're in, whatever it might be.</p> <p>If you can just change your state, instead of being good, be awesome, just like Jesse, I don't care what situation you're in and how tough life could possibly be, you can weather those storms and come out victorious and on top. Also remember, you can't lose with a smile on your face. That's what I got for today, you guys. I'm at the office.</p> <p>I hope you guys have an awesome day today. Again, make sure you let other people know about this podcast if you're enjoying it at all, and if you got any feedback or comments, we'd love to see them on iTunes. Thanks everybody, and I\u2019ll talk to you again tomorrow.</p>", "duration": "11:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/17_-_Awesome.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1368208800, "title": "Episode #16 \u2013 The Preframe That Closes", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On this episode, Russell discusses how to properly use preframing in every step of your online sales sequence.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to the Marketing in Your Car podcast. I hope you guys are doing awesome today. I actually just got out of the gym and I'm driving back to the office and had something really exciting happen today that I wanted to share with everybody, actually, a bunch of exciting things.</p> <p>First off, we had almost 100 of you guys comment on the podcast yesterday which is exciting because I asked everyone to give some feedback. I appreciate it. Keep the good comments coming. It's fun, it's exciting, and hopefully we'll get more people to learn about our podcast because I'm sharing all this cool stuff and we should share it with everyone. I want to see everybody's businesses grow. That's my passion in life.</p> <p>With that said, if anyone has been studying my stuff for awhile, I did a really cool talk at StomperNet four or five years ago. I did another one kind of similar at Dan Kennedy's event about two years ago, not so much talking about internet marketing but talking about the sales process and the psychology behind it. There's something that happened in our business today that was really exciting that re-reminded me of that.</p> <p>If you guys saw that presentation, and if you go to YouTube I think, at least Google, if you type in \u201cRussell Brunson StomperNet presentation,\u201d you can hear the whole 90 minute presentation. I was talking about just all the different things that happened, the lifeline of your customer. Somebody comes to your website and what website do they come through to get to your website?</p> <p>When they\u2019re there, what do they see? What's the next step, and the next step? I talked about all the pieces that you need to have in place to maximize your customer value. One of the big things I talked about was the concept that if you've ever studied NLP before, neuro-linguistic programming, you learn about a topic called framing which is basically the frame that somebody enters a situation will have a huge determining factor on the response they have on the next site, the next page.</p> <p>For example, if I'm going to frame you to my friends, introduce you to my friend, I'll introduce you through a frame, \u201cHey, this is Joe. He's a really cool guy. I think you're going to like him.\u201d The frame that I introduced you to my friend through, now he's going to think, \u201cOh yeah, Joe is a cool guy.\u201d If I say, \u201cHey, this is Joe, he's a total jerk. He stole money from me. I want to introduce you to him,\u201d that frame is going to be different and their whole experience with you is going to be different.</p> <p>In fact, there's a really cool book. I can see the cover in my head but I can\u2019t remember it right now, but in that book, they shared a case study of a teacher that was tested in a college classroom. They had a substitute teacher for the day. Before the substitute teacher came in, the principal or whatever came in and said, \u201cHey, we have a substitute teacher. Before I introduce him, I\u2019d like you guys to read his bio really quick. Then I'm going to have him come in.\u201d</p> <p>They handed out the bio to all the students in the class, in a class of 900 people or so. The surveys were exactly the same of the bios except for each of them had one word different. Half of the bios said, \u201cMr. So-and-so is a very warm teacher,\u201d and the other half said, \u201cMr. So-and-so is a very cold teacher.\u201d</p> <p>That was the only difference between the frame that these guys had to meet the teacher. The teacher came in. He gave the entire class, and at the end of it, they surveyed all the students. What was interesting was that, again, all the students heard the exact same lecture, all of them read the exact same bio.</p> <p>The only difference was that half the bios said he was a warm teacher, and half said he was a cold teacher. When they surveyed the students, the students that the paper said he was a warm teacher, the vast majority said, \u201cHe was an amazing teacher, he was great, I learned a lot.\u201d The people whose paper said he was a cold teacher didn't like him, thought he was talking down to him, he was a rude person.</p> <p>It was interesting how that little tiny shift of a frame, how much it affected the reality of that class afterwards. I'm always talking about and I always teach and do, when you're sending somebody to your website, what's the frame they're coming through. The ad that they click on is a frame they're going to your website through.</p> <p>If you land them on a review site before they come to your site, that was a frame you were taking them through. There's a lot to do with different frames that you're taking someone through and how it affects the outcome on the other side. We did this test just in the last two or three days. It was really interesting.</p> <p>We have this squeeze page. On the squeeze page, it's kind of like a multi-step squeeze page where they first land on it, and it has a headline and it says, \u201cStep number one, where did you learn about us?\u201d There's radio buttons they can choose, \u201cDid you learn from this source, this source, or this source?\u201d</p> <p>They click on the button. Then boom, it says, \u201cStep number two, give us your email address.\u201d Then step number three said finish. That was the way that this squeeze page worked. Step one, two, three, and step three was finish.</p> <p>The only test we changed was we changed the word finish to \u201cGet Instant Access.\u201d That was the entire test. What was interesting, and I almost got this wrong, we ran the test. What was interesting was that when it said \u201cFinish\u201d at the end, we had 40% bump in opt-ins because the last step is when they actually give you their email address, and then it says, \u201cClick here to finish.\u201d</p> <p>We're like, \u201cWow, this is a great test. We found out we increased our opt-in rates by 40 percent.\u201d I was even telling my guys, \u201cWe should change all of our opt-in buttons that said, 'Submit here,' to, 'Click here to finish.'\u201d We were really excited, but then after they opt-in, then we take them to the next page which takes them to a video sales letter where then we sell them the product we were trying to sell them. Then they land on that page.</p> <p>What was interesting was when we looked at the data between the two, we had a 40% increase in people who opted in clicking the finish button, but then we had almost a 40% decrease in sales across the board, dramatically. It actually more than, the sales more than cut in half percentage wise, the people who clicked on finish versus the people that clicked on \u201cGet Instant Access.\u201d</p> <p>You never really know why that works but psychology teaches me, what I believe is that the frame I was taking somebody through with the finish button was saying, \u201cHey, this process is finished. You're done.\u201d In their mind, it's saying, \u201cOkay, it's complete, I'm finished,\u201d and then off comes this page trying to sell them something, and I've closed that loop. I've closed that gap.</p> <p>Now they're not in a buying position because just that little tiny, just the word on the button closed the gap on their mind which decreased sales by 50% whereas the \u201cGet Instant Access Now,\u201d then took them to a page where the loop was still open, they were trying to see what the next step was, and they were more in a state of mind where they could purchase.</p> <p>It was a very interesting test. Just think about how you guys can apply that into your business. It's all about pre-framing, opening and closing loops, a whole bunch of really cool NLP stuff that I wrap into one little five minute lesson but just think about that, guys, on your sales processes. What are you doing? Are you keeping the loop open? Are you keeping them excited, or are you shutting them off and keeping them from making the sale you want?</p> <p>I remember on a one-time offer before we did a test awhile ago, similar type concept where they purchased the product and a one-time offer came up. It said, \u201cThank you so much for ordering. Your product is in the mail. By the way, we have this other special offer.\u201d We tested that versus, \u201cWait, your order is not finished yet. Finish order customization, step one of three.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cWait, your order is not over yet, order customization,\u201d that text dramatically thrashed the other one. It's all about keeping that loop open, keeping the frame you're taking someone through in the correct way that keeps them in the buying mood. Anyway, I thought it was really interesting. That little tweak is going to make me a lot of money this year.</p> <p>I hope you guys apply that into different sales funnels, squeeze pages, sales processes. Whatever you're doing, think about the frame that someone is entering your website through and you can manipulate that. When you do that, you will manipulate and affect the outcome dramatically. I hope you guys enjoyed this podcast. If you do, please tell your friends. Tell anybody that likes marketing. It's a lot of fun.</p> <p>Again, if you like this, please leave feedback.

I'm excited for today. It's a beautiful day here in Boise. I am excited about everything that's happening. I hope you guys are having a good time in your business as well. Yesterday, I shot a trailer video for the Marketing in Your Car podcast which is kind of fun so hopefully I'll get a lot more subscribers coming in which will be fun. We appreciate all you guys.</p> <p>Today, I want to talk about what we've been working on the last few days which is not so much what we've been working on but what we've been focusing on. We've been working on our supplement but what's been fun about it is we've been over this past two or three days, we've been really focusing on shifting the channels that we're marketing through.</p> <p>We found that, just in my business as a whole, there are a couple of channels that I'm really, really good at. By channels, I mean like a distribution channel, a different type of traffic. For example, a channel could be TV, newspaper could be a channel, radio could be a channel, things like that.</p> <p>Obviously we're online. Most people just lump the internet together as one big huge, it's the internet but it's obviously not. There are a lot of channels on the internet, almost more than you can even count. There are three or four channels that I personally am really, really good at. One is the joint venture affiliate channel. I'm really good at that channel.</p> <p>The next one is email media buying. We're really good at that channel. Direct mail, we're pretty good at that channel. Those are channels we're good at. We've focused primarily as we've rolled out our supplement on those channels. So far, it's doing really, really good.</p> <p>We keep adding in more pieces to that. For example, with email media buying, we found some lists that are converting, their offers are converting really well to. What we do because we want to make our offer evergreen is instead of sending out just one solo ad that goes out to the entire list once and then moving onto the next list, we set it up so that our solo ad goes out to a portion of that list every single week.</p> <p>For example, we have an ad running with World Net Daily right now, and I think their list is like a million people or something like that, so right now, our ad goes out to one seventh of the list every Monday, which is cool because every time it goes out, we make 50, 60, 100 sales, and it's just consistent though as opposed to we could send out one email, get a whole bunch of sales and then it ends.</p> <p>This way, we can do that and it rotates through it every seven or eight weeks, we've hit the entire list and then it starts over and keeps going. It's an evergreen type thing. We have something similar with our Dot Com Secrets local offer. We have a couple of people that mail to a percentage of their list every single day, it just rotates through their list.</p> <p>That way, it's more of an evergreen thing as opposed to just a one-time strategy. We've been doing those, studying the lists for it, finding joint venture partners, a bunch of stuff like that and it's been going really, really good but now that we're getting these channels dialed in and the numbers are working good, and they're consistent, what other channels can we add to this?</p> <p>It's been really fun looking at that because there are so many different ways to drive traffic. You have Facebook, we have Google, we have the other ad networks. We have PPV stuff, CPV, there's so many different channels and ways to do it. It can get overwhelming.</p> <p>What we've been doing is just really strategically looking at the ones that we want to test first. Some of them, again, that we're really good at doing and some we're really bad at doing so we're finding partners in each of those spaces like someone who is a lot better than me at Facebook because I don't think I\u2019ll ever be good at Facebook just because I can't stand logging into Facebook, so finding somebody who is good at that and let them run it, test it, and try a bunch of things, and maybe invest $1000 or $2000 in that source trying to see if we can make it work, testing it, trying it, and just perfecting it until we can get that channel to work.</p> <p>If we can't get that channel to work, that's fine too. That's one thing that a lot of people don't understand is that just because it works in one channel doesn't mean it's going to work in another channel. If we can\u2019t get it to work, then move on, try another channel and keep going through but it's just kind of fun.</p> <p>The reason I wanted to talk about this today is because about a year ago, I had a really interesting conversation with Perry Belcher who is one of the smartest marketers I've ever met, and a really cool guy too but he was talking about they had hired Mary Ellen Tribby to be their CEO for a year, year and a half, something like that.</p> <p>I remember when they first hired her, I said, \u201cWhat was the reason why you brought her in to be your CEO?\u201d He said, \u201cMary Ellen always says that us internet marketers, that we're crazy because we go out there and we spend all this time, effort, and money creating an offer, getting it out there. We launch it, make a bunch of sales, and then the next day, we're onto the next project.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cThe way Mary Ellen looks at business is more like a play. How crazy would it be if you were to make a big play, you go to hire the actors, the directors, and you guys practice for six months, and you go on, you go in Boise, Idaho, and you put on this play. It's a smashing success and everybody loves it, and then you just go home.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cNo, if that works, and you're making a ton of money off it, then you take that play on the road. You take that show on the road and you go to Chicago, and then Dallas, and Denver. You take it across the country and across the world. You turn that success into tens of millions of dollars.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cThat's the way that she looks at internet marketing is you create a good offer, and then you got to take it on the road.\u201d That's what we've been really focusing on with our supplement is we created the good offer. Now we're taking it on the road and we\u2019re focusing on taking it to Dallas, Denver, and Chicago, and all these different channels.</p> <p>We've got direct mail going forward now. We have all these different things. We're just adding channel after channel after channel and taking that from an idea that right now is doing good money to by the time this year is out, it should be doing insane amounts of money just because we're really dialing in channel by channel, and perfecting each of those.</p> <p>Just something to think about in your own business and your own marketing is after you've got something working is taking that and changing the channel, and focusing on different areas, and really scaling it, taking your show on the road. I'm at the office. I hope you guys enjoyed that. If you like the Marketing in Your Car podcast, please go into iTunes and rate us. I would really appreciate it. I appreciate you guys.

This episode reveals ideas you can use to strengthen your funnel.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and this is the Marketing in Your Car podcast. I want to welcome you guys to today. I don't know about you, but it's a beautiful day today and I'm having a good time. Yesterday was one of the most fun days I've had at the office in a long, long time. I want to talk to you about what we did because it's really exciting. It's something that everybody else should be doing in their business as well.</p> <p>We've got a supplement that we've been selling for the last six months or so, and it's been doing really well but we're always trying to figure out ways to increase how much money we make per customer so that we can spend more on advertising because as you know, whoever can spend the most money on advertising wins in this game.</p> <p>Right now, we're spending about $30 to $40 to get somebody to sign up for a free trial, which is good and right now, what we're doing is the trial is 14 days long so after about 14 days, actually at day 14, we're a little bit above break even right now. It's working good but it's still kind of scary because we have that two week float that we're waiting before we make our money back.</p> <p>That's where we're at right now. We've been trying to figure out how do you, what can we add to make it so that we can make money for every single customer. We started looking at our entire sales process, and that turned into something where I was actually at the office last night until one working on it because we had so much fun with it.</p> <p>We looked first at our sales process. We looked at people coming to our site, they see the offer, step one, we ask for the shipping, step two, we ask for the credit card. Now, what are things we're missing? What happens about people that come to page one but they leave? We're not following up with them.</p> <p>We put banner retargeting on that page so that when somebody comes and then they leave, we follow them around with banners everywhere. That was the first thing. Then we said, they come, they opt in, but they don't buy, what do we do? We built out a whole email follow-up sequence to try to close them.</p> <p>Then if they do buy, what do we do? Some of us were thinking, \u201cWhat else could we sell them?\u201d Right now, we've got our supplement and we're trying to figure out what other products we could sell. We're looking out on the market trying to find all different things that other people were already selling to our customers.</p> <p>Finally, we found a skin cream that actually related really well to it. We called the company up and within about five minutes, they agreed to private label it for us. Boom, suddenly we had our own skin cream to go with our front end supplements. Now we had an upsell. Then we went out there and tried to find some other products.</p> <p>We found a website that had ten different products for people in our target market, and we called them up. Sure enough, they agreed to let us sell every one of the products that are on their website, and we get like a 75% profit margin on all these products. Then we found a couple other things we could add in the funnel.</p> <p>Anyway, pretty quickly, within two or three hours of us just asking that question of what else can we do? When we look at our sales funnel, somebody comes in, what pages are they going to, what are they doing? Then we try to think, how do we maximize, how do we make each of these steps better?</p> <p>What can we add here to get more people, to close more people, to convert them or to get people who leave, to get them to come back, and people who buy, how to get them to buy again, at what price points, and stuff like that? Within a couple of hours of asking those questions, we were able to change our funnel.</p> <p>Obviously we haven't had a chance to drive traffic to it yet. We just finished six or seven hours ago, but now, you look at our funnel and it's much more robust. I think right now, we're looking at if we get 20% of the people to take our upsell for our skin cream, our front end profit doubles. That means we could spend $60 to $70 to acquire a customer, and we'd still be okay.</p> <p>It's just interesting and it's been so much fun. For all you guys, I want you to take a look at your sales funnels, your products that are already doing well, that are already converting, and just think, \u201cWhat else could we add here? What kind of upsell could we add? What kind of downsell could we add? What kind of exit pop-up could we put in here? If we follow these people with banners if they leave, what's our follow-up sequence look like? Do we add more messages to our follow-up sequence?\u201d</p> <p>These are all the questions you should be asking. When you start asking those kinds of questions, it makes a good sales process very quickly become a great sales process. It's really been exciting for me and for everybody here on our team. I woke up early again this morning. I haven't slept very much but I'm excited to get back in the office and keep on cranking it out, and doing some more because it's just so much fun right now.</p> <p>Anyway, I just got to the office. I hope you guys enjoy that. My goal for all you guys though right now is to look at your funnel and figure out how to strengthen it, and what things you can add. If you do that, that will be some money you'll find today, and you'll do what I tell you guys to do a lot of times. Give yourself a raise everyday.</p> <p>You do that by these little tweaks, little changes\u00a0 that are going to change your business. Thanks to you guys.

I want to welcome you guys to today. It's a beautiful day here in Boise, Idaho. I'm excited to drive to the office but I want to share with you guys something that happened yesterday.</p> <p>I've been involved, the last 30 days have been kind of crazy in my businesses. On top of everything else, we were in a contest for this one network marketing company that we're involved with for a Ferrari, and it's been crazy trying to win that. Then we also launched a network marketing company called Rippln which has been going crazy, which has right now growing faster than Facebook did.</p> <p>It's been a crazy 30 days, and the month just ended for us so I'm excited to get back and start focusing on some other projects as well. Today, we're focusing on our supplement which will be fun, but I wanted to share with you one interesting thing that I remembered last night. Back in the day, we used to do a lot of product launches.</p> <p>We haven't done a product launch in a couple of years because of the stress behind them and all the stuff that goes with a product launch, so we just kind of haven't done them recently but I forgot that when we used to do product launches, we do the big launch. Usually they would be a seven day launch. What was interesting is we would normally sell as much product on the last day of the launch as we would on the first day.</p> <p>If you looked at the graph, it's almost like a big smiley face, tons of sales, and then it slowly dropped down in the middle of the week, and then the last day would spike back up. For the Ferrari contest, I was beating the other guys pretty well until yesterday. I think we had sold 750 copies of the product, which is pretty dang good.</p> <p>That's a lot of sales for a 30 day period of time, especially thinking in the middle of it, we spent two and a half weeks launching a network marketing company so I only had basically two weeks to even compete at the contest. Basically, we had sold a lot. I was proud. We were doing really good.</p> <p>Then yesterday, the contest was ending at midnight Eastern time so the owner of the affiliate program that we're promoting, he basically told me, \u201cRussell, if you can get 40 more sales today, you got a pretty good shot of just winning it pretty easily.\u201d I'm like, \u201cAlright, we'll try to do 40 more sales.\u201d</p> <p>We started promoting the last day. We had some scarcity obviously because the bonuses we were offering and stuff were going to disappear at midnight. We did a couple of things that were strategic that I think worked out really well for us, but when all was said and done, we sold 188 copies yesterday, yesterday alone, which still blows my mind that we sold that many.</p> <p>We sold more on that by far than we did on the first day, almost first week. Scarcity played such a huge role in it, 188 copies, just blows my mind. The way we did it is basically a couple of things. I had done webinars leading up to the launch and stuff like that. I've been replaying those webinars.</p> <p>Yesterday morning, we send an email to the entire list basically saying, \u201cThere's 12 hours left. You got to hurry,\u201d then we went through and started making segments of our list. We looked at the webinar. We had about 4300 people that registered for the webinar. We took that list and scrubbed out everybody who had already purchased.</p> <p>That dropped it down to 3500 people, whatever it was. Then we looked at those who had attended the webinar but didn't buy it, and those who had not attended and didn't buy. I went through and actually made a personal video for each of those segments saying, \u201cHey, this is Russell and I noticed you registered for the webinar but for some reason, you didn't show up,\u201d and then made one that said, \u201cI saw you registered for the webinar, you were even on it, but for some reason, you didn't buy.\u201d</p> <p>I made these personal videos. Then I sent it to each of those segments with about six hours left, saying, \u201cThere's six hours left. I made a personal video that's important for you to go watch, so go watch it.\u201d Boom, that video went through again that aspect of it to help close people. We used that.</p> <p>Then I did a two-hour warning just to everybody who had registered for the webinar. I knew that I didn't want to email my whole list again but those 4200 people were the people that were the most interested out of everybody. We sent our two-hour warning right before, and said, \u201cTwo hours left, you got to hurry.\u201d</p> <p>That last two hours, we sold 80 just in the last two hours alone. Then it closed down. It was just a shock to me how, we always talk about having scarcity in your offers but having scarcity when you orchestrate it correctly and you do it right can sell so much product so quickly, that fear of loss people have is such a big thing. Fear of loss, I talked about this before, not on a podcast but a seminar, talking about my kids, how when I try to get my kids to come to dinner.</p> <p>I'm like, \u201cCome to dinner,\u201d and they just lay there, and nothing you can do to get them off the floor, get them from whatever activity they're doing to come and eat dinner except for one thing. If I come back and I tell my kids like Bowen, \u201cBowen, Ellie is eating your dinner,\u201d boom, he jumps up and sprints and runs in because that fear of loss is the biggest driving force for little kids. It is for us too.</p> <p>My message for today is just to think about that. Think about fear of loss and scarcity, and how you could add that to your business. I almost think it's intelligent to pull your products off the market once a month just so you could have a fear of loss. With the Rippln launch, I talked to Brian the owner about this.</p> <p>I said, right now, they're in this NDA phase. It's all this prelaunch stuff but I was like, \u201cIf we, a week before launch, if we shut it down and just said nobody gets any NDAs for seven days, and let them know that a week in advance or two days in advance, 'Hey, we're going to shut this down and you're not going to get any NDAs until actual launch day,' that two day prior, I guarantee will be 50% of the growth of the entire company because of that fear of loss, again, I need to get this now, because in two days from now, I won't be able to lock anybody in.\u201d</p> <p>It's just interesting. Think about different ways you can use that, whether it be sales, whether it be bonuses or value adds, or upsells, or whatever it is. If you can think about different ways to increase that fear of loss in what you're doing, it will do big things for you. That is my message for today. I'm at the office now.

I want to welcome you to the Marketing in Your Car podcast. Today, I actually just got my haircut and I'm driving back home. It was kind of fun, before my haircut, I had somebody call me and they're writing a book, and they want to interview me about success and about stuff like that for the book.</p> <p>One of the questions that they asked me sparked a thought that I wanted to pass on this podcast. Any of you guys thinking about it as well, basically, the question had to do with why do most people not succeed. What's the reason behind it? Is it fear of success? Is it fear of failure? What is it that causes most people not to succeed? What do you do different that has made it possible for you to have great success?</p> <p>I started thinking about that. It reminded me of one night, one of my close friends, he's a chiropractor. He just started his chiropractic clinic. It was kind of struggling. He called me one night and asked if I could talk, so we went over to his clinic and sat down and just started talking for a couple of hours.</p> <p>I could see he was in a really bad place. He was just very concerned and freaking out, and all sorts of stuff. He was just very scared of all the stuff that could happen. Because of that, he didn't know what to do and he couldn't move. He was kind of stuck in this really bad spot. I remember I sat there and thought for a minute.</p> <p>Then I asked him, I said, \u201cFor you to be successful, you got to do what I do. You need to look at what is the worst case scenario.\u201d He said, \u201cWorst case scenario, I go bankrupt.\u201d I'm like, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cIf I go bankrupt, then this, this, this.\u201d</p> <p>I'm like, \u201cYou got to dig deeper. What are your real fears? If bankruptcy is the worst case scenario, what are your fears about that?\u201d \u201cWell, if that happened, that means I would probably lose my house, and if I did that, I would lose this, and this would happen.\u201d I made him sit down and we actually mapped out what was the worst case scenario.</p> <p>What was that thing? He listed it out. I said, \u201cLook, if you're going to be successful in this venture, you have to be okay with the worst case scenario. Until you are completely okay with the worst case scenario,\u201d I said, \u201cyou will be so scared, you won't be willing to gamble the dice and do what you need to do in order to be successful in this business.\u201d</p> <p>After awhile, he said, \u201cYou know what, you're right. I'm okay with that. If that's the worst case scenario, I can live with that. If that's what's going to happen, that's what's going to happen.\u201d As soon as he was able to accept that, then he was able to start producing and start getting out there and actually doing what he needed to do to be successful in the game.</p> <p>I think that that's a lesson for people in any area of life. In wrestling, I had the same thing. In business, I've had the same thing multiple times where if I don't know what the worst case scenario is, I can\u2019t be successful. A little while ago, we had our merchant account shut down. We had 100 employees that had almost a million dollars a month in payroll, overhead, and expenses, and we lost our merchant accounts.</p> <p>I remember I went to this paralyzing fear. I didn't know what to do and I didn't know how to move or how to react. I was just stuck. I remember sitting there thinking, \u201cMan, I'm kind of in a bad spot.\u201d It wasn't until I sat down and did this same exercise myself and I said, \u201cWhat is the worst case scenario?\u201d I said, \u201cWorst case, I've got to shut down our company or I kick out people. I got to file for bankruptcy,\u201d whatever it might be.</p> <p>I listed those things out and I had to become okay with that. The second I was okay with that, saying, \u201cLook, if that's the worst thing that's going to happen, I can deal with that,\u201d suddenly, that paralyzing fear disappeared and I was able to step up and to produce and do what I needed to do to break through and create something better than the worst case scenario.</p> <p>That's I think where leadership really comes from. As leaders, we have to have a vision of where we want to go, and then we have to be willing and able to guide ourselves and our team and get there, and be willing to act and move but if we're scared of the worst case scenario, and we keep pushing it to the back of our mind because we don't want to think about it, that will paralyze you and keep you from taking the action you need.</p> <p>Step number one for any of you guys is list out what's the worst case scenario in the situation. Then become okay with that, and then build a vision to make something better than the worst case. Make something as great and amazing as you can but realize that the worst thing that could possibly happen is that, and if I'm okay with that, then I've got the ability to move and to really shine.</p> <p>I look at my wrestling. When I was all the way through high school and all the way through college, I was the kind of wrestler I was good in practice but I was much better on the mat. I think part of it was because of my attitude where it was kind of like if I lost, I didn't really care because there's always the next match and the next tournament.</p> <p>I just competed at a higher level than I think my skill set was. I would always, if you look back at high school and college, I always upset people that I shouldn't have beat because I stepped on the mat and I would just go out there. I think the reason is because a lot of times, people didn't want to lose so bad that I was able to beat them.</p> <p>For me, my senior year in college was the first time I ever experienced that. I knew people had this problem but I never experienced it until my senior year. My senior year, my very first match, I wrestled a kid who ended up winning the NCAs and was a two-time NCA champ, three time or four time finalist.</p> <p>I wrestled in this match. I lose to him by one point. I was frustrated but I was like, \u201cMan, I'm at that level. I'm close enough that I should be in the All American this year.\u201d That was my goals. After that match, everything started going downhill. I ended up losing insane amount of matches afterward.</p> <p>It was so embarrassing to me. I realized later on in the season, luckily I was able to pull myself out of it about halfway through the season, but I realized that my fear of the worst case, because this was my last year, I had to prove it. Everything in my entire career was on the line for this and I had to prove that I could do it.</p> <p>Because of that, I wasn't able to produce. I wasn't able to succeed and I didn't wrestle as well as I should. I think my senior year is probably my worst year because of that, because I was so afraid, \u201cThis is my last shot.\u201d I just want you guys to think about that, if you're in athletics, if you're in business, and in your personal life, your marriage, your family.</p> <p>Whatever it is, you've got to become okay with the worst case scenario because as soon as you do, it's the most freeing experience you will experience. It gives you the ability to step up and produce, and do what you need to do to get your job done. That is my words of wisdom for today. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope that you got some value out of it.</p> <p>If you like this, if you like our podcast at all, please go to iTunes and rate us. I would love to see some feedback. It's kind of fun to see some of the reviews coming in. We appreciate you guys. I hope that you get a lot of value out of this, and I will talk to you all tomorrow on our next podcast.

If you haven't been on one yet, Google Hangout is basically, you jump on your webcam and you can have four or five, I think you can have up to ten other people jump on as well. You see all their little webcams. Whoever talks, it shows their video up top and little head shots of the people down below. Then when they talk, it jumps them up. It's pretty cool.</p> <p>Last night, I was actually interviewed by the Huffington Post through a live Google Hangout. It was me and three other experts who are on there, along with a host. It was a really fun experience because it was just like I was in the studio getting interviewed for the news, except for I was sitting in my bedroom with my laptop, and it was really cool. I saw how they were using it.</p> <p>They're using it on a big scale. They're actually publishing a live 24 hour a day news show using Google Hangouts. They had a producer and people. It was really exciting, really cool actually. First of all, I want to say anyone who wants to start your own news channel, you can do it with Google Hangouts. These guys, obviously Huffington Post is a huge company but they were able to do it.</p> <p>They have the same technology we all have. Google Hangouts is completely free so it was pretty cool, but then we're using it in our business in a lot of other ways. Right now, some of you guys know with Rippln we're going to be rolling out, we've been doing tons of Google Hangouts. Everyday, I do a Google Hangout and have everyone on our team bring their teams to the Google Hangout, kind of like back in the day with network marketing companies, they were grown through hotel meetings.</p> <p>This is kind of like a hotel meeting that we do every single day at noon for 30 minutes. We get people on, get excited, we sign them up, and then the next day, they bring back their friends. We just keep doing this process over and over again. Our team is growing. We're at 26,000 plus this morning and growing like wildfire. It's pretty exciting.</p> <p>Now, some of the other interesting things, we've been using Google Hangouts also to sell product, a lot of product. In fact, we had this friend and they did a webinar. They put it on for a week ahead of time. They did the webinar, and then on the webinar, they sold $70,000 worth of product. They did pretty well.</p> <p>Then the next day, they did a Google Hangout. The Hangout was basically just with everybody who had been on the webinar, and it was to answer questions. They sat on there for three or four hours just answering questions, talking to people about it, getting them excited, and ended up almost doubling the sales during the Google Hangout which is pretty amazing.</p> <p>Then the other exciting thing is Google Hangouts are run like they stream live on YouTube so as soon as the Hangout was over, it was kind of cool because people during the Hangout can ask questions and all that kind of stuff. People were asking questions and they were responding. As soon as they're done, all those questions, all those comments instantly turn into YouTube comments.</p> <p>The second the video was live, there's 1000 comments that pop in there. It's just amazing that because of the comments, because it's YouTube and because Google wants to award people for doing Google Hangouts right now, they're ranking those videos very, very high. This guy, he had done $70,000 on the live webinar. I think he did a $60,000 on the Google Hangout but that Google Hangout was archived on Google and he was ranked number one for the product name, for what he was selling.</p> <p>For the next three or four months, people kept searching for that product name and he told me he sold over $50,000 more in stuff from people who would just stumble upon his Google Hangout that is now there and archived for the rest of time and all eternity. It's kind of interesting because he did that work once, and that sales presentation he made will continue to sell for him forever.</p> <p>Really, that's one of the magical, powerful things about Google Hangouts. After you're done, those things are archived forever and they'll keep closing sales for you 24 hours a day, seven days a week for forever. When you're dead and when your kids are dead, and your grandkids are dead, those things will still be closing sales for you.</p> <p>It's exciting. For those who have not tried Google Hangouts yet, they're completely free. Just go into your Google Plus account. On the right-hand side, there's a big button that says Hangout. You click on it, boom, you invite some friends to it, you name it, you stream it live, and you can do it. I just recommend jumping in and doing one.</p> <p>Just do one for fun. I'm going to do one today with just myself on it just to create the video that I can then use in a promotional video. That's the other thing is you make quick promotional videos by making Hangouts. There are a lot of really cool ways to use it but it's by far one of the most powerful tools we've ever used for converting customers, for driving traffic, for sustaining your sales message, and it's a super powerful tool.</p> <p>If you haven't done a Google Hangout yet, go and do it. I'm at the office right now. I'm going to be doing three or four Hangouts on queue for myself to do today so I'm going to go jump on one right now, and make some money. You guys should be doing it as well. Thanks everybody.</p>", "duration": "05:52", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/11_-_Hangout_To_Close_Sales.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1366740000, "title": "Episode #10 \u2013 Your Opinion Doesn\u2019t Matter", "author": "", "summary": "<p>I hate when people give their opinion on what is good and bad. \u00a0The only thing that matters is what works in an actual test. \u00a0The writers at TechCrunch need to understand that the only thing that matters in a new company is results\u2026 Not what they think is cool.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson with DotComSecrets.com, and this is the \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcast. This is the first podcast where I haven\u2019t actually been in my car. I\u2019m actually at my office right now, because today I\u2019m going to go on a little bit of a rant. The title of this rant is \u201cYour Opinion is Irrelevant\u201d [laughs]. The reason why I\u2019m doing this, and you may think I\u2019m upset, but I\u2019m actually really, really excited.</p> <p>Rippln got written up in \u201cTechCrunch\u201d. TechCrunch is a huge tech blog, and most people dream about having their company, their startup, talked about in TechCrunch. So that was an exciting thing, except for the fact that the TechCrunch articles says, \u201cWhat Not to Do in Your Startup Promo Video\u201d. Now this made me smile, because I was the one who created the startup promo video. I wrote the copy for it. We got it animated, and we\u2019ve used it to roll out. Now I\u2019m going to read you this article first. I\u2019m going to bleep out the curse words, because he uses a lot of them, but this is what it says.</p> <p>It says,</p> <p>\u201cThanks to my job, I get to see a lot of stupid B.S., most gets filtered out, but every now and then, something just rises up that\u2019s so ridiculously stupid, it\u2019s just begging to be called out. That\u2019s the case with this promotional video from the kind folks at Rippln , which is more or less a two-minute case study for how not to pitch your soon to be ultra-viral app to the general public, or to the press, or to potential employees, or investors.</p> <p>So, here\u2019s the step-by-step of what not to do in your video. First, don\u2019t tell us your app is going to be viral before it\u2019s even friggin\u2019 released. Second, don\u2019t expect the press to cover your stupid app before it\u2019s been released, except for maybe in posts parodying it. Number three, don\u2019t assume your friends or family members will be talking about it. Likewise, don\u2019t assume strangers will be coming up to you on the friggin\u2019 streets to talk about it. Number four, don\u2019t say your stupid app is going to change the way we communicate, or call it \u201cthe biggest breakthrough since e-mail\u201d. Next, don\u2019t promise that your app will change how commerce, either online or off line, is happening \u2013 definitely not both. Don\u2019t promise again that your stupid app is going to go viral. Don\u2019t compare its growth to Facebook or Twitter. Don\u2019t pretend to know how people were talking to Mark Zuckerberg in the cafeteria at Harvard or how he would respond. Please don\u2019t bring Adam D\u2019Angelo into this. Also, if you must, don\u2019t say he looks like a thirteen-year old. Don\u2019t try to impress me with Adam D\u2019Angelo\u2019s net worth. Wait, why are we talking about Adam D\u2019Angelo again? Don\u2019t make your stupid app sound like some sort of exclusive club with an inner circle, and talk about how lucky we are to be able to be invited in and \u201ccurse word\u201d. VELVET ROPE? INNER CIRCLE? F*, NO. INVITE FIVE LEADERS? WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU? Don\u2019t say there\u2019s a brief window for me to join, but please, if there is, let\u2019s hope this abominable window closes soon, because this startup sucks. Don\u2019t pretend to have trade secrets. Trade secrets? Don\u2019t refer to an NDA when you really mean personal information collecting form to use in our B.S. marketing. Also, who signs an NDA on YouTube? And don\u2019t participate in the general douchebaggery which pretty much describes this entire video.\u201d</p> <p>When I read that, at first I was kind of upset about it. Then I started thinking about it. I want to show you guys some of the stats, because if you haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s been happening behind the scenes in Rippln, it\u2019s going crazy.</p> <p>In the first seven days, we had over 150,000 people register for this site by filling out an NDA. Now this is through a manual process. No one has been able to mass-promote it, so it\u2019s kind of cumbersome to even have happen, yet, holy cow, it\u2019s working. Right now, it is growing faster than Facebook or Twitter. Right now, it is going viral. The press is covering it, including TechCrunch [laughs], whether they like it or not. Most people\u2019s friends or family members have talked to them about it, and total strangers have been contacting us about it, as well. Right now, the app is changing how we communicate, so it\u2019s kind of funny that all of these things that he\u2019s angry about have all been prophetic. Every one of these things is happening and has happened.</p> <p>The fact that there\u2019s this huge divide means that the copy on the video worked perfectly. The goal with copy and with a video is never to unite everyone into your cause. It\u2019s to split people in half. When you split people in half, there is polarity, and polarity is a good thing. It creates an \u201cus versus them\u201d situation, and it\u2019s good, so when all is said and done, he\u2019s giving his opinions about why he does not like the video, yet the video is working. It\u2019s working like crazy. It\u2019s helping this grow out faster than any other tech company, any other startup that I\u2019ve ever seen. Based on our current numbers, projections for month number one, when Rippln goes live, are $100,000,000 in month number one, which is interesting, considering most startups that are featured on TechCrunch don\u2019t make any money. In fact, there\u2019s one guy\u2019s comment down here that I really appreciated, and so I\u2019m going to read them to you guys, too.</p> <p>He says,</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems you have in the tech scene is lack of marketing ability. You have people who have amazing products, apps, software, et cetera, but nobody ever hears about them. One of the big reasons behind it is the aversion that people in the Valley seem to have to effective direct marketing. People see that firms like Google and Apple hate direct marketing, so they figure they should, too. Well, Google and Apple both have billions of dollars at hand. They can afford to hate the most cost-effective form of advertising in the world. People are afraid to sell, because they don\u2019t want to look like jerks or douchebags. Well, personally, I feel like more of a douchebag if I couldn\u2019t make the mortgage than I would by aggressively selling to people. Amazing products go undiscovered and companies go broke in the Valley every single year because people are afraid to push the envelope a little bit with marketing. There are billions-of-dollars companies in the Valley that could have an amazing impact on people\u2019s lives, but they will never get the chance, because people in the Valley are afraid to sell.</p> <p>Anyway, back to my starting point here. In my original post, I acted like a jerk towards the author, and I apologize for that.\u201d</p> <p>And he goes on about how he\u2019s not a part of Rippln, and blah, blah, blah. Again, I want to come back to how someone can write an article about why something doesn\u2019t work, which this guy\u2019s trying to do, but it\u2019s working. He says, \u201cWhat Not to Do in Your Startup Promo Video\u201d, and this happens to be the most successful startup promo video in the history of the Internet, and he\u2019s telling us that it\u2019s a bad case study. Yet it\u2019s working perfectly, so I think it\u2019s ironic, and it makes me smile and makes me laugh.</p> <p>I just want everyone to understand that your opinion does not matter. Right now we\u2019re finishing up our first issue of the new \u201cDot Com Secrets\u201d lab\u2019s newsletter, which has been all about the split test we ran. In ninety percent of the split tests we ran, I assumed that the other version would win, and I was wrong. Our opinions do not matter. The only thing that matters in the marketing world is what works, and this obviously is working. Today we should pass 200,000 people in Rippln, and again, we are eight days into this thing, so I\u2019d like to see TechCrunch or any of the other companies featured in TechCrunch do something that\u2019s even close to that with their startup videos. Yeah, it\u2019s not going to happen.</p> <p>So if you want an example of good copy and what\u2019s working, and you don\u2019t care about your opinion, you just care about what actually works in this world, check out the Rippln NDA video, or just go to TechCrunch and read their article, and tell them your opinion about the fact that, \u201cYour opinion doesn\u2019t matter. The only thing that matters is results, and, holy crap, this is getting results.\u201d</p> <p>So there\u2019s my rant, you guys. Don\u2019t be shy about your marketing. You\u2019re right. They\u2019re wrong. Do whatever works. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to change the world. You don\u2019t change the world by being scared of selling and by hiding behind fancy company names and a bunch of other crap like that. There\u2019s my opinion. I hope you agree with it. If not, I don\u2019t really care, because, again, your opinion doesn\u2019t matter in this situation. The only thing that matters is what works, and this is working like crazy.</p> <p>I appreciate you guys. If you liked this podcast, please tell your friends about it, and also, I\u2019d love if you would leave any feedback on our channel. We\u2019re trying to get some more feedback, because we\u2019re a brand-new podcast, but we\u2019re having fun so far, and we\u2019ll talk soon. Thanks, everybody.</p>", "duration": "08:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/10_-_Your_Opinion_Doesnt_Matter.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1366394400, "title": "Episode #09 \u2013 Donald Trump Needs Some Accountability", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Want an idea for a business reality show that would actually be worth watching?</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hello, everyone. This is Russell Brunson from DotComSecrets.com, and this is the \u201cMarketing from Your Car\u201d podcast. I\u2019m on my way to the office right now, and I wanted to make you guys a podcast. I guess this is a bit of a rant, a little bit.</p> <p>Recently I\u2019ve been watching TIVO\u2019d episodes of my favorite shows [laughs], and I\u2019m sure you guys know how it is. You record them all, and when you actually have the time then you watch one and knock it out. I just watched one of the most recent \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d episodes. My first rant is that I wish they\u2019d get rid of Celebrity Apprentice and go back to the real \u201cApprentice\u201d, because that show was a lot better.</p> <p>But even with that, this is my real frustration with that show. If you guys ever watch it, each week they have two different teams. The teams get different tasks, and what\u2019s interesting is that the way they choose the winners is, basically Donald Trump \u2013 or they\u2019ll get a company, like they had Australian Gold Suntan Lotion on this the last one I was watching. They each get to make a commercial for the company, and then they pick the winner based on whose commercial they like more. As a direct response marketer, that drives me crazy, because it\u2019s not based on what converts more, or what makes you more money, it\u2019s based on one person\u2019s opinion.</p> <p>It makes me laugh, because we\u2019ve been doing a lot of testing lately in our company, and most of the times, the test that I think is going to win, loses. It\u2019s really interesting. In fact, there\u2019s a site called WhichTestWon.com. It\u2019s really a fascinating site. Every day they give out different tests, and they show the \u201cA\u201d and the \u201cB\u201d \u2013 the split tests, and you get to vote on which one you think is going to win. Ninety percent of the time, we pick the wrong one. I\u2019m somebody who\u2019s been in this business for a long time. I\u2019ve had my head in this more than most people, and we still don\u2019t pick it right. What drives me crazy is that they base those tasks not on performance or on anything, it\u2019s based on which one we like better.</p> <p>If we were going to make a show that was actually legit and actually was a good show, they should do it like \u201cPitchman\u201d. I don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s ever seen Pitchman before. I believe Billy Mays passed away. That show was awesome. What they would do at the beginning of the show would be to pick five or six different products that they wanted to make infomercials for, and they\u2019d narrow it down to two or three. They would show the process of making an infomercial and filming it and all that kind of stuff.</p> <p>Then what they did, and this is the cool part, is they\u2019d actually take that infomercial, and they\u2019d air it live. They\u2019d air all of them. They\u2019d give them a $20,000 test budget, and they\u2019d test all three of them. Then they\u2019d come back afterwards, and they would show the results. They would call each person. It was cool. They would call each person up on the phone and say, \u201cHey, we ran your show and [pauses] unfortunately the numbers didn\u2019t back it up. It\u2019s not going to be a winner,\u201d or they\u2019d call them up and say, \u201cHey, just so you know, we went three times over on the front end. You\u2019ve got a winner. Congratulations, you\u2019ll be a millionaire within six months,\u201d that kind of thing. It was, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. That\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s something to get motivated by versus, \u201cHey, Gary Busey made a commercial and he didn\u2019t have a hero shot in it, so he lost.\u201d \u2013\u201cSeriously? Who says a hero shot is going to get anything to convert better or make more money at all?\u201d It just fascinates me, and so I just want all of us to be thinking about that.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m addicted to ads. I\u2019m addicted to watching what\u2019s happening on TV and on the radio. It\u2019s fun for me to watch, not because I care about the creative part of it, but because I care about what\u2019s going to work. What can I pull from that and use in my own advertising? We need to become accountable to our ads. If we\u2019re not, and we want to pull them and make a Donald Trump and just throw crap out there, we have no idea what\u2019s actually going to happen.</p> <p>I had a chance to go to a Super Conference, one of Dan Kennedy\u2019s Super Conferences, and they had a guy named \u2013 I think his name was Lenny Liebermann. He\u2019s one of the owners or the founders or partners \u2013 I\u2019m not sure which, in \u2013 what\u2019s that company? They have the skincare stuff for night. That\u2019s funny. I\u2019m going to blank out right now. It\u2019s a billion dollar brand. I can't remember what it is now. Anyway, it's all of this skincare. You can wash your face, and you get rid of acne and zits, and all of that kind of stuff, and I respect that company so much. But what's interesting about that is they are $1 billion brand, and he said, \u201cWe never will run any type of advertising where we can't track the ROI. Believe me, it's been so tempting at times, where in the playoffs they want you to rent the backboard and things like that, or they want you to buy an ad here and there. If we can't track the results, we will not spend money on it,\u201d and that's why they've grown to a billion-dollar brand.</p> <p>They're one of the few brands that I actually respect, because they're doing it the right way. They are not like a lot of the brands out there that you see that have, \"Here're our advertising budgets. We have $4 million for the year. Blow it on whatever you want,\" which is how most of these guys\u2019 budgets work. That's how Burger King, McDonald's, all of those are. There's no accountability whatsoever. It's just, \"Hey, let's spend some money on ads,\" and that's just fascinating to me.</p> <p>I just want us all to realize that as direct response marketers, that's what matters \u2013 what converts better or not. It\u2019s not, \u201cWhat do you like better, or what's prettier, or what does your mom or dad think is cool, or what Donald Trump thinks looks the best?\u201d It's what actually is going to convert better when you put it out there in the marketplace.</p> <p>I think it would be a lot better show if that's how it ran \u2013 where everyone makes their ad. They run it, see who wins, and go from there. In fact, that's a good idea for a reality show. If any of you guys want to do that, that's the game plan \u2013 basically make an infomercial. Do the whole concept of getting two teams and having them each build an infomercial, run some media, and see which one wins. That would actually be a fascinating show. It would be fun to watch, because then you could dissect it. \u2013\u201cWhy did this one win? Why is this one better?\u201d As opposed to, \"Oh, the executives thought this was cooler [laughs].\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, that's my thoughts on it. If anyone wants to make that reality show, let me know. I'll be part of it. It would be awesome. It would be a lot of fun.</p> <p>That's it for today, guys. I'm at the office. I hope you guys enjoyed this, and please leave comments down below. We'd love to hear back if you like the show, or if you have any ideas or topics you want me to discuss on my drive in. We'll talk to you all soon.</p>", "duration": "06:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/09_-_Donald_Trump_Needs_Some_Accountability.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1366308000, "title": "Episode #08 \u2013 The ONLY Secret To Get From $0 To $1,000,000", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On this episode, Russell talks about his 8 hour marathon hangout and\u00a0the ONLY thing you need to get your business to 7 figures a year.</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everybody. This is Russell Brunson from the \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcast at DotComSecrets.com. Right now, I\u2019m actually headed to the gym, because I don\u2019t want to go the gym this afternoon, so I\u2019m going this morning [laughs]. This is actually the \u201cMarketing on Your Way to the Gym\u201d podcast this morning. It\u2019s been a couple of day since I did a podcast, mostly \u2013 oh, I just hit a squirrel. Oh, he survived. Good, he missed me [laughs]. That was close.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been gone. I was out of town, in Dallas, because there\u2019s a new network marketing company launching. I\u2019ve spent the last seven months or so building out all of their sales processes, and scripting their videos, and all of that kind of fun stuff with it. They actually went live on Saturday, so it\u2019s been kind of a whirlwind nightmare and exciting all at the same time. I\u2019m sure that if you were on Facebook or on Twitter that you have been pounded by it, which is probably kind of annoying to some people, but it\u2019s a good thing from my standpoint, because the word is out, it\u2019s growing fast. It\u2019s on the first leg. This is Tuesday morning, so it\u2019s been live basically two and a half days. We\u2019ve had over 35,000 people sign the NDA to find out what it is, and it's been exciting watching it. It's just growing like wildfire. I\u2019ve had messages from people trying to get close to me. My voice is on all of the videos, so it kind of makes me laugh.</p> <p>What was interesting, and what I want to talk about today is that there is a really good book written by Michael Masterson called \u201cReady, Fire, Aim\u201d. In that book he talks about the skill sets and the things that you need for a business going from zero to a million dollars in a year, from a million to ten, from ten to fifty, and from fifty to a hundred. For most of us, we are not going to get past the ten million dollar mark. You might, but for me, I don't even want to. We got to ten million dollars once, and it was kind of a nightmare to manage.</p> <p>But anyway, it was interesting \u2013 the skill set to go from zero to a million dollars \u2013 the whole book is funny. Most people will be focusing on getting the website perfect, getting their office set up, hiring the right staff and all of this stuff. He\u2019s like, \u201cThe only thing that matters, if you want to go from zero to a million dollars, is sales. Sales are the only thing that matters. Getting in there, and cutting your teeth, and just selling, selling, selling, selling.\u201d If you're going to read that book, it brings you back to that, because in all of our businesses, we make money when we sell. Most of us, when we start our businesses, if we\u2019re entrepreneurs, that's how we get our start. It\u2019s us out there selling and doing our best, and then somewhere when we start growing, we get away from that. I know for me, we always come back to that. When everything starts getting going down a little bit, you can come back and sell, and, \u201cBoom,\u201d it brings it back up.</p> <p>Selling obviously is happening in a lot of different formats. You\u2019ve sales letters, webinars, tele-seminars, videos. There are so many fun ways to sell online. Yesterday I did a kind of a fun experiment. Because this whole new company is launching, and we want to get a bunch of market share as quickly as we can to get a lot of people on our team, we decided to do a big huge Google hangout yesterday. We ended up doing Google Hangout for six or seven hours long. I can't remember. I was beat up by the end of it, but basically we got me and four or five other people on it, and we put it out to our list. For six or seven hours, we did this huge long hangout, closing people one at a time on why they should sign the NDA. It was actually really fun. It felt almost like we were on PBS \u2013 one of those telethons, because we'd be on there and get people to text us their information. We'd go and we'd fill out the form, and say, \"congratulations, Mike. You just made it in. Go sign the NDA. Okay, so and so, I just got your text. We're doing you next.\"</p> <p>Everyone was going back and forth, and there was a lot of energy in our office. It was really fun. But it reminded me about getting back to the roots of selling. We put everything else on hold the entire day, and did nothing but have our entire team all selling for the entire day. I look at \u2013 you know most days in the office, I'm working on a project. They're working on their little thing, and things slowly move forward, but the times we make huge jumps is when everybody\u2019s selling. The energy in the room is from when all of that stuff is happening at once.</p> <p>I think that in my company, we're going to do another telethon today, which is going to be fun. I would really set it up at least once a month where you get everyone on your team selling \u2013 something in place where that's the mindset and the culture of everyone \u2013 that selling is the most important thing. It's the lifeblood of our team. Whether it is, if you have an e-mail list, you sending an e-mail out to your list and having people calling in, or something that causes that to happen. You can get everyone on your team doing that. When you do it, it brings your team closer. Everyone understands that the way that they make money and get paid is by selling, and it just changes the culture a little bit.</p> <p>Yesterday was such a neat, magical day. By the end of it, we were all tired and beat up, and we all just wanted to go home and crash, but that experience bonded us altogether, and I think it was really neat. That's what I recommend.</p> <p>Again, first off, I'd go read Michael Masterson's book, \"Ready, Fire, Aim\", and even if you just read the chapters, the beginning two or three chapters, where it talks about going from zero to million dollars a year, that stuff is powerful, and it will get you back into the mindset of selling, selling, selling. Then do that with your team. Do that if it's just you. If you're a one person team, figure out a way you can just sit down and sell all day long, because when you start selling, you\u2019re going to see what works, what doesn't work and it's by far the best way to start growing. If you have an existing business relationship, it will really expand if you just get back into the sales mindset.</p> <p>That's about it for today. I just wanted to mention all of that stuff. That's what's going on in my life and at the top of my mind right now. I'm at my gym now, so I'm going to go. I appreciate you guys. If you enjoyed this podcast at all, please comment on it. I think I need a couple of more comments, and then I can actually get some stars showing on this thing which would be exciting. All right, talk to ya soon guys.</p>", "duration": "06:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/08_-_The_ONLY_Secret_To_Get_From_0_To_1000000.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1365616800, "title": "Episode #07 \u2013 Dealing With The Haters\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t offended someone by noon each day, then you aren\u2019t marketing hard enough\u2026\u201d -Dan Kennedy</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson from DotComSecrets.com, and this is the \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcast. I\u2019m actually heading to the office right now. It\u2019s a little early today, because I\u2019ve got a fun project I\u2019m working on, and I wanted to get started before anyone else showed up.</p> <p>Today I wanted to talk about something that hit me last night. The title of this podcast would be what we call \u201cDealing with the Haters.\u201d If you guys watch \u201cThe Office,\u201d which is wrapping up its last season, this week they had an episode where, they\u2019ve been filming The Office for the last ten years as a being kind of like a reality show, and they released the trailer of that reality show on YouTube.</p> <p>It was funny, because after they released it, all of these comments started coming in. One of the people mentions Andy Bernard and says, \u201cAndy, are you the guy playing the banjo at minute 6:31? That guy is awesome.\u201d He gets all excited and starts commenting back to people, and then when he does, someone comes back and says, \u201cNo, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s not cool. He\u2019s stupid. We hate him,\u201d and Andy takes this so personally. He\u2019s like, \u201cArg!\u201d and he starts responding back, and then the guy\u2019s responding back to him, and there\u2019s a big huge fight that\u2019s going back and forth. Andy makes all of these personal response videos, and the people that hate him are going back and forth with him. It\u2019s just the funniest thing how he deals with all of the people that hate him [laughs] and how it affected him so much.</p> <p>I know what he\u2019s talking about, because I had something like that happen last night, at the end of my day, and it just kind of put me in the wrong mood for a while. Now it actually got me into an even better mood today, because I had someone that sent me \u2013 and I get stuff like that. Anyone who\u2019s out there, you\u2019re going to get hate mail every once in a while, and I got some yesterday. Usually I don\u2019t see that kind of stuff, but somehow they got to my personal e-mail inbox and so it really frustrated me.</p> <p>Anyway, it was interesting because stuff like that used to really, really be hard for me. In fact, I used to do all of my own customer support, and there was a time when I was ready to just quit because I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m out here serving, and doing my best, and trying to help people as much as I can, and people are sending me hate mail. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>I remember I had a mentor named Dan Kennedy, and I heard him say something once that really helped me a lot, so I\u2019m putting this out here for you guys. If you\u2019re in the limelight at all with your business, you\u2019re going to get some of this. Dan Kennedy said that if you haven\u2019t offended somebody by noon every day, then you\u2019re not marketing hard enough. When he said that, it really gave me permission to blow those people off, and I want to give you guys that same permission.</p> <p>When I was working with Tony Robbins, one thing he said to me was really interesting He said that there\u2019s two ways to build the tallest building in town. The first way is to go out there and put a lot of sweat and effort and all of this stuff into something, and build the tallest building in town. The second way is to go around to everybody else\u2019s buildings and knock them down, and that way you\u2019re the tallest one.</p> <p>That\u2019s really the way that people are. Most people do not want to go out there and work their butts off to build the tallest building. They want to go and tear everybody else\u2019s down because it makes them feel bigger, and that\u2019s kind of how I felt with this thing yesterday. It was funny. They guy sent a nasty e-mail, \u201cF-bomb this,\u201d and what a horrible scumbag I am and all sorts of stuff. At first I couldn\u2019t figure it out, like, \u201cWho in the world is this guy?\u201d I couldn\u2019t figure out what he was talking about. Finally I realized that he was commenting on a promotion we did.</p> <p>For those who are on some of our lists, we did this really cool local marketing webinar series where we had seven of the top local marketing experts in the world come on and basically show you exactly what they did in their business, and reveal the behind the scenes and show everything. They did each one of them like a two- or a three-hour webinar, so in all we had twenty hours of webinars. People could get on the webinars for free when they were live, and then at the end of the webinar, some of the speakers sold stuff, which is obviously how we monetized it.</p> <p>What we did is we offered replays. \u2013\u201cWe\u2019re not showing anybody the replays, so if you want the replay, you\u2019ve got to pay for it. It\u2019s $97. You get the replay of all seven events, then you can go back and you can rewind it, you can listen to it, and learn all kinds of stuff. Plus as an extra bonus, I\u2019m going to transcribe all seven of these events, so if you\u2019re the kind of person that likes to read along, you can have the transcripts with it.\u201d</p> <p>I thought it was a good offer. I think for someone like me, I\u2019d be like, \u201cMan, if I can hear twenty hours of people doing the business that I want to be doing or the business that I am doing \u2013 seven people, some of the best in the world, and then I can actually have replays. I can watch it over and over and over again, and I can read the transcripts. That\u2019s valuable to me.\u201d</p> <p>And so we priced it at $97, which I thought was a steal, and that\u2019s what this guy was so upset about, saying basically, \u201cHow in the world dare you sell something digital for $97 where people can just... It\u2019s something that\u2019s just streaming off of your website. You shouldn\u2019t be doing that,\u201d and on and on and on and on. I was just shocked, and again, it really offended me at first. Then last night and this morning as I was getting ready, I was like, \u201cYou know what? He\u2019s coming in and trying to knock down the tallest building in town. Why doesn\u2019t he go out and provide his own value? Why doesn\u2019t he go out and do something, as opposed to coming in here and just yelling at me and other people?\u201d</p> <p>It made me feel a little bit better, so I wanted to give you guys permission, right now, that if you get hate mail, if you get people that are upset or frustrated, don\u2019t pull an Andy Bernard. Don\u2019t go and complain and fight back and comment back on YouTube videos and stuff like that. Just ignore it, and then give yourself permission, like I said, from Dan Kennedy, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t offended somebody by noon each day, you\u2019re not marketing hard enough.\u201d Let me give you that permission to go out there and do what you need to do. Just stop focusing on the people that don\u2019t like you, and focus on the people that you\u2019re serving. Focus on people whose lives are changing because of the good, the value, and the things you\u2019re putting out there in the world.</p> <p>We had over 10,000 people register for that webinar series. We\u2019ve got hundreds of people sending e-mails and thanking us and success stories and all sorts of stuff coming in from it, and then there\u2019s one dude who\u2019s upset because we\u2019re selling the replays. Don\u2019t focus on the one dude that\u2019s going to make you upset. Be grateful that you upset him, because that means you\u2019re working hard. Focus on the people who love you. Focus on providing value to them.</p> <p>I hope that helps you guys, and that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m at the office. I\u2019ve got a fun day ahead of me today, so I\u2019m excited. I hope you guys do, as well. If not, find a new job. Find a new line of work. Do something that you\u2019re so passionate about. Right now, at 6:25 in the morning \u2013 I woke up early today, because I\u2019m so excited to come in and start working on this project. Find something you\u2019re that passionate about, and if you\u2019re not yet, just go out there and seek it. You don\u2019t have to do whatever you\u2019re doing right now.</p> <p>I have a close friend of mine who I love and care about a lot. He told me flat out, \u201cThis is what I wish I could do with my life,\u201d and I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do that?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t because this.\u201d He always had an excuse for why he couldn\u2019t do it. He said, \u201cI used to envy you, Russell, because you go out there, and you just do whatever you want to do.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do it? It\u2019s just a choice. You just have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Figure out what you want to do. I ask myself probably once a month, \u201cWhat do I want to be when I grow up?\u201d and then I go and I work towards that. That\u2019s a good thing to do \u2013\u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d If you\u2019re not passionate and in love with whatever it is that you\u2019re doing, figure out what you want to be when you grow up, and go and do it. Just quit everything else and focus on that. Well, don\u2019t quit everything else \u2013 obviously you\u2019ve got to pay the bills. If you\u2019re doing something, you know you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do, but work your face off to get towards whatever it is you want to be doing when you grow up, because this life is way too short to not do that.</p> <p>Anyway, I appreciate you guys. If you liked this podcast at all, please comment on it. We\u2019re six or seven episodes into this thing. , I think, and trying to get iTunes to give us some love. They ranked us on the first page. This is really cool. I was on iTunes the other day, and I was scrolling through the home page, and our podcast was in there, so congratulations, you guys, the listeners. We\u2019ve got people listening, which is exciting. I just need you to go and review it so that we can get some stars in there and people on iTunes can find us. I appreciate you guys, and I will talk to you all tomorrow.</p>", "duration": "08:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/07_-_Dealing_With_The_Haters....mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1365530400, "title": "Episode #06 \u2013 The Power Of Secrets", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell talks about how fast a new idea went viral when it was locked behind NDA\u2019s\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, this is Russell Brunson with the \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcast from DotComSecrets.com. I am actually driving home from work today. I\u2019ve had a really fun experience, and I want to share, because I think there\u2019s some value in it for everybody.</p> <p>This is what I want to talk about \u2013the power of secrets [laughs]. Our company name is \u201cDot Com Secrets\u201d, and I remember at one of my events that I did, I was telling someone, \u201cFind some secrets, and that\u2019s what you should be selling.\u201d Someone told me, \u201cWe hate the word \u2018secrets\u2019. We want to change it to \u2018strategies\u2019.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou can do that, but secrets works.\u201d</p> <p>So here\u2019s some more proof that the whole secretive concept is awesome. I do webinars, and we\u2019ll promote them to our list of half a million people. From that, I might get five thousand people to register for a webinar, which is great. We make a lot of money with 5,000 people on a webinar. Last night, or actually it was two nights ago, we did a webinar, and this one I didn\u2019t promote. I personally texted a couple of people, and I said, \u201cHey, this is this thing I\u2019m doing. We\u2019re rolling out this new app. It\u2019s going to be really cool, and you may want to be part of it. I\u2019m doing a secret webinar. If you want to come to it, show up.\u201d That was my text, and there was a link to register for the webinar. I only sent it out to maybe twenty people. I had two of my friends send it out. Between all three of us, we maybe sent it out to fifty people \u2013 maybe, but probably not even that many, and we specifically said, \u201cDo not tell anybody else about this. This is just for you.\u201d</p> <p>That night, we had over a hundred people register for the webinar, and about eighty-five of them showed up. Almost everyone showed up, and it was interesting because I was like, \u201cMan, I specifically told you not to invite anybody, but you invited five people.\u201d Each of them did, and it was interesting. We\u2019re doing another one tonight, and it\u2019s been amazing to watch how fast something grows when they\u2019re not supposed to tell anybody about it. And it\u2019s funny.</p> <p>There\u2019s this new network marketing company rolling out, and they hired me to come and do the sales process and the scripts and stuff. It\u2019s kind of fun. I\u2019ve never been on the inside of a network marketing company to see how something like that rolls out, and how the whole process works, but they are some of the best at using this concept. They\u2019re rolling it out in about two weeks from now, and they\u2019ve been telling people, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about it. Don\u2019t tell anyone about that,\u201d and so specifically nobody\u2019s been able to tell anyone. To learn anything about it, you have to sign an NDA to find out about it.</p> <p>They\u2019re doing this event in a week from now. Nobody knows what it is still, but they have to pay to come to this event, and they\u2019ve got twenty-five hundred paid people coming to this event without knowing what it is. All they know is they can\u2019t tell anybody, so it\u2019s this interesting...I almost just hit a squirrel. You guys who are listening in live while I\u2019m driving, I barely just missed a squirrel [laughs]. Anyway, it\u2019s interesting the power behind that.</p> <p>I saw one guy do this with a webinar. It was Trey Smith, in the app industry. He does the same thing. \u2013\u201cI\u2019m doing this webinar. It\u2019s so secretive. If you want to know what it is, you\u2019ve got to sign an NDA.\u201d I don\u2019t know his numbers, but I\u2019m sure his turnout rate was amazing and the sales rates were amazing.</p> <p>Figure out how you can use that in your business. Figure out if you want to do an event for whatever it is you\u2019re doing \u2013 a new rollout of a new product, or a new project, or a new whatever. I promise you, if you tell people that it\u2019s a secret and that they can\u2019t tell anyone else, magically the word of mouth will start working, whereas if you ask somebody, and you bribe someone and you say, \u201cHey, I\u2019ll pay you twenty bucks to tell your friends,\u201d a lot of times the referral marketing stops there. They don\u2019t tell their friends, but you tell them not to tell anybody and it\u2019s amazing what happens, so that\u2019s kind of an interesting concept.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure you guys can use that in a lot of different spots in your business. I\u2019m seeing the power of it right now, and it\u2019s fantastic and really exciting. In fact, with the rollout of this network marketing company, their goal is to get a hundred thousand people on NDAs before it ever goes live \u2013 a hundred thousand people to sign an NDA to find out about something that they can\u2019t tell anyone else about. That\u2019s the interesting. It\u2019s a powerful strategy, so I hope you guys can use that. I\u2019m going to be using it, and you will see it coming from me in my marketing in the very near future.</p> <p>Thanks, everybody. Oh yeah, and to end with, I learned from somebody who actually does podcasts a lot that you should always tell people on your podcast to go and to rate your show, so if you\u2019ve like anything you\u2019ve learned so far, please go back to iTunes and rate it. I would appreciate it. This is still a kind of a new project for me, but I\u2019ve noticed we\u2019re in the top, I think, eighty-sixth new and hot podcasts, so we\u2019re rising in the ranks, you guys, so if you\u2019ve enjoyed this at all, or enjoyed any of them, please go and leave some feedback. It would be much appreciated, and I\u2019ll talk to you guys again tomorrow. All right, \u2018bye.</p>", "duration": "05:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/06_-_The_Power_Of_Secrets.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1365098400, "title": "Episode #05 \u2013 Who Should You Be Really Selling To?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>During this podcast you\u2019ll learn the difference between a $100 a month client and a $50,000 a month client (and the funny thing is the work for both is the SAME!)</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson again with the \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcast from DotComSecrets.com. Normally I do these podcasts when I\u2019m driving to work in the morning, but I didn't this morning. Right now, I\u2019m just out driving around actually. I had a cool experience happen today that I wanted to share, because I thought it would be a good lesson for everyone.</p> <p>I had a chance to go to lunch today with a guy here locally in Boise who does local marketing on a really big scale. He\u2019s a really neat guy. It\u2019s funny, because he\u2019s been in Boise for two years, and I've never even bumped into him or met him. It\u2019s always unique and fun when you meet someone who\u2019s in the same business as what we\u2019re doing. I met with him, had lunch with him, and I had a great time.</p> <p>I had one take-away at the very end of the conversation that really just jumped out to me. He said, \u201cRussell, there\u2019s no money in local marketing, going to businesses that are B2C. That\u2019s what most people are focusing on. If they\u2019re a local consultant, they\u2019re going after chiropractors, dentists, and things like that. I focus, one hundred percent, on B2B companies. With those kinds of clients, what\u2019s interesting is that basically \u2013 let\u2019s say you have a client, and they sell a widget. Maybe for that widget they've got, they've got five or six customers total, but those five or six customers make them $5 million a year. I come in, and I start to work with those kinds of clients. I just have to get them one new client, and when I do, that\u2019s worth a million dollars to them, and so for that, I take a percentage, so maybe $100,000 a year.\u201d</p> <p>He had one client. \u2013\u201cI have all year to focus on just getting them one client. In that kind of business, you don\u2019t have to worry about SEO, PPC, social media, any of that kind of stuff. All you focus on is getting them another client through whatever means necessary,\u201d and I thought, \u201cMan, that\u2019s interesting. Everyone\u2019s going after these smaller businesses, and obviously people are making money with it, but that\u2019s the hustle \u2013 going after smaller businesses, where this guy is doing the exact same business. He\u2019s just focusing on a different market, and he\u2019s got a lot less clients and making a lot more money.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, just kind of a big \u201caha\u201d for me, and it made me think about how in my own business, I\u2019m always sharing stuff with small businesses. That\u2019s been my passion \u2013 helping small businesses grow. Then I look at someone like Gary Vaynerchuk, who\u2019s a mentor of mine, and a really neat guy. Gary teaches very similar stuff to what I do. I don\u2019t think he teaches it as well, and I don\u2019t think he executes it as well, to be honest. But one thing that Gary does is he focuses on bigger clients. His average client, I think, pays thirty to fifty thousand dollars a month, where my average clients \u2013 our high-end clients are like ten grand a month. It\u2019s just interesting. He\u2019s doing the exact same thing I\u2019m doing. He\u2019s probably not working as hard as I am, but he\u2019s going after a bigger market and a bigger client, and I just thought it was really interesting.</p> <p>For all of you guys out there, including myself, this was a wake-up call for me today. Just look at who you\u2019re targeting. Who are the customers that you\u2019re going after? Just by shifting who you go after \u2013 who else? Just think about this right now. Who else would your product or service help? Think about that. What if you targeted them, instead of just the people you\u2019re currently targeting? Like Gary Vaynerchuk, go and land one client. \u2013\u201cBoom.\u201d You\u2019re making fifty grand a month. This guy I had lunch with today, his name\u2019s Diego. Go out like him, and, \u201cBoom.\u201d Get a client, and get $100,000 contract to get one new client.</p> <p>We\u2019re all doing the same amount of work anyway. We might as well get paid what we deserve, and so target bigger customers, whatever business you are in. A lot of you guys are selling different things, but just think about that. Right now, if you\u2019re not going after the customer you keep focusing on, who would that new customer be? Hopefully that will be some food for thought for all of you guys. I know it was for me today. It gave me a big wake-up call and got me excited to start looking at my business and start re-picking my target market. It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.</p> <p>I hope you guys liked this, and I will talk to you guys again probably tomorrow morning. Have a great night.</p>", "duration": "04:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/05_-_Who_Should_You_Be_Really_Selling_To.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1364839200, "title": "Episode #04 \u2013 The Waterslide In The Desert\u2026", "author": "", "summary": "<p>You\u2019ve heard the #1 reason you succeed or fail in real estate is \u201cLocation, Location, Location,\u201d but what is the #1 reason when you\u2019re online\u2026?</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Russell Brunson again, from the DotComSecrets.com \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcast. For me, the weekend just ended. I hope everyone had a great weekend. I\u2019m rebounding from winter today, and I\u2019m actually wearing shorts to work, so I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>I want to talk about something that\u2019s on my mind a lot. We had Easter break this weekend, so my family and I went down to where my wife\u2019s parents live. It\u2019s interesting. We live in Boise, Idaho, which isn\u2019t a huge town, but it\u2019s a good-sized town. We drove down two and a half hours to a city called Burley, which is where my wife\u2019s family is from. It\u2019s a lot smaller town, and from there we drove out to a smaller city called Alpine, which has about five hundred people. From there we drove out to this city called Almo, which I think has about eight people in the whole city, and that\u2019s not really exaggerating all that much \u2013 literally eight people.</p> <p>I had some interesting thoughts along the way. First off, we were driving down to Burley, and on the side of the freeway, there\u2019s this hill. I\u2019ve seen this every time we drive by it, and I\u2019ve always wondered what it is. It\u2019s this huge hill, strangely huge, and it looks like something that just popped up out in the middle of nowhere. They have these two huge waterslides coming off of one side, and a zip line that comes off the other side. It\u2019s on the side of the freeway, out in the middle of nowhere. There\u2019s no city within fifteen miles of there \u2013 it\u2019s just this random, weird thing. I keep thinking, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I always want to stop and go water-sliding down it, but you\u2019ve never see anyone there. It\u2019s just this random thing.</p> <p>That was the first thing we saw, and then we went out to Almo, which again, is this little podunk city, literally, with a population of eight or nine. We\u2019re driving out there, and all of the sudden, there\u2019s this huge hotel. That\u2019s where we stayed. We called every night for an entire week before someone answered the phone. We were driving down there, literally, and someone finally answered the phone, and they go, \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019ve got tons of rooms. Come stay.\u201d We go and stay at this place. We\u2019re the only people staying there. There\u2019s nobody else. It\u2019s just interesting.</p> <p>My brother-in-law was down there with us. We were hanging out with him. His family owns one of the local banks, and he told me that both of those projects \u2013 the big huge hill on the side of the road \u2013 that the people had come in and tried to finance with them. They turned them down, because they said, \u201cLook, nobody is going to go to a random water slide on the side of the freeway where there\u2019re no exits close by [laughs]. There\u2019s no city.\u201d They turned the guy down. The guy was all excited. He was so passionate. He knew it would be huge, so he went and borrowed money from his friends and family, built this huge waterslide thing, and apparently it went bankrupt because nobody could even get to it. Literally, there\u2019s not an exit close by. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d even get to it.</p> <p>The other one was this little hotel in the middle of the desert that the bank actually did finance. There\u2019re probably twenty rooms or so. There\u2019re more rooms in this hotel than there are people in the city, and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a tourist spot close. It got me really thinking about how so many times, we get passionate about an idea, and we think it\u2019s the greatest thing in the world, so we go and we dump all of this money and time and effort into something when there\u2019s nobody around. In the real estate days, they used to always say that the most important thing about real estate is \u201clocation, location, location.\u201d I remember hearing that from my dad when I was a kid. Now obviously for this, these guys built a waterslide hill on the side of the freeway \u2013 horrible location. Nobody shows up. Bankrupt. These other guys found this little city with a population of eight and decided it would be a great spot for a hotel. The spent probably a million bucks building this hotel, and guess what? Nobody shows up. Location, location, location.</p> <p>So how does that relate to you guys? When we used to do our big high-end seminars \u2013 some of you guys probably came to them. We used to do seminars where we would charge between five and ten thousand dollars for people to come to our office in Boise. We\u2019d spend three days working on their business, and I\u2019d say half of the time, if not more, people would come to these businesses, that they weren\u2019t businesses \u2013 there was no market. One guy I remember vividly. I felt bad for the guy. He spent ten grand to come. I tried to talk him out of it, but he kept telling me, \u201cI want to create a product to sell to Boy Scout leaders, because there\u2019re X amount of Boy Scout leaders across America, blah, blah, blah. Nobody else is tapping into this market,\u201d and I said, \u201cThe reason no one taps into it is because there\u2019s not a market there. Boy Scout leaders usually aren\u2019t really getting paid for that. They\u2019re volunteers. They\u2019re not going to spend their own hard-earned money to go and buy more stuff to learn how to become a better Scout Master, unfortunately. I wish they would, but they just don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t really go hand-in-hand.\u201d</p> <p>The way I look at this is, in the real estate world, its location, location, location. In our world, it\u2019s, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a hot market ahead of time.\u201d I luckily learned this lesson early on when I bought a product from Frank Kern and Ed Dale called \u201cThe Underachiever Method\u201d. In fact, two years ago I bought that whole company, and I bought that brand from them because I was so passionate about it. I still am. We\u2019re going to be publishing it as a book and a bunch of other really cool stuff here in the near future.</p> <p>One of the core things they taught in The Underachievers Method was that there\u2019re basically three steps. Step number one is to find a hot market. Step number two is to ask them what they want. Step number three is to give it to them. So many of us go around and do it backwards, where we will have an idea for a product. We go and create the product. We spend time and energy and money and effort creating the product, and then we go and try to sell it, and ninety percent of the time, there\u2019s no market there.</p> <p>In my business, we\u2019ve been really trying to reverse engineer it, and go the other way. Find the hot market first, find out what they want, and then create it. That\u2019s how we found our diabetic supplement. We went out there \u2013 and I don\u2019t know anything about diabetes. In fact, ours is a niche within diabetes. It\u2019s neuropathy. I don\u2019t know anything about neuropathy, but we were able to find out that there\u2019s a market there. People are buying stuff, and so we went, and we found out what they wanted. They wanted a natural supplement, and so, \u201cBoom,\u201d we created it.</p> <p>We did it the correct way. Find a hot market. Ask them what they want, and then give it to them, as opposed to what most of us do, which is have a product idea, create it, and then go try and shove it down people\u2019s throats. For people that are doing that, you\u2019re just like that dude on the side of the road with the huge waterslide, and nobody\u2019s around. It\u2019s important to sell stuff you\u2019re passionate about, but that\u2019s not the first step. The first step is to find that market. Find the group of rabid, hungry buyers first, and after you\u2019ve found it, then, again, it\u2019s not like you go and create something. Find out what they want. Ask them questions.</p> <p>If you find that existing traffic stream, you can put up what we used to call fly catcher pages. We\u2019d put up a little page, and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s your number one question about this topic? What\u2019s the most important thing? What\u2019s the number one thing you\u2019re trying to do? The number one struggle with your diabetes?\u201d or whatever it might be. You ask people that, and they let you know, and then you create the product. Just like in real estate, it\u2019s location, location, location. In Internet marketing world, it\u2019s find a hot market \u2013 the market, the market, the market.</p> <p>So I just want to encourage you guys that wherever you are in your path right now, if you haven\u2019t started yet, make sure that you\u2019re doing it the right way. Find the hot market first. If you already have a business, and you\u2019re trying to grow it, go out there and start looking for those markets. Go and find the place that there\u2019re already people at and set up shop there.</p> <p>Another thing \u2013 we were in Albion, and these guys were building this beautiful bed and breakfast, out in Albion, Idaho, population, again, three hundred or something like that. I was like, \u201cWhy? You\u2019ve got to spend the same amount of money building a bed and breakfast in Albion as you would in Boise. Why wouldn\u2019t you build in Boise where people are actually at, and people are visiting and traveling to?\u201d I think the only visitors to Albion each year are my wife and I, because we have family there, but most people aren\u2019t going to Albion. It\u2019s going to be very difficult to keep that bed and breakfast busy all year round, but for whatever reason, people fall so in love with the idea, they fall in love with the location, that they do crazy things that just don\u2019t make sense logically from a business standpoint.</p> <p>For you, I want you guys to be thinking logically. I don\u2019t want you to fall in love with a product. You can fall in love with a market, because you know that there\u2019s so much traffic, there\u2019s so much business, and so many people there, and if you do that, then you\u2019re going to be fine, but if you go about it the other way around, and you spend all of your effort building the most perfect product in the world and hope that there\u2019s a market later, you\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed when you find out that you\u2019ve spend a lot of time and a lot of energy.</p> <p>That is my rant for today. I\u2019m now at my office. I\u2019m planning to have a really exciting day today, so I hope you guys enjoyed this and I hope that you got some value out of it, and we will talk to you guys all soon.</p>", "duration": "09:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/04_-_The_Waterslide_In_The_Desert....mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1364580000, "title": "Episode #03 \u2013 Killing \u201cActive\u201d Communication So You Can Get Stuff Done", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Do you struggle to get stuff done each day? \u00a0Russell talks about how to shut off active communication, switch to passive communication and how it can make you 200 \u2013 300% more productive every day!</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey everyone. This is Russell, and I am actually going in tonight to the office. It is almost nine o\u2019clock at night, but I\u2019m working a late night tonight, because sometimes that\u2019s what you've got to do. I\u2019m going out of town tomorrow with my family and so I\u2019m heading out to a late night session at the office to get some stuff done so I can take a couple of days off and goof off with family</p> <p>I've been thinking about something a lot today, and I've been ranting with some of the guys who work for me about it. I just wanted to get everyone\u2019s perspective on this and put it out there. When I first got into this business, one of my early mentors was Dan Kennedy, and I went through his time management course [laughs], which is different than most time management courses. If you've ever gone through it, he talks about time vampires and how to distance yourself from customers or anyone who wants to suck your time.</p> <p>For example [laughs], with Dan, if you want to get hold of him, you have to fax his assistant. Once a week his assistant collects all the faxes, puts them in a FedEx box and FedExes it to Dan. When Dan gets it, he then writes his responses on the faxes and then shoves them back in the FedEx box and FedExes them back to his assistant. His assistant actually will respond back to each person who contacted him, so [laughs], if you\u2019re going to ask him a question, it\u2019s a two-week process. It may be annoying on your side trying to get hold of him, but it also makes you, when you ask questions, very, very efficient.</p> <p>That\u2019s my biggest issue with phone calls. I hate phone calls. You can ask anybody [laughs]. I hate answering the phone. The only person I answer the phone for is my wife. On the phone, everyone wants to be like, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d They try to catch up, and twenty minutes into this conversation, they finally get around to what they\u2019re going to ask you.</p> <p>Then e-mail came around, and at first, the way e-mail worked is we just told people what we wanted, they responded back, and it was great. But now e-mail has become so informal that to write an e-mail, I've got to go through this chitchat \u2013 the same stuff I've got to do on a phone call. It takes so much time and energy.</p> <p>Then text messaging came out. I love texting, because I can text people and the response is really quick. There\u2019s a new app I've been using called Vox which is great, because I can Vox somebody and leave a message, and then when they get it, they can respond back to me. If I have time, I can respond back.</p> <p>I really like that type of communication. I hate active communication, where we have to be actively engaged, because it takes me and you having to be stopping everything we\u2019re doing at the same time to connect and have that conversation. It\u2019s so inefficient for me. It drives me crazy. A lot of people ask me, \u201cRussell, how in the world do you run twelve companies. How do you do all this kind of stuff?\u201d The way I do it is because I don\u2019t have inefficient communication.</p> <p>My people on Skype \u2013 I try to train people I work with and it\u2019s very difficult, because they don\u2019t understand. If you\u2019re on Skype and you message me it will be like, \u201cHi.\u201d \u2013\u201cHi.\u201d \u2013\u201cHi.\u201d I will never respond back to a \u201cHi\u201d. If they leave me a question, I will respond back with the answer next time I\u2019m on, but I hate the active communication, because it opens up a door that wastes so much time. It makes you so inefficient. If I\u2019m respond back to someone who skyped me, \u201cHi,\u201d it would become at least a ten minute conversation, talking about the weather and everything else before we got to the point.</p> <p>For me, for time management, for example \u2013 I want you guys thinking about this, too \u2013 how can you shift your communication? To set active communication, where you\u2019re sitting there talking in dialog with somebody, to inactive, where they send you messages and you respond on your time, kind of how e-mail used to be.</p> <p>The tool that I\u2019m using when I do that is Skype, for the most part. I\u2019m still struggling to train some of people whom I work with on that, but that way you message me on Skype. When I am ready to focus on that project, I will find that thing, and I will respond back to them on that topic. Text messaging is still great, because of that. Voxer, if you haven\u2019t downloaded the Voxer app, it\u2019s great. I can leave voice mail. It\u2019s almost like a voice walkie-talkie text message. I text message somebody what I want to tell them, and they walkie-talkie me back when they want to.</p> <p>I encourage you guys to figure out ways to break up active communication and train your partners, your staff, your employees, into the inactive kind. You will get so much more done. I set my day out, so I know, \u201cHey, today from this time to this time, I\u2019m working on this business, or this project, or this, whatever it is,\u201d and I only look at e-mails and correspondence and things related to that. I shut off everything else. I\u2019m not perfect at it. I\u2019m still getting better at it [laughs], but I get so much more done when I do that. It\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>I promise you guys that if you will cut out active communication, cut out phone calls \u2013 you don\u2019t call people. Don\u2019t do meetings. Meetings are the worst thing in the world. Do not do them, especially the \u201cGot a minute?\u201d meetings. If you've got a staff, then you know what \u201cgot a minute\u201d meetings are. They always end up being eighteen hours long.</p> <p>Figure out ways to break up the active communication and turn things into passive communication, where you communicate back if and when you want to. And notice I said, \u201cIf.\u201d That\u2019s a big thing. You do not have to respond back to everyone. I would say probably ninety-nine percent of my e-mails go un-responded. I\u2019d say probably fifty percent of my Skypes go un-responded. Just because somebody messages me, doesn't mean I have to respond back to them. I want to give you guys that permission as well, to understand that you don\u2019t have to respond back to everybody. Just respond back to the people that you need to communicate with for the project that you are trying to move forward at that time.</p> <p>If you do that, you will get so much more efficient. If you will train your partners, and train your staff, and train your employees to do that, you will become so much more efficient. I've got three partners right now that I\u2019m trying to train on that. They\u2019re like the talkers who want to just get on the phone and hang out and network and talk, and I\u2019m the opposite of that. We have this thing where they will call me, and then I will text them back. But that\u2019s the way you've got to be. You've got to be so protective of your time, because people will dominate your time. They will devour it, and they don\u2019t care. If you don\u2019t care about it, people will run you over and so that\u2019s my message today, for tonight.</p> <p>Again, I\u2019m going in at nine o\u2019clock, probably planning about three hours of some awesome stuff, and then I\u2019m going to go and take a couple of days off and party with my family, and it\u2019s going to be awesome. I hope you enjoyed this. Again, if you like these podcasts, please leave your feedback. This is brand new. I've never done one of these before, and I would love to hear some feedback, hopefully positives. If they\u2019re negatives, please don\u2019t leave comments [laughs], but if they\u2019re positive, I\u2019d love to hear your comments. In the iTunes place would be really cool and also at our DotComSecrets.com, for more information about us and how we can help your business. Again, you guys, just take care of your time. It\u2019s your only precious commodity that you have. Protect it. Don\u2019t let people suck it. Don\u2019t let people be time vampires and suck it up. Be very protective of it. I hope this helps.

He was going and he was putting up the first podcast, getting it all installed on iTunes, making it all work, and he was like, \u201cHey, do you want to use that intro we had done about four years ago for the \u2018Marketing in Your Car\u2019 podcast?\u201d and I was like, \u201cOh, yeah, I forgot. We hired this dude to make an intro,\u201d so I listened to it. It was super corny, super cheesy, but it sounded like a cool radio show, and so we\u2019re going to use it for a while. Congratulations. You guys get to hear our awesome intro.</p> <p>Right now I\u2019m actually not driving to the office. I\u2019m actually driving to go to wrestling practice right now. One of my buddy\u2019s kids is in town and wanted me to beat up on him a little bit, so I\u2019m driving there, but I just had some ideas I wanted to let you guys have some fun with. It was the thought process I\u2019m going through.</p> <p>Yesterday I talked about the power of things being rare in your business, and so when I was sitting there that day when I got to the office, I was thinking about how I could use that on anything I'm working on right now. We recently launched a new supplement, and if anyone's ever been in the settlement business, I'm learning all of the headaches that come with the inventory management and stuff [laughs] like that.</p> <p>When we first launched, we had no idea if it was going to sell, so we ordered a thousand bottles, and it sold really well. When we went back, we ordered twenty-five hundred bottles, and it sold out, so then we went back and got another thing, but the thing that's annoying is that we have a six-week delay before the next order comes in. If I put in an order today, six weeks later is when we'll get the bottles back in, so it's a huge timing issue.</p> <p>I'm a good entrepreneur. I'm not so good with timing and all of that kind of stuff, so all sorts of headaches has been happening. We decided to test something in the last day or so, and I don't have extensive results yet to show you guys, but so far the numbers look really good.</p> <p>On our phone number, if you'll call in to order, we have a voice message thing that we're doing, and we are also tweaking the copy on the page, which basically just talks about the fact that the supplement is rare right now, which is true because we ordered our last batch of whatever it was, and they're almost gone, so we spoke to that. We talked about that and basically said, \"Hey, this is a trial run. We're making sure that it sells well.\u201d</p> <p>I can't remember exactly how the script went as I'm sitting here in my car, but we did a couple of tweaks with the script, talking about how it was rare. Eventually it will be something that we have full production runs of, and at that point, the price will be X, but right now, because this is a newer thing, we want more case-based success stories. Until we sell out, this is the new price point. So far, in less than a day now of results, that\u2019s going really, really well, so I'm intrigued and excited to watch what's going to happen over the next little while.</p> <p>The other thing I want to talk about today, and hopefully this will give you guys some ideas, but one of my favorite books that I\u2019ve read recently is a book called \"Rework\", by Jason Fried and the team over at 37 Signals. They are the guys that invented Basecamp. They also brought Ruby on Rails, that language about, and anyway, they\u2019re really neat guys, and I had a chance to interview Jason a little while ago.</p> <p>One of the concepts he talked about was selling your byproduct. He talked about a coffee shop which sold coffee, and they made a bunch of money, but they had all of these coffee bags they were just throwing away, and so they started selling the empty coffee bags and started this whole new business just selling that. He was talking about his business, the fact that these books they\u2019re writing are the byproduct of all of this stuff they\u2019re learning.</p> <p>I thought it was kind of interesting. For almost the last five and a half years now, we've been running the publishing and print newsletter \u201cHeadDotComSeekers.com\u201d, and we've had tens of thousands of subscribers from all around the world. Tons of success stories have come from it, but it's just been that everyone in our office wrote an article about what they're doing, and we published it.</p> <p>Recently I came back and said, \"Look that stuffs been good, and people like it, but how do I create a product that's just phenomenal and exciting?\u201d I kept wondering, \u201cWhat are the things that people in our market really want? What are they interested in?\u201d What was kind of cool is that in January, I was at an event. It was Ryan Deiss\u2019s and Perry Belcher\u2019s Traffic and Conversion event. Listening to this thing, and after, one of my friends came over to me. He's from Israel, and he said, \"Hey, why aren't they sharing more of their split test results? That's the main reason why I flew all the way from Israel to here, because I want to see the results from the testing.\u201d</p> <p>I thought, \"Isn't that interesting? That was his main driving point.\u201d In our business, we test stuff all day long. We've got split tests on thousands of awesome, exciting, crazy, different things. I was trying to think of that could be the byproduct of our business, sharing in our split test results. I don't know anyone that's as much of an entrepreneurial ADD as me and has so much happening in all of these different markets. I think right now we're in twelve different markets, I believe, unless you count the Thai company I\u2019m trying to roll out. That would be number thirteen [laughs]. But we're doing stuff in all of these different markets.</p> <p>I think we have the unique perspective that most people don't have, so we share stuff that's happening in our supplement business and in our \u201ckeep running\u201d business, and in our dating and our weight loss, in our Internet marketing, and all of these different businesses, and share the results. So that's what we're now rebranding our whole newsletter around, around testing results, and in about two months from now, we\u2019re re-rolling out our newsletter under that new direction, new angle, and I think it's going to be really cool.</p> <p>Just for you guys to think about in your business \u2013 what are the byproducts? What are the things that you're doing that just by the nature of your doing it, it\u2019s creating something? That could be an information product. It could be creating waste. Whatever it's creating, what other side businesses are there that you can do, that you can spin off of that? I thought it was kind of an interesting topic and something you guys could think about in your businesses as well.</p> <p>That's all I had for today. Again, I don't want to make these long. I want to keep them small. My goal is I\u2019m going to be recording these while I\u2019m driving either to work or like right now [laughs], driving to the wrestling room. Hopefully these things will be something that you guys can plug in to your car while you're driving. You can download them in the morning. I still don't know how podcasts work. I've never really been a part of one before, but download them in the morning, and when you jump into your car, driving to work or when you're driving around during the day, listen to them for ten or fifteen minutes.</p> <p>My goal is that if I can give you one little idea or just get your mind thinking about something different each day, then I feel like I've succeeded and that's what my goal is. I appreciate you guys listening in, and I will try to keep giving you some good ideas. If you want more information about me or our company, please go to DotComSecrets.com. That's where we share most of our Internet marketing. Cool stuff that\u2019s going down. I appreciate you guys, and we will talk to you again soon.</p>", "duration": "07:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/02_-_The_Hidden_Business_Within_Your_Business.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1191617599, "seriesTitle": "Marketing In Your Car", "pubDate": 1364320800, "title": "Episode #01 \u2013 The Power Of \u201cRare\u201d In Your Marketing", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Russell Brunson talking about how the power of \u201crare\u201d is more powerful then scarcity\u2026</p> <p>---Transcript---</p> <p>Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to the DotComSecrets \u201cMarketing in Your Car\u201d podcast. This is episode number one. This kind of makes me laugh, because this is something I\u2019ve been talking about doing for five or six years, ever since I first learned what a podcast was. I have never actually done it, so this is the first podcast.</p> <p>My game plan in this is that basically I have a five minute drive to work every day. I'm just going to dump some marketing ideas and concepts on you on my drive. It's not going to be long or extensive, just about five to six minutes long, and that way, while you guys are driving to work every morning, hopefully you can listen to this as well and get some ideas for your business. That\u2019s the game plan.</p> <p>Today I want to talk about something that was kind of interesting to me. Saturday night, I was working on my computer late, and probably at about two in the morning or so is when my resistance to buying is at its lowest. Of course I decided, \"I'm going to swing by eBay and see if there's anything cool that I can buy,\" which is usually a bad idea. Most days when I do that I end up a thousand dollars poorer, by the time it's all said and done. That night was no different.</p> <p>So I'm in there. I'm searching for stuff. I'm trying to find something to buy. I\u2019m looking for different marketing things and typing all of my favorite guru\u2019s names. Finally I found this product. It's called something like \"Guerrilla versus Gorilla\", like Jay Conrad Livingston\u2019s guerrilla versus a gorilla. There was a whole CD course from Chet Holmes, Jay Conrad Livingston, and Jay Abraham.</p> <p>When I first saw it, I was like, \"Oh, this is cool,\" and then I passed it, but I had it in my watch list. I went back later on that night, and I looked at it. I was looking closer. It was a cassette tape set, but Tape 2 to and Tape 4 were missing. I'm looking at it, and I'm going, \"Oh man, it's missing some tapes, so I'm probably not going to buy it,\u201d but I was like, \u201cI kind of want to buy it now, because this is kind of interesting to me. Let me go and see if I can't find it anywhere else.\u201d</p> <p>I started searching everywhere else, and I kid you not, there is no copy of that product you can buy anywhere online at any site, even at their own site. It's impossible. I searched for another hour trying to find a copy of that product. I couldn't find it anywhere, so finally I came back to eBay. The only copy that\u2019s there is missing 2 tapes, and it\u2019s $200, but I go and I buy it really quickly, for $200, because I want this information. There's no one else in the world that has it apparently. You can't buy it anywhere, and so I bought that.</p> <p>I told my brother. I\u2019m like, \u201cScott, I just bought this thing, but Tapes 2 and 4 are gone. I need that information,\u201d and so he searched for another hour or two trying to find a torrent site that would have them. We couldn't find any torrent sites that had them, but finally there was this Internet marketing torrent site that he was able to find it on, and we were able to download it.</p> <p>I've been listening to it this week, and it's been great a great product. It really got me thinking a lot about the power, not so much of scarcity, but the power of rarity \u2013 of it being rare. I started thinking about how I could use that more in my business. I remember when I first got into this business, and I started learning how to do speaking, I started speaking at every single seminar. The very first seminar I ever spoke at was amazing, because they introduced me as this rare underground guy who never speaks, blah, blah, blah. Because of the fact that I was rare, the response was amazing.</p> <p>After a year of me traveling the speaking circuits and speaking all of the time, I wasn't that rare. Some of that disappears because they can go see you anywhere. After about a year and a half, I quit speaking, and now I only speak maybe once a year. Again, when I speak now, it's kind of that rareness that comes out, and it's different. I started thinking more about my marketing. How can I cause that?</p> <p>One of my mentors and someone I've worked with a lot over the last years is Dan Kennedy, and Dan always talks about positioning yourself as the guru on the top of the mountain. People can see where you are, but they can't get there directly. They have to buy things to get closer and closer to you. With Dan Kennedy obviously, you have their $40 or $50 a month newsletter, and then their $200 a month newsletter, and then their Mastermind Groups. The more money you pay, the closer to the guru you get. I just wanted to kind of throw that out there, not so much to tell you what to do, but just to get the wheels in your head spinning.</p> <p>How can you become more rare, which will increase the demand for you for your time, for whatever it might be? If you're in a consulting business, the rarer you can make your time, the more you can charge. From a publishing standpoint, if you're blogging all of the time...</p> <p>I've been watching recently \u2013 Ryan Deiss has been launching his Authority ROI product. I've been watching his prelaunch and stuff, and it's interesting. He's talking about bringing in a whole bunch of guest bloggers to post on your blog. I think what's interesting about that is that fact that now you can keep consistently updating your blog and having new stuff happening so that there's content, there's excitement, there's stuff still happening, but you can step back yourself and become more of a rare commodity where now you come maybe once a week or once a month and post. At that point everyone's waiting to hear what the guru has got to say. He\u2019s finally coming down from the mountain, and now he's going to grace us with his presence, and talk.</p> <p>I think it's a really interesting strategy, so I just want to throw that out there for today. It's something that's been on my mind a little bit. Again, I'm not sure of the perfect way to execute it yet, but I\u2019m going to start working on it more and more in my business from all sorts of different levels, from a consulting standpoint, when we do consulting work, from a product standpoint, from a blogging standpoint, just, \u201cHow can I make myself more rare?\u201d, because again, it increases the demand and the excitement for you.</p> <p>But how do you do that without becoming irrelevant either? If you're not out there for too long, then you become irrelevant, and so it\u2019s this mix of, \u201cHow do you do it? What\u2019s the perfect formula?\u201d Anyway, something for you guys to think about today.</p> <p>I\u2019m now at the office. I\u2019m going to end this recording, and I hope you enjoyed it. We\u2019re about six minutes and eight seconds long, because that\u2019s about how far away my office is from my house. Now I know. I hope you guys enjoyed this. If this is your first time ever listening, we\u2019re going to try to figure out how to get this thing on iTunes, so please subscribe there, and then also check out our site DotComSecrets.com to learn how to increase your business. I appreciate you guys, and we\u2019ll talk to you again tomorrow.</p>", "duration": "07:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/03/ee/36/03ee36a7-5d4d-50d5-509e-607943ca4768/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/marketinginyourcar/01_-_The_Power_Of_Rare_In_Your_Marketing.mp3?dest-id=455168", "type": "episode", "tags": []}]}
