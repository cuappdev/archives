Half of the time? All of the time? It almost seems like a silly question to ask; why would you say anything less than \u201call of the time?\u201d The whole point of hiring an advisor is to have someone you can trust to help you make the best choices possible with your money.</p> <p>The sad truth is that many financial advisors don\u2019t view this as the primary function of their job.</p> <p>Out of the 310,000 financial advisors in the US, how many do you think are required to act in your best interest? 50%? 25%? The shocking truth is that less than 10% of all financial advisors in the United States follow the fiduciary standard \u2014 which legally requires financial advisors to put your interests ahead of their own.</p> <p>It gets even scarier. Of the 10% of financial advisors who are fiduciaries, many are dually registered \u2014 meaning they can act as both a broker and a fiduciary. Legally, they don\u2019t even need to notify you of their dual status, or whether they\u2019re acting as a fiduciary or a broker at any given time! Talk about trust issues; would you ever go see a doctor who is only required to give you \u201cgood\u201d medical advice during half of your visit? (And she doesn\u2019t have to tell you which half of the visit.)</p> <p>If you can\u2019t trust 90% of financial advisors to act in your best interests, and many of the remaining 10% will only act in your best interests some of the time, then who can you trust?</p> <p>That\u2019s just the question Tony set out to answer when he wrote Unshakeable. Designed as your go-to financial freedom playbook, Unshakeable gives investors the knowledge they need to be truly unshakeable \u2014 unfazed by financial winters, prepared for anything, and wise enough to know who they can trust and who they can\u2019t.</p> <p>Having someone by your side who you can count on to give you the best advice for your money is a key part in planning for the financial future you want. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that you make sure your financial advisor \u2014 even a registered fiduciary \u2014 keeps you on track, and doesn\u2019t prioritize their own needs over yours.</p> <p>Even though the numbers look stacked against you, it\u2019s possible to find a trustworthy financial advisor. There are over 5,000 firms and individuals in the US that will act in your best interest.</p> <p>In this episode of The Unshakeable Podcast, Richard Bradley sits down with Tony and Peter Mallouk to explore the process of finding a financial advisor you can trust and how to identify the ways your financial advisor may be working for personal gain, instead of for you.</p> <p>This episode of the Unshakeable podcast has been b<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rought to you in collaboration with Creative Planning, an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, where Tony Robbins is a board member and Chief of Investor Psychology.

Never? You may have laughed at the absurdity of the question when you first read it \u2014 who would buy anything without knowing how much it costs first?</span></p> <p>It turns out most Americans do. Over 70% of people who invest in 401(k) plans have no idea how much they pay in fees to their plan providers. That means more than half of Americans are paying to invest in a 401(k), without first knowing the price!</p> <p>Why are so many Americans unaware of the fees they pay? Why don\u2019t more people ask to review the fees, before agreeing to a plan? Sadly, most people wouldn\u2019t even know what to ask. For over three decades, the companies offering these 401(k) plans weren\u2019t required to provide any information to you about how much they charge you in fees. Even now, when they are legally required to do so, 401(k) providers use convoluted documents to hide their fees in plain sight. How can you ask about the cost of fees for your plan, if you didn\u2019t know there were any fees in the first place?</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Chapter 4 of</span> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unshakeable</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tony Robbins and Peter Mallouk break apart the complicated industry of retirement plans, and the fees they try to hide from you. More than 90 million Americans invest in 401(k) plans. For most of us, it seems like a no-brainer. Your employer takes the contribution straight from your paycheck, which helps you save on your taxes every year \u2014 plus you get to save for retirement. Even if you do pay some fees, it\u2019s not that much money\u2026 right?</span></p> <p>It turns out that paying even 1% more in fees than you need to can dangerously slash your nest egg. Take the example of an average American worker, making $30,000 a year and putting 5% of each paycheck into a 401(k). Over the lifetime of this investment, an extra 1% in fees will result in a loss of almost $154,000 \u2014 and that\u2019s not even including what you would have earned, with compound interest, if that money had been invested in your plan. For each 1% in unnecessary fees, you lose potentially 10 years of retirement income. So much for the \u201cgolden years.\u201d</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making matters worse, most well-meaning business owners are just as unaware of the fees as their employees. They may think they\u2019re providing the best for their employees, but the convoluted nature of the industry makes it just as difficult for them to see the true cost of fees. When it comes to 401(k) plans,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employers and employees are on the same side \u2014 as most business owners are also heavily invested in the company\u2019s 401(k) for their own retirement savings.</span></p> <p>In this episode of the Unshakeable Podcast, Tom Zgainer and Josh Robbins of America\u2019s Best 401k speak with Richard Bradley, Editor-In-Chief of Wealth Magazine, to shatter the misconceptions in the complicated world of 401(k) plans. Advocating for yourself \u2014 and your investments \u2014 may be more important than you realized; it may make the difference between thriving or barely surviving retirement.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal Disclosure: Tony Robbins is a board member and Chief of Investor Psychology at Creative Planning, Inc., an SEC Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) with wealth managers serving all 50 states.
