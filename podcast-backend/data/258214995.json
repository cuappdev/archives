Thank you very, very much!</p> <p>You may have noticed that there has been a dearth of new audiobooks appearing through the website. The last one that was produced for the website was <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, which came out last May. The reason for this lag is that I can no longer afford to produce these \u201cbonus\u201d audiobooks out of my own pocket. You see, every episode of The Classic Tales Podcast is downloaded or streamed over 16,000 times in the course of a month. Yet, I have just over 300 monthly financial subscribers. This is great, and it pays the podcast and website bills and a little more, but it\u2019s far from the funding required to produce a new audiobook every month.</p> <p>Now, I would rather go forward than go back. If we get more supporting members, we can produce more Classic Tales. So I\u2019d like to offer you more incentive to become a monthly supporter of The Classic Tales. Starting in March, there will be a new 4 hour-long portion of a new audiobook that will be available to subscribers only, in addition to The Classic Tales Podcast. This line of additional subscribers-only content will be called the Enchiridion. Every month, subscribers will get an email with a link to approximately 4 hours of additional Classic Tales content. What titles will be available through The Enchiridion? We will start with <em>Alan Quatermain</em>, the sequel to <em>King Solomon\u2019s Mines</em>. From there, we have an entire catalogue of fantastic titles in the queue, including London\u2019s <em>The Sea Wolf</em>, Verne\u2019s <em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em>, Sabatini\u2019s <em>Scaramouche</em> and many, many more.</p> <p>And so now, if you become a monthly supporter, not only do you ensure the future of The Classic Tales Podcast, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but also you get a monthly coupon code AND 4 hours of a new audiobook \u2013 every month.

While she is not the absolute epitome of high classical fiction, (and I\u2019m not completely sure if anyone is), her work holds a distinctive place in the canon of what is typically understood as classic literature. Her characters are sparkling, her prose style is rich and musical, and the plots, though largely character driven, move like gangbusters.</p> <p>And so, while there are many, many wonderful audiobook productions of this work, I wanted to see what I could make of Austen\u2019s remarkable and sumptuous text.

In it, Baum creates a mythological world in which the magical forest of Burzee , created at the beginning of time, is the main source of all other worldly magical power. Ak, the Master Woodsman rules the forests; Kern, the Master Husbandman of the World, rules the food crops; Bo, the Master Mariner of the World, rules the seas. All other immortals are subject to these three. Baum also created Ryls as guardians of the flowers and Knooks as guardians of the animals of the world. He first introduced Ryls and Knooks in his collection of short stories, <em>American Fairy Tales</em>. In <em>The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus</em>, his mythology is more fleshed out, comprising a rich enchanted world, which also includes the more traditional nymphs, guardians of the trees and fairies, guardians of humans.</p> <p>Later, when Baum\u2019s creation of Oz became his main focus, he placed all of his fantastical realms around Oz, yet designated that the forest of Burzee was the source of the magic of Oz itself.</p> <p>And now, <em>The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus,</em> part 1 of 4, by L.

My reasons for saying this? 1) His method of study is unorthodox, and requires an incredible amount of tenacity, even fixation. Most people couldn\u2019t do this. This is what I term the autism super power. 2) His unwillingness to vary his study schedule of the Encyclopedia (He won\u2019t skip a volume). 3) He imagines a fantasy scheme where his problems are all solved, and works diligently to accomplish this impossible task. 4) He is rather socially awkward, bless him.</p> <p>This is no way official, and I can\u2019t back it up with anything other than my own observations, but when I read this story, it struck me how my autistic son has many of these same character traits. He also demonstrates the autism super power, and is a truly amazing boy. I find it encouraging that P.G. Wodehouse saw how characters of this temperament could find happiness and love in a world that largely misunderstands them.</p> <p>And now, <em>The Man With Two Left Feet</em>, by P.G.

He was born to a wealthy family in New York City, and moved to England to complete his education. He was beginning to create a name for himself as a significant writer of supernatural fiction, and was a member of the Aesthetic Movement, a progressive literary circle composed of many literary luminaries among which was one Oscar Wilde.

Ambrosius is experiencing something called cognitive dissonance. Leon Festinger introduced this theory in 1957. He suggested that we have an inner drive to hold all our attitudes and beliefs <em>in harmony</em> and avoid disharmony, or dissonance.</p> <p>For example, when people smoke, and they know that smoking causes cancer and disease. Their behavior (smoking) clashes with their cognition, or what they know to be true (the fact that smoking is harmful to them). The discomfort caused by the cognition, or belief, motivates behavior to be brought into greater harmony with the cognition. (I know this is bad for me- I should stop).</p> <p>When Ambrosius sees how his superiors shamefully mistreat Benedicta in today\u2019s episode, he experiences cognitive dissonance. All of his experiences as a youth and a monk have given him many evidences of the goodness of his high-demand religion. He loves it. But when he sees Benedicta suffer at the hands of his superiors, he is motivated to somehow find mental harmony.</p> <p>Would this conflict occur if young Ambrosius were not in love with Benedicta? Who knows? But his feelings certainly make the dissonance stronger. He\u2019s been trying to reconcile his feelings for her all along, considering them a divine mission, a holy sign and token to protect her, etc.. They have to be anything but <em>romantic love</em>, for that is forbidden, and he is very, very devout. He shouldn\u2019t have these feelings. But he does. It is this process of his quest for harmony that leads him to eventually resolve the cognitive dissonance by going to a very dark place, indeed.</p> <p>And now, <em>The Monk and the Hangman\u2019s Daughter</em>, Part 2 of 3, by Ambrose Bierce</p>", "duration": "53:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/classictales/CT_488_Monk_Hangmans_Daught_Pt2of3.mp3?dest-id=60626", "type": "episode", "tags": ["audio", "monk", "daughter", "ambrose", "bierce", "hangman"]}, {"seriesId": 258214995, "seriesTitle": "The Classic Tales Podcast", "pubDate": 1473393684, "title": "Ep. 487, The Monk and the Hangman's Daughter, Part 1of3, by Ambrose Bierce", "author": "", "summary": "<p>A knot of monks happens upon a gallows in the middle of a dark forest.

We couldn\u2019t do this without you.</p> <p>After our long and exciting summer run of Tarzan, I wanted to do something a bit more subtle and literary before we jump into the horrors of October. Ambrose Bierce is most famous for his story <em>An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</em>. However, many consider <em>The Monk and the Hangman\u2019s Daughter</em> to be his real masterpiece. First published serially in 1891, it has an atmospheric fairy tale feel like many popular stories of the time. The subtle transformation of the monk Ambrosius from innocent monk to violent zealot is where Bierce really shines. When an innocent monk falls in love, his efforts to suppress his natural feelings result in a gradual descent toward calamity.</p> <p>From the introduction to the 1967 edition, copyright by The George Macy Companies, scholar Maurice Valency writes:</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 his spiritual discomfort is enhanced by his heroic efforts to transcend the normal appetites of a young and healthy body. The consequence is a special sort of erotic frenzy, and a series of rationalizations which end in madness. Insofar as such a story is said to have a moral, it is plain: Nature is not to be denied. If we try to shut it out, it presents itself in another guise, and it becomes terrible\u2026. Love comes to the monk Ambrosius with terrible urgency. Because his heart is pure, his passion is transformed into zeal; his jealousy becomes sacred; his revenge a vocation, and in death he finds his priesthood\u2026. [He is]\u2026 the victim of an excess of goodness.\u201d</p> <p>And now, <em>The Monk and the Hangman\u2019s Daughter</em>, Part 1 of 3, by Ambrose Bierce</p>", "duration": "57:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/classictales/CT_487_Monk_Hangmans_Daughter_Pt1of3.mp3?dest-id=60626", "type": "episode", "tags": ["audio", "monk", "daughter", "ambrose", "bierce", "hangman"]}, {"seriesId": 258214995, "seriesTitle": "The Classic Tales Podcast", "pubDate": 1472797800, "title": "Ep. 486, After Twenty Years and Mammon and the Archer, by O.

Nine years ago three little episodes were released to the iTunes Music Store. Today episode 476 is released. Thank you for helping us make it this far.</p> <p>Why do I do this? I have talked about it before. Every week I produce, narrate, edit, mix and release The Classic Tales Podcast because classic audiobooks changed my life. I never would have read books; I never would have become a reader without audiobooks. Discovering them and integrating them into my lifestyle helped shape my personal character. I became more compassionate, more understanding and more patient, because my view of the world expanded through classic audiobooks. I wanted other people to have the same experience.\u00a0</p> <p>And so here we are nine years later. 476 free episodes later. It will be interesting to see where the next nine years take us. Again, thank you for your reviews, your monthly support, and for just listening to the podcast and enjoying it. If you are listening and enjoying these classic stories, that gives all this work relevancy and value \u2013 and that really makes it all worthwhile.</p> <p>And now, The Return of Tarzan, part 4 of 11, by Edgar Rice Burroughs.</p> <p>Help ensure another 9 years of The Classic Tales Podcast by becoming a supporting member at www.thebestaudiobooks.com</p>", "duration": "01:02:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/classictales/CT_476_Return_of_Tarzan_Pt5of11.mp3?dest-id=60626", "type": "episode", "tags": ["podcast", "the", "of", "audio", "apes", "tarzan"]}, {"seriesId": 258214995, "seriesTitle": "The Classic Tales Podcast", "pubDate": 1466145000, "title": "Ep. 475, The Return of Tarzan, Part 4of11, by Edgar Rice Burroughs", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Assassins and ne\u2019er-do-wells discover Tarzan in the vast deserts of Algeria, and his mission becomes more and more complicated.

So The Edgar Allan Poe Collection will remain as it stands, now at a reduced price of only $5.99 at <a href=\"http://www.thebestaudiobooks.com\">www.thebestaudiobooks.com</a>.</p> <p>The good news is that in its place I will be recording the very first Sherlock Holmes novella: A Study in Scarlet in May. See Watson and Holmes meet and solve their first case together. Check your inboxes for an announcement next week!</p> <p>When most people think of Jack London, they usually think of Alaska, the Klondike, and dog sleds. However, he wrote successfully in many genres including science fiction. Today\u2019s story is the first half of a post apocalyptic novella written in 1915.</p> <p>Now, as with most of the stories on the Podcast, today\u2019s tale reflects the prejudices of London\u2019s time in 1915. Not only are its attitudes towards \u201cuncivilized\u201d people offensive, but his outlook toward the poor and unprivileged is also disparaging. So let\u2019s learn from the past and celebrate how far we\u2019ve come.</p> <p>And now, The Scarlet Plague, part 1 of 2, by Jack London.</p>", "duration": "01:16:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/2e/16/99/2e1699aa-ffea-02b3-235e-3d782292ca00/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/classictales/CT_469_ScarletPlague_Part01of2.mp3?dest-id=60626", "type": "episode", "tags": ["audio", "jack", "plague", "london", "scarlet"]}, {"seriesId": 258214995, "seriesTitle": "The Classic Tales Podcast", "pubDate": 1461909600, "title": "Ep. 468, The 200,000 Franc Reward, by Maurice Leblanc", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Innocent flashes of light on a wall lead Arsene Lupin to unravel\na calamitous mystery.

This is a relatively modern film, and I was astounded to see that it was based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe, for I had never read such a story. I went back through my anthologies, and it appears that this story is rather obscure, and was not included in my \u201cComplete Short Stories\u201d collection \u2013 or any other collection on my shelves. After some digging, I did discover the story in question, which is the one you will hear today. I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>It was 175 years ago, on April 20, that \u201cThe Murders in the Rue Morgue\u201d first appeared in print. This story by the great Edgar Allan Poe is largely considered the first detective story. Poe invented and pioneered the detective story. It is also unlikely that you can pick up any collection of gothic horror stories without it containing at least one from Edgar Allan Poe.</p>\n<p>And so, I am creating a second edition of The Edgar Allan Poe Collection. This edition will include all of the 2007 first edition classic stories of horror, science fiction, and mystery including The Gold Bug, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Raven, The Black Cat and others. But it will also include all of the other Poe stories I\u2019ve produced through the years, such as Ligeia, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, Berenice, as well as updated versions of The Cask of Amontillado, The Case of M. Valdemar and The Masque of the Red Death. It will also include several previously unreleased short stories. All in all, it\u2019s a deluxe, curated audio collection, newly mixed and updated.</p>\n<p>And what\u2019s more, you can save $3 and preorder you copy of the Edgar Allan Poe Collection 2016 Second Edition by going to <a href=\"http://www.thebestaudiobooks.com\">www.thebestaudiobooks.com</a>. You\u2019ll receive the audiobook as soon as it is released in early May.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s story, like so many of these classic stories, contains disparaging references to a certain group of people \u2013 this time the mentally ill. It also has some misogynist references that reflect the attitudes of the time. Please remember that the treatment of the mentally ill in Poe\u2019s time was in an absolutely abysmal state, and psychology and the study and treatment of mental illness was still in its infancy. I do not hope to validate these ancient views, but rather I wish to hold up a mirror so that we can mark our progress in the treatment for those that suffer in this way.
