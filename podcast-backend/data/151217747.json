He studies how our visual perception, guided by millions of years of natural selection, authors every aspect of our everyday reality. His research is about uncovering the underlying secrets of human perception. Donald has discovered clues that point to our subjective nature of reality. According to Donald, we actively create everything we see. Donald started to learn how to program at a very early age. This is what got him thinking: Are we just machines, or actual humans?<br /> <br /> Donald began to be bothered by the reality that we might not be seeing what our eyes are seeing. Do we see reality as it really is? Almost all of us have a belief that we see the world as it is. Michael and Donald go in depth about certain illusions and truths that may be hidden from the main public. Illusions are everywhere when you start looking. Evolution shaped us with certain perceptions and interfaces that we, as humans, evolved to keep us alive. Whether or not those perceptions are real or fake is irrelevant. As long as they keep us feeling happy and alive, that is all that matters. Natural selection has also led us to the reality we see. The only thing that matters in natural selection is fitness. Fitness according to natural selection is not based on physical fitness but rather if you are able to reproduce.

Unfortunately, people crave more complex. With trend following, traders keep it simple. They just want to get the direction of the trade right. Trend followers don\u2019t care about what the price will be or how far it will go, they just go back to the basics and see what way the trend is going, up or down.<br /> <br /> The ability to simply follow the math has always been undervalued. Risk management is about the math of selling losers and hanging onto winners. It isn\u2019t hard math to do, but this is what separates successful managers from losing ones. Successful managers build a portfolio, follow the trends and execute trades properly.<br /> <br /> Harry Markowitz said, \u201cIf I would have created CAPM around semi variance no one would have understood the math and I would not have won the Nobel Prize.\u201d Mark breaks this quote from Markowitz apart.

She is a poker player, author, decision making expert, and cognitive scientist. Her understanding of how luck, skill and uncertainty all play a role in life is fascinating.<br /> <br /> Donald Trump has made some unusual cabinet choices, especially for getting elected by such a small margin. Annie breaks down her perspective on why Trump chose the way he did. One of the hardest people to play against is someone playing aggressively across the board, such as Trump. She relates Trump\u2019s aggressive political playing to poker, giving insights as to how Trump opposition might be playing their cards to beat him.<br /> <br /> Annie moves on to decipher luck and skill in decision making and outcomes. Black and white thinking can be harmful. Decisions that don\u2019t go your way are not always the wrong choice. You may have taken the right direction, the cards just didn\u2019t fall in your favor. You need to be able to move on and know that another chance is around the corner. Fixating on decisions that were wrong can easily start to snowball and make things personal. The key is to learn to move on from one hand dealt to another quickly because life won\u2019t pause for anyone. Take the time to reflect later, but don\u2019t get caught up in the moment and dwell on what mistakes you may, or may not have made.<br /> <br /> The world of poker is a male driven sport. Focusing her purpose on winning the game rather than getting people at the table to like her enabled her to get over discrimination and actually use it to her advantage. Not caring about the approval of peers instantly gives the person being discriminated against the upper hand. Once you view something as a challenge rather than adversity you become a stronger person and begin creating a positive narrative for that situation and your life. Shying away from adversity is a way of giving up on yourself and falling victim.

Many crave the life of creativity but choose not to live it. Jennifer explains creative change in a way that newbies and professionals can understand.<br /> <br /> \u201cWhat was the initial aha moment that made you go down this particular path?\u201d People have this \u201clove/hate\u201d relationship with creativity. During a study, Jennifer found that more people relate the word \u201cvomit\u201d to creativity than they relate words like; love, peace, and happiness. This made her wonder, \u201cWhat is it about creativity that makes people feel that way?\u201d<br /> <br /> More and more customers want a creative experience. When people think of a creative experience they think of: something beautiful, not mass marketed, not necessarily fashionable, something that took time and effort to put together, feels authentic and makes them happy. Corporations do think of creativity in the same way, however they end up moving in the opposite direction. They often get sucked into feeling like their product needs to be for everyone, mass marketed, fashionable, etc. so they can sell the product.<br /> <br /> Steve Jobs created \u201ccorporate creativity.\u201d He had a way of connecting with people from how he dressed to connecting through his products. When people engage in a creative effort they feel like their lives are meaningful and are happier. Jobs captured that. Giving people a surprise is one of the top things people attach to creativity, along with beauty. He was able to wrap all these things up in one presentation.<br /> <br /> \u201cWe want more creative change. We know there has to be a disruption and we know we can\u2019t predict the future.

His newest work is \u201cI Am Keats: Escape Your Mind and Free Your Self.\u201d The title of his book spawned from a conversation he had with a friend whose 20-something year old son was still living at home. Tom told his friend \u201cToo bad we can\u2019t wipe his memory clean and start over.\u201d All actions come from your memory so Tom figured if he could wipe the 20 something\u2019s memory clean, he could rewrite his life.

His company is Duct Tape Marketing and he has been around 29 years offering insights. His new book is \u201cSEO For Growth.\u201d John seeks out knowledge for his own personal growth, which then spills over into helping out clients.<br /> <br /> One of the major ways to build your brand is producing new, information rich and constant content. Michael and John talk about Twitter and blogging strategies that help tap into your marketplace so you reach your optimal audience. Creating constant content won\u2019t build you or your brand up very much if nobody reads it.<br /> <br /> Moving on to SEO, John says \u201cPage one results [on Google search] is your new business card.\u201d When you hear a friend talking about someone or if you are looking for products and services, the first thing you do is search their name or brand. Having an active Twitter and LinkedIn account is a good start to getting your name out there. However, if you take it a step further and write an article for a news source in your field it could give you a much larger leg up on your competition. There was a recent study done with 2,200 buyers. 80% of these buyers made their decisions to buy before ever even contacting the company. They are turning to search engines and their social networks. If you do not show up in their initial research, then you do not exist.<br /> <br /> Google\u2019s original objective (when it was founded) and its current objective is for people to get the most relevant results related to their search. Over the years Google has gotten better at refining their objective by creating new code and stopping fraud. John dives into ways to help out your SEO with Google. Essentially it all boils down to creating great content. \u201cBuild it and they will come\u201d rings true more now than ever before.<br /> <br /> What are some of the things people are doing right now that are on the Google \u201cdo not fly list?\u201d The biggest mistake made is paying people to get results by bogus links. It may work for a month or two but after awhile you will probably get blacklisted from Google\u2019s search engine. This is the most obvious of the \u201cdo not do\u2019s\u201d with SEO. Content creation will help the most with SEO, and getting people to stay interested in what you are doing. Ebooks, podcasts, books, articles, etc. all count as content. Responding quickly to client emails or calls is also a great key to gaining strong followers. Expectations have gotten so low on the customer service front that something as simple as returning an email in a timely fashion may be the differentiating point between you and the competitor.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Benefits of podcasting</li> <li>Evolution of podcasting and blogging</li> <li>SEO</li> <li>Behind the scene of the Google algorithm</li> <li>Seven stages to your hourglass</li> <li>Critics and criticism</li> <li>Voice activated searching</li> </ul>", "duration": "51:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/521.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1484535600, "title": "Ep. 520: Take the Lid Off with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael starts the podcast quoting from a recent blog post of Seth Godin\u2019s called \u201cThe Candy Diet.\u201d Most people want a Guru or someone to spoon feed them something, anything. They want to be told what will happen in the future. They are on the \u201ccandy diet\u201d that Seth Godin speaks to. People want to be baited with quick and easy. Michael reads from the obituary of the late Jay Forrester next. Forrester made the point in one of his classes that not a single one of his engineering students had ever taken the back of the toilet seat off to see how it worked. Looping back to Godin\u2019s candy diet piece: There isn\u2019t enough curiosity out there.<br /> <br /> Michael quotes Jameis Winston, quarterback for the Buccaneers next. Jameis was asked if the Buccaneers were playoff contenders. Jameis\u2019 response was that he was just trying to be 1-0 each week. He was living in the \u201cmoment of now.\u201d He wasn\u2019t worrying about week five while he was playing a game in week one. This thought process goes for everything in life, especially trading. You need a systematic approach that keeps you in the moment of right now. Otherwise you become bait.<br /> <br /> Jared Kushner ran the Trump campaign. He tried to run the Trump campaign on the cheap. He would see what worked, and if it didn\u2019t work then they would cut their losses quickly. If it worked, they would keep that strategy going and scale it up.<br /> <br /> Michael finishes up the podcast talking about the new version of his Trend Following book.

It is his third appearance on the show. Van runs the Van Tharp Institute and is the author of four acclaimed books published by McGraw Hill: Super Trader, Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom, Safe Strategies for Financial Freedom, and Financial Freedom Through Electronic Day Trading. His new book is called Trading Beyond the Matrix. He was also featured in Jack Schwager\u2019s Market Wizard\u2019s: Interviews with Great Traders. Van Tharp received his Ph.D. in psychology, is a certified Master Practitioner of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), a Certified Master Time Line Therapist, a certified Modeler of NLP, and an Assistant Trainer of NLP.<br /> <br /> Michael starts the podcast asking Van how he felt the year Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller won the Nobel Prize. Van has a long standing theory that those who win the Nobel Prize are just supporting the ideas of the status quo. It is meant to propel the majority into believing they are in the right. Trend following does nothing to support the status quo, therefore Van says that Michael and himself will not be winning the Nobel Prize anytime soon.<br /> <br /> People looking for help constantly approach Van. Michael asks, \u201cWhat is it like to observe the learning of people who come into your world?\u201d Van goes into the steps he takes new students through when teaching them how to trade. He shares some typical biases that new traders have when starting their training. He first teaches people to understand that they need to take total responsibility for what happens to them while trading. If was easy to make money in the markets then big money would make it hard to participate in the game, but since it is not easy to make money in the markets, they make it easy to join.<br /> <br /> Michael switches gears and asks, \u201cWhen were you first exposed to the \u2018how much\u2019 question?\u201d Van says that it was at a workshop with Ed Seykota. Seykota asked, \u201cWhat is the most important factor in your trading?\u201d Van responded, \u201cWell, It\u2019s you.\u201d And Seykota said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s how much.\u201d It all starts with how much you are willing to lose and how much you can afford to lose. Michael moves on to ask \u201cAre there anymore interesting things that you learned from working with Ed Seykota?\u201d Van shares a story about Seykota and the psychology behind what makes him such a legendary trader. He moves on to share some stories about another legendary trend following trader, Tom Basso. Van shares personal stories about how he conducted his business and trading.<br /> <br /> Discretionary trading is the next topic. Van says, \u201cIf you are a pure discretionary trader, it seems to me that it would be very difficult to implement some of the position sizing methodologies that are in your work.\u201d A trader needs to know when something is not working anymore. You need to be aware of market changes, and subtle changes in that market that no longer works.<br /> <br /> Michael ends the podcast asking, \u201cWho changed your thinking in your life? Who helped to send you down this path?\u201d Van started his business around 1982, which coincidentally was probably the low point in his life. He went to a life science church that helped him work on himself.

After falling short in the 1972 Olympics winning the silver medal rather than gold, Lanny went home and re-applied himself. He returned to the 1976 Olympics and won the gold medal in rifle shooting.<br /> <br /> Lanny was the kid in school that nobody wanted on their team. He was slow, short and uncoordinated. He worked hard, but he was never going to be able to compete against others that were taller, faster and more coordinated. He shares a story about being in school and one of his classmates saying that he would be the least likely person to become an Olympic gold medalist. This prompted him to go home and learn all he could about the Olympics. This began his journey in finding his place in Olympic history.<br /> <br /> Lanny moves on to share how much practice and work he had to put in to become an elite performer. He never felt like practice was something he had to do, it was something he got to do. He loved rifle shooting not just because of the action of it, but because he was good at it. He took obstacles and turned them into opportunities.<br /> <br /> Next, Lanny says there is a big difference between winning silver and winning gold. When you go back home and everyone asks how you did, they always ask who won the gold, not who won the silver. Lanny relates winning silver saying, \u201cIt is like going to the super bowl and losing.\u201d Doesn\u2019t matter that you made it there if you don\u2019t win. He quickly realized the reason he won silver wasn\u2019t because of his shooting capabilities, it was his mental game. He teaches people how to have a mental process and tap into it when they need it the most.<br /> <br /> Lanny breaks performance down as a function of three mental processes: the conscious mind, subconscious, and self image. He goes into depth explaining the balance between all of these psychological functions. He says that you need to focus on your process rather than outcome. When you are 100% in control, then you will be much more mentally consistent. Outcome will always follow process.

You can\u2019t beat the market, and 2. The price that you see is always right. They discuss debate in the academic world between the efficient market camp and the behavioral finance camp. Daniel says that the 2008 crash shows where the efficient market theory starts to break down. He moves into value and momentum trading.<br /> <br /> Daniel brings in research proving that rules based approaches is 94% more successful than expert personal discretion. \u201cLet your profits run and cut your losers short\u201d is perhaps the biggest rule in trend following which takes great psychological discipline. Daniel says that it is an easy concept to grasp, but so hard to follow. Any investment discipline rooted in human psychology has a much better chance of working and sticking around than other strategies that don\u2019t take human nature into account.<br /> <br /> To make the risky choices Daniel says you need a mentor. Humans don\u2019t do well with volatility and uncertainty. We live in the present and not in the future so a lot of people need coaching to look beyond the day to day. The hallmark of a good investor realizes that the rules do apply to them and they own the fact that they are no more gifted or special than the next person. Most investors tend to leave about 50% of their profits on the table due to bad emotional decisions.<br /> <br /> Daniel says that everyone talks about the idea of \u201ctrouble is opportunity\u201d but they don\u2019t really live by it. People need to take a closer look at what \u201copportunity\u201d really is. They need a rule, system or automation in place that makes them do the thing they don\u2019t want to do.

He has had a bird\u2019s eye view of some of the most interesting events in the economy over the last 20 years.<br /> <br /> Jim and Michael start the conversation off talking about WikiLeaks, who the global elites are, and how they are slowly being exposed. WikiLeaks is showing the private face of how politicians think and giving a behind the curtains look into their lives. People are losing confidence in these \u201celites\u201d and the \u201celites\u201d are starting to lose confidence in themselves.<br /> <br /> In Jim\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Road to Ruin: The Global Elites\u2019 Secret Plan for the Next Financial Crisis,\u201d he talks about 1998, 2008 and 2018. Jim gives these dates as examples of financial crises that happen (and will happen) every six to ten years. He relates financial panics to earthquakes. If you could stop an earthquake mid earthquake, this is similar to how we have been dealing with financial crises over the years. When bubbles are created, and then bailouts occur, government is only putting a stopper in the problem, however the problem is still there and building. The next bailout can\u2019t come from the central banks.<br /> <br /> Jim and Michael finish the podcast discussing cyber hacking and WWIII. Jim believes WWIII has already begun between Russia and America on a cyber warfare front. Cyber warfare has been happening between Russia and the U.S. for years. It is the worse kind of attack because you can get into major operating systems. Jim uses the operating systems of the Hoover Dam or getting into the operating system of the New York Stock Exchange as examples.

He writes for \u201cliving and writing wild.\u201d He has authored 22 books and has been featured everywhere from the New York Times to the LA Times. His latest book is titled, \u201cDropping the Struggle.\u201d<br /> <br /> Michael and Roger start the episode by breaking apart Roger\u2019s book title, \u201cDropping the Struggle.\u201d Roger looks at different areas of life where struggle doesn\u2019t work such as the struggle for meaning or purpose of life, the struggle for love, and the struggle against change, just to name a few. Next, Roger expands on the idea of \u201cthe moment of now.\u201d He says that the idea of \u201cfate\u201d does not mean that your life is predetermined. The love of ones fate, and embracing fate as your life is how you write your own story. Planning for the future has its place, but when it preoccupies current life completely, then it can be problematic.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael and Roger talk about the always occurring \u201cend of the world\u201d debate going on. They use the upcoming election as an example. Once the presidential election is over, the debate will move onto something else. Life is a constant river. There will always be ups and downs. It is just the way the world works. It is how people respond to the ups and downs that define how things work out.<br /> <br /> Love is the next topic of conversation. Roger says that there will always be imperfections with love but even those imperfections contribute to who we are as people. If you take those imperfections out, then we wouldn\u2019t be the people that we are. It is part of the process of humility. Michael and Roger finish up discussing the differences between eastern and western cultures.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Reflective contemplation</li> <li>The moment of now</li> <li>The fantasy of control</li> <li>Imperfections with love</li> <li>Buddhist culture</li> <li>Individuality in western culture</li> </ul>", "duration": "42:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/501.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1478487600, "title": "Ep. 500: Charles Faulkner Special with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>My special 500th episode is a 6-hour aggregate show featuring Charles Faulkner.</p>", "duration": "06:19:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/500.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1478224800, "title": "Ep. 499: Jenny Blake Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Jenny Blake is author of \u201cPivot: The Only Move That Matters is Your Next One.\u201d She is a former Google employee and has a perspective that everyone can learn something from, especially if you feel like you are at a plateau in life.<br /> <br /> Michael and Jenny start the conversation off with the benefits of yoga. Jenny says that \u201cYour body is your business.\u201d She quickly realized that when her body was operating at 50% then her business was operating at 50%. Yoga has always been her outlet and her source of strength, flexibility, and one of her biggest accelerators of focus.<br /> <br /> Michael asks, \u201cHow did we get to this point where everyone thinks that life goes in a straight line?\u201d Jenny says we are all hungry for a sense of adventure, however we so often resist change. 2008 was a game changer that made many realize that anything can happen at any time. Social media has contributed to this also by creating a sense of restlessness and what Jenny refers to as \u201ccognitive junk food\u201d.<br /> <br /> Jenny talks about the word \u201cplateau\u201d next. Plateau is the word she uses for when one thinks things/life are generally OK and then things start to gradually decline. When you hit a plateau, it is usually a case of mastering the job that you are doing at hand. It isn\u2019t about personal failure. Plateau\u2019s are more about figuring out what is next, how you can continue to grow, and how you can make the most impact on the world, Jenny interviewed a wide variety of people from peak performers to others who peak in some other way. She found that pivots were the most successful when the answer was already within someone. When it doesn\u2019t work out is when people try to pivot too sharply. We can\u2019t always know 100% if a pivot is going to work or if it is right but you need to put yourself outside of your comfort zone and take the risk.<br /> <br /> Jenny moves on to explain what she calls \u201cthe pivot method\u201d, which is comprised of a four step process. Plant, is the first step: One foot stays planted and the other foot pivots and scans the other options. It is about where you want to end up one year from now. The second step is scan: As you plant your feet you scan all the options. The third step is piloting: This is the experimentation phase. The last step is launch: This step is exactly how it sounds, you are launching into whatever that pivot is that you have been experimenting with.

He also founded and ran United Asset Management for 20 years. He has 50 years of experience on Wall Street. Today, Michael and Norton talk about his new book, \u201cInvestment: A History.\u201d It is a detailed anthology on investment.<br /> <br /> Norton stresses that everyone has a responsibility to understand their investments and to educate themselves to know what they are getting themselves into. Most people seem daunted by the challenges of investing. Real ownership, seeking a value, the role of leverage, and resource allocation are four key points of investment that Norton lays out in his book. When someone makes an investment, they need to really own that investment. It isn\u2019t just a piece of paper.<br /> <br /> Michael moves the conversation to economic bubbles and asks, \u201cWhat are some of the timeless lessons that can be learned from bubbles you have witnessed in your lifetime?\u201d Norton\u2019s favorite bubble to have witnessed in his 80+ years is the latest bubble that popped in 2008. It was the way in which the bubble was created that fascinated him. He relates it to the great depression and discusses the similarities in recovering from it.<br /> <br /> Next, Norton gives his perspective on efficient markets vs. the behavioral school. He says that it is a conundrum that has not yet been solved. Survivorship bias is the next controversial topic. They discuss the success of Warren Buffett and the \u201csurvivorship bias\u201d argument that has been attached to him. Buffett has been around for many decades and both men agree that there is much that can be learned from Buffett. On the other side of the spectrum is Bernie Madoff. Norton explains how an operation like Madoff would be almost impossible to pull off in today\u2019s markets. He also agrees with Michael in saying, \u201cI would be deeply skeptical of someone producing 1% returns every month. You need risk to have returns like that.\u201d<br /> <br /> Michael brings up tail risk next. Norton describes tail risk as, \u201cA one in a one hundred year event.\u201d Things can be rare and unlikely but it is not the same as saying something is impossible. Conditions can always get extreme and produce \u201ca one in a one hundred year event\u201d and wipe you out. Norton uses Long Term Capital Management as a great example. Michael and Norton finish the podcast stressing that people can never be too cautious when investing in the markets.

He is a former United States congressman, who also served as the Director of The Office of Management and Budget under president Ronald Reagan. His books include, \u201cThe Great Deformation\u201d, and \u201cTrumped: A Nation on the Brink of Ruin\u2026 And How to Bring it Back\u201d.<br /> <br /> Michael and David start off discussing the recent news of Larry Summers suggesting that the Fed should start buying common stocks. David says that this is an act of sheer desperation and that any economist, 20 years ago, would have never come up with such an idea. What has happened is that policy makers have been led into a dead end path. \u201cMadness\u201d is how David describes the Fed right now. The mentality people have today, with Janet Yellen, is that intervention is necessary and without it, the whole system will fall apart. This mentality was not present prior to the year 2000 or maybe even 2008. Wall Street and Washington applaud the policy only because the market continues to go up.<br /> <br /> Michael turns the conversation to the present election and asks David how he perceives the rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. \u201cWhat does it say about America\u2019s present state of mind?\u201d David says it shows that America has had enough. The public is responding to Trump because he isn\u2019t part of the system. Regardless of Trump\u2019s stance on issues he will probably get a large part of Sanders supporters because they both have an \u201cagainst the grain\u201d political stance. David refers to Hillary Clinton as \u201cthe class president of a failed generation\u201d. He gives examples back to 1991 when Bill Clinton was president, pointing out the senseless wars and damage that has been done to the economy due to policy. Clinton is \u201cA survivor of what has been a 30 year consolidation of bad policy\u201d says David. Hillary Clinton was the survivor who happened to be in the right place at the right time.<br /> <br /> Next, David goes into his stance on Glass Steagall and how he would reinstate it in a way that would re-stabilize the financial system. Michael then has David elaborate on Deutsche Bank and some of the other problems the European banking system is facing. Michael asks, \u201cWhat will happen if there is another 50% decrease on the S&amp;P? What will the authorities do next?\u201d David believes they are out of options. Going to negative interest rates will create a firestorm that they can\u2019t take on. It will induce the sensible people in America to riot. A real correction will not happen until the market is able to stay down and correct from the damage that happened in the propping up in 2008. Michael and David finish up the podcast discussing the Chinese economy. David believes their economy is just as unsustainable as the United States.

The book shows how common algorithms relate to our everyday lives.<br /> <br /> Brian starts off giving a historical explanation of an \u201calgorithm\u201d. Algorithms do not just relate to computers or mathematical procedures. A cooking recipe can be described as an algorithm or you could use an algorithm to solve the question, \u201cHow do you know when your best opportunity is?\u201d Brian says you use an algorithm known as \u201coptimal stopping\u201d to solve this question. He explains the algorithm that provides the best probability of the best outcome.<br /> <br /> Probability is the next. Is it worth exploring a new business possibility? Or is it better to hone in your skills and continue on with what you are doing? There is a formal framework or algorithm to help make these decisions. Brian explains the \u201cwin stay, lose shift\u201d approach. If a restaurant is good, go back. If you don\u2019t have a good experience, don\u2019t go back. It may not be the optimal approach but it is a good approach and easy to live by.<br /> <br /> Michael jumps to an example with Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon. Brian tells Jeff\u2019s story of Amazon and how he left his successful job at the time to start up this \u201conline bookstore\u201d. He ultimately used a \u201cregret minimization framework\u201d to make his decision. There was a possibility Jeff may not have been successful starting Amazon, but had he not tried it, he would have regretted not trying for the rest of his life. Brian also gives other examples of regret minimization algorithms.<br /> <br /> Michael and Brian discuss threading next.

He has had an amazing career full of great experience and insights. Chris first entered the FBI in 1983 and has been involved with over 150 kidnapping cases. He started out working on a suicide hotline and quickly realized that his negotiating skills were applicable to all areas of life, not just hostage situations.<br /> <br /> Chris starts the conversation off talking about how he begins hostage negotiations. It is about exchanging power and getting the upper hand early on in the negotiations. A lot of people want to think of negotiations as chess. Chris explains why this is not the case. You can make four moves in a row if you want. Not necessarily making one move, then a counter move by the other person. Chris goes on to explain that if you can walk out of any situation you don\u2019t like, then you can win in any situation and you are able to have more fun with negotiating.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael asks, \u201cHow do you go about negotiating with bat shit crazy people?\u201d Even \u201cbat shit crazy\u201d has it\u2019s patterns. Chris talks about being on Comedy Central and doing a skit on this exact situation. As long as he starts looking at patterns then things become aware to him and he can influence people\u2019s emotions. When people don\u2019t open themselves up to you, that is the first sign of danger. If people won\u2019t talk, this is when you know psychologically they have shut down. 9-11 is an example of people being silent on the other side, shutting down, and leaving no room for negotiation. If you can ask someone \u201cHave you given up on resolving this situation amicably?\u201d Even having someone say \u201cYes\u201d means they are immediately opening up a little more than they were before. Chris was always taught to go into situations knowing that people are not rational. They are driven by passion and purpose.<br /> <br /> Chris also elaborates on \u201cWhy, How and Lying three times\u201d. In general, \u201cWhy\u201d questions make people feel defensive instantly. \u201cHow\u201d questions make the other person feel powerful. People feel in charge when they are asked \u201cHow\u201d, but it puts a lot of constraints on their answer. His last rule of negotiations is the \u201cLying three times\u201d rule. If you get someone to lie three times then they most likely won\u2019t act on that lie.<br /> <br /> The podcast wraps up with bonus material of an interview between Michael and Chris recorded on a previous day.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Aversion to negotiation</li> <li>Negotiating skills</li> <li>Never pretend people are rational</li> <li>Business negotiations compared to hostage negotiations</li> <li>Lying three times</li> <li>\u201cHow\u201d and \u201cWhy\u201d questions</li> </ul>", "duration": "01:07:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/489.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1474855200, "title": "Ep. 488: Never Forget the Lessons with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael reads some of his favorite quotes circa 1920\u2019s/1930\u2019s from a famed trader.

He is best known for writing \u201cInfluence: The Psychology of Persuasion\u201d published back in 1984. Robert is the \u201cgo to man\u201d for understanding effective persuasion. Reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking and scarcity are his six key principles of influence that he teaches. His new book, \u201cPre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade\u201d, introduces a seventh key principle of influence.<br /> <br /> Michael asks \u201cHow did you start down this path? What was your \u2018A-ha\u2019 moment that got you researching for this new book?\u201d Robert says it was a series of recognitions as he was reading the newest work in behavioral studies that made him realize that creating mindsets in people didn\u2019t involve just six principles. He went back to his notes and looked at what the top people in various professions were doing. He realized that they were acting like gardeners. They were preparing the earth before planting the seed. These professionals were priming a persons mind to perceive their idea more fully.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael and Robert talk about anchoring a persons perception of what they are paying or asking for. You start off with a higher number or a grander request before hitting the other person with what you really want. \u201cAre there types of thinkers where pre-suasion is not as effective? Or have you found universally across the populations that pre-suasion is just very effective?\u201d Robert says it seems to be a universal operating procedure that is built into us from birth. He uses a study done with 18 month old babies that proves that this is built into our psyche.<br /> <br /> Lastly, Michael asks Robert to elaborate on the idea of unity. Robert shares a story of Warren Buffett and unity taken from his book. Michael finishes up the last 20 minutes of the podcast with a presentation on behavior change and the part that social norms play in creating that change, given by Robert.

Or to put the question another way, what is it that growing up in influence provides to children that growing up in poverty does not?\u201d This is the question that today\u2019s guest, author Paul Tough, poses in his newest book, \u201cHelping Children Succeed: What Works and Why.\u201d It is a data driven book about how young kids are growing and developing in today\u2019s world.<br /> <br /> 51% of children in the public school system are below the low income bar set by the government. Paul goes through the psychological issues of children from low income homes starting from birth all the way through high school. Science is very clear that children develop the most during the first three years of their life. He says there are two main things to think about when children are developing: stress, and day-to-day interaction with parents or caregivers. Paul gives examples of the types of stress and interaction that is good and bad during early childhood.<br /> <br /> Paul talks about the education system next. He says that development should be looked at as on a continuum rather than separated into segments such as preschool, kindergarten, and so forth. Michael and Paul also speak to the behavioral issues that may come from different socioeconomic backgrounds and what schools can do to improve the outcome of a child. \u201cGrit\u201d and curiosity needs to be taught and encouraged along with standard learning, in and out of the classroom. Intervening more intensely in the first few years is a huge way of creating this motivation and curiosity.<br /> <br /> Michael brings up the higher income children who also are having trouble finding \u201cgrit and perseverance\u201d. Paul says we aren\u2019t giving children the opportunity to struggle with adversity. The difference between not having grit in a higher income family as opposed to low income is that you can usually get by in life. You can usually find an average job and have food on the table. However, not having drive coming from a low income family, you may not be able to put food on the table and have a roof over your head.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Early childhood development</li> <li>Creating the right environment for children</li> <li>Childhood poverty</li> <li>Serve and return parenting</li> <li>Teaching grit and curiosity</li> <li>The accountability movement</li> <li>What motivates us?</li> <li>Education as a national problem</li> </ul>", "duration": "38:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/483.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1473040800, "title": "Ep. 482: Two Takes with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>There are back-to-back monologues on today\u2019s episode.

The first take Michael was told was too aggressive with too many F bombs, so he re-recorded but still left it up on the tail end of the podcast. The double header podcast today was inspired by a film Michael recently re-watched called, \u201cBoom Bust Boom\u201d.<br /> <br /> Michael talks about Hyman Minsky\u2019s \u201cfinancial instability hypothesis\u201d. Minsky said that there is instability in capitalism and if capitalism was eliminated, that would help eliminate bubbles. Minsky believed that offsetting the economy is how you eliminate instability. This is where the government came up with zero interest rates, and in some places, negative interest rates. Due to the Minsky mentality, economists think they can control the markets and stop human nature from happening.<br /> <br /> Michael ties his documentary film into the discussion and describes the insight he got during \u201908 when he happened to be filming. Trend following strategies and behavioral economics have these characteristics in common: 1. People will never be rational. 2. Markets will always trend up, down and sideways. 3.

It is predicated on, \u201cWhat are the deep root causes that allow some companies to stay young, stay energetic, and be sustainable in their performance over time?\u201d<br /> <br /> Only 1 in 10 companies sustain a modest level of growth over a decade. Chris, and his co-author James Allen, found that when the founder of a company was still evolved and their presence was still looming, companies had about three times higher performance than other companies where the founder had stepped away. Chris elaborates on their research process and the steps he and James took in writing \u201cThe Founder\u2019s Mentality\u201d.<br /> <br /> A deep sense of insurgency, frontline obsession, and an owner\u2019s mindset are the three characteristics that make up the founder\u2019s mentality. Keeping an open mind at all times and willingness to adapt to your company\u2019s growth is key. When companies fail to be open minded, they become short term minded. Chris has found a great response from this way of thinking. He has now written 5 books over the last 12 years on this topic and all have been extremely well received, especially his latest work, \u201cThe Founder\u2019s Mentality\u201d.<br /> <br /> People are searching for happiness in their work and Chris is helping outline how to get there. He helps people own the customer service experience in their company. Chris and Michael use Nokia as a great example of an industry leader that failed to adapt. Nokia was the first to use email on phones, they were huge in cameras, and had the first smart phone but they failed to be innovative enough and became institutionally closed minded. Ultimately what looked like a tech company that could not have died, ended up committing suicide.<br /> <br /> Chris uses Starbucks as another example of a company that started something special, but as soon as the company moved away from what Howard Schultz, the founder, had started they began to crumble. After profits started to take a hit, Howard Schultz was asked to come out of retirement and revive the company. Starbucks was self inflicting wounds that were unraveling the core of the Starbucks experience.

Social media is constantly being thrown in everyone\u2019s face, and subsequently you need an efficient tool kit under your belt to be able to gain any type of real achievement in today\u2019s world.<br /> <br /> There is an epidemic of 20 to 30 year old men who cannot think. There is also a feminization of men that is taking over the younger generation. They seem to only be attached to their feelings. Men have traditionally had a more analytical view on things and women have a greater capacity to think with emotion. The analytical side of men is starting to get edged away.<br /> <br /> Michael then poses the question, \u201cHow do you end the dominance of the 1%?\u201d Michael says you either take their money, or kill them. If you do not act on one of those two things, then how else do you strip away their dominance? Once you walk through how you are going to \u201ctake care of the 1%\u201d then you realize the statement is a sham.

She is the author of \u201cYour Inner GPS: Follow your Internal Guidance to Optimal Health, Happiness and Satisfaction.\u201d Her goal is to help clients find a stress free and happy existence by getting in touch with their inner voice.<br /> <br /> Michael and Zen start off talking about the inner GPS. Zen believes that everyone is born with this inner voice guiding them, but most lose sight of that influence. Buddhism and Daoism have strong beliefs in the use of meditation to help people use their minds as a tool rather than an operating system. The more people realize there is a flow within their body, the more they can train their mind to get into this energy. Once someone gets into that flow, they are able to understand their thoughts and emotions clearer.<br /> <br /> Neuroplasticity is the next. Zen says she has a tool kit to make people\u2019s minds move in different directions. Zen teaches practices that help move their brain into a different domain when they have a block or feel trapped. She uses an example about her and her father\u2019s relationship as well as a coaching session she had with Van Jones.<br /> <br /> Zen describes how each person\u2019s internal guidance system is linked in with their destiny. This internal GPS is trying to help use the mind to move towards a persons optimal life. Zen uses an example about the owner of Cliff Bar, as well as a personal example of an experience she had at the Denver airport. Her experience, in short, lead her to catching a plane ride that she would have never been able to catch had she not listened to her internal GPS. Michael also shares a personal example he had about listening to his internal GPS which lead to a great business opportunity. All these examples show the constant battle between what your gut is telling you to do, and what your head is telling you to do.<br /> <br /> Michael and Zen wrap the podcast up discussing the meaning of ones \u201clife purpose\u201d. We have thousands of life purposes rather than just one. True fulfillment comes from giving and contributing. You don\u2019t get that feeling when you are too focused on on one item.

Michael says, \u201cJust focus on price action and look at markets from a \u2018desert island approach\u2019.\u201d Trading price is the only information you can trust.

The Chinese hacking US government databases is just one of a few examples used by Morgan to illustrate the point. Morgan says that there is no accountability in the government, which is a major contributor to why some of these hacks are able to take place.<br /> <br /> Email is the next topic. How safe is it? Email is one of the best ways to attack someone. Companies are being hacked and having money stolen in the millions of dollars through email.

Morgan was tasked with confronting Congress and explaining the lack of security within that particular government website. He went before congress to prove how ill secure the website system was.

He is co-founder of Creative Live, a live educational platform. There is much to learn from his entrepreneurial ventures and how he made it in the photography world.<br /> <br /> Michael and Chase start the podcast talking about basketball, and Golden State in particular. Chase goes to a lot of games and has had the opportunity to sit up close and personal with the players. He says the best part about going is seeing the infectious energy and passion among the players. Steph Curry is his favorite to watch and compares his confidence, energy, and talent to Michael Jordan.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael asks about how Chase got involved with photography, and how his career has evolved into what it is today. Sports were a huge factor in his success as a photographer as well as becoming an entrepreneur. Teamwork, hardship, success, disappointment all gave relevance to his professional career development. His first photography shots were of skateboarding, snowboarding, etc. things that he knew well. He also had some professional friends in those sports that he could take pictures of which consequently helped jump start his career.<br /> <br /> Chase moves into talking about his most recent venture, Creative Live. Creative Live is the world\u2019s largest live educational platform. It is focused specifically on creative education and the ability to make a life out of that creative field. A few years ago Chase started to shift from just taking photos, to sharing his experiences with others as a photographer. He turned his photo studio into a bit of an incubator and launched the first app that could upload photo\u2019s directly into social media outlets.<br /> <br /> Chase shares with listeners how he flushes out his creative blocks with adventure. Adventure has always been an ignition to be propel him into a new head space. He gives a couple examples such as traveling to Europe for 6 months and traveling across New Zealand. Chase also shares simpler ways to travel and get your feet on the ground. Chase quotes a friend by saying there are two things you have to ask yourself if you think you are ready to make a change in your life: 1. Is this working? 2. Do I still believe in it? If the answer is no to both, then it is time to get out of what you are doing.<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pursuing classes via Creative Live, Chase has provided a special discount for Trend Following listeners.

Christopher is co-author of \u201cPlay Bigger: How Pirates, Dreamers, and Innovators Create and Dominate Markets\u201d.<br /> <br /> Michael and Christopher start the podcast talking about the commonalities between most innovators and entrepreneurs. The legendary innovators that make their companies into a success focus on three main points: product design, company design, and category design. Category design is about inventing a whole new space in the world for their product. Legendary innovators are just as thoughtful about their category design as they are of product and company design.<br /> <br /> Christopher and his co-authors went back and looked at every start up company founded in the United States dating back to 2000. They asked, \u201cWhat percentage of the market cap in the category goes to the category king or leader?\u201d On average the category king captured 76% of the markets profits. Category design is a secret \u201cblack art\u201d in Silicon Valley. Only about 10% of companies are thinking about teaching the world to accept their new innovation. If you do not teach your consumers, then you are leaving your company up to chance, waiting to see if people will figure your company out on their own. Christopher stresses that when you create a product that fits into an existing category, you are by definition playing someone else\u2019s game. And you are fighting for essentially only 25% of the market. He uses Microsoft as an example.<br /> <br /> Michael asks Christopher to go into the idea of \u201cdisrupting the marketplace\u201d with new ideas. Christopher says that \u201cdisrupting\u201d is actually the wrong way to go about looking at things. Elvis did not disrupt Jazz, he just created a new genre that we now know as rock and roll. And in the same way, Les Paul created the electric guitar. He did not ruin the acoustic guitar; they just sit side by side now.<br /> <br /> \u201cWhen someone comes up with a new category, how do you determine pricing?\u201d Christopher says that the category king has pricing power. You get to decide what the pricing is if you create the category. And in order to become a category king, the CEO needs to spend at least half of his/her time articulating the problem that has been solved with their product to the customer. Christopher goes into detail and uses Pixar as an example of this concept.<br /> <br /> The category king dynamic is not geographically bound. There tends to be different kinds of technology that breaks through in different parts of the world, but that is really the only difference. In many parts of the developing world there is even more of a focus on getting the \u201cproduct, company and design\u201d right.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Disrupting the marketplace</li> <li>Product marketing</li> <li>Teaching consumers about your product</li> <li>Creating new market categories</li> <li>The anchoring effect</li> <li>Thunder lizards</li> <li>Category kings</li> <li>The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma</li> <li>Category design</li> </ul>", "duration": "01:10:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/473.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1470016800, "title": "Ep. 472: Silence with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today, Michael dives into silence. An excerpt from Daniel Gross: \u201cIn the mid 20th century, epidemiologists discovered correlations between high blood pressure and chronic noise sources like highways and airports. Later research seemed to link noise to increased rates of sleep loss, heart disease, and tinnitus. (It\u2019s this line of research that hatched the 1960s-era notion of \u201cnoise pollution,\u201d a name that implicitly refashions transitory noises as toxic and long-lasting.)\u201d<br /> <br /> \u201cSilence\u201d science is leading the way with awesome new insights: \u201cThe growth of new cells in the brain doesn\u2019t always have health benefits.

She is author of \u201cThe Happiness Track: How to Apply the Science of Happiness to Accelerate Your Success.\u201d She is the Associate Director for the Center of Compassion at Stanford University. Emma\u2019s work isn\u2019t based on theories or common knowledge, there is a tremendous amount of neuroscience backing her work.<br /> <br /> Emma starts the podcast off stating that being happy is a very subjective experience. With that in mind, in general, happiness is divided into two main categories; hedonic and eudemonic. Hedonic happiness doesn\u2019t last long and is more associated with short burst of excitement such as sex and food. Eudemonic is much longer lasting and is more associated with self-fulfillment. Emma goes into depth explaining and giving example of both forms of happiness.<br /> <br /> Michael asks Emma to talk about the myth of success next. Emma says Americans are over stimulating themselves, and believing that running on adrenaline is the best way to get things done. Chronic stress is actually what we are embracing and it starts to deplete our immune system. Emma acknowledges that you may not be able to control the world around you, but you can control your state of mind. Working on Stanford\u2019s campus, Emma has seen first hand the severe epidemic of students buying into myths of happiness, especially on higher achieving campuses. They believe the only way to be successful is to burn themselves into the ground and of course, this notion is completely false. Unplugging and taking more vacations is the best way for us to reach our maximum potential. Creativity and happiness in the workplace depends on it.<br /> <br /> Next, Emma discusses the impact breathing has on our emotions. There are different breathing practices that help out with stress and anxiety. Nurturing more calmness in our life helps us manage our energy much more. There was a study done at Harvard that showed our brains wonder 50% of the time. However, science shows that we are never happier than when we are in the moment of now. With technology constantly at our fingertips, it is getting harder and harder to be in the present moment. But when we are in the moment, it boosts our charisma and happiness. People are drawn toward others that are satisfied being in the present moment with them. Michael and Emma turn the conversation to negative emotions. These emotions make us more focused on ourselves and selfish. When the focus shifts to positivity, authenticity is created. Others crave authentic people they can connect to. They finish on talking about creativity and how to best tap into the creative parts of your brain. Just by making small changes in the way you work can really make a huge difference in the way your feel and your brain works.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Benefits of happiness</li> <li>Stresses in life</li> <li>Controlling your mind</li> <li>Happiness in college</li> <li>Cultivating resilience</li> <li>Tapping into the opposite of fight or flight response</li> <li>Impact of different breathing techniques</li> <li>Living in the moment of now</li> <li>Authenticity</li> <li>The flow state</li> <li>Activating creativity</li> </ul>", "duration": "37:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/471.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1469412000, "title": "Ep. 470: Objective with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael takes the podcast back to 1959 with an interview between Mike Wallace and Ayn Rand.

She started working for herself creating websites for people when she was 22 living in Chicago. It spread to optimizing traffic and online marketing for her clients. In 2014 she launched her social media software business, Edgar. They haven\u2019t taken any money from investors and have grown to 2.8 million annual revenue.<br /> <br /> Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn are the biggest social media platforms today. Many entrepreneurs get overwhelmed by the scope of content creation and posting needed to be successful. They tend to give up before they have even begun. Laura goes into the advantages of recycling content, notes that small percentages of your audience will ever see your content, and that the nature of the internet is all about repeated content.<br /> <br /> The questions to ask yourself are, \u201cHow much traffic are you driving back to your website? How many people are buying off of that traffic?\u201d There needs to be a balance between providing worthy content to your social media followers and not just pushing ads at followers. Michael then asks, \u201cHow important is it to be authentic?\u201d<br /> <br /> Don\u2019t worry about people who want to un-follow or unsubscribe to your email. If they don\u2019t want to follow you, then you don\u2019t want them anyway. The extreme side of un-followers are critics. Laura and Michael talk about critics and how to cut them loose.

He started Trend Following Radio in 2012. It originally was all about trading, but with a Vernon Smith interview, then Gerd Gigerenzer and Dan Ariely interviews, he realized he could take it in a different direction. With those three interviews under the belt, he was able to secure Daniel Kahneman on the podcast which he believes was the real tipping point for the podcast.<br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode Michael plays curated clips from the men mentioned above: Vernon Smith, Gerd Gigerenzer, Dan Ariely and Daniel Kahneman. He wraps up by playing a short clip from another brilliant mind in behavior finance, Nassim Taleb. The clips exemplify the spirit of behavioral finance. They range from helping people understand their behavior at a fundamental level to behavior in markets and what drives the average person to make particular risky moves in life and in their trading.<br /> <br /> Michael finishes up talking about the enormous amount of misinformation in news and media. You need to do the reading and educate yourself. Absorb wisdom from the right people, do your homework and put in the work to get ahead.

Fredrick\u2019s claim to fame is discovering that it isn\u2019t about innovating a product, but rather about innovating the factory. He looked into factory processes and what it took to make a product most effectively. The downside of his work was that he believed management should be operated scientifically as well. He thought that management was smart and factory workers were dumb. His values helped people focus on how to make a product most efficiently not how to make people sustainable, prolific and healthy. He took a lot of the emotion out of it. Most of his work has shifted from the United States and moved to other more factory driven places such as China.<br /> <br /> The new form of work that we are seeing in most countries is creative work. Employees are required to make decisions or make collective designs with people in their company. Michael asks, \u201cIsn\u2019t this about making employees feel like entrepreneurs in their company or organization?\u201d David uses tech start-ups as examples; Even as they get big they aim to make their companies continue to feel like a start-up and train their employees to think like solo entrepreneurs. This is how trust and intellect gets built within a company.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael and David discuss the effectiveness of email. Pros: The cost of email is cheap and you can respond on your own schedule. Cons: Constant text and emails have diverted focus and created too much distraction. David stresses that there is no such thing as \u201cmultitasking\u201d, there is only task switching. Some studies say it could take up to 15 minutes to get back to the focus you were at before you were interrupted.<br /> <br /> Michael and David move the discussion back to the importance of keeping your employees happy. Having outstanding customer satisfaction comes down to putting employees first. Sometimes that means siding with your employees over your customers. You need to be able to tell some customers that your company or product simply may not be right for them. Also, creating the right work environment is key. Open work environments as opposed to more closed work environments have been becoming the norm. In an open office environment the idea is that working together is easy and creates a better collaborative environment. However there are negative effects such as increased sick days (perhaps because they do not want to see certain co-workers) and more distraction.<br /> <br /> Michael and David finish talking about non-compete clauses and the counter productiveness of them. There is a difference between a non-compete and a non-disclosure. Apple and Google have two totally different views on this. Google is 100% fluid and open. Apple is very closed off and believes in the non-compete clause. When people migrate from one company to another, it has been shown in studies that both companies actually win from the intellectual knowledge transferred and gained from each other. Non-compete environments benefit everyone in the long term. Also, on a societal level you can see a huge benefit when non-competes are not allowed.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Re-designing the factory</li> <li>Physical labor vs. Intellectual labor</li> <li>Machines vs. Man</li> <li>Multitasking = Task switching</li> <li>\u201cThe customer is always right\u201d mentality</li> <li>Confirmation bias</li> <li>Introverts and extroverts</li> <li>Customer service</li> <li>Non-compete clauses</li> </ul>", "duration": "45:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/467.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1468202400, "title": "Ep. 466: Don\u2019t Worship the Computer with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael starts an email from a listener that starts with praise, then turns around and claims that a top trend following trader has 400 employees and \u201csuper computers\u201d to carry out trades, and that is why he is so successful.

The trader he refers to is on record saying that he trades off of Excel spreadsheets. For the remainder of the podcast, Michael expands on his response to the listeners email, and breaks apart algorithmic trading.<br /> <br /> Michael next reads an excerpt from \u201cIntuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking\u201d, by Daniel Dennett. The excerpt breaks down algorithms in depth. Michael\u2019s point is to show that a computer doesn\u2019t make a great trader, it is the algorithms programed in the computer that creates the success.

There are foreseeable events and unforeseeable events. Brexit was a foreseeable event. Jason and Chris breakdown the weeks before Brexit, and how Sunrise has been positioning their portfolios in contrast to other firms. Jason and Chris say that in the systematic world there have been two different camps of thought in how to approach Brexit.<br /> <br /> Michael moves the conversation from Brexit to Oil dropping in 2014. Jason and Chris say that these events are not just moneymaking events, they are also risk management events. People live in the middle of a bell curve and never think of the tail events in life. They trade and invest for the non-random times and are always shocked when events tend to go further than expected. Sunrise does the opposite and uses technology to curb our human irrationality.<br /> <br /> Michael and Chris dive deeper into risk management and the importance of diversification.

Barings Bank collapses spring of 1995, trend following kills it. August 1998, Long Term Capital Management craters, and trend following made a fortune. It was almost a zero sum transfer from LTCM to trend followers in August of 1998. Spring of 2000, the dot com bubble bursts and trend following cleans up again. 2002 was one of the best trend following performance years ever. After 2002 another bubble is built and when it burst in October of 2008, trend following had outstanding performance results yet again.

Jack is the author of the Market Wizard series. His books have remained relevant over the past 25 years, and for many traders they are the best trading books on the shelves today. Michael and Jack talk about the structure of the Market Wizards books and how they evolved to interview style format.

Michael asks, \u201cOf all the traders you have talked to, what trader impressed you the most?\u201d Jack has a hard time, of course, narrowing it down to just one because there has been so many extraordinary people that he has interviewed. That being said, in terms of track records and sheer intellect, he would chose one. Jack was completely awed by his accomplishments and was surprised how great he was on a personal level.<br /> <br /> There has been a strong trend over the years for money to go to bigger and bigger asset managers. It has become a safer thing to do, to put money with a larger manager. It isn\u2019t performance driven, it is purely safety driven. Jack says that even if you have skill it is becoming exceedingly more difficult to gain new clients and get big. Jack\u2019s new venture is focused on helping these start up traders.

Robin is professor of economics at George Mason University and his new book is, \u201cThe Age of EM.\u201d Robin and Michael look forward about 100 years and analyze what the world will look like.<br /> <br /> They start the podcast discussing singularity and what it will be like when robots take over. Michael asks, \u201cHow much time will it take to get to singularity and are there faster ways that we may get to this point?\u201d Robin says that robots are a staple of where the future is headed. There are a few different schools of thought on how they will evolve but Robin\u2019s theory is based on porting. In a nutshell, this means that you re-write old software to fit your new criteria. The idea is to do the same thing with the human brain. Robin goes into detail on this idea and says that it may take as little as one century to unfold.<br /> <br /> Next, Robin discusses the types of people that will start out being emulated. The first will be top intellectuals of the time. After some years that will expand to other types of humans. Robin says that the economy will boom and double in size quickly. He also expands on \u201cEm cities\u201d, what they are, how they are created, and how they are run. \u201cEm\u2019s\u201d is the term Robin uses for emulation robots.<br /> <br /> Michael brings up the effects this next reality will have on mother nature and Em sex. Em\u2019s live in a virtual reality. They never have pain or disease. They have perfect bodies and just have sex for recreational purposes. However, they do not last forever. Em\u2019s will have to retire eventually because of software rot which Robin gives examples of and expands on.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael asks about the political ramifications of robots entering the work space. Will Em\u2019s run for politics? Robin says that they will most likely be involved in politics because they would never want to be run by people that are not nearly as fast and smart as them. He then expands on what the bodies of Em\u2019s will look like. He describes the different shapes and sizes that Em\u2019s are going to employ. This leads to the question of death. \u201cWill Em\u2019s be afraid of death?\u201d Robin says that they probably wont see it coming.<br /> <br /> Many people, when they look at the future, like to discuss what will happen. There is a degree at which our future can be influenced but to a large degree it is out of our control. Technology has been out of control for awhile. There are such varied interests among people that it will not matter if one group wants to move forward with Emulations or not. Things will continuously evolve.

Tucker has authored many books, however today he is on the podcast to talk about a new entrepreneurial venture. Tucker created a simple algorithmic process to writing a book. He began by asking himself: What do we have to do to position a book? How do we structure it? How do we outline it? How do we conduct an interview to get the information out of a authors head? And then how do we transcribe it? Once he had these answers, he had a company.<br /> <br /> Today, 18 months in, he has signed about 230 authors and has put out about 50 books. With a price point of $20,000-$50,000, Tucker and his company offer the exact steps to writing a book. His company is not ghostwriting. They aren\u2019t learning anything about your content, just getting your ideas on paper in a cohesive manner. You have to qualify in a few ways for their service: Can you pay for it? Do you have sufficient ideas for writing a book? And are you an a**hole? A**holes do not make the cut.<br /> <br /> Michael and Tucker bring up the importance of Amazon when it comes to successful marketing. Although Google is the #1 search engine, Amazon is the search engine when looking for legitimate products or the best books to buy on any given subject. When people are looking for a book or a product with reviews, they turn to Amazon.<br /> <br /> If you are going into any business, writing a book is the best way for you to become an information authority in that field. Tucker goes into depth describing the steps he takes client through to write their book. He also goes into detail about his clients motivations to writing a book or being held back from writing. Many people see writing a book as an extension of themselves and this holds them back.

In 2000 Amy started a program called, The Art of Perception at The Frick Collection in New York City. She helps her students figure out how to fix big picture problems by looking at the small details. Her new book is \u201cVisual Intelligence: Sharpen Your Perception, Change Your Life.\u201d<br /> <br /> Amy starts the podcast off sharing a story referred to by Michael as \u201cthe soap story.\u201d It is about a man from Uganda who was moved by how wasteful the hotel industry is. His big picture movement started with a bar of soap. The staff at a hotel he had been staying at cleaned his room and replaced a bar of soap that he had only used a few times. He contacted the front desk of the hotel and asked why his soap had been replaced when it had not fully been used up. The front desk explained that they replace all the soaps everyday regardless of how much had been used. What came of this small encounter? This man from Uganda jumpstarted a movement that changed the way the hotel industry operates by being more mindful of the how much needless waste they are creating. It was a small detail that changed a big picture problem.<br /> <br /> Next, Amy shares an \u201caha\u201d moment she had in college about art. She went from practicing law to studying museum education which led to her founding The Art of Perception at The Frick Collection in New York City. The program began with teaching medical students about art and how to translate it into their own profession. She started the program in 2000 and in 2004 she was having dinner with some friends which sparked the idea of expanding the program to the police field. It was wildly accepted and in no time, the program was expanded to just about every other professional field. Amy goes into some examples of her students that took her class and that have shared real life examples with her. Her students have been able to apply her teachings to everything from helping diagnose patients to solving crimes. It is all about the small details in the big picture.<br /> <br /> Amy says her program has been so successful for two reasons; art is powerful and art is not threatening. She requests that her students do not take notes, and there are no cell phones allowed during class. All that is needed is your eyes, brain, and your ability to communicate. She doesn\u2019t want to teach people how to see art, but rather teaches what she refers to as the five \u201cA\u2019s\u201d: Assess, analyze, articulate information, adapt your behavior, and become accountable for your decisions.<br /> <br /> Amy talks about listening to your sixth sense but also being able to articulate what you are feeling so you can act on it. She stresses that precise and consistent communication is paramount and gives some real life examples of why it is so important and what could happen when that ground work is not laid down.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Undoing perceptions</li> <li>COBRA methodology</li> <li>Listening to your sixth sense</li> <li>Situational awareness</li> <li>See something say something</li> <li>Pertinent Negative</li> <li>Critical inquiry</li> </ul>", "duration": "48:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/457.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1465178400, "title": "Ep. 456: Josh Hawes Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel interviews Josh Hawes. Josh is the Risk Officer and Investment Manager of Hawking Alpha. He is a trend following trader now who started off at Goldman Sachs. Josh breaks apart the trading industry, highlighting many of the cons associated with the mutual fund space.<br /> <br /> Josh has always had a passion for math. He started looking at the performance of different funds within Goldman. As soon as he started to look at returns of some, he began to see a disconnect. They would judge themselves off \u201cbeating the index\u201d but they were still losing massive amounts of money. They would also have access to CEO\u2019s of top companies and still not be able to make money off of the information they would share. This is when he began to transition out of the company and turn to other forms of trading, not just long only.<br /> <br /> Josh was given many books to read while at Goldman. \u201cReminiscences of a Stock Operator\u201d was one that resonated with him the most. \u201cTrend Following\u201d was another book that Josh had come across. \u201cTrend Following\u201d triggered him to reach out to some of the traders mentioned in the book. Ed Seykota and Jerry Parker were just a couple of the traders he was able to spark up a conversation with by reaching out.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael and Josh break apart index investing. Josh says everyone should ask themselves, \u201cWhy does the market owe you anything? And if the market goes down, does that not mean that the markets can go down for a long period of time?\u201d You can\u2019t say that you should go long the market because for 200 years the market has gone up. There has been massive ups and downs and you have to be able to navigate the down periods. Michael then asks, \u201cHow does one become the next Warren Buffett?\u201d Josh says that 2008 is one of the best examples of why you could never be the next Warren Buffett. There are a lot of people in the mutual fund space that try and mirror Buffett. Some of these people fail trading the exact strategy as Buffett. So does that make Buffett lucky or a genius?<br /> <br /> Josh and his firm guarantees to always follow their stops. He guarantees his clients that he will be a trend follower and although he can not guarantee any level of return, he will always follow his stops. This sets Josh and other trend followers apart from fundamental traders. Josh then segues into what he believes are the four ways to make money: When prices move, when prices don\u2019t move, arbitrage, and high frequency trading. He expands on these four points and gives examples. Michael and Josh end the podcast on the importance of talking directly with clients and connecting with people on a personal basis.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Trading off fundamentals</li> <li>Keeping up with the Jones\u2019s</li> <li>Smooth equity curve\u2019s</li> <li>Concept of an Index</li> <li>Mutual fund industry</li> <li>10,000 hours</li> <li>Arbitrage</li> <li>High frequency trading</li> </ul>", "duration": "58:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/456.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1464919200, "title": "Ep. 455: Ryan Holiday Interview #4 with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel interviews Ryan Holiday. Today they discuss his new book, \u201cEgo is the Enemy.\u201d<br /> <br /> Ryan makes the case that ego is the worst factor that you can add into any situation. So many entrepreneurial ideas start out as crazy. However, when the idea works out after ignoring every critic or bit of sound evidence that it would not work, then that can create an ego that can easily get out of control. Ryan says, \u201cThis is how a person that builds an empire also destroys an empire.\u201d He uses General Sherman from the Civil War as an example of controlled success. His greatness came gradually and unexpected as opposed to a person like Napolean who thought they were set for greatness from the outset. Google is another example. It was started by two men who did not set out to conquer the internet but because they focused on events as they came, one at a time, greatness gradually happened.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael brings up one of Ryan\u2019s book chapters relating to being a student. He tells the story of Kirk Hammett, one of the greatest heavy metal guitarist of all time, being a student of Joe Satriani who is one of the most famous guitar virtuosos of all time. Hammett hired him when he was already on his way to being famous. Even with his success, he knew he still had plenty to learn from Satriani. Hammett was able to be humbled enough, even after being chosen as the new guitarist of Metallica, to hire someone who was an even better guitarist than him so he could continue to learn. Steve Jobs is another example that is brought up. Before he created the iPod and iPhone there were many other layers to his story. His story could have ended after he was fired and he could have become a cautionary tail for CEO\u2019s to learn from but instead he became an inspiring story that everyone can learn positives from.<br /> <br /> Michael and Ryan move into breaking apart the \u201c10,000 hour rule.\u201d Ryan says that it isn\u2019t a real number. It is egotistical to think that once you hit that 10,000th hour that you will gain your success at that moment. Outcome is one thing, but the process is something else. If we could learn everything from a book that would be great but some lessons can only be learned from painful experiences. It is a balance between learning from your own experiences and learning from others. Landing on the other side of fear, failure, success, and aspirations can be a great feeling. Ryan says that each person is constantly at one of those points in their life. It is ever changing, but the worst thing you can introduce into any of those phases is ego.<br /> <br /> Michael finishes the conversation asking Ryan if he thinks his message will translate to the younger \u201cmillennial\u201d generation. Ryan says that this is something he had thought a lot about while writing his book.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Letting other people win</li> <li>Being seen not heard</li> <li>Only the paranoid survive</li> <li>Dealing with failure</li> <li>Dealing with success</li> </ul>", "duration": "55:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/455.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1464573600, "title": "Ep. 454: Socialistic Paradise with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel starts the podcast off talking about President Obama and his recent visit to Asia.

Dan is author of \u201cNegotiating the Nonnegotiable.\u201d He demonstrates negotiation as a process and quantifiable. His work tries to articulate practical negotiation skills based on the most recent science. Dan\u2019s work started when he was working in eastern central Europe when countries were going from open, to closed societies. He wanted to help people deal with conflict more effectively especially the emotional side of it, and more specifically, dealing with identity. He looked at: Do relationships matter in negotiations? Do emotions matter? And how do you deal with them? He has spent the last 20 to 25 years learning how these intertwine. Dan\u2019s website sums up his work perfectly saying, \u201cDrawing on these experiences and his years of research at Harvard, he has developed a wealth of practical approaches to amplify influence and leadership\u2014in business, in government, and in life.\u201d<br /> <br /> Dan and Michael start off discussing, \u201cWhat gets us so stuck in emotionally charged conflicts?\u201d This is a question that drives Dan and his work. In the early 1990\u2019s Dan was working with refugee\u2019s in Yugoslavia hoping to promote good communication. He was doing a workshop in Serbia where he met a women who shared a personal story of tragedy that has stuck with him for the last 24 years. His work is a homage to help people who may feel hopeless, like there could not be any more room for negotiation. Michael says, \u201cWell aren\u2019t there some situations where negotiation is not even on the table and things are just going to play out?\u201d So often we get into ruts of feeling this way, thinking there is no possible way out, but more often than not there is always negotiations that can take place. There is always a way out.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael asks, \u201cDon\u2019t both people need to be willing to negotiate to enter a negotiation?\u201d The short answer is no. It only takes one side to move toward a resolution. Also, don\u2019t ever assume that both sides of a conflict need to be rational. The classic challenge within conflicts that he sees is \u201cHow do you deal with an irrational person?\u201d Everyone thinks that they are the rational ones and the opposite party is irrational.<br /> <br /> Michael and Dan move on to discuss BATNA. BATNA is an acronym for; Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. It is your \u201cwalkaway alternative\u201d. Most people walk away to a worst situation than they were in. You always need to think rationally and not emotionally about your alternative. Lastly, Dan gives an overview of what he calls the five lures of the tribal mind; vertigo, repetition compulsion, taboos, assault on the sacred and identity politics. Dan expands and gives examples of these lures. He says that these concepts are obvious and everyone has experienced them. He just puts words to these feelings that people have so people can identify and help work through them.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Negotiations</li> <li>Self awareness</li> <li>BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)</li> <li>Five lures of the tribal mind</li> </ul>", "duration": "52:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/453.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1463968800, "title": "Ep. 452: Engineering the Fundamentals with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel breaks apart Bill Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

They are the owners and founders of Tuft and Needle, a modern mattress company. They met during college at Penn state, parted ways after college and then met back up in Silicon Valley at a startup tech company.<br /> <br /> Two young men, who had never worked at a mattress store and were coming straight out of Silicon Valley, hardly fit the mold of mattress company tycoons. When they first started Tuft and Needle, the majority of questions they received all circled around how and why they came to enter the business of mattresses. The answer was quite simple; JT and Daehee started the company based on horrible personal experiences buying mattresses. After their experiences and talking about them together, the two sat down and wrote out all the painful things associated with shopping for a mattress and discussed how they could eliminate those experiences. They came to find out that their wasn\u2019t any \u201clove\u201d or brand loyalty associated with a mattress or the company. This was something they wanted to change.<br /> <br /> Since they started with zero mattress experience, Michael asks the obvious question, \u201cWhat was the first step you took once realizing you wanted to be in the mattress business?\u201d The first step was building up the list of negative experiences they had encountered with personally buying a mattress. Second step was trying to figure out, \u201cWhat is a mattress? What is the science involved? What are the root principles? And working backwards from that.\u201d They ripped open one of their own mattresses and figured out the components. After seeing the makeup of the mattress, they called around to manufacturers to figure out what it would cost to build.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael asks \u201cWhat kind of motivation did you have for disrupting the industry?\u201d JT and Daehee only figured out the kind of traction they could gain after about a year. They didn\u2019t know how big of an \u201cold boys club\u201d the mattress industry really was. However, their success has proved that there was definite need for disruption in the industry.

Neil is author of the New York Times best seller, \u201cThe Happiness Equation.\u201d He is also author of the popular blog, \u201c1,000 Awesome Things.\u201d Neil brings great insights on finding happiness and staying positive.<br /> <br /> Neil starts the podcast sharing how his success started. During his first years of gaining notoriety for teaching about happiness, he actually wasn\u2019t happy himself. He was going through a divorce, hardly sleeping, and still working a full time job at Wal-Mart management. His creative output was nothing. He ended up falling in love with a women and that ended up shifting his thinking. He went from observing awesome things, which he is probably most known for, to the application of integrating those awesome things into your life, such as \u201cHow do you live a happier life?\u201d \u201cThe Happiness Equation\u201d started as notes to Neil\u2019s unborn son. He essentially wanted to write down everything he wanted him to know about life.<br /> <br /> Neil details some of his techniques on how he starts writing a book. He is a huge believer of \u201cthe note card system.\u201d For a few years he carried note cards around and wrote down any thoughts or tidbits that he would see during the day that were interesting. This is a great example of placing action before motivation which is critical to reaching goals. Neil says that taking small steps is the key to success. Michael brings the conversation back to Neil\u2019s book and happiness. The first thing that pops up on Google search when you type in \u201chow to be\u201d is \u201chow to be happy.\u201d Everyone wants to be happy but they are struggling, searching, stressed, and looking for balance.<br /> <br /> The traditional way of thinking is, \u201cStudy hard, get good grades, and you will be happy.\u201d Neil says that you should flip that upside down and work on; being happy, then doing great work, and then you will have big success. All studies show that choosing to be happy above all other things leads to a better life. The healthiest societies in the world do not have retirement. Instead they focus on loving what they do throughout life. People need to have a challenge and a way to stimulate the mind and body. Retirement, for most, tends to put an abrupt halt to those things. Michael ends with taking quotes from Neil\u2019s book and having him elaborate.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Happiness</li> <li>Retirement is a lie</li> <li>Loving your work</li> <li>The lottery</li> <li>The note card system</li> <li>Criticism</li> <li>Goals are never ending</li> <li>Having less wants in life</li> </ul>", "duration": "46:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/449.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1462759200, "title": "Ep. 448: Mike Lofgren Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today, Michael Covel interviews Mike Lofgren. Mike\u2019s new book is titled, \u201cThe Deep State: The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government.\u201d We are in a world where everyone thinks their vote matters and that the next President will fix all of America\u2019s problems.<br /> <br /> Michael starts the podcast off reading an excerpt from Lofgren\u2019s new book. The two dig into expectations that people had for George W. Bush. As he failed, the people then voted in Barack Obama. Obama failed to meet people\u2019s expectations as well. Lofgren explains what he describes as a \u201cdeep state\u201d phenomenon.<br /> <br /> Next, Covel and Lofgren dig into: \u201cDoes our vote really matter?\u201d Lofgren says that whoever is elected President matters on the margin. The general vector of who gets what, what the general distribution of income is, and what our general foreign policy is, is going to be pretty much the same no matter who is elected. However, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are so far out of the box that they may change those norms because of how out of distribution the system has become. The public knows something is wrong. Trump and Sanders have, at the very least, shaken up the political structure regardless of if they win the election or not.<br /> <br /> Lofgren goes into economics and military next. He doesn\u2019t look at economics and military as separate entities. He sees all arms of government as intricately intertwined. When you see a change in the economics of the country, you can see just as large of a shift in the military and vice versa. Michael and Lofgren also discuss Dick Fuld and the Lehman Brother collapse.<br /> <br /> Michael moves on to ask, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t their more whistle blowers coming out of the government?\u201d Lofgren says that it is largely because people don\u2019t want to go to prison. More people are being charged with espionage in America than within any other government.

Ben is the Chief Risk Officer at Salient Partners and the author of \u201cEpsilon Theory.\u201d This is his second time on Trend Following Radio. He has an interesting way of looking at capital markets\u2013through the lens of game theory.<br /> <br /> Michael and Ben start the podcast off talking about buy and hold and why the strategy does so poorly. Ben moves on to break apart monetary policy and domestic politics and how they are intimately intertwined. When you have a world of massive debt, like we do today, then deleveraging naturally should take place. Instead, in today\u2019s world you have the ownership of that debt shifted from private entities taking responsibility of it, to the government.<br /> <br /> Central bank policies are always a direct reflection of the politics that are going on in the big four economies that drive the world; U.S., China, Europe, and Japan. The domestic political interactions going on in those countries are what you see in the world\u2019s economics. This leads to cooperation during economic crashes, for example, during the great recession. Countries inflate their economy to get out of economic crashes. Going to a lower or negative interest rate is a perfect way to devalue a countries currency. Right now, we are moving from a positive sum on trade, to a zero sum on trade and Ben says that the outcome is very predictable. He says that we have seen this movie before and it isn\u2019t hard to see how it is going to play out.<br /> <br /> Michael brings up Ray Dalio and asks the question, \u201cWhy are all these companies putting their money in one place, with one company and with the same model?\u201d Ben notes Ray Dalio\u2019s massive amount of money that he manages and what Bridgewater (his company) has created is an easy process that is implemented in an automated and quantitative system. The whole notion of having a rigorous process and managing clients money within that process is Bridgewater and Dalio\u2019s most widely spread influence.

People\nare taking paid versions of products and producing cheap and free\nversions. Josh points out that a year ago he was writing about\nscarcity, now its abundance. We use to have pop culture or a #1 hit\nTV show or hit band. Now there are 50 different sub cultures and\ngenres.<br />\n<br />\nBut abundance is killing us. Josh notes that it would be best if\nthere was a major flush of the system. Capital needs to be\nexchanged and shifted.

Parag is an international\nrelations expert, a CNN Global Contributor and Senior Research\nFellow at the National University of Singapore. He is also the\nManaging Partner of Hybrid Reality, a geostrategic advisory firm,\nand Co-Founder & CEO of Factotum. Parag\u2019s new book,\n\u201cConnectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization\u201d\nrecently came across Michael\u2019s desk. The concept of connectivity\ndoes not just relate to mobile phones and Skype. There is a very\nphysical and tangible evolution of connectivity that can be boiled\ndown into three categories; transportation, energies and\ncommunications.<br />\n<br />\nMichael and Parag start the podcast off touching on what\nconnectivity is and then dive into the relationship between cities\nand states. Parag says that there is not one single successful\nstate that is not built upon the stability of their successful\ncities. We have more mega and viable cities than states in the\nworld. Cities are the drivers of growth. More mayors are sitting\nheads of states or presidents nowadays than any other time in\nhistory and think of themselves as CEO\u2019s rather than\npoliticians.<br />\n<br />\nNext, Parag elaborates on supply chains. The diversity of products\navailable today is truly global. A product can have digital design\nfrom Silicon Valley, assembly in China, and a call center for\nproduct customer support in Vietnam. As a business, the combination\nof infrastructure investment and connecting through supply chains\nto global markets makes you a real player in the economy. Michael\nbrings up the economical impact that globalization has made, in\nparticular to taxes. Apple is working with Ireland to keep their\ninvestments outside the U.S. More and more companies are realizing\nthat they can operate over \u201cthe cloud.\u201d Markets are everywhere and\nsales are everywhere so investments should be able to be everywhere\nas well. American politicians have been counter productive in\ntrying to capture taxes from some of the biggest companies in\nAmerica.<br />\n<br />\nMichael brings the conversation back to China and their\ninfrastructure. China has made a global plan to help counties boost\ntheir infrastructure. They are spending their own money to help\ngain trust and also smooth the flow of goods in and out of\ndeveloping countries by building railways, airports and shipping\nports. Most of the world trade growth is happening across the\nIndian Ocean because of the Chinese.<br />\n<br />\nNext, Michael brings up country borders and the reservations\ncitizens may have about immigrants. No country has gained more from\naccepting immigrants into their society than America Parag argues.\nParag says that unfortunately people are acting more with their\nhearts rather than acting on the data. There are far more benefits\nto welcoming immigrants into societies as opposed to shutting them\nout. People talk about globalization doing us wrong. It is not. It\nis political governments that are failing. Policies in politics are\nthe problem.<br />\n<br />\nMichael and Parag finish up discussing the booming rise of Dubai,\nand how the city is a perfect example of infrastructure growing a\ncity. Dubai has thought strategically about all their expansion,\nfrom their roads to their buildings to their education system.

That is not how the best traders trade.<br /><br />For the remainder of the episode Michael leads with a presentation from Gregg Popovich, the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs basketball team. Gregg talks about organization, discipline, player relationships (between players and the coach and between players and players), and the importance of being comfortable enough in your own skin to take advice from others, among many other subjects. You can\u2019t begin to execute a trading rule until you have sound philosophical grounding. It starts with the right mentality and imagination, and Gregg is a perfect example of this.

Simon is an investor, entrepreneur and the founder of Sovereign Man. He has a travel perspective that has given him unique insights on freedom, making money, keeping as much of it as possible (and protecting it from the government whatever government that may be).<br /><br />Michael starts off the podcast asking Simon, \u201cI want to know your story. How did you go down this path? How did you start?\u201d Simon\u2019s journey started in the military. He went to West Point. Upon graduation he was commissioned as an Army intelligence officer and stationed in the Middle East around the time Bush was accusing Saddam Hussein of having weapons of mass destruction. As the U.S. was gearing up for war, it became abundantly clear that it was all a lie, and Simon realized that if the president would be willing to go to war over something that was so false, then what else would the government be willing to do?<br /><br />Simon breaks down the idea of currency. He says that everyone should have physical cash money. There are different forms of money or \u201clegal tender.\u201d One form of currency would be U.S. government bonds which are used by large entities. Another type of money is banking accounts. That is what most of us use. 90% of the money supply is in banking accounts, otherwise known as in digital form. Most people have their money in a computer stored in a windowless building somewhere. Physical cash is another form of money. It is the money you see in your had. Those are three very different forms of money, however they all happen to trade at a 1-1-1 exchange rate. That could change at any point. Simon urges that everyone should have physical money at their disposal in the case that banks shut down our ability to withdraw.<br /><br />Michael and Simon talk travel next. Modern transport technology has made travel simple and given people a unique opportunity to see different places and cultures. Simon makes the point that freedom is a state of mind, it isn\u2019t necessarily attached to travel. Every country has a unique vantage point such as great health care or education. Simon talks about health care in particular and the cost differences in the U.S compared to certain places in Asia.<br /><br />The thrust of today\u2019s podcast is to point out that everyone should be responsible for his or her own security and safety. One should be sovereign over his or her own life, experience freedom and live independently. Challenge the status quo. Think outside the box, whether that be choosing your healthcare, profession, or where you want to live.

Jesse is the host of Smart Drug Smarts, a podcast that is centered around supplements people can take to augment brain function. He has an out of the box perspective on health, fitness and enhancing cognitive performance.<br /><br />Michael and Jesse start the conversation off with the question, \u201cWhat is healthy?\u201d Some athletes that can perform amazing feats are actually destroying their bodies to get there, so are they really healthy? Mind and body can be at total odds when it comes to health. Jesse breaks open the idea of cognitive performance and where a good starting point is when trying to increase your performance. He says your brain is meant to do everything. It is a universal machine that does things that we are, and are not aware of. To improve performance of the brain, there are a variety of things one can do. He breaks it down into four categories: Mood, focus, creativity, and anxiety. Jesse goes in depth on different supplements you can take to improve your focus (in particular) such as increasing your dopamine.<br /><br />Jesse and Michael talk about how Jesse rode his bike from the west coast to the east coast in about 5 \u00bd weeks. Michael asks \u201cWhy do you think you are constantly experimenting?\u201d Jesse says there are a lot of things that you can\u2019t get the gist of without going through the experience. He wants to continue to understand, and maintain his brains capabilities to keep up with the evolving world.<br /><br />Jesse moves on to explaining what nootropic drugs are and the cognitive effects of them. He is not a doctor but has given himself an education over the last few years by immersing himself in these subjects and talking with field specialists such as doctors or pharmacists a couple times a week. Michael asks about jet lag and how to beat it with different techniques. Jesse says that one of the best ways to beat jet lag is by fasting until it is dinner time at your new destination.

Michael brings in basketball references from the Boston Celtics and their head coach Brad Stevens. He goes into the accomplishments of Stevens as a coach and as a quant. Stevens coaching is all about numbers and probabilities.<br /><br />Michael plays a clip from Chris Mannix of the Vertical Podcast with Brad Stevens. Stevens explains how he uses statistical analysis in his coaching and how the \u201cbest of the best\u201d like to be coached. Most don\u2019t care about a numbers to numbers speech but everybody wants to know how they can best play and attack situations. Michael circles the conversation back to trading markets and trading on the numbers. Mannix then asks Stevens if coaching is just coaching being on an NBA sideline as opposed to other sidelines? He says that the longer he has been a coach the more he has been able to take emotion out of the game and it has become a job. By the time a game nears the end he isn\u2019t even thinking of the game, he is thinking of the next practice, and how he can make the team better.<br /><br />Michael ends with reading interview questions that were asked to Stevens; \u201cIs your calm demeanor a part of your coaching philosophy?\u201d He says that his philosophy is doing 99% percent of the work behind the scenes and hopefully that is enough to prepare him for the next game. He is always thinking about the next play, therefore you will not see him doing cartwheels on the sidelines very often. Stevens is also asked, \u201cHow is the style of play at the professional level evolving?\u201d He says the game use to be about height and weight as opposed to skill.

Cole is the CEO of Longboard Asset Management and has appeared on the show many times. Cole and his business partner Eric Crittenden are featured in Michael\u2019s book, \u201cThe Little Book of Trading.\u201d Eric and Cole started their firm from the ground up. They pushed hard and now have hundreds of millions of dollars AUM.<br /><br />Michael and Cole start off talking about the recent volatility in the markets; crude oil in particular. Cole is a trend follower through and through. He says that there will always be fluctuations in the markets, but with the right tools and rules, you can ride those waves out successfully. He stresses that diversification is the only \u201cfree lunch\u201d that exists. His firm focuses on building multi asset portfolios that provide diversification. \u201cWhen you are in 130 markets around the world, you can\u2019t know all the fundamentals about those markets, the only thing you have to guide you is the price,\u201d says Cole. Focus on what those price trends are doing, positive or negative.<br /><br />Michael moves on to ask, \u201cDo you think of you and your firm as more offensive minded or defensive minded?\u201d Cole says they are definitely more defensive minded. Any successful trader or sports coach knows that you will ultimately get ahead and compound your success by making sure you cover you bases on the defensive. Having an unemotional approach to the markets is key. Cole then shows a unique differentiation between trend following managers in regards to their amount of AUM. The way a trend following firm trades it\u2019s money can vary greatly depending on how much AUM they have. The larger firms aren\u2019t able to move into some of the smaller markets where big money can be made.<br /><br />Cole speaks to the business thought process Longboard is built on, particularly what made him want to start his firm. He says there are three core components: Having a dream or vision about what you are doing, the people you surround yourself with to execute that dream, and the principles/operating rules of the game. When you get those three things to line up inside an organization you can create something magical. Michael asks how he has won people over and gotten them away from the \u201cbuy and hold\u201d mentality. Cole says the trend of alternative investments is starting to grow rapidly.

Any scam that takes place today, we have seen before. In the early 2000\u2019s Enron was at the height of its game. Turns out they had a fake trading floor set up just to convince Wall Street they were real. At Enron\u2019s peak, their company was trading at $90 a share. When it crashed, their stock traded around $0.50 a share. And that story brings us up to current day with the latest Enron.<br /><br />Michael continues to read more feedback, but this time from a listener of his podcast seguing him into the current blowup of the pharmaceutical company, Valeant. Valeant\u2019s share prices went from $250 to $30 in short order. Even as the stock was crashing people were buying the hype and false fundamental information. Michael reads from sources such as Jim Cramer, Morgan Stanley, and Valeant themselves. He then connects articles from Enron\u2019s press releases back in 2001 before their crash and press releases from Valeant in 2016. Quotes from both companies CEO\u2019s have strikingly similar comments on their companies as events led up to their falling apart.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are in a stock that goes from $250 to $30\u2026You screwed up. There is no reason for that except you. When the numbers say exit, you exit. Ego must be left out of your trading. Michael ends with excerpts by Steve Sjuggerud.

His new book is \u201cPeak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise.\u201d Starting around high school, Anders became interested in how he could best improve himself. When he got to college he studied how people could achieve above average performance. He did a study showing the number of digits average people could repeat back correctly. The average number was about 5-7 digits. After an hour of practice they were able to repeat about 20 digits correctly. With even more training one student was able to get 70 digits in a row. This showed Anders that the mind can improve with the right kind of practice. Performance is trainable and purposeful practice is key. One major component of successful practice is immediate feedback on whether you are accurate or not.<br /> <br /> Michael moves onto a study Anders did on taxi drivers in London. They have to go through extensive training to drive the streets of London. They are average people, but train for many years to be able to pass this taxi driving test. After learning over 10,000 streets and different connections there brains actually changed. He compared bus drivers in London, who did not have to go through the same training, to the taxi drivers. The same changes did not occur in bus drivers brains like the taxi drivers. They did not have to master all the streets but rather just master certain routes. Michael asks, \u201cIf they stop their taxi driving profession, does the brain regress?\u201d Anders says that yes, without practice your mind will revert back to the old state.<br /> <br /> Next, Michael and Anders use Mozart as an example of nature vs. nurture. His father was a musician and taught young children how to play instruments. Mozart was able to learn many of the musical distinctions that he was famed for because he started so early, around age 3-4. Any child at that age is able to learn the things Mozart learned, however it is virtually impossible as an adult. This moves into the idea of brain plasticity. It is important to realize that you can\u2019t push your child to learn longer than they want to learn for. About 30 minutes is their limit. Beyond that, they lose their capability for deliberate practice. Deliberate practice helps raise the bar and get you better than you were before.<br /> <br /> The next example of extraordinary talent brought up are master chess players. They don\u2019t look at pieces individually, but rather base their actions on pattern recognition. They see structure and see where attacks may be successful. Grandmaster chess players are able to play blindfolded and against 25 or so people simultaneously. These are skills that are acquired and practiced. Stephan Curry is also used as another great example of an extraordinary achiever. If you understand the practice an individual does then you can see their improvement over time. Michael asks, \u201cHas anyone said that their improvement was easy?\u201d Anders said that he has been studying this subject for over 30 years and about 50 people have said that improvement came easy, but after talking for a few hours, their answers change. Michael then asks about the validity of the idea that 10,000 hours makes you an expert. Anders says he hasn\u2019t seen that 10,000 hours is a magical number. You need a lot of practice, but there are no magical boundaries. When people count the number of hours that they have done something, and it happens to add up to 10,000 hours, then that doesn\u2019t make you an expert. For example, if you have driven 10,000 hours, that doesn\u2019t make you an expert.<br /> <br /> Lastly, Michael circles back to the importance of deliberate practice asking about the difference between youngsters and older people seeing the benefits of deliberate practice. Anders says that unfortunately most younger people that are so focused as a child in their performance don\u2019t go on to have careers in the field they were pushed into. Those who chose and want to be in the sport they are in usually go on to continued success. Deliberate practice alone doesn\u2019t make you successful. You need to have a sincere desire for what you are doing.</p> <p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Discipline and practice</li> <li>Solo and group practice</li> <li>Flow state</li> <li>Social Motivation</li> <li>The late birthday rule</li> <li>10,000 hours of practice</li> <li>Nature vs. nurture</li> <li>Brain plasticity</li> </ul>", "duration": "01:24:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/437.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1459130400, "title": "Ep. 436: Tom Bilyeu Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel interviews Tom Bilyeu. Tom is the co-founder and president of Quest Nutrition. He is the consummate entrepreneur who went from running a successful tech company to starting all over and developing Quest Nutrition. He has created his own narrative for entrepreneurial greatness.<br /><br />Tom started out as what he would describe as a \u201cgood employee,\u201d with never questioning the system. He didn\u2019t take high school seriously but when he started college he buckled down. He heard that the brain doesn\u2019t stop developing until the age of 25 and that helped shape a large part of his 20\u2019s. Watching \u2018The Matrix\u201d at age 22, he realize that he wanted to be in control of his own life. Around age 26 he met his business partners with whom he would start his first company.<br /><br />In 2012 his tech company was named the 42nd fastest growing tech company in North America. Soon after that, he had a talk with his partners letting them know he wasn\u2019t happy, wasn\u2019t having fun anymore, and wanted out. His partners felt the same way, and they proceeded to sell their company at the height of their success. Quest Nutrition came out of the folding of their prior company. They chose to go into the nutrition business by asking themselves \u201cHow can we deliver value to people.\u201d Tom and his partners were told over and over again by factories that they were not able to produce the product they wanted to make, and the factories were right. They ended up buying their own equipment and re-engineering it to produce a nutrition bar unlike any other on the market.<br /><br />Tom says that the combination of unbelievably good tasting food coupled with horrific ingredients makes for the worst kind of drug. Sugar affects the brain just like dopamine. Evolution has instilled a need for sugar in our brains and has brought us where we are now. Tom spent a long time learning about, from a metabolic state, what is nutritious for your body. The \u201cauto pilot thought process\u201d is one thing that Tom really works with people on. He works with people to focus on what their subconscious is telling them to do, and decipher what is right from wrong.<br /><br />Michael asks Tom to go into international regulations. He says that dealing with all the different regulations can make a person go crazy. He doesn\u2019t think that we should legislate sugar or saturated fat out of people\u2019s diets. People should be able to have free choice. Tom\u2019s life has been based on mastering one baby step after another and accomplishing everything with discipline and practice. Whether you are trying to get better in leadership, finance, or in relationships, everything is a learning experience. The more you attack something the more it continues to get better.<br /><br />Lastly, Tom talks about letting go of the need to be right. He got to a point where he built his self esteem around being right. He soon realized that, that was actually helping him move further away from his goals. He switched his belief system over to focusing on identifying the right answer faster than anyone. There are so many that just want to protect their ego with being right, but as soon as they learn to let that go, a whole world opens up.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discipline and practice</li>\n<li>The Quest belief system</li>\n<li>Escaping the Matrix</li>\n<li>Tom Bilyeu\u2019s ultimate reading list</li>\n<li>Being authentic</li>\n<li>Obesity</li>\n<li>Autopilot thought process</li>\n<li>Letting go of being right</li>\n<li>Reaching your true fans</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "50:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/436.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1458871200, "title": "Ep. 435: Steven Pinker Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel interviews Steven Pinker. Steven is a Canadian-born American cognitive scientist, psychologist, linguist, and popular science author. He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, and is known for his advocacy of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind. He covers phenomena that have traditionally not been looked at scientifically such as: visual perception, war and peace, and differences in writing styles. He has authored numerous books with his most recent being, \u201cThe Sense of Style.\u201d<br /><br />Steven knew he was an atheist from the age of 13. He never had a big revelation because God was never a real part of his consciousness. However, his religious awareness as a young man helped to guide his career into using science, and science only in his research. He puts science as the decider of \u201cwhat is.\u201d<br /><br />Michael asks, \u201cHow has human behavior been shaped by evolution.\u201d Steven based his book, \u201cThe Blank Slate\u201d around the idea that humans aren\u2019t born with a blank slate. He says that to have the ability to analyze speech and comprehend speech you have to have something there at birth. If the mind has a built in structure, where did it come from? Steven argues it comes from evolution and natural selection. He uses a combination of cognitive science and evolutionary psychology to back up his theories. He also covers why there has been so much controversy surrounding the idea that we are not born with a blank slate and why our common sense so often clashes with our political conviction. One reason he offers is because many think the idea of equality means that we should be indistinguishable, essentially like clones. He argues that fairness should not be based on sameness.<br /><br />Michael goes back to the blank slate concept and asks, \u201cAre we born good or bad? And explain what you have learned throughout your career about the evolution of language.\u201d Steven says we have some good and some bad. The brain is massively complex and layered. There is so much going on in the brain when someone speaks and when someone listens and retains the information. Eggs and sperm have about 70 mutations. That is how we have natural selection that makes someone run faster, see better, think faster, etc.<br /><br />Next, Michael and Steven dive into the history of violence, where it came from and where we stand today. Steven says you can\u2019t get an accurate view of violence from the news. They find the worst violence and promote it. The rate of homicides have plummeted over the years. There are far less wars going on now than in the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and so on. Since the end of WWII there has been a steady decline. Civil wars have still occurred but they are far less plentiful than they use to be and death rates are also less than they use to be. Steven\u2019s next book, due to be published in 2017, is a defense of science, reason and humanism as a source of aiding in morality.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evolution</li>\n<li>Natural selection</li>\n<li>War statistics</li>\n<li>Cognitive science</li>\n<li>Evolutionary psychology</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "42:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/435.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1458525600, "title": "Ep. 434: Myanmar Expedition with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel brings a different perspective to countries and cultures. He starts off reading an article by Simon Black, \u201cVi\u1ec7t Nam will become one of the top expat destinations in the world.\u201d Due to China\u2019s growth in the last 10 years they can\u2019t compete making cheap goods like they have in the past.

They are making it easier for locals to earn more money and thrive. Things began changing in the late 1980\u2019s when the communist government opened up and encouraged private business.<br /><br />Michael moves on to talk about his recent trip to Myanmar (formerly Burma). It was colonized by the British, but in 1948 Myanmar declared their independence. Their borders were closed off for about 50 years after that. Around 2011 they opened the borders to foreigners again, and in 2015 they held their first elections. There are 50 million people currently living in Myanmar. Now, there is a buzz about the country that shows they are clearly moving forward. The ethnic diversity is immediately apparent, and the hustle for commerce is everywhere. People there are beautiful, friendly and energized. The lessons for all of us are there staring back at us.<br /><br />Michael encourages everyone listening to get on a plane and go. Go travel.

Catherine is author of, \u201cHypnotrading: A practical guide to using hypnosis and NLP to improve your trading performance: Self-hypnosis and psychotherapeutic techniques for traders.\u201d Catherine believes that hypnotherapy and neuro-lingustic programing can help traders defeat inner challenges and become more successful. She got started working with traders after helping a friend, who happened to be a trader. He helped her understand the world of trading a bit more throughout their sessions and this ignited her interest deeper. She has been helping traders for years but didn\u2019t start HypnoTrading until 2014.<br /><br />Catherine was working as a psychologist when a friend referred her to see a hypnotherapist. She started to see the hypnotherapist for stress relief in her work and personal life. She was intrigued by the therapy so much that she switched career paths and sought training as a hypnotherapist. Hypnosis is essentially being in a deeply relaxed state of mind. It is an open state of consciousness, but you are fully in control of your thoughts. The first time Catherine experienced hypnosis she found it incredibly relaxing, and thought \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened, why haven\u2019t I done this before?\u201d Catherine dives deeper in the different steps she goes through in her sessions to get people in that relaxed state.<br /><br />When Catherine trained as a hypnotherapist, part of the training was in NLP. Hypnotherapy and NLP are two different practices buy when used together they can be very powerful. An example of using the two fields together would be to associate pain with a color or a shape. It gives the client a way to view pain in a tangible way. They are able to think about that pain as an object that can be picked up and taken out of their body.<br /><br />Michael moves on to asking, \u201cHow do different trading styles play into how you treat patients?\u201d Catherine explains that there are certain universal techniques in hypnotherapy. When it comes to traders, the goal is to find the right trading style that works for them. There are many methods of trading and people should find the one that fits their personality. For example, some people are not built to use a strategy with precise rules and vice versa, some are not cut out for the fast pace of day trading.<br /><br />Lastly, Michael and Catherine dive into the idea of modeling and goal setting. Modeling is a process of looking at other people and what they do, and essentially modeling that. One way to change yourself for the better is to mimic others who are successful in the field you are trying to master. It is a way of seeing what your results will look like. Modeling helps refocus. The majority of people may not have the chance to get next to a great trader, but everybody can get close to those insights through the written word or videos online. Find people that reflect your values and the style of trading that you want to achieve. There are thousands of trading books out there; you need to weed out what will work for you. Break down what you want to achieve and how you are going to achieve it. Defining your goals and how you want to achieve them is key.<br /><br /><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stress vs. anxiety</li>\n<li>Meditation vs. hypnosis</li>\n<li>Being in a relaxed state</li>\n<li>Negative self talk</li>\n<li>Fear of success</li>\n<li>Modeling</li>\n<li>P-A-C-E-R</li>\n<li>Luck and expectation</li>\n<li>Defining goal setting</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "45:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/433.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1457920800, "title": "Ep. 432: Powerball Manipulation with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel talks about shaking up the establishment, referring to Trump and the presidential race. He sees hope that the political establishment could take a hit and just maybe a dent in the political health of America could happen. He isn\u2019t saying that he would get great legislation through, or solve world peace, but he might shake up the political arena and detour the agendas of some special interest groups.<br /><br />Next, Michael leads into discussion of the lottery, banks, and government. The lottery has become one of the biggest cons by government directed at the lower to middle class. They have convinced people that playing the lottery is a form of investing for their retirement. Michael plays a clip from the Virginia state lottery. They found a Jim Cramer look alike to get people to think of investing as they talk about playing the lottery and saving for the future.<br /><br />Michael moves into reading an article by Barry Ritholtz that was written in January of 2016 when the Powerball prize was around 1.5 billion dollars. He makes the point that Americans spend 70 billion dollars a year on the lottery which is more than they spent on sports tickets, books, video games, movie tickets, and music plus all types of apps, games and programs bought from Apple\u2019s iTunes app store combined last year. Barry then asks the question, \u201cIs investing gambling?\u201d His short answer, \u201cYour goal as an investor should be to eliminate as much of the element of chance from your process and like the house, stack the odds in your favor\u2026 How do you become the house? You understand the nature of risk, are comfortable with the idea of uncertainty, rely on long-term measures of valuation, use mean reversion as a guideline to unknown future outcomes, allow time to work in your favor, understand the impact of leverage, recognize the folly of relying on forecasts, consider all possible outcomes; including extremely rare black-swan events, and accept that some losses are inevitable.\u201d Above all, he makes the point that even though you have full control over how you invest, you do not have complete control over the outcome.<br /><br />Michael ends with the nonsensical idea of government achievement. He says that we need someone who leads by example rather than telling us what the next government hand out will be.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trump as President</li>\n<li>Lottery and Powerball</li>\n<li>Changing American politics</li>\n<li>Getting something for nothing</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "28:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/432.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1457665200, "title": "Ep. 431: Bill Bonner Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel interviews Bill Bonner. Bill is author of \u201cHormegeddon: How Too Much Of A Good Thing Leads To Disaster.\u201d He has made a career out of skepticism. That skepticism started right out of college as he helped a friend start a grassroots organization, The National Tax Payers Union. There, he was able to get an inside look at government. It was during his lobbying for this grassroots organization that he saw the true motivations of politicians.<br /><br />Bill and Michael start the conversation off talking about having too much of something, good or bad. Everything in the world, when you get too much of it, it is bad. Bill uses Germany as an example: When Hitler first got into power, his message to the people was more security. As Hitler kept gaining more power, the government took more control and things began to fall apart rapidly from there.<br /><br />Next they talk about negative interest rates. There is a social contract being broken by the use of negative interest rates. Bill says the whole idea of work leading to output, leading to money, leading to investment, which leads to further output all falls apart with negative interest rates. Negative interest rates don\u2019t stimulate the economy, they actually lead to people hunkering down and saving more money. This segues into the next topic of myth and reality. Myth plays a large part in society. Our conception of government is based on myth, and our idea of how government operates is far different than the reality of how it is actually run.<br /><br />Michael and Bill move into discussing how internet has connected people and put information at everyone\u2019s fingertips. However, it has proven too difficult for people to sift through all the information and find the wisdom inside it rather than the noise. Bill brings up a poll that was done by the National Constitution Center. The poll said that 41% of Americans are not aware that there are three branches of government. 62% of them cannot name what the three branches of government are, and 33% of them cannot name a single one of the branches. Americans can\u2019t be shocked that a government doesn\u2019t work the way it \u201cshould\u201d work when they don\u2019t even know how it \u201cshould\u201d work in the first place.<br /><br />Lastly, Michael and Bill talk about prediction and crashes. Since 1970 there has been seven recessions. Economists were able to predict none of them. Even in early 2008 when everything was crashing, not a single economist thought we were heading into a recession. This just shows how little the government basis their studies on facts but rather on human judgement. Bill says that unemployment is a great example. Unemployment rates aren\u2019t subject to scientific analysis, they are subject to human analysis. The GDP growth rate is made up of the same kind of fictitious numbers and based on human judgment. It is more a measure of how quick people are going into debt not if they are better off in life.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Declining marginal utility</li>\n<li>Unemployment</li>\n<li>Negative interest rates</li>\n<li>Myth vs. Reality</li>\n<li>Government polling</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "53:29", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/431.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1457319600, "title": "Ep. 430: The Mob Rules with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Michael Covel starts the discussion off with Mark Zuckerberg and the virtual reality realm we are entering. There is now an infamous picture of Mark Zuckerberg walking down an aisle with a huge audience behind him hooked up to helmets. All audience members are in a virtual reality. Michael bridges the gap between speculative follies of the past, with the virtual reality bubble we are about to embark on.<br /><br />David Harding and James Holmes wrote a book titled, \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum: A Menagerie of Speculative Follies.\u201d Michael reads an excerpt from the book, giving a historical narrative about how people have behaved over the centuries. People always get excited about something new, and that \u201csomething new\u201d historically always seems to crater and crash. The chapter Michael reads from is titled \u201cBasking in an Indian Summer: The Bombay Share Mania of 1865.\u201d The excerpt relates to cotton exports during the American Civil War. Bombay saw massive profits in cotton and silver due to cotton exports being halted in America during the war. Due to the boom in the economy Bombay saw huge expansion in their commercial sectors. Investors were only focused on the short term rather than long term.<br /><br />When the American Civil War ended the Indian economy hit depression. Banks went bankrupt and the housing market crashed. The Bombay commercial world went totally bust. This is only one of many speculative examples that are in \u201cThe Pit and The Pendulum.\u201d History always repeats itself. All speculative follies go down the same path.

Jim is a famed American investor based in Singapore. He was co-founder of the Quantum Fund, and has authored numerous books. Today\u2019s conversation is geared toward the central banking system and the direction Michael and Jim think the world\u2019s economy is headed.<br /><br />Michael starts the podcast off talking about negative interest rates and if that is a possibility in the U.S. Jim brings up a study published in 2007 that said, \u201cWe have the Federal Reserve, we have 1,000 of the most brilliant economists in the world how can we be wrong? How can people say that we are wrong?\u201d Jim says that for the last 30 years the Fed has done just that. They have gotten just about everything wrong. Janet Yellen has been getting everything wrong since before she was even head of the Fed. She blames her blunders on the market being wrong or the public being wrong. According to Jim, every head of the Fed has been an academic and political hack.<br /><br />Michael posits, \u201cEveryone should be able to imagine another stock crash, we have had enough of them.\u201d Jim says that the debt is staggering right now so when we have a crash it is going to be utter chaos. When we have extreme economic problems a war usually follows as well as someone coming in on a white horse to save the day. That white horse person will also cause more debt and make things even worse. This is the first time in history that government is actually out to destroy the people who have saved and set away for retirement. The middle and saving class has been destroyed before, but that was because of war or inflation. Jim says that it is mind boggling that the government\u2019s solution to clearing up debt is to create more debt.<br /><br />Next, Michael asks, \u201cHow do you see China right now?\u201d Jim says that when they had their big market crash they chose to invest in the future with money they had saved. In America, we did the opposite. We chose to bail out the bureaucrats and make sure the rich didn\u2019t go poor. The European and Japanese central banks have come out saying that they will practice unlimited QE funding. They will print unlimited amounts of money to solve their economic problems. Most do not question this because most people have no idea who or want the central bank is.<br /><br />Lastly, Michael asks Jim what the best way is to prepare for potential problems that may unfold in the future. Jim says the first thing is to not listen to the news or what you may read on the internet.

He starts off sharing a recent email received. The email suggested Michael tone down the trend following talk and work with people to help find their calling in life. This email dovetails into an excerpt Michael plays of high school football coach, Kevin Kelley.<br /><br />Coach Kelley is a contrarian thinking football coach. He is known for never punting and onside kicks after every touchdown. Coach Kelley ran the numbers and figured out the probability of winning with punting as opposed to going for it. He has had tremendous success from doing things differently and creating his own answers on the field.<br /><br />Next Michael reads an article from Andy Staples, \u201cThe power of not punting: Why a college coach should adopt Kevin Kelley\u2019s unconventional philosophy.\u201d Andy Staples, a writer for Sports Illustrated, was curious about Coach Kelly and his unconventional coaching, so he visited one of Coach Kelley\u2019s games. During that game, Coach Kelley had to give in and punt on one of his fourth downs. Andy asked, \u201cHow hard was it for you to do that?\u201d Coach Kelley replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t really hate it at all. It is what it is if the situation dictates it is something that we have to do. It\u2019s all about winning. It\u2019s never been about anything else.\u201d Coach Kelley\u2019s players don\u2019t win because they never punt and always onside kick, they win because the offense plays as if they are always going to lose. He turns the psychological tables on his opponents, and bases everything off of mathematical statistics. The math indicates that punting is actually the riskier choice.<br /><br />Michael stresses that no matter how much fundamental information you think you may have, you are lying to yourself. The only thing that you can rely on in the markets is the price data. The only way to get ahead is to be a contrarian. Michael ends paraphrasing Ed Seykota, \u201cEveryone gets what they want, win or lose. If you lose a lot you got exactly what you wanted, to lose.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Math in football</li>\n<li>Thinking like a contrarian</li>\n<li>Risk management</li>\n<li>Fundamentals</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "34:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/428.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1456455600, "title": "Ep. 427: Michael Ellsberg Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Michael Ellsberg. Michael is an American author, blogger and public speaker. Michael Covel and Michael Ellsberg met for the first time in Napa Valley at a Tim Ferris conference. Today they talk about Michael\u2019s newest work, \u201cThe Last Safe Investment: Spending Now to Increase Your True Wealth Forever.\u201d The book is about making money, being an entrepreneur, and giving insights that can applied today.<br /><br />The two start off talking about entrepreneurism and dive deep into how people think about money. Michael, and his co-author Bryan Franklin, wanted to completely rewrite the script for how people think about making and spending money. Michael says the bottom line is to try and make your life as awesome as possible in every aspect. Most people want money for one reason or another. He has found that the three most popular reasons people want money is: happiness, freedom, and security. Michael always wanted to be a writer growing up. He used his savings to help pay his way to become a writer. Most save their money and figure that what they love can come later when they have enough saved up. The question is, \u201cWhen do you want to start your passion?\u201d When you retire? Or do you want to invest in those things you are passionate about now?<br /><br />Michael E. then goes into how important the presence of meaningful friends are, otherwise known as your \u201ctribe.\u201d He says that it is important to travel and figure out where you want to settle down and live. When you nail that down you can start investing in learning about the place, people that live there and invest your time in making friends. Traveling and learning where you want to settle down has a lot to do with gaining critical self knowledge which, according to Michael E., is the greatest investment a person could make. When you are self aware you get far more happiness out of the money and time you invest in things. You aren\u2019t wasting as much time and money experimenting, trying to figure out what you like.<br /><br />Next, Michael E. answers the question, \u201cWhat is the difference between a market skill and a super skill?\u201d A market skill is any skill that you can sell directly, such as plumbing or marketing. Super skills are skills that can be taken across any job platform and are essential in any marketplace regardless of economic circumstances. Michael E. categorizes them into four categories: interpersonal, creative, technical and physical super skills. Different skills have different levels of entry. Public speaking is one super skill that they go into depth about. Michael E. says that if you learn how to speak publicly even semi well, you will be far above the rest of your competition.<br /><br />One of the last topics discussed are the areas in your life that create happiness. Relationships, health and money are the three big contributors to happiness. Each time you spend money you should look at how that purchase will impact every area in your life. If you go to buy a meal you should look at how that will affect your health and if that bleeds into happiness in your relationships. Michael has found that all of these things are interconnected. When you look at things as a whole, spending money can be looked at as investing rather than spending frivolously.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super skill vs. Market skill</li>\n<li>Systemic spending</li>\n<li>Cultivating meaningful relationships</li>\n<li>Thinking three dimensional</li>\n<li>Creating happiness in your life</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "01:00:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/427.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1456110000, "title": "Ep. 426: Vineer Bhansali Interview #2 with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel speaks with Vineer Bhansali. It is Vineer\u2019s second appearance on the show. He brings a world of experience to the subjects of behavioral finance and tail investing strategies. He believes strongly that sustained portfolio performance comes from expecting the unexpected and hedging both left and right sides of tail risks. Vineer\u2019s firm, Long Tail Alpha, is based on exploiting values from the tails of the probability distribution and also exploiting how human behavior distorts the markets.<br /><br />Michael starts the podcast off breaking apart Vineer\u2019s white paper, \u201cA Behavioral Perspective on Tail Risk Hedging.\u201d Vineer says the way markets actually trade have very little to do with the idealized models that have been presented in the academic community. Those models are presented because they are easy to solve. All interesting things that go on in the markets are beyond the idealized scenarios. Vineer talks Michael through the idea of the \u201cThree Investors.\u201d His study is based on how people account for gains and losses. The study concluded that people are more adverse to losses than they are to gains, also people like security. Next, Vineer speaks to work done by Kahneman and Tversky that dovetails into his own studies. This work allows him to rationally explain the existence of tails in terms of very persistent behavioral biases.<br /><br />Michael and Vineer comment on oil and how significant the price of oil has been in the last few years. Where does the behavioral aspects come into play? He says that both kinds of investors, rational and irrational, create market dynamics. He gives an example of a gambler that leaves the casino while he is up a lot, as opposed to the gambler that is down and keeps gambling trying to get it back. \u201cYou have people in this commodity market casino who are going in with a certain plan, but they can not execute on that plan.\u201d He goes on to say that people who have a trend following plan are going to do very well. They can go short or long. Their portfolio\u2019s tend to be more dynamic, and unless you know a whole portfolio you cannot make a rational decision. Michael says aggregation is the key word. You can\u2019t look at a price for a hedge in isolation. That doesn\u2019t do anything for anyone.<br /><br />Michael then asks \u201cWhat about the timing in Tail Risk?\u201d Vineer says you have to be very open minded in how you construct a portfolio, and the timing relates back to the valuation. These concepts are well known in the finance world, they are just not widely practiced. Tail risk, hedging or insurance is what investing is all about. Michael ends with asking, \u201cWe all know everything we know about Oil, China and Rates could go in another direction. What will happen if your thesis doesn\u2019t materialize? If things bounce back to the way they were?\u201d Vineer says that at some point markets overshoot and his firm is set up for when that happens. He is always asking himself, \u201cWhere is the valuation? What signals are you getting? What objective framework and model can you build?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is trend following mean reverting?</li>\n<li>Tail risks</li>\n<li>Tail hedges</li>\n<li>Human behavior and biases</li>\n<li>Importance of a dynamic portfolio</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "41:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/426.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1455850800, "title": "Ep. 425: Philip Tetlock Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Philip Tetlock. Phil is a Canadian American political science writer currently at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is right at the intersection of psychology, political science and organizational behavior. His book, \u201cSuperforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction,\u201d is about probabilistic thinking defined. Phil is also a co-principle investigator of The Good Judgment Project, a study on the art and science of prediction and forecasting.<br /><br />Michael starts off asking, \u201cRegular folks can beat the experts at their own game?\u201d Phil says essentially that is correct. He started The Good Judgment Project in 2011. It was based around forecasting and was funded by the government. He was shocked by the amount of \u201cregular\u201d people he recruited for his study that were able to compete with, or do a better job predicting than professionals working for agencies such as the NSA.<br /><br />Michael and Phil move onto discussing the Iraq war. They discuss what the actual probability may have been of Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction. George Bush claimed that it was a \u201cslam dunk\u201d when clearly there was not a 100% probability of weapons of mass destruction being there. Michael asks, \u201cWhen is society going to adopt more of a probability mindset?\u201d Phil says that soft subjective human judgment is going by the way side. Pundits saying, \u201cSomeday this will happen\u201d without any real substance, will come to a stop. As long as a forecaster can say, \u201cThis may happen in the future\u201d then they can never really be held accountable for being wrong. Michael brings up the example of Robert Rubin. Robert worked for Goldman Sachs and was under Bill Clinton during his presidency. He was a great probabilistic thinker. Everyone loved him until the 2008 crash. Phil uses him as an example of even the best prediction people getting it wrong.<br /><br />Bottom line, superforecasters look for aggregated data. They know there is interesting data laying around and they tend to look at crowd indicators heavily. The distinction between superforecasters and regular forecasters is their ability to start with the outside view and move to the inside slowly. Regular forecasters start with the inside view and rarely look at the outside view. Superforecasters also believe in fate less than regular forecasters do. When you highlight all the low probability events surrounding outcomes, such as the lottery, many chose to think the event was decided by \u201cfate\u201d or just \u201cmeant to be.\u201d Superforecasters think in a way of \u201cwell someone had to win, and they did.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are superforecasters?</li>\n<li>Probabilistic thinking</li>\n<li>Looking at aggregate data</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "44:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/425.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1455505200, "title": "Ep. 424: The Wizard Jeremy Siegel Filleted on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel profiles Jeremy Siegel.

The first clip has Jeremy outlining his predictions in early November 2015: The Dow will surpass 20,000, oil can\u2019t go much lower, and the dollar can\u2019t go much higher. His predictions are perfect examples of predictions without any substance. They have no timelines, or data to backup why he feels the way he does.<br /><br />Excerpt #2 was filmed around December 13th. The Dow at that time was at 17,300. The S&amp;P was at 2020. Jeremy moves right into more predictions and generalizations. He doesn\u2019t say \u201cbuy at this time\u201d and \u201csell at this time.\u201d Jeremy proceeds to use words like \u201ctremor\u201d and \u201crelief rally.\u201d It is hard to have wrong predictions and forecasts when you use words that have generalized meaning.<br /><br />Excerpt #3 is from February 8th, 2016. Jeremy had to back peddle because his November and December forecasts had not come to fruition. He admits to being too bullish\u2026sort of. He blames his wrong predictions on the market not doing what the market was suppose to do. Michael weaves in his commentary throughout the clips.

Angus is a British American economist. In 2015 he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize for his work in economic sciences on his analysis on consumption, poverty and welfare. Those topics go into one of the most hotly discussed issues in America right now, inequality. He brings some great data driven insights and angles to the discussion.<br /><br />Michael starts the podcast off discussing the benefits of winning a Nobel Prize and how it opens up debate and reshapes topics. Angus agrees that the Nobel Prize does get conversations going and as an academic, it allows him able to reach a broader audience. Michael and Angus move right into discussing inequality. Angus says that in periods where there has been the most innovation, this is typically when there is the most inequality. Angus also quotes a famed economist saying, \u201cData is like meatballs. I won\u2019t eat them when I\u2019m out because I don\u2019t know what is in them and I won\u2019t eat them when I\u2019m home because I do know what is in them.\u201d When going through data from places like India, where about 1/3 of all global poverty resides, it is hard to tell whether the data is correct. For example, although there is a rapid rate of growth, the poverty level has not raised. Are poverty levels not moving because the aid money is going straight to the 1% or is it because the data is not correct? Angus says the data is easily skewed so it is hard to really get a read on what is going on.<br /><br />Next, Michael and Angus discuss how arbitrary the idea of \u201cthe poverty line\u201d is. It is hard to classify what poverty truly is. Angus likes to look at the subject as if everybody is poor, but some are just much poorer than others. Measuring poverty across time and place is an impossible thing to do. Poverty data can be skewed by various factors such as if the area being studied has government healthcare or public school systems. Michael brings up the emotional side of poverty next. Angus says that it is very possible to be happy and sad at the same time. Emotion isn\u2019t cut and dry. He has found that not having enough money does have a large impact on your happiness. However, most day-to-day emotional happiness comes from having contact with other people and friends, not money. Money starts to affect your day-to-day interactions if you are so poor that you are not able to do certain things that allow you to spend time with friends and family.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unemployment</li>\n<li>Minimum Wage</li>\n<li>Poverty</li>\n<li>Economics</li>\n<li>Money and happiness</li>\n<li>The birth lottery</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "43:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/423.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1454900400, "title": "Ep. 422: The Pay People Deserve with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel starts off giving listeners perspective on the feedback he receives. Over the years Michael has received thousands of emails that have created insightful and thought provoking give and take discussions. He reads an email that came in recently on a fairly controversial topic. The listener talked about his disagreement with Yaron Brook in episode 183. He disagreed on the shared viewpoint between Yaron and Michael. The listener\u2019s email also touches on unemployment, minimum wage, and government regulations. The email was extensive and Michael gives his feedback as he makes his way through reading it.<br /><br />Michael furthers the discussion by moving into reading from an article titled, \u201cThe Case Against the Minimum Wage\u201d by Daniel Bier. Daniel says that there is much we may not agree on, but when there are topics that economic professionals do agree on, we should take notice. Economists across the board agree that by raising the minimum wage we will actually increase unemployment. The article\u2019s main premise is that the core value a young person gets from their first job is the life experience rather than the monetary gain. Working with a team, punctuality, and taking direction are just a few fundamental skills that can be taken away from a minimum wage job. These jobs create a track record for an individual that lets them move on to other higher paying jobs.<br /><br />So many people miss the point: It isn\u2019t about the money, it\u2019s about the experience. Having exposure to minimum wage jobs at a early age has long term effects. Daniel Bier says that it is actually more about politicians trying to feel good than actually doing good. Michael finishes with a quote from Nobel laureate James Buchanan further touching on the ramifications of raising minimum wage.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unemployment</li>\n<li>Minimum Wage</li>\n<li>Ayn Rand</li>\n<li>American economics</li>\n<li>The seen and unseen consequences of a law</li>\n<li>Libertarianism</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "29:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/422.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1454641200, "title": "Ep. 421: Steve Kamb Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel speaks with Steve Kamb.

He gives great insight on how to reach a specific audience and gain a loyal following. He knew he was horribly mismatched in his career and had to make a drastic change. Not wasting much time, Steve moved to Atlanta and took a job making half the money and loved it. It was at this job where he started getting into fitness and creating a website to help others. His company, Nerd Fitness, soon turned into a full time job.<br /><br />Michael starts the podcast asking, \u201cWhat is your definition of a nerd?\u201d Steve quotes Wil Wheaton, \u201cA nerd is not what you love but how you love it.\u201d He elaborates saying that you could be a comic book nerd, medical school nerd, Star Wars nerd, etc. Steve\u2019s outlook on fitness is about keeping a healthy lifestyle while keeping your other passions alive. It took Steve years to get his fitness regime down. He knew there had to be more people that were struggling to find the right information when it came to fitness. Steve started writing about sound strategies to build solid plans to get on the right fitness path. He uses movie and comic book references to help get his clients motivated and relate more to what he is teaching.<br /><br />Steve also started looking at his life, and his clients lives as if they were on their own \u201chero\u2019s journey.\u201d He calls it the \u201chero\u2019s call to action.\u201d This journey is cyclical. You go out and come back and it is never ending. He shares stories of superhero\u2019s like Clark Kent/Superman or Indiana Joans/archeology professor. Regular men that go out time and time again on their hero\u2019s journey, only to return back to reality after accomplishing what they set out to do. His book, \u201cLevel Up Your Life,\u201d is about re-framing ones life in a hero\u2019s journey type of way. Strength training, yoga, live action role playing, etc. could all be things that motivate you to get off the couch and start your own hero\u2019s journey.<br /><br />Michael and Steve finish up sharing tips on how to travel smarter.

Michael starts off reading from an article titled \u201cTwo Americas.\u201d The article focuses on people who contribute, and those who do not. People who work and those who do not. The article disagrees with the notion that all incomes should be equal. Different choices lead to different consequences. Those who choose wisely have a greater degree of success and should not have their success taken from them because others chose unwisely. The article goes on to say, \u201cEntitlement has replaced effort in American society.\u201d Just because you went to college doesn\u2019t mean you are entitled to a certain level of income. On the other hand, those that do not have an education or work hard to make something happen are also not entitled to a certain level of income. Achievers do not want a pat on the head or a fake handout. Free money doesn\u2019t work. You need passionate effort for there to be a desirable end result. If the drive is not there then the result is there.<br /><br />Michael then reads from a blog post by Seth Godin titled \u201cThe crowd, your work, and a choice.\u201d Seth dives into crowd mentality. He says that the public would rather, \u201cWatch a movie than read a book, stand in lines for the popular attractions\u2026likes explosions, resolved plots and ample lighting\u2026Crowds only care about fast, easy, cheap, fun, now and simple.\u201d Crowds demand that they are told how much they will make and in what markets. When it comes to investing and trading there are no deadlines. Trends come and go, there is no timeline.<br /><br />Michael moves on to discuss his recent interview in New York with Barry Ritholtz. He talks about himself and Barry as a piece of media and how media is becoming more individualized with the help of social media. There are so many outlets to get your name out whether it be your blog, podcast, or news column. All these places are just distribution outlets. Places like twitter and Instagram give you a platform to contribute value and feedback to people.

Mebane is a noted author, blogger, and portfolio manager with Cambria Investment Management. His new book, \u201cInvest with the House: Hacking the Top Hedge Funds\u201d is out now. This is Mebane\u2019s 4th appearance on Trend Following Radio. Michael and Mebane have a slightly different outlook on trading but they do align. The biggest similarity is that they both come at the markets from a quant way of thinking.<br /><br />Michael starts the podcast off asking, \u201cWhy do some of the big name guys motivate you so much.\u201d Mebane says he always loved investing. In his spare time during college he would explore finance. A fund manager named John Griffin, who was Julian Robertson\u2019s right hand man, taught at Mebane\u2019s school UVA. It was in this class that many famed hedge fund managers provided his first initiation. The managers would give examples of different kinds of research they would do. Mebane knew he would never have the resources to do that type of research, so he turned to studying the numbers instead.<br /><br />Mebane\u2019s new book is based on mimicking the trades of some of the most successful hedge funds. He says it isn\u2019t too hard to identify the \u201cMichael Jordan\u2019s\u201d of the finance world. The key, however, is to figure out who\u2019s trades you could piggy back off of and be successful. You have to go into this believing markets aren\u2019t efficient. Where do you find the best players? Mebane studied 10-12 managers that friends and colleagues suggested. The most obvious was Warren Buffett. Turns out, you still make amazing returns piggy backing off of Warren Buffett\u2019s trades. You cannot trade futures in this way or trade shorts, you must be long only. Trading with this strategy, as opposed to buying straight into these big hedge funds, gets you away from paying huge fees and large taxes. In Mebane\u2019s latest book he goes much more in depth into this topic.<br /><br />Michael then goes into Twitter questions posted by listeners. The first question, \u201cMy market is too small? What should I do?\u201d Mebane says there is a \u201chome country bias\u201d among people. People like to invest in their own markets. The Asian countries happen to have the worst of this bias. It is a terrible habit to have if you need proper asset allocation in your portfolio. You must look beyond your own country, be agnostic in your trading.

Stanley shares his views on betting big and diversification. Michael expands on Stanley\u2019s views by stressing how crucial diversification is to a portfolio\u2019s success. You must be open to many markets to handle your risk management. And when markets start to go your way, you have to \u201cbet the ranch.\u201d When one market in your portfolio takes off you need to go big and make the most of it. This is where your profits will come from. Note: Stanley Druckenmiller had two big mentors in his life. One of the two influences was George Soros. The two have been business partners for years now and have made a fortune trading trends. These men do not tout themselves as trend following traders but Michael describes them as \u201ckissing cousins\u201d to trend following.<br /><br />Michael then reads an article from Josh Brown titled, \u201cEveryone is a closet technician.\u201d In the article, Josh claims everyone is a technician. What is a technician? Josh defines them as, \u201cSomeone who cuts right to the chase and studies actual prices and behavior instead of puzzling over the causes of prices and behavior like everyone else.\u201d He says that investors only pay lip service to fundamentals. Technicians find truth and meaning in price and the action that is currently happening. They respect the idea of sentiment. Sentiment is how valuations come to be. Prices change and with that the truth is constantly changing. Technicians do not waste their time with the \u201cWhy\u201d question. Hindsight bias is a slippery slope. Josh says, \u201cFundamentalists will share their reasons with anyone willing to listen. The technicians will take these reasons with stride and focus on what is happening, not \u2018why.\u2019 The \u2018why\u2019 will always be much more apparent after the fact. After it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Price will do its thing regardless of what people predict. Michael doesn\u2019t believe the people on CNBC throwing out predictions are technicians.

Robert is author of \u201cSystematic Trading: A unique new method for designing trading and investing systems.\u201d He got his start in finance working at AHL. Robert started with AHL in 2001 during his final year of college. It was at this time that he was introduced to quantitative trading and began thinking of finance in a systematic way. He later went back to AHL, working there from 2006-2013.<br /><br />Robert doesn\u2019t tout systematic trading as the only way to trade. He says there are some great traders out there that aren\u2019t systematic traders. However, the majority of people need a system to be successful. So how does Robert define a system? He says a system must be objective, repeatable, and transferable. If you can\u2019t get the same results using a different person then it is not a true system. The rules must be transferable from one person to another and the results must be objective and repeatable. Most do not have a good understanding of statistics, and they get confused in thinking that the more complicated a system is, the better it must be.<br /><br />Robert and Michael move on to discuss behavioral finance, prospect theory and the difference between trend following and high frequency trading. A high frequency trading system is harder for traders to meddle with than trend following systems. The trading time frames are much shorter in high frequency trading which lessens the opportunity for human intervention. Most traders fail because of their own meddling. If you can avoid the temptation to change your system then you will be more profitable in the long run.<br /><br />Working for a company like AHL would have been interesting to see from the inside during 2008. Michael asks, \u201cWhat were you seeing from the ground in 2008? How did that change you and how you viewed systems?\u201d Robert says it showed him that people truly don\u2019t know what is happening or going to happen. Systematic traders, including himself, were able to make money because their systems saved them. When their systems saw markets going down, stops helped them exit trades and even go short in some cases. This is where all the money was made. Robert does say there are rare times you should intervene with your trading system. For example, he was forced to modify one of his systems when he found out there was going to be a coup in Thailand and the currency was going to be suspended. It\u2019s not that he thought he could forecast what the price was going to do better than the system, but he did know trading that market was going to be impossible. Robert says there has been maybe three other times when he has had to intervene with his system. They are rare and extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unpredictable risk vs. Predictable risk</li>\n<li>Systematic trading</li>\n<li>High frequency trading vs. Trend following trading</li>\n<li>Black swans</li>\n<li>When to intervene with your system</li>\n<li>2008 crash</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "49:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/417.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1453086000, "title": "Ep. 416: Market Timing Confusion with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel talks prediction.

Most of what we read in the paper is about overconfidence. People put a lot more weight on negative events then on positive ones. However, many decisions people make are optimistic. Kahneman says it is good that we have a lot of optimism in society. Unfortunately, over confidence and loss aversion seem to work in opposite directions. Most do not know the odds when they take risks. People save and borrow at the same time. Investors tend to view each stock they buy as an individual account rather than part of a bigger picture. These are just a few examples of how society as a whole is generally narrow-minded. Kahneman shows how intricately trading and psychology are linked together throughout the three clips. Michael finishes up the podcast with Ed Seykota singing.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diversification</li>\n<li>Seth Godin\u2019s 2016 predictions</li>\n<li>Market timing</li>\n<li>Understanding psychology in trading</li>\n<li>Pitfalls of overconfidence</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "35:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/416.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1452826800, "title": "Ep. 415: Peter Gray Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Peter Gray. Peter is an American psychologist who currently occupies the position of research professor of psychology at Boston College. He is also a well known critic of standard learning systems, and calls himself an evolutionary developmental psychologist. He studies why children are the way they are by asking questions like: Why are children so playful? Why are they so willful? Why do children do what they do?<br /><br />Peter starts the podcast off saying, \u201cThere is an issue with the resilience of young people today.\u201d Since the 1950\u2019s there has been an increase of psychological problems among youth. Counselors are being flooded with trivial issues that in earlier years students would have taken care of themselves. Roommate issues, bad grades, breakups, etc. are a few examples of issues students are now deciding they need to see psychotherapists for. It\u2019s not that people are biologically different than previous generations, it\u2019s that our world has become radically different than the past. Children used to spend a lot more time away from adults, where they have to make their own decisions. They used to learn how to deal with bully\u2019s on their own or getting lost and having to find their own way home.<br /><br />Peter argues that as long as we are overly protective of young people, they will never grow up. Kids need to have the time and opportunity to get out in the world and figure out what they really enjoy. We aren\u2019t letting children experiment, take risks and fail. Even sports have been taken away from the kids. Adult directed sports don\u2019t let kids have creativity to solve their own problems. Children learn the most from playing with other children and taking adults out of the equation. Kids who are \u201cplay deprived\u201d have real social consequences. Peter shares an experiment done with young monkeys. One group of monkeys got to play with other monkeys their own age, the other group of monkeys were only around their parents, not other adolescents to play with. The ones who were not able to play were socially incompetent. They would either get overly aggressive or nervous around others their own age. Over the past 50 years there has been a continuous decline of play between young children. Hence, you can see the rapid increase in social and emotional disorders among youth. Michael and Peter finish up discussing ways of implicating free play back into society.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hunter gatherer cultures</li>\n<li>Self-reliance</li>\n<li>Evolution of development in youth</li>\n<li>Pros and cons of video games</li>\n<li>Ways of implicating free play back into society</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "44:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/415.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1452481200, "title": "Ep. 414: Buy and Hold for 50 Years with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel starts off talking about goal setting for 2016.

In the middle of giving his fundamental data however, he acknowledges that he does not have a crystal ball (and is guessing). He then goes on to guess oil prices will be higher rather than lower three years from now. Michael uses his statement as an example of prediction without foundation.<br /><br />Michael moves on to diversification. If you trade in the direction of the stock pickers he brought on today, then where is your diversification? Research has shown that you need diversification. If you put all your money into Facebook or Chevron, as his market guru examples have told you to do, then where will you be in 10 years if those companies go the wrong way?

Ron is an award winning social psychologist that specializes in human motivation. He is author of \u201cThe Best Place to Work: The Art and Science of Creating an Extraordinary Work Place.\u201d His book consists of over 1,000 academic studies that have been boiled down.<br /><br />Michael and Ron start talking about factors that contribute to employee dissatisfaction. Ron says there are three main needs that we, as humans, need fulfilled: Competence, relatedness, and autonomy. There is clear evidence showing that when you have happy workers, you have a much more productive company. Free snacks and coffee, for example, make workers feel more at ease and productive in their workplace. Michael then asks, \u201cHow do you define a \u2018workplace\u2019.\u201d Ron says that work use to be just confined to an office. Now a workplace could be anywhere you have a cellphone connection. Michael then asks, \u201cHow do you create success in the workplace?\u201d Giving employees the opportunity to fail is one way to create success. However, it is the risk taking chances that are encouraged, not failure due to incompetence or laziness. Failure helps you learn and to improve for the next time. That is how you get a creative and innovative team. Getting in the habit of physically writing down what you learned from your failures is a great exercise to help you move forward and grow.<br /><br />Michael and Ron then move on to the idea of flow in the workplace. Flow is the moment where you are so enthralled with the work you are doing that you forget time. Flow is more common in work then we realize. Video games are a great example of providing a flow experience. Video games give us immediate feedback, immediate recognition, and they provide progressive difficulty. Unfortunately most work environments are structured opposite of this thinking. 80% of people are not engaged at their work. Not being properly challenged is one reason for lack of engagement.<br /><br />Michael and Ron talk about actionable steps to make a workplace better. Ron says that our physical surroundings affect our mindset greatly. Ceiling height affects your level of creativity, and personalizing your work space makes you more comfortable. He discovered that employees that sit by a window focus better and do better at their job. You can predict how satisfied employees are by the amount of daylight they are exposed to. Afternoon naps are another great tool. We have a biological need for rest that is just as pressing as our need for food or water. If we re-stock our brains with a 20 minute nap, it increases productivity. On the same note, the food you take in and how much you exercise affects how you think. It puts you in a better mood, helps you collaborate better with others, and go home feeling more satisfied. This is critical to employees long-term engagement.

The first question Mihaly asks is, \u201cWhat is the meaning of happiness? If each one of us is responsible and in control of our happiness, then how do you obtain happiness?\u201d People feel the most happy when they are able to express who they really are. When people express their strengths, they are able to say, \u201cYes, this is who I am.\u201d It makes life suddenly matter and creates happiness. Mihaly came up with the term \u201cflow\u201d from people he would interview and study. When they would describe being truly happy, they would describe the feeling as being carried by a current and floating along.<br /><br />Mihaly brings up a personal experience from fighting in WWII. He said when people lost their property and personal belongings, most would crumble. This is when he became interested in the differences between people who were able to be strong internally as opposed to those who needed to lean on society and what it could provide for them. He says, \u201cEveryone is the master of their own destiny and should not allow themselves to be pulled by the strings of fortune or fame.\u201d<br /><br />Mihaly then goes into how to gain flow in your own life. The first step is to be totally focused on an intention. How can you organize your life so you can have that focus everyday? Flow rarely just happens. You have to work at it and prepare yourself mentally, but you can get to the point where you don\u2019t have to think about what you are doing. It just flows naturally. Mihaly uses surgeons and rock climbers as examples. Both disciplines require great concentration and muscle coordination. Once you are in the zone, you aren\u2019t aware of anything else such as being a father, husband or what you are having for dinner. You are there simply as a surgeon or rock climber, present in the moment, flowing from one task to another in order to accomplish the end goal.<br /><br />Michael then goes on to play another clip from Csikszentmihalyi where he talks about the \u201cstruggling artist.\u201d He makes the point that you don\u2019t have to be tortured to be creative. He goes into a study he did that showed extraordinary people mostly come from lower class or upper class families. He found that people who came from a fairly comfortable childhood didn\u2019t seem to find the need to stretch and challenge themselves. Michael brings it all together with a thought provoking excerpt from Alan Watts.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is flow</li>\n<li>How does flow happen</li>\n<li>Dealing with worry</li>\n<li>Addiction to thoughts</li>\n<li>How to obtain happiness</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "39:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/412.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1451617200, "title": "Ep. 411: Jason Williams Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Today on Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Dr. Jason Williams. Jason is author of \u201cThe Mental Edge in Trading.\u201d While going to medical school Jason fell in love with the brain and psychiatry. He was fascinated with figuring out all the different ways the brain worked. While finishing his psychiatry degree at John Hopkins he started working on a research project giving psychology tests to traders. The goal was to see if they could find any common themes among traders and how they think during trading. There are many similarities and he has built up a side business helping traders get in touch with their mental game.<br /><br />Jason uses a test called the NEO PI-R. He explains the differences between the NEO PI-R and other personality tests such as Myers Briggs. He says that if you take Myers Briggs, and take it again a week later, the results are different 50% of the time. Myers Briggs gives extreme generalizations. It simply says if you are an extrovert or introvert and doesn\u2019t go much deeper. Jason brings up horse jockeys and basketball players as examples. You can be tall, but not tall enough to be a pro basketball player. On the same note, you can be short, but not short enough to be a horse jockey. Looking at the extremes is critical. You need to look at not just if you are tall or short, but actually ask, \u201cHow tall are you? How short are you?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cOnce I know my personality, then what?\u201d Jason says you need to ask yourself: What are my traits? Where am I on the scale? How can I use these to my advantage? How are they getting in my way? The NEO is a 5 factor model; neuroticism, extroversion, openness, agreeableness, and consciousness. Each trait has six sub-traits. Jason goes into depth with examples for all of the personality traits. For the most part, everyone has a personality and is unique. Sometimes the test will show you some \u201cA-ha\u201d surprise moments that give you a little more self-awareness. However, most people are in the middle of a personality trait scale. According to the laws of evolutionary psychology you don\u2019t want to be too high or too low on the scales. It could drown out the logical or rational side of the brain.<br /><br />One common thread Jason found between traders was that most have very low anxiety levels. Knowing when you are feeling anxious in the markets but not having the anxiety be so overwhelming that you are not executing correctly is important. Anxiety is what pushes you on and is somewhat of a barometer. The successful traders are able to adapt a trading strategy to their personality. He says it took his father, Larry Williams, some time to realize that it was better to create systems himself and let others execute. Sometimes it is better to adapt to your personality than try and change it.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using your personality to your advantage</li>\n<li>Psychology of trading</li>\n<li>What is the NEO PI-R test?</li>\n<li>Why anxiety is important in trading</li>\n<li>Commonalities among traders</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "53:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/411.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1451271600, "title": "Ep. 410: Lessons Comparing Pro Football and Pro Baseball with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael starts off discussing his travel. One of his stops in early December was New York City to meet up with a few legends, one of them being Larry Hite. He talks a bit about their lunch conversation and how Larry has climbed the ladder of success. Larry paints the picture that he was just an average Joe from Brooklyn, and his success is fully obtainable if the right desire and drive is there.<br /><br />Today's subject on Trend Following Radio goes along the lines of the rest of his conversation with Larry Hite. It\u2019s all about the data. Michael makes it clear that his career would not exist if he did not have the opportunity to dig into the trend following data. You see all types of trend following traders up in the same months and down in the same months\u2013that means something. Doesn\u2019t matter why it happened, just that it happened. Further, many make the mistake of not caring about the psychological. You can have the best system under the sun, but if you don\u2019t have the psychological toughness to carry it out then the system does not matter.<br /><br />Michael goes on to read from an article out of The Washington Post titled, \u201cJeff Samardzija just proved athletes would be foolish to pick NFL over MLB.\u201d America\u2019s favorite sport is football, hands down. The dream of just about every father in America is for his son to play professional football. However, all data says to stop right now and turn your focus to baseball. The article states, \u201cThe top 30 contracts in the history of team sports \u2013 ranked by total compensation \u2013 all went to baseball players.\u201d When you compare average players in the MLB with top players in the NFL, the MLB still comes out on top. \u201cThrough this season, [Calvin] Johnson will have collected $113,816,086 in earnings, making him one of the wealthiest non-quarterbacks in league history. Samardzija, by virtue of the five-year contract he just signed with the San Francisco Giants, is guaranteed to have earnings of $122,725,000 \u2013 and have another chance to dip into the till in 2021, when he\u2019ll turn 36.\u201d Mike pulls the article back to trend following showing that trend following numbers have made it and persevered through ups and downs.

He self published the first edition of \u201cThe Practicing Mind,\u201d and as it snowballed into a phenomenon, publishers started knocking at his door for wider distribution.<br /><br />This is about practicing focus and learning to calm your mind. Not an easy task in today\u2019s world with media constantly telling us we are incomplete in what we are doing. People incessantly crave closure, but closure is not always the answer. Tom says that immersing yourself in something that is ongoing puts you in a place of \u201cbeing.\u201d People are always trying to complete the next level, but being in a state of constant expansion is the best state to be in. He says that even the process of writing books does not have a beginning and an end. He looks at it as an ongoing process. When one book ends, then you can move on from saying what you needed to say and move onto the next phase of what you want to be said. Tom shares a personal story about becoming a musician. For years he had felt inadequate as a musician. It took some time but eventually he figured out that he had accomplished many milestones throughout his career but because he had a limitless ability to expand and grow as a musician, he would never reach the state of perfection he envisioned. Almost in an instant, his frustration and negative thoughts about his accomplishments washed away.<br /><br />The importance of repetition is Michael and Tom\u2019s next topic. Your brain responds to repeated action best. This can vary from swinging a golf club over and over again, to how you meet people and interact with them. Tom says, \u201cAttention combined with intention is the goal.\u201d Your process and repeated practice is what makes achieving a goal feel so good. Anything you can snap your fingers and have doesn\u2019t feel nearly as rewarding. He says that \u201cYour perception of what good is and how good you can get is ever changing.\u201d<br /><br />Lastly, Michael and Tom discuss multitasking and living in the moment of now. Tom says that the way we envision multitasking doesn\u2019t exist. When you think you are doing a bunch of different things simultaneously, you are not. The brain is operating at higher speeds but we are not letting our brains concentrate in one area for a long amount of time so in consequence, our brain is atrophying. We are losing that part of our mental game. Slowing your mind down brings clarity and thought. Secondly it connects your mind to what you are doing. If you are just reacting to whatever your mind is creating than you have no control over what you are doing. Mindfulness is not something that can be mastered. You have to constantly work at it just like you would never say \u201cI have mastered fitness so I don\u2019t need to work out anymore.\u201d It is a constant practice. The moment you catch your mind running off is when you start training your brain. If you can recognize yourself chasing your mind then that is being aware of where it is going. Mike says, \u201cIt is like an organized treadmill that everyone is on. There is this lack of awareness among people that they are not in control.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attention combined with intention</li>\n<li>Non-judgment</li>\n<li>Perils of multitasking</li>\n<li>Controlling your mind</li>\n<li>Constant media chatter</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "54:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/409.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1450666800, "title": "Ep. 408: The Force Awakens with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael Covel starts off with a short clip from Star Wars.

Analyzing a companies culture is a good way to produce less over-fitting results.

Dave discusses his transition from marketing consultant to entrepreneur. Formerly Dave did consulting work for paid advertising and now has transitioned into t-shirt design and sales (Michael notes that famed trader Salem Abraham had considered the t-shirt business before trading). He has been able to grow his business quickly due to a website called www.teespring.com. This website allows him to order shirts on-demand without any out of pocket expenses.<br /><br />Dave comes at t-shirt sales in a trend following manor. One out of every ten shirts that he puts out will be a big winner. He makes it clear that it is very important he has a system. He limits his cost to $20 per shirt for advertising. If he doesn\u2019t get a positive response from his $20 advertising push then he stops. He lets the market decide which t-shirt designs are worth pursuing. He has put out 500+ designs just this year. Six out of ten times he sells zero shirts. Three out of ten of those shirts sell 20 or 30 units and he breaks even, but one out of ten shirts will sell over 1,000 units. He never knows which will be the home run and which designs are going to be the duds.<br /><br />Dave stresses how online marketing has become more and more a part of our lives. You have to participate in online marketing if you are going to have any kind of business these days. You find your most passionate fans in your business and hit them at the right time.

Larry is unquestionably one of the founding fathers of systematic trend following. In 1981 he founded Mint Investments and by 1990 it was one of the largest trend following funds in the world. At the same time he formed partnership at Man group, which became wildly successful as well. In 2000 he decided to go another direction, focusing on proprietary trading and research, founding Hite Capital Management. Currently, Larry is partnered at ISAM with his long time colleague Stanley Fink.<br /><br />Throughout today\u2019s podcast Michael pulls quotes and excerpts straight from Larry\u2019s chapter in \u201cThe Little Book of Trading.\u201d Quotes range from probability advice to compound interest and one or all of them are certain to spark certain \u201cAh-ha\u201d moments. Michael starts with Larry giving advice on the notion of being wrong. Larry stresses that being wrong is ok. He was wrong often and always built the possibility of being wrong into his models. He would ask himself, \u201cHow much can I afford to lose?\u201d And work his risk in from there. Hite found that even having perfect knowledge of an end of year price wouldn\u2019t guarantee riches. His research proved that you could only bet with 3:1 leverage on a stock, even if you had absolute knowledge of the stocks year end price, because you can\u2019t predict the path a market might take getting there. Respecting leverage is key. Michael then brings up a dating story Larry shared about probabilities.<br /><br />Michael then goes into Larry\u2019s risk management. He stresses, \u201cMake sure you are as prepared as possible. You can\u2019t know everything but you can certainly be prepared.\u201d Larry always starts from an assumed position of ignorance. You have to know what you don\u2019t know. If you know what the worst possible outcome can be from the outset then you are starting with a great advantage. Mike finishes with one last excerpt from Larry taken from a paper titled \u201cLife is a Bet.\u201d In this excerpt Larry outlines why life is just a serious of bets. Some are large and some are small. Some seem trivial and some seem to have far greater impact on our lives. However, those trivial bets can quickly become paramount. Never discount a decision. It could be the one that makes or breaks you.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respecting leverage</li>\n<li>Thinking in terms of odds</li>\n<li>Being wrong is OK</li>\n<li>Getting the odds on your side</li>\n<li>Risk management</li>\n<li>Life is a series of bets</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "20:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/406.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1449802800, "title": "Ep. 405: Didier Sornette Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Didier Sornette. He is Professor on the Chair of Entrepreneurial Risks at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. He is also a professor of the Swiss Finance Institute, associated with both the department of Physics and the department of Earth Sciences at ETH Zurich. He has worked on the King effect, a theory used to predict economic bubbles. Didier also set up the Financial Crisis Observatory in October of 2008. He brings an interesting perspective to financial crisis\u2019s, and bubbles.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Didier first realized his fascination with financial bubbles back in 1989. He received a grant to try and solve the equation of prediction. Didier goes on to discuss the different theories that stemmed from his research. A few years later, when the housing crisis hit the U.S., he founded The Financial Crisis Observatory. He founded it as a psychological response to the discourse he had with the markets. People didn\u2019t have a clear view of what was happening. Nobody seemed to know how it happened, but to Didier it was so obvious and natural that the crisis occurred. He wanted to help inform people better with his observatory by showing concrete steps that lead to the housing collapse and other crashes that came before it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Michael and Didier then go into discussing black swans. Didier does not believe in black swans because they relate to \u201csurprise events.\u201d He says that crisis\u2019s are actually not surprise events at all. They can be expected and are human related. Instead, Didier believes in a notion he calls \u201cDragon Kings.\u201d His theory is called Dragon Kings because a King is a special person in a country, and dragon means of unique origin. Dragon Kings is how he describes his version of, \u201csurprise events.\u201d Michael and Didier move onto talking about how the world is out of equilibrium. The world is consistently battered with surprises therefore the equilibrium is always off. A lot of economists refuse to acknowledge this and policy makers are not well educated on the subject. Lastly they talk about Didier\u2019s financial bubble experiment. Didier then goes into his background in physics saying it gave him tools to look at things outside the box.

Napoleon was born in 1883 and died in 1970. He is most known for paving the way for the new thought and personal success movement with his book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d which has become one of the best selling books of all time. Its premise is to help people realize they have the power to create success within themselves by way of conscious and unconscious thought. His message is straightforward, pragmatic and clear.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">For the remainder of the podcast Michael plays a presentation by Napoleon. The presentation is centered on making a goal and how to use certain tools to achieve that goal. Napoleon starts off by explaining the power of motives. He says you have no right to ask yourself or anyone to do something unless you give an adequate motive. If you give someone a good enough motive to buy something from you or give yourself a a worthwhile reason to achieve a goal you can sell or accomplish anything. You can also trick your mind to believe anything by repetitive action. If you have faith in what you want to accomplish you will accomplish it. On the same note, faith without action is dead and faith without believing is dead. Napoleon believed that 98%-100% of people sell themselves short because they do not believe in themselves. He says, \u201cThe power of thought is the only thing humans have absolute control over.\u201d By repetition, thought, and action you can educate your brain to pick up only the vibrations related to what you want. He stresses that you must make sure your subconscious mind knows you are the boss.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The power of motives, thought, and faith in yourself all goes into being able to create and carry out a plan successfully. Napoleon says to write out your major objective in life and give it a timeline. Make sure it is clear and precise. Keep your major purpose to yourself. Your actions speak for themselves, and the envy of mankind can slow you down. Also, leave your plan flexible. Nobody can put limitations on you except for yourself. With that being said, acknowledge your weaknesses but don\u2019t let them overtake you. If you keep your mind positive, it becomes greater than all the negatives.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Conditioning your unconscious mind</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Setting goals</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Laws of nature</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Vibrations of thought</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Using your greatest asset</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Individual power</span></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "01:20:08", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/404.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1449198000, "title": "Ep. 403: Barbara Fredrickson Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Barbara Fredrickson. Barbara is a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is the Kenan Distinguished Professor of Psychology, and the Principal Investigator of the Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology Lab at the University of North Carolina. She is a social psychologist that conducts research in emotions and positive psychology. Her main work is related to her Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions which suggests that positive emotions lead to novel, expansive or exploratory behavior, and that over time these actions lead to meaningful long term resources such as knowledge and social relationships.<br /><br />The podcast starts with Michael asking, \u201cWhen did this fascination start with you?\u201d Barbara explains that she has had a curiosity with emotional behavior all her life, but it was in college when she realized that almost all research was centered around negative emotions. She began being influenced by evolutionary science, neurosciences, and behavioral changes that occur with emotions. She sees her job as figuring out why positive emotions matter, and why they are important. All emotions have specific action tendencies whether negative or positive. She believes that positive emotions broaden our horizons and negative emotions have values that are much more narrow and specific. Positive emotions bring awareness. They help us become better versions of ourselves. Barbara goes on to explain that it\u2019s not the intensity of positive emotions that are important, it\u2019s the frequency. They are like waves, they arrive and then dissipate. Positive emotions don\u2019t typically have as powerful of moments as negative emotions and that is why Barbara believes they have eluded the interest of scientists for so long.<br /><br />Michael then brings up Barbara\u2019s work with \u201cthe undoing effect.\u201d Barbara expands on this hypothesis by saying, \u201cIt first started when other scientists looked at the physiological signature of emotions.\u201d The undoing effect counters the current notion that negative emotions have a signature and positive ones do not. The study showed that positive emotions actually act as reset buttons to your negative emotions. Lastly, Barbara helps listeners look at love through the lens of an emotions scientist. She explains that when we share positive emotions with multiple people it is more effective than when we experience that same emotion individually. She also points out that love is made up of micro moments of positive experiences rather than long lasting ongoing experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inner-experiences and well being</li>\n<li>The undoing effect</li>\n<li>Positive negative ratio</li>\n<li>The body\u2019s definition of love</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>The idea of soul mates</li>\n<li>Emotional connections</li>\n</ul>", "duration": "44:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/403.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1448852400, "title": "Ep. 402: Charles Faulkner on Goals; Special Episode", "author": "", "summary": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael Covel features a presentation by Charles Faulkner. Charles is a trader, mentor and author who has been featured in Jack Schwager\u2019s \u201cMarket Wizards\u201d series. Faulkner is an international expert on modeling the knowledge and performance of exceptional individuals, teams and organizations, and applying the latest research in cognitive neuro-science and linguistics. He has appeared on this podcast five times and has received more positive feedback than any other guest.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Today, Charles\u2019 message is about goals. It is about setting large goals that are above and beyond your everyday concerns. Goals that give your life purpose. Charles comes at this topic in a pragmatic and scientific way. He breaks down how our brains function best, making goals easier to obtain. The first example he gives is a \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d experiment. The experiment showed that when you do something repetitively in the correct form, you have a much higher success rate than if you were to be sitting in the stands watching or doing a variety of the same act, but only occasionally doing it right. Charles then moves onto a study centered on the idea of taking internal dialogue and externalizing it. When you write down a goal and draw out what that goal means to you, that is externalizing your inner-dialogue. In addition to writing out your goals, it is important to talk them out. Charles has his students ask each other: \u201cWhat are you going to do to achieve your goals?\u201d \u201cWhat will you see, what will you feel?\u201d \u201cWhere will you be and who will be there?\u201d Asking these questions vivify your goal. On the flip side, it is important to ask about the downsides. The more important the goal, the more negatives it\u2019s likely to have.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGoals are a way of directing your attention\u201d says Charles. He goes on, \u201cYou don\u2019t set one big goal, you set interim goals so you get rewarded along the way.\u201d Charles goes on to talk about the importance of having milestones so you don\u2019t get discouraged when your goal is not met immediately. People become attached to a certain outcome but they don\u2019t think about why that outcome is important. He asks the question, \u201cWhat is important about making a million dollars?\u201d When you break down the reasoning behind your goal, it may uncover layers you had never thought about.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How to set goals</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How to achieve your goals</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Externalizing your inner-dialogue</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The importance of milestones</span></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "01:18:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/402.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1448593200, "title": "Ep. 401: Ben Carlson Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Ben Carlson. Ben is the Director of Institutional Asset Management at Ritholtz Wealth Management. He first gained fame with his blog, \u201cA Wealth of Common Sense.\u201d Following his blog success Ben wrote the book, \u201cA Wealth of Common Sense: Why Simplicity Trumps Complexity in Any Investment Plan.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA Wealth of Common Sense\u201d is geared toward helping investors gain a simpler decision making process and developing a clearer way of thinking. This is where Michael and Ben take the conversation on today\u2019s podcast. Ben says that people usually become their worst enemy while trading. Cycle to cycle or fad-to-fad is how so many plan their investing rather than building their trading off a solid foundation. Studying the emotional side of trading is a relatively new concept that has sprung up in the last couple decades, which causes people to overlook the necessity of its study in their trading. Ben says, \u201cEnvy is the worst of all sins because nobody enjoys doing it.\u201d People are constantly tempted to follow what others do. With the amount of information and \u201cnoise\u201d thrown around today we are more informed than ever but most aren\u2019t putting that information in the right context.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ben uses the documentary, \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi\u201d as a great example of having faith in a system matched with an extraordinary amount of discipline. There is nothing fancy about Jiro and his sushi. It is his discipline over the years to perfect his craft that has made him arguably the best sushi chef in the world. Whether it is creating the perfect meal or creating the perfect system, you have to give it time to work. Ben says that discipline is just not there for most people. Constantly asking, \u201cDoes this still work? Why should I continue to follow it?\u201d Lastly Mike brings up the phrase \u201cMarket timing.\u201d On a daily basis there is someone on T.V. predicting what will happen. The two talk about lack of understanding among investors, relating investment advisors as shrinks to their clients.

This is his 2nd appearance on Trend Following Radio. He is a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at New York State University, author of \u201cThe Daily Trading Coach,\u201d \u201cThe Psychology of Trading,\u201d and \u201cEnhancing Trader Performance.\u201d His newest work is \u201cTrading Psychology 2.0: From Best Practices to Best Processes.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Michael and Brett start the podcast off by asking the question, \u201cDo people really have that burning desire to succeed?\u201d Brett says he does believe traders are drawn to trading for the money outcome, but also for the allure of not working a 9-5 job or the dream of scoring easy riches. Brett breaks it apart further by explaining the motivations for different traders: Practice and process are essential. He says, \u201cYou hear traders talk about finding your edge and sticking to your edge.\u201d Finding your edge is a continual process because the markets are forever changing. You must adapt.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brett goes on to discuss the importance of back-testing and how valuable it is to your strategy. He gives the example that elite performers spend more time in preparation than in performance. That preparation helps develop a strategy and prepare the performer mentally. It pushes the performer to develop the best of what they are doing. Brett then details the difference between repeated performance and deliberate practice.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Creativity is the next big topic discussed. Brett says it\u2019s an individual\u2019s creativity that breaks them away from the herd. A trader that has the creativity to diversify and test new strategies. Brett then touches on what it means to \u201ctrade your personality,\u201d how paramount it is to have the right trading mentor, and the advantages of creating a checklist to bring out your best practices and make them routine. Lastly, Michael and Brett dig into the necessity of eating, sleeping, physical exercise, and yoga to help fuel a positive emotional experience in life and in trading.

He begins with an article excerpt about locker room etiquette and loops around to the parallels between sports psychology and trading psychology. Michael argues that critical thinking has gone by the way side in the general populace and if you have an alternate way of thinking, one that is not with the masses, then you have a leg up.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Digging in Michael explores excerpts from a paper by Howard Marks titled, \u201cInspiration from the World of Sports.\u201d The paper outlines the consistencies between sports and trading. Michael discusses bullet points from the article; 1. Trading and sports are competitive. Some succeed and some fail, and the distinction is clear. 2. In the long term the better returns go to superior investors. 3. An investment career can feel like a basketball or football game with an unlimited number of quarters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Michael also explores from Howard Marks the career of Yogi Berra, his achievements and his baseball philosophy. Howard points out how consistent Yogi was in his performance and how that is exactly what he likes to see in his investing. Howard then compares Yogi Berra and Reggie Jackson (Reggie was far less consistent then Yogi). Howard says that he would rather have returns like Yogi, nice and consistent. Michael argues the case for trading like Reggie\u2019s baseball performance. He says the Reggie Jackson home run model is more in line with venture capital, film financing, the MIT blackjack team, and trend following trading, for example. The point being that home runs will pay for the strike outs. Michael ends the podcast by pointing out that Reggie and Yogi are ultimately in the same game, but it is up to you to decide what style of trading you want.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Consistency vs. the home run</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Quarterly performance</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Trend following performance</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Emotion in human nature</span></li>\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Irrationality in investing</span></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "25:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/398.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1447383600, "title": "Ep. 397: Jim Rickards Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Jim Rickards. Jim was front and center during the 1998 LTCM blow-up. He was a partner and general counsel for Long Term Capital Management. Following their blowup, he was principal negotiator in the 1998 bailout of LTCM by the Federal Reserve. He has had a bird\u2019s eye view of some of the most interesting events in the economy over the last 20 years.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Michael and Jim dive right into the sequence of events that lead to the devaluation of the Thai Baht in May of 1997. Jim then goes into the chronology of events that took place leading to the fall of Long Term Capital Management. He makes clear that LTCM had some of the brightest brains in finance working for them at the time, including Nobel Prize winners and a vast number of PhD\u2019s from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, etc. Jim summarizes the events prompting Russia to default on their debt which let loose a sequence of events leading to LTCM losing four billion dollars in one month. Wall Street cared not for the four billion LTCM loss but because they had over 1 trillion dollars of derivatives contracts tied to LTCM positions. Many thought all of Wall Street would have been taken down if LTCM went down. That was when the Fed intervened and organized a bailout.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Jim goes on to talk about the changes that took place and the lessons that were learned from the fall of LTCM. He says the three lessons that should have been taken away from the crisis were; derivatives are dangerous, leverage is dangerous and getting banks involved is dangerous. The changes started with repealing Glass Steagall in 1999, rewriting laws so they could do \u201cswaps\u201d on everything, and then in 2006 the SEC changed leverage rules on brokers. So in short regulators ended up doing the complete opposite of what they should have learned from LTCM. Michael asks the question, \u201cWhy were the same people who were saying that the economy was great till the day it crashed, the same people that were responsible for fixing it?\u201d Jim says policy makers never see bubbles. He gives two possible explanations for why policy makers act as they do; conspiracy or complete incompetence. He believes it is more incompetence rather than a conspiracy and goes on to explain why.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Michael and Jim then dive into \u201cmodels\u201d. If you have the wrong models you will get the wrong results every time. Michael notes that the right models are rooted in behavioral finance. Jim notes that the Fed does not use behavioral economics. Jim talks about the three elements that his model is based on: behavioral finance, complexity theory and inverse probability. He goes into great depth on what all of those models are and gives real life examples for them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1997 devaluation of the Thai Baht</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The collapse of Long Term Capital Management</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The 2008 crisis</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Complexity theory</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Behavioral Finance</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Inverse Probability</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Federal Reserve</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Description of currency wars</span></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "49:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/397.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1447038000, "title": "Ep. 396: Kathleen Eisenhardt Interview with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On today\u2019s episode of Trend Following Radio Michael Covel interviews Kathleen Eisenhardt. Kathleen is Co-Author of the best selling book \u201cSimple Rules.\u201d She is also the Co-Director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. Her book\u2019s foundation is based on the argument that too much structure and too many rules don\u2019t get products out the door and the other extreme, no rules or structure tend to not produce results either. In short, simplicity beats complexity. Her book \u201cSimple Rules\u201d is not just about rules in business, but in all aspects of life; sports, entertainment, investing, diets, etc.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kathleen defines simple rules as shortcuts that save on time and are more commonly known as, \u201crules of thumb\u201d (heuristics). Michael and Kathleen pull in examples from Google, Netflix, The White Stripes, Billy Bean and the Oakland A\u2019s, General Motors, Stanford football and an expedition in the South Pole launched in 1912. Kathleen shows in all the scenarios how people who modeled the past failed and how the simple route conquered the complex every time. She stresses that the philosophy, psychology, and the system itself may not be so simple, but the rules to follow are.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kathleen and Michael go on to discuss people who make a living out of of being complicated. Lawyers, accountants, lobbyists make a living out of having a lot of rules nobody can decipher. Kathleen discusses the differences in risk adverse people, more strategic people and the people who just go ahead and wing it in business and in life. Kathleen explains her three step process in creating simpler guidelines. \u201cBottleneck\u201d is the 2nd rule in the three step process. The \u201cBottleneck\u201d is what keeps you from getting to the objective. It\u2019s what holds you up from moving forward.

Rob may not be a trader, but he is a serial entrepreneur. And trading at its heart, after all, is an entrepreneurial activity. Rob started early. When he was eight his parents purchased an Apple computer and he learned to code to create video games, and when he got into college he realized coding could be profitable. He asked himself, \u201cWhat can I do that I can leverage?\u201d In the late 90\u2019s he got his first paid job writing code for a consulting firm and around 2007/2008 he transitioned full time into creating and producing his own products.<br /><br />Rob talks about learning from every job and every encounter. He speaks to real life experience and how it is paramount to success. Rob was passionate from the start about coding. He did it long before he thought it could be a paying gig. Michael and Rob also give examples of why you need to start at the beginning and figure out how to build your audience. If you are in your 20\u2019s you especially need to realize that you don\u2019t know everything. You are missing something. No matter how smart and motivated you are, you need that real life experience.<br /><br />When trying to start your business Rob gives examples such as: pick a few people that resonate with you and focus in on them, only take the information you need at that point in time, and above all, stop shooting for the Zuckerberg \u201cdream\u201d. He sees so many businesses trying to be a \u201cone hit wonder\u201d. They aren\u2019t thinking about building a business that is going to last.

Michael uses Jack Schwager and his books Market Wizards and The New Market Wizards as prime examples of timelessness. Although they were written years back, he argues they have not lost an ounce of value in today\u2019s trading world. Michael harps on critics that say the Market Wizards books have no place in 2015 markets, noting that one of the great concepts introduced in Schwagers\u2019 books was the notion of \u201csystems\u201d. Although the concept of having a system had been around for over 100 years, Schwager was one of the first to present and teach in an interview format.<br /><br />Michael then segues into a clip with Howard Lindzon of Stock Twits. Howard further makes the point that having \u201cAny system is better than no system\u201d. He goes on to say, \u201cYou have to have a system to beat another system.\u201d Howard talks about Jerry Parker, his trading style and why he has become so successful. Covel asks listeners, \u201cWhat kind of system do you want? What are the risks and rewards? There are all kinds of systems out there. Have you done the work to find out the pros and cons? What kind of life do you want to have?\u201d The system you choose will dictate that. People who tell you the Schwager books are dated are the same people that will sell you anything. These people go off of gut, intuition or even magical feelings, and that is their decision-making process. Trust that the highest achievers and money-makers on Wall Street trust their systems, painstakingly researched and developed. When times are good they leave it alone, and when times are bad they leave it alone.<br /><br />Covel plays one last legacy excerpt from Bill Dunn. Dunn lays out that his approach is long term trend following and quantitative. His company does not override their signals ever and they have serious risk management programs in place. They have a 1% probability of losing 20% or more in a one month period. However, the client can choose more or less risk. He shows how his firm does not correlate with the S&amp;P and their positions and trades are completely transparent to their clients. Dunn makes it clear that his performance is not a result of anyone\u2019s judgment. It is a result of long tested simulations and models.

Michael first heard of Emil from former turtle, Lucy Wyatt. The first thing to note is that he is not a trend following trader. He is a commodity spread trader. Emil has been a CTA since 1997, but his first trading experience was at the early age of 12. Emil delivered papers when he was younger and would take the money and invest in rare coins. The owner of the coin store happened to be a commodity trader. He helped teach Emil about trading commodities and even put in trades for him. Emil\u2019s first trading job was in 1986 at the age of 21.<br /><br />Michael and Emil start the podcast explaining spread trading. Emil describes trend following as one dimensional whereas spread trading in his view has a multidimensional trading surface because of all the directions a trade can profit rather than if the market only goes up or down. Emil refers to his trading as not systematic but model driven. At the base of his every trade is a model and they can tweak the model accordingly as they see fit\u2013a big distinction compared to trend following.<br /><br />Emil\u2019s firm is one of the only CTA\u2019s that are negatively correlated to trend followers.

Unknown to most, Earl Weaver, the Orioles manager, had a strategy that was a foundation for the book (and later turned Hollywood movie) \u201cMoneyball\u201d.

After getting into karate at the age of 10, he moved into lifting weights at the age of 14 and fell in love instantly with the sport.

There is no pressure.\u201d Keep the competition going with yourself. Also, have a good balance of work and time off.

Hitchens is certain that he doesn\u2019t know, and sees doubt and skepticism as our only path to enlightenment. He invites us to open up to the possibility that doubt will always be in front of faith\u2013whatever that faith may be about. Covel sees Hitchens insights well beyond religion, and connects his comments to his trading world.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Next, Michael excerpts a recent soundbite from Jim Simons on Trend Following. He is one of the most successful traders ever. A great track record. 100% systematic. Uses price action. He is very clear that fundamental analysis is not his direction. How does Simons really trade? Will we ever know? No. Simons is tight lipped. Is Simons a trend follower? Does he use trend following at all? Worthy questions given his limited public statements. Covel digs into Simons recent comments about trend following asking the hard questions few are prepared to pose.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Lastly, Covel brings in Alan Watts to connect both Hitchens and Simons. Watts wonders why children have been forced into a learning process that doesn\u2019t help them in the long run. He sees culture as leaving children at a disadvantage. He points out that the rules of the game are not given to children. Children are strung along. The powers that be keep key information away from the child, and even the adult, forcing them to always rely on the system. So while everyone is in desperate need of the future, ignoring the present moment is inevitable. Covel easily connects this to the markets and trading reminding us all that the gatekeepers are not your friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Christopher Hitchens on certainty v. uncertainty</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Jim Simons on Trend Following</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Faith v.

Feng Shui, as Joey explains it, is \u201cabout how your environment supports you\u201d. Further digging into the subject, Joey and Michael examine the world as a network of positive and negative energies.</p>\n<p>After explaining some of the core principles of Feng Shui, Joey discuss how the practice has been \u201cbastardized\u201d by the West. Westerners believe it\u2019s the items themselves that project energy \u2013 resulting in an entire trinket industry that has developed \u2013 when nothing could be further from the truth. The items exist merely for the energy to flow around because, as Joey explains, flow is everything.</p>\n<p>Joey then goes on to discuss the myriad ways in which the tenets of Feng Shui apply to the business world.

Collectively, this energy is called the \u201ccorporate culture.\u201d But each individual environment is governed by a dominant energy, and that energy is determined by the company leaders.

Sometimes making the right move means going against your instincts, and it\u2019s at these times that\u00a0you need to force yourself to make a decision \u2013 even if it means quitting. People tend to equate quitting with failure when the truth, as Michael points out, is that sometimes quitting is what keeps you in the game.\u00a0This line of thinking is again linked to logic rather than faith \u2013 the erroneous faith that if you necessarily stick it out (i.e. a losing trade in the markets) success will follow.</p>\n<p>Other topics covered in this episode touch on how financial advisors primarily exist to push mutual funds and buy and hold orthodoxy, why investing without a plan dooms you before you begin, and why embracing the challenge of how the world and investing really works makes you a smarter investor.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logic over faith</li>\n<li>Financial advisors: there to give mutual fund advice</li>\n<li>Adapting your strategy</li>\n<li>How quitting can keep you in the game</li>\n<li>Forcing yourself to make decisions</li>\n<li>Risk and reward</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want a FREE Trend Foll\u043ewing DVD?

Gabriel points out that in the business world traction is about far more than simply getting a grip and hanging in there \u2013 it\u2019s about then moving forward, ultimately toward a defined goal (customers).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Just like a trend following trader that uses quantitative methods to invest scientifically, Gabriel relies on numbers and hard data to inform him about which marketing channels are working and which should be focused on, and which are less effective and should be dropped. The result is a streamlined marketing approach that\u2019s allowed Gabriel, a self-published author, to sell upwards of 35,000 copies of his book.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Michael and Gabriel also talk about how psychology factors into startup entrepreneurship. For anyone investing their time and energy into a project, both passion and resiliency are paramount. If you aren\u2019t passionate about the work you\u2019re doing, and if you don\u2019t genuinely enjoy the challenge of bringing a product to market, then you\u2019re doomed before you ever start.

From gamblers to pharmaceutical executives to those in the film and music industries, trend following is a strategy rooted in human nature itself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">As an example, Michael examines the success of film producer Jason Blum. In direct opposition to the Hollywood mantra of Spend! Spend! Spend!, Blum has chosen another path. Blum, recognizing that big budgets don\u2019t necessarily mean big profits, developed a filmmaking system based on low budget projects. Blum fully understands that close to half of his films will flop. But he also understands that a handful of box office successes will more than cover those losses. This is the essence of trend following.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Michael goes on to quote from a 2005 article by best-selling author Michael Crichton. Crichton, talking about the then-burgeoning field of futurism, explains that these so-called futurists don\u2019t actually know any more about the future than the average man on the street.

Paul is president of Decision Research and a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, and today he talks with Michael about the science behind risk perception.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">To demonstrate how people tend to conflate actual risk with their perceptions of risk, Michael and Paul discuss a topic that\u2019s always been a hot button issue in the public consciousness, nuclear power. In the early days of this industry, people were rightfully concerned with the possible mismanagement of such a potentially dangerous technology \u2013 concerns seemingly crystallized by the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979. Similar concerns continue to be raised today, particularly in light of the Fukushima disaster of 2011. But as Paul explains, neither of these tragedies can completely outweigh the obvious benefits of nuclear power. It\u2019s a case of risk perception to overcome the actual risk posed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The conversation also focuses on the role of the media in influencing people\u2019s decision-making processes. Why is it, you might ask, that the media spends so much more time pushing negative stories than positive ones? The answer, according to Paul, goes back to biology. It\u2019s a survival mechanism in human beings that we\u2019re affected far more by negative stimuli than positive stimuli. This makes sense when you consider the external dangers we\u2019ve faced in our evolution.

Later, Michael asks Lawrence to talk about the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and how, since the subprime crisis of 2008, many are looking at the VIX as long-term insurance for the future. One of the problems with that strategy, as Lawrence points out, is that many people fail to take into account that VIX only measures market expectations for the next 30 days.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Also discussed today are leverage as a financial tool and the concept of the black swan \u2013 unforeseen events that have a major impact, but only rationalized after the fact.

Language is best learned by immersing yourself in the culture of the people who speak it.

This, as Michael points out, is certainly true for trend following traders, and some of the sharpest push back comes from the talking heads of the media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">To emphasize his point, Michael plays clips from an interview between CNBC\u2019s Joe Kernen and Graham Capital\u2019s Ken Tropin, a highly successful trader who heavily incorporates trend following techniques into his overall strategy. To Michael, of utmost significance in the two men\u2019s exchange, is the fact that Kernen bumbles through the interview wholly unprepared (either via incompetence or on purpose). Kernen didn\u2019t respect Tropin or his strategy enough to do even the most basic homework beforehand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Michael\u2019s discussion then moves on to the topic of uncertainty. In direct opposition to media personalities, that are paid to pretend to know what the market will do, trend following traders embrace the knowledge that they can\u2019t predict the future. Uncertainty makes the game more exciting, and not just the investment game.

Michael Covel and Annie Duke discuss several of the countless ways in which the psychology of gambling overlaps with that of trading, investment and other aspects of business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Annie explains the importance of thinking probabilistically for decision-makers. Gamblers, like investors, can sometimes become so focused on their losses that it begins to affect their decision-making process in a negative way. Annie calls this \u201ctilt\u201d and says it occurs when players put too much emphasis on outcome. She points out that so long as you are getting an overall return on your investment via a positive expectation, small losses should be both expected and absorbed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Michael and Annie also discuss further in depth expectancy and how the top minds in both trading and gambling think about the long-term. When involved with risk, it is always important to think realistically. If there is a 90% chance of success, don\u2019t round it up to 100% simply to boost your confidence. This way, if the venture fails, you won\u2019t feel the need to discard your strategy since there was always that 10% chance of failure. Overall, your odds of success are still very good. This is why Annie\u2019s thinking is so important for all of us.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">In this episode of Trend Following Radio:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Focusing on the process instead of the outcome</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Understanding that it\u2019s about your return, not you winning percentage</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Recognizing that in investing, consistency is unnatural</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Thinking probabilistically</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Maximizing your expectancy</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Understanding that a loss doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect bad thinking</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Want a FREE Trend Following DVD?\u00a0 Get it <a href=\"http://trendfollowing.com/win\">here</a>.</span></p>", "duration": "55:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/ce/d9/79/ced97981-f6a1-9ba5-736f-b80236dccd64/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/trendfollowing/377.mp3?dest-id=88838", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 151217747, "seriesTitle": "Trend Following with Michael Covel", "pubDate": 1440986400, "title": "Ep. 376: Overcoming Bias with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"border: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; margin: 1.6em 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Human beings have a strange habit of trusting other humans, even when the trust isn\u2019t warranted.

All three talking about systems and or trend following. The important point about systems is not just selecting the right one, but also sticking to it once selected. Often people are tempted to make discretionary calls and override a system, defeating its original purpose. Instead, the potential rewards and risks inherent in a trend following system should be evaluated at the beginning, discretionary calls made at the outset, then let the system run without interference.

Trend following is inherently simple to understand, and does not require above-average intelligence once the system is in place. Yet so many people, including most fund managers, tend to downplay trend following and keep seeking the \u201choly grail\u201d \u2013 a magical system that will supposedly make them money without any downside. An interesting metaphor for this that Chris offers is that of weight loss. Although the theory of it is simple (diet and exercise), most people keep seeking the magic bullet that will make them achieve results without following the system. Much the same with trading.</span></p>\n<p style=\"border: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; margin: 1.6em 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Another topic that Michael Covel and Chris Clarke talk about is understanding the difference between risk and drawdowns.

A quick search yields the following definition of speculation: \u201cforming a theory about a subject without firm evidence.\u201d Yet if we look at the origin of the word, \u201cspeculor\u201d means \u201cto observe\u201d in Latin. To speculate is to observe, and to make decisions based on those observations. In business and in life, there are ultimately two choices: to speculate or to gamble. The difference between the two is simple: the first has a strategy behind it; the second does not. The first relies on predetermined parameters for making decisions; while the second leaves decisions up to circumstance or emotion. In this monologue, Michael Covel talks about the philosophical foundation of success: speculation. This episode features many notable quotes from famous economists and traders, going back as far as the 1800s. The wisdom of these men is the foundation of trend following, and is as relevant today as ever. In this episode of the Trend Following podcast: why speculation is such an important concept, the philosophy behind trend following, watching results rather than causes, cutting short your losses, timeless excerpts from as early as the 1800s, and the early beginnings of Wall Street.

When a manager performs well over a number of years, it is not clear whether the success can be attributed to the manager\u2019s skill and strategy, or random luck. And vice versa, when a manager performs badly, it can be difficult to pin-point whether it was due to lack of skill, or simply bad luck. Another factor that is commonly misunderstood in finance is risk. Understanding the differences between risk, volatility, and skew is essential to developing a well-performing trading strategy. Campbell Harvey studies these phenomena. He is a finance professor at Duke university, and research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research in Massachusetts.

Originally profiled in the classic book 'The Market Wizards', Seykota has played a pivotal role in the growth of trend following trading for 40 years. This conversation breaks down into three parts: Govopoly, the Trading Tribe and trend following. Govopoly is Seykota's most recent book. In it he sees the economy transforming from a free and open societal structure to a controlled structure. The Govopoly system is taking over. It's not about another election to solve this, or to try and fix it. It is what it is and best we can all do is to cope with it. Seykota sees the Trading Tribe as one means of coping. The Trading Tribe is an association of people who commit to excellence, personal growth and supporting and receiving support from each other. The members of the Trading Tribe trade roles, becoming in turn senders and receivers for each other. Lastly, Seykota and Covel discuss trend following. Specifically, Seykota shares early experiences with Richard Donchian and his solo time with mainframes testing some of the first trend systems via computer.

First, Covel speaks of a recent case where a high school student was said to have made 72 million dollars. Of course, the story was false, but Covel explores. Many want to believe that these savants exist, but we all know the truth.

Casey is the founder and chairman of Casey Research, a provider of paid subscription newsletter services espousing libertarian viewpoints as the justification for the purchase of highly speculative microcap stocks, precious metals, and other investments.

Smith and Covel discuss how winners and are being selected by the state as exemplified by the 2008 financial crisis; alliances between corporations and the state; why there might be an uproar if equity markets were not at all-time highs; what happens when the typical wage earner can no longer substitute debt for earned income; stagnant wages and tradable labor; building your life around non state controlled opportunities; the decentralization of power and wealth; and the reliance on secrecy in politics to avoid accountability.

They discuss forecasters and prediction; the three types of forecasters; confirmation bias; how your political affiliation might change your willingness to listen to forecasts; value perspective vs. momentum perspective; the anomaly of momentum; the evidence-based thinking approach; momentum trading in 2008; how Swedroe prepares for the unexpected; not treating the unlikely like it\u2019s impossible; managing your risk; process vs. outcome; the equity risk premium and bear markets; commonplace crises; planning ahead; and diversification attempts to get outside of equities.

You can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow; you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going to happen to people in your life. You can just go with it--you can just keep on keeping on. But predicting tomorrow, thinking that you have an explanation as to how it\u2019s going to actually unfold? You\u2019re kidding yourself if you think you can predict tomorrow. People are paid a lot of money to pretend that they can predict tomorrow. But it is pretending, no doubt about it. Covel moves into his main topic for the day, noting that since March of 2009, stocks have taken off. It\u2019s a massive trend--a trend following dream for stocks. Covel also sees that the fundamental guys look at the all-time highs with justifications. Trend followers have no justifications. There have been millions of words since March of 2009 written by fundamental traders justifying the all-time highs, and people get paid a lot of money to write these justifications. What will all those words count for if the S&amp;P makes another 50% drop? How do you make a fundamental decision in the face of a game where fundamentally, the only thing you really have is \u201ccan you predict what the Federal Reserve will do next?\u201d Covel also shares some words of wisdom from trend following trader Jerry Parker that he obtained through a recent email, as well as words from Tom Basso and David Cheval. These traders all agree on one thing: ride the trend. Building on these thoughts, Covel moves into talking about football, Chip Kelly, the Philadelphia Eagles, Hal Mumme, and Mike Leach. Covel uses this as a metaphor for why you can\u2019t be a trend following trader in one market alone. So, if you can\u2019t predict tomorrow, what can you do? You can take what\u2019s given. You can take the trend that arrives. Want a free trend following DVD?

There\u2019s no doubt about it: it\u2019s soothing to have all-time highs in the equity market. Today, Covel wants a different perspective from what is out there in mainstream media. First, Covel talks about the S&amp;P 500 index. The S&amp;P is a trading system. It is a specific grouping of stocks put together with certain weightings and certain rules, and it trades in a certain way. And it has to stick to those rules. Covel talks about how the S&amp;P is a system despite most people not knowing that it is one. Covel compares this system to a trend following system (and notes how trend following is applicable to stocks too). Covel talks about the dangers of correlation if you apply your trend following strategy to only equities, and the importance of diversification across different markets. Next, Covel looks at the S&amp;P system vs. trend following systems in the context of crisis, and questions where the S&amp;P would be without zero interest rate policy and Fed intervention. Is the S&amp;P trading system that good that it will be at all time highs forever? Covel moves on to talk about black swans and anti-fragility in the context of the S&amp;P trading system.

It reminds Michael Covel of... The \u201cthis time is different\u201d routine. Covel moves on to talk about Timothy Geithner\u2019s new book, and how Warren Buffett approached him after bailouts. Covel talks about crony capitalism on both sides of the aisle. Rigged markets at all-time highs are not fun. It may feel great at the time, but there\u2019s a hangover. Covel shifts gears and talks about classical economics. It\u2019s all about assumptions that become axioms. Covel discusses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, and how the edges are indeed important. Covel can\u2019t predict or tell you when or how, but he can tell you that if you\u2019re in a position with a system to take advantage of price movements, you can benefit on the upside, the downside, and the black swan side. Next, Covel gives an example of someone who was mugged outside of a bar and became a mathematical savant after brain injury. Given these gifts, will he work for Wall Street? There are too many variables to make a prediction, he says. Next, Covel moves onto a TED talk. He\u2019s thought they\u2019ve always been enjoyable--until now. It turns out the TED operation operates like a cult, as evidenced by a clip from the Joe Rogan podcast. Covel wraps it all back to classical economics--it\u2019s a cult, too.

Covel likes the fact that when he goes through their references, it's all other academic white papers. Then, sandwiched in between the other white papers, \"The Complete TurtleTrader\" is referenced. Covel posted this on Twitter and received a response in which someone wanted to talk about the last couple of years of trend following performance. Trend following performance is going to differ depending on the trader, what\u2019s in their portfolio, the type of system they\u2019re trading, and the risk they\u2019re taking. There isn't some one magical elixir. Covel believes that you\u2019re better off in the long-term trend following world, rather than in the short-term world. Still, the person Covel interacted with on Twitter was not concerned with the two centuries of trend following that the white paper talked about, but rather, \"what have you done for me lately?\" Covel moves on to talk about a recent monologue he did concerning a Yahoo Finance article in which he questioned the vocabulary of the talking heads. Covel looks at the responses to that episode, and then the larger view: Most people don\u2019t have the foggiest clue what trading is; what Wall Street is. They\u2019ve been listening to nonsense in the media. The lure is still out there. The buy and hold lure is still out there. But even worse is that \"get rich quick\" attitude. People don\u2019t understand it as a science. Covel looks at at \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and analyzes a segment from the movie. Covel uses it as an example of how most people view money-making and Wall Street. People don\u2019t think like Covel\u2019s podcast guests and writing subjects; they don\u2019t think like Marty Bergin at Dunn Capital or Ed Seykota. This is what Covel is up against.

Covel dissects the terminology and words used by the media, and the position of the talking heads on this Yahoo Finance article. First, inspired by Larry Tentarelli, Covel discusses the idea of researching stocks. There is advice that says you should be doing one hour of fundamental research per week on every stock you own. If you own 50 stocks, that's 50 hours a week. Covel thinks this advice is asinine, and points out that the best traders don't do that. If the best traders in the world don't do that, why should you? It doesn't matter what the research tells you; if you don't have a stop loss, you're going to lose your money. Period. Covel then moves on to the Jeff Macke/Michael Santoli segment and dissects it each step of the way. Covel breaks down the terminology, including \"crowded longs\", \"chatter from brokerage firms\", and \"hedge fund favorites\". Covel also discusses how we don't know the why behind bubbles, inspired by his Justin Fox interview from a few days ago. Covel also discusses why you don't need to know what a good price is on the way down; defining \"smart money\", \"aggressively buying\", and \"leadership\" in a trading system; and whether or not the market is \"anxious\". Covel ends with something inspired by James Altucher's article, \"Ten Reasons You Have To Quit Your Job In 2014\". Want a free trend following video?

It linked to a CNBC interview with an analyst named Brian Shannon. Covel plays the CNBC clip and gives commentary at specific points. Covel shares the technical analysis viewpoint with Shannon, but disagrees when it comes to price targets. Covel also points out some terms that aren\u2019t part of the vocabulary of a trend following trader. A pure, predictive technical analyst could go that direction, but that\u2019s not trend following. Covel isn\u2019t trying to slam Shannon, who is trying to fight the good fight from a price action perspective. Rather, Covel focuses on CNBC\u2019s coverage and one particular talking head who has no idea about technical analysis. Covel points out that even if you\u2019re a purely fundamental trader, you have to know what trend following is, what it does, and how it behaves. Covel focuses on price action and momentum, not Tesla\u2019s latest announcement. Shannon concludes by talking about risk management, which Covel then discusses. Covel ruminates on why trend following and technical analysis are so confused, and talks about the difference between predictive and reactive technical analysis. Continuing on with another example, Covel tells a story about a young man he met who invested in $10,000 worth of Facebook stock, and why it\u2019s important to have an exit plan. Covel was forwarded the young man\u2019s blog post, which stated the decision to invest in Facebook was based off a wealthy friend\u2019s advice. If you\u2019re going to follow advice, make sure it isn\u2019t made up out of thin air. If you\u2019re going to follow a thought process about how money is made, you have to scientifically dig in and look at the process. If not, it\u2019s just gambling. To close out, Covel talks about a piece he re-read from Malcolm Gladwell about how Nassim Taleb first met Victor Niederhoffer. Want a free trend following DVD?

How is it all related? Covel explores. First, Covel opens with a quote from Martin Bergin of Dunn Capital: \u201cEverything we do is 100% systematic. There\u2019s no over-ride, no individual decision-making whatsoever. That is the focus of the firm.\u201d Covel moves into a clip from David Harding on Bloomberg. Harding doesn\u2019t completely obliterate Eurgene Fama\u2019s work, but he says, although his work is academic beauty, it doesn\u2019t beat the performance of trend following. Covel then moves into Hugh Hendry. Although not a trend follower per se, he has often said things that are extremely trend following. The quote the Covel explores today, however, gives a clearer picture of Hendry's strategy (its not TF). Next, Covel discusses a documentary produced by Penn and Teller on the Dutch master, Vermeer, who may have used a tool to complete some of his paintings. The analogy to trading is there. There\u2019s a system; there\u2019s a process; there\u2019s a model. Whether in painting, or whether in trading. Next, Covel talks about the Pope\u2019s recent statement on economic inequality. Covel talks about how anyone who wants the politicians to legislate inequality is extremely naive. They have a vested self-interest. Covel moves on to talk about acroyoga, which he\u2019s been practicing for the last several months. It\u2019s reinforcing the idea of deliberate practice in Covel. That\u2019s how Bergin makes that statement, and how Harding is so confident about trend following: They\u2019ve been down the path of deliberate practice. Want a free trend following DVD?

We all know that markets are volatile. They go up and down. You can get hurt, and getting hurt is part of the game. Even though you can get hurt in the markets or life, that doesn't stop people from pretending. Covel gives some examples to illustrate, and makes an analogy to the Federal Reserve. How have we gotten to the point where some failure, some losing, has been deemed so inappropriate that we're going to try and protect everyone and everything? This has become the way of the markets; the way of life. However, the markets and life are rough. But if the vast majority of people are just trusting their money to a big monolith of a machine, that gives you a leg up. If you have rules that are opposite to what the vast majority of people are doing, that should give you an edge.

Who cares what the instrument is? It's irrelevant. The only relevant issue is: what is the strategy and how can it help the end user? Covel discusses \"managed futures\", black box trading, Ray Dalio, Bill Dunn, and an article called \"How Investors Lose 89% of Gains From Futures Funds\". Covel moves onto the confusion with the phrase trend following and brings up a company named FX Concepts and its leader John Taylor. Yet is this doomed 14B hedge fund really trend following? Covel sees prediction, an assortment of other strategies, and efforts to forecast what the next government move is going to be. That's not trend following.

For example, the Wal-Mart heirs have the same wealth as the bottom 30-40% of America's entire population. Covel thinks that when it comes to the inequality debate, however, that the government is ultimately responsible for inequality. They're pimping out the American people to large operations, whether that's banks, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and or fast food companies. Covel gets into specifics about this \"pimping\" behavior discussing how else the government creates inequality and discusses mandated healthcare. In the midst of all this chaos, there are trends--big ones. Covel notes that one of those trends is Singapore, and how it appears to be Ayn Rand's \"Galt's Gulch\". Average as a state of mind--is the poison to eliminate. Who wants to be average? You have to figure out a way to make yourself valuable--above average.

When it comes to tomorrow, Covel is majorly uncertain. He doesn't know what's going to happen. He can think of the worst case scenarios, though; a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism\" target=\"_blank\">Stoic tradition</a>. Many people today figure the crisis of '08 was a few years back, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">the Fed</a> has everything figured out, and the stock market is at all time highs. There's nothing to be worried about. Covel reads several quotes to start off the podcast, from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilda_Radner\" target=\"_blank\">Gilda Radner</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\" target=\"_blank\">Richard P. Feynman</a>. Covel questions why most investors don't think like this, and notes that 59% of US investors believe the markets can be predicted. Covel discusses the trend following mindset in contrast, and moves on to talk about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Dalio</a> and his 100% systematic trading strategy based on fundamentals. But how do you know when you have enough fundamental data to make a decision? How do you account for the remaining uncertainty? Covel explores. Next, Covel talks about using simple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic\" target=\"_blank\">heuristics</a> to make decisions. The simplest factor to follow is the price. That's the only thing you can be certain about. So if you can make decisions off price movement, and use that as a simple heuristic for your buying and selling decisions, you might have something that works for dealing with market uncertainty. From a trend following perspective, simple heuristics is all about trading the price.

The idea is to be above average and to do the best for your life and your situation. That's the objective.

Next, Covel plays a clip from former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB\" target=\"_blank\">Russian KGB</a> officer Yuri Bezmenov in which he talks about the four step process that forces people to become lost; the four steps which can be used to change the thinking and behavior of entire generations. Demoralization, destabilization, crisis, and normalization. The normalization can last forever. That's what's happening in modern day society. If that is it, the idea of David Harding being curious and looking outside the box (or inside the box as the \"Embrace The Shake\" video says) is more important than ever. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking\" target=\"_blank\">Critical thinking</a> is everything.

It's always \"trend followers have drawdowns\". It's like a broken record.

Don't just trust Covel: look at the data. Next, Covel talks about advising people in their 20s against buying real estate. Many, many areas of real estate in the US that are underwater: are all of these people simpletons, dummies? Or did they get caught up in the greed and the fear of a bubble, and a black swan hit? Covel goes on to talk about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swans</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_interest-rate_policy\" target=\"_blank\">zero interest rate policy</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_and_bust\" target=\"_blank\">bubbles</a> (and why there is a way around it all). Next, Covel talks about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture\" target=\"_blank\">nurture vs. nature</a>. Of course, when he talks about nurture vs. nature, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061241717/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Turtle story</a> must be brought up.

Like that classic scene from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction\" target=\"_blank\">Pulp Fiction</a>, the gimp is the average investor. The gimp is the investor that isn't in control, either by their own choice or choices put upon them. They are left to the machinations and maneuvers of forces. They don't think clearly; they don't know how to make a decision. Their decision is simple: sit tight and trust the powers that be. That's what <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Covel</a> calls \"Gimp Investing\". If you don't want to be a gimp investor you have to figure out a way to think; a way to be skeptical. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism\" target=\"_blank\">Skepticism</a> is where it begins. If you can be a skeptic, then you have a chance. Covel talks about \"digging\" for information; taking the information that's given to you and sorting it out for truth. Covel moves on to the comparison between digging for information and digging for dinosaurs. This idea of thinking and seeing what the data shows--not just trusting the system and the stories--is exactly what skepticism is all about. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Horner_%28paleontologist%29\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Horner</a>, the paleontologist, is one of the greats in his field. He's figured out that dinosaurs built nests, lived in colonies, traveled in herds, and that their skulls changed shape from childhood into adulthood. Most of this was not common knowledge until Horner came around. Horner walked into it wide-eyed; he didn't have a plan. He said, \"What can I deduce from this that makes the most sense?\" Covel talks about how much this compares to his early experience with looking at the data of trend following traders. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">Trend following </a>is the other side of the coin to gimp investing. It says if you're willing to take those small losses, you're almost invincible. As long as you can come back to play the next day and you can take those small losses, it puts you in the position where if the black swan comes in, you're prepared. When the gimp style stops working trend following gives you a chance to survive. Covel ends with a clip of Jack Horner. It's useful to hear how an expert goes on to learn. It's not linear learning; if you're trying to make chaos a straight line you're going to have a rough life. Attach Horner's words to good trend following trading and it all connects.

Give me something I can believe in.\" That's what most people believe, even if it's a fantasy. <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Covel</a> discusses what makes a good teacher, and brings up one quote in particular: \"A good teacher is one who will not give you an answer, but will allow you to find the answer in yourself. A teacher is a guide. He or she will show you that the answer is inside you, and that there is a right answer.\" Michael Covel discusses a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hussman\" target=\"_blank\">John Hussman</a> quote and explores \"right\" and \"wrong\" answers. Hussman's comments are not about trading; trend followers don't attempt to make the analysis that he does. Trend followers don't analyze how poor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke\" target=\"_blank\">Bernanke</a>'s policies may or may not be; trend followers do not attempt to say whether <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">Fed</a> policies are good or bad. You don't make money trying to make those judgments. Covel discusses some of the comments he received after posting the Hussman quote, noting some supportive Fed comments. Of course, none of these views are relevant to trend following trading. But as a human being--as a thinking person--Covel discusses some Fed policies. Covel's point here is to get you to think: Do you just want to trust the system? With stock markets at all-time highs and interest rates low that everything is rosy and everyone has it figured out? With the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500\" target=\"_blank\"> S&amp;P</a> having collapsed 50% two times in the past fifteen years do you want to trust that it can't happen again? Do you want to trust that the DOW really can't go from 15,000 to 7,500? This is what Hussman is really getting at. Unlike a trend following trader Hussman is getting at why these machinations and maneuvers of the Fed really don't last. The beast can't be contained. So will you have a plan when all hell breaks loose? Nothing can contain<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\"> market volatility</a>; it always comes back. And sometimes markets don't recover: look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\" target=\"_blank\">Japan</a>. Covel asks, \"do you want to trust the system, or do you want to have control of your life to some degree?\" Bottom line, you can make\u00a0 money when the central planning plans break down. Finally, Covel ends today's show with a long clip from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hendry\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Hendry</a> that gets at the issue of what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">capitalism</a> is today.

Ultimately it's about science; the science of what the market is doing. Covel reads a blog excerpt from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Carroll</a>, and goes over a three-part definition of what makes up science to further comment on the CNBC clip. Covel just wants to make the point: you have to look through the haze to find out what's really going on. You have to break it down to science.

We don't think about it regularly when it comes to our money, but understanding our emotions is core to investing. Those emotions tie right into when you buy and when you sell. If you think you're going to become a successful trader without obliging the emotional side of the coin, you're wrong. First, <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Covel</a> talks about the idea of multitasking, discussing an article called \"<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201304/issie-lapowsky/get-more-done-dont-multitask.html\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Multitask, Your Brain Will Thank You</a>\". Research shows that chronic multitasking can have long-term effects on your brain's functioning. Applied to trading what if instead of the chronic multitasking associated with fundamental analysis you could just focus on one thing? What if you could just reduce it all into something simple to digest? That's where trend following makes sense. Covel moves on and gives an example of a doctor friend who is confused with current markets. Related to that, Covel also discusses an article in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal </a>by Brenda Crane. There has to be a new way of looking at the investing landscape that can provide some sort of \"emotional rescue\". Covel moves on to another Wall Street Journal article titled \"<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323550604578413162718644332.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Cold Truth About Emotional Investing</a>\" and the idea of the \"fantastic object\", as well as a clip from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a> on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics\" target=\"_blank\">behavioral finance</a>. So once you have this understanding that we're facing this multitasking hell, we need a way to decipher the hieroglyphics of the market, i.e. all the conflicting information. Covel's doctor friend is not the only one confused. Flow is one way to avoid the distraction, and Covel shares a classic<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee\" target=\"_blank\"> Bruce Lee</a> clip to illustrate the trend following mindset. Markets going down are only bad if you're only betting for them to go up. Go with the flow. Avoid distractions. Avoid multitasking. Then what? You need a process; you need a system to tell you when to buy and sell. And even if you get the monetary success, what are you going to do? Just buy stuff? Emotions come into the picture again...even when you're successful. Covel brings up an article called \"<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21579799-smarter-ways-spend-buy-buy-love\" target=\"_blank\">Buy Buy Love</a>\" in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist\" target=\"_blank\">Economist</a> about the most satisfying ways to spend your money. In the end, it's all about the tools you have in place to keep your emotions in check. Want a free trend following DVD?

The US stock markets have had a lot of volatility this past week. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke\" target=\"_blank\">Bernanke</a> might be moving on; there might be a replacement. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing\" target=\"_blank\">QE</a> might be ending. People are preparing for that or maybe not that. In reality, you can't predict anything. That's why Covel opens up today's podcast with an old heavy metal ode to fantasy. Can you believe what your eyes are showing you? Even if you have the perspective to see beyond the fantasy, do you have a tool to make money in these volatile markets? Of course, markets go through periods, cycles of volatility. It's nothing new. The key is, can you be detached? Can you view it as a game? Can you observe and tune it all out emotionally? It's that kind of mindset where you'll make the best decisions. Covel moves on to discuss a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_%28conference%29\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a> called \"<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/didier_sornette_how_we_can_predict_the_next_financial_crisis.html\" target=\"_blank\">We Can Predict The Next Financial Crisis</a>\" by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Sornette\" target=\"_blank\">Didier Sornette</a>. Covel shares some beliefs with him, but as Covel opened up talking about dreams and fantasy, prediction is just the same: a fantasy. Even if you could predict the next financial crisis, we make the assumption that prediction equals profit. Even if you could predict, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to profit. Profit comes from having a specific set of rules that tell you when to buy, when to sell, and how much to buy or sell. Covel agrees with some of what Sornette says, but is anybody making money with it? Sornette says that his predictions work, but it's not tied to real money? Sornette's hope is that never again will there be a financial crisis that will take us by surprise, yet does anyone buy that? Human nature will now end due to his predictions? Covel thinks it sounds like a bunch of bull, and explains why. The ability to predict tomorrow is a dream. It's not something you should be thinking about. It's not a useful endeavor for your life. Instead of trying to predict tomorrow why not just react to what happens with the trend following way of being? React to market movements, follow along, and be prepared for the bubble, the crisis, the unforeseen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100-year_flood\" target=\"_blank\">100-year flood</a>. Trend following is the best solution for that. Prediction is just a dream. Want a free trend following DVD?

Collins was the managing editor at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_%28magazine%29\" target=\"_blank\">Futures Magazine </a>for over a decade, and has talked with many trend following traders. Recently, he put out an interesting post on his website commenting on an article called \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6469d82-cd3e-11e2-9efe-00144feab7de.html#axzz2fq0qxwrB\" target=\"_blank\">Quant Hedge Funds Hit By US Bonds Sell-Off</a>\" which originally appeared in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Times</a>. Covel and Collins discuss the article and other subjects such as why trend followers are speculators rather than investors; why the Financial Times article showed a misunderstanding of trend following in general; headlines and what drives them; equity-centric writers; why long term trend following is disrespected and why there is a bias towards higher frequency, shorter term traders; why keeping it simple is a good strategy; fees in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_futures_account\" target=\"_blank\">managed futures</a> and options industry; \"volatility value trading\"; \"style drift\"; why quality <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> traders under the umbrella of \"managed futures\" allow some lesser strategies to \"free ride\" on their success; different time horizons in trend following; and why trend following is declared \"dead\" so often. Collins also shares his views on several traders (<a href=\"http://www.michaelcovel.com/2005/06/06/michael-j-clarke/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Clark</a>, Bob Moss, <a href=\"http://www.dunncapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Dunn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.abrahamtrading.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Salem Abraham</a>, and<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eckhardt_%28trader%29\" target=\"_blank\"> Bill Eckhardt</a>) with short synopses of their styles and trading personalities.

If you've listened to him more than once, it's probably because you relate. He wants you to show him the truth. He's agnostic to the market, too; he knows that price is the only truth. Covel starts off today's episode with a song from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTC\" target=\"_blank\">XTC</a> that reflects that sort of agnosticism. In a continuing search for more truth, Covel spends the rest of the episode providing commentary on a speech called \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3If06Diya_Q\" target=\"_blank\">God Is A Genius Because He Is A Sloth</a>\" by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hendry\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Hendry</a>, who has become a fairly noteworthy hedge fund manager in recent years. Covel points out that Hendry doesn't appear to be a trend following trader; at least not in the classical sense. But his response to questions will make you think. Covel discusses elements of Hendry's speech that includes the impossibility of being able to predict the future; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">emotional intelligence</a>; \"not wanting to know\"; why procrastination can kill you; disciplined curiosity; being agnostic to the market; being wary of \"the brightest guy in the room\"; and why falling in love with your analysis is not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management\" target=\"_blank\">risk management</a>.

They know what the deal is. Unfortunately, Covel's home country of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_%28country%29\" target=\"_blank\">America</a> seems to only pretend that there are certain basic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties\" target=\"_blank\">civil liberties</a>; that you have a right to privacy. In the midst of the revelations that have occurred surrounding the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency\" target=\"_blank\">NSA</a> scandal, Covel discusses an article titled \"<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324634304578537720921466776.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Brother Is Really Watching Us</a>\". Covel talks about the extraordinary invasion of privacy we're experiencing and why people don't seem to care. If the revelation is that the United States government is basically spying on everybody, it says that things are extremely unpredictable. In Covel's world--the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a> world--you can benefit from the chaos. The extravaganza happening right now is just another example of why you can't trust the system. You have big brother tracking everything you do, so why do some people not seem to care? Covel explores, questioning whether there is a grand <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Stockholm Syndrome</a> present in the US today. Covel surmises that the unpredictability today means that we'll have chaos and market movement. So how do you make money in this situation, where you can't trust <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_%28United_States%29\" target=\"_blank\">Social Security</a> or retirement programs, or what the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve</a> is going to do next? You need to be in an absolute returns mindset. The idea of going for the averages, mimicking the index, is going to keep you by definition average. In the midst of the chaos, trend following is a fantastic opportunity. Covel also comments on an article by Sam Jones which doesn't seem to understand that trend followers have losing months, which gives way to a conversation on media manipulation of trend following strategies. Covel doesn't care about the masses that are frightened; they're just going to stay frightened. He wants to help people that want to see it clearly for the first time and get motivated, or just to reinforce those out there that already acknowledge the chaos and still want to make money in this crazy environment. Don't trust that the man behind the curtain will take care of you. You can get ahead in an unpredictable world, and trend following is a great way to benefit from the chaos.

Cuban says some not-so-kind words about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold\" target=\"_blank\">buy & hold</a>, and notes several other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> concepts along the way: don't just put positions on your account just to have them; take action when the market moves. Cuban's success doesn't mean we should blindly follow his wisdom, but shouldn't you be curious if someone like Cuban calls buy and hold a \"crock of sh*t\"? Covel often hears people say, \"I can't be a trend following trader because I can't take the drawdowns\". But at least with trend following you've got a chance to make a heck of a lot more money. Cuban also makes a great point regarding volatility. You can't make big profits without volatility. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Bogle</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard\" target=\"_blank\">Vanguard</a> fame came out squarely against Cuban, and Covel plays another clip. Covel critiques the clip and discusses \"the average investor\", exit strategies, and Bogle's view of buy & hold investing. When do you get out of a buy and hold strategy? What if you pick the wrong decade? What if, when you retire, it's the fall of 2008? Bogle says to expect two 50% drawdowns in the next ten years. You might see that in a trend following strategy too, but at least your upside makes it worth the investment. Bogle notes that all investing could be considered \"buy & hold\". However, the strategy he vouches for is essentially buy & hold with no exit strategy. If you want to go ahead and call trend following buy & hold with an exit strategy, more power to you. But which do you want? A system with an exit strategy, or a strategy where you're put in a position that makes you have to trust the system? A system where you have to trust that you'll exit at the exact right time? Covel isn't saying it'll be the exact right time for trend following either, but historically, trend following has a chance to make so much more money. So if there are mistakes to be made, if things don't happen at the exact right time for you, at least you've made that much more money along the way. This is your money. What else are you gonna do? Rely on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_%28United_States%29\" target=\"_blank\">Social Security</a>? It basically guarantees to take your money and earn you less than inflation. That's what you're up against. You've only got one life. Put your kids on the right path. Break the cycle. Do something novel. Trend following is novel. It's fresh. Philosophically, psychologically, trend following makes a lot of sense. Take a chance on a strategy that isn't \"average\".

Organized education is broken and the typical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University\" target=\"_blank\">university </a>experience is a fraud. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure_%28academic%29\" target=\"_blank\">Tenu</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure_%28academic%29\" target=\"_blank\">red professors</a> make a ton of money, and students are stuck with hundreds of thousands of dollars of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt\" target=\"_blank\">debt</a>. The whole situation is vicious, and a student's best hope for a steady job after school is to serve lattes. Millions of people think that if they go and sit through classes at a university for four years, listen to professors who have never made an entrepreneurial dime in their life, that they'll be in a better position to make money. Covel discusses an essay found on <a href=\"http://www.oftwominds.com/\" target=\"_blank\">oftwominds.com</a> (<a href=\"http://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay13/genX5-13.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay13/genX5-13.html</a>) about one specific generation of college graduates. People don't want to talk about this, but the moment the US <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market\" target=\"_blank\">stock market</a> takes a prolonged dip, that's when the dam will break. Are there alternatives? Yes. With access to the internet, we're in a better place than ever before to educate ourselves. Covel further illustrates his view with excerpts: The first is from entrepreneur David Gilmour, who started <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji_Water\" target=\"_blank\">Fiji water</a>, extolling the virtues of travel. Next, Covel plays a clip of a<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_%28conference%29\" target=\"_blank\"> TED</a> talk from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_%28educationalist%29\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Robinson</a>, who talks about the connection between education and curiosity--which is the true engine of learning--and the difference between education and learning. Covel notes that it's not about following the rules; it's not about doing what you're told. Automation is eliminating so many blue and white-collar jobs so quickly, there's no hanging on anymore. So where does that leave the college student? The final excerpt comes from Angela Lee Duckworth, who talks about what she thinks the real key to success is: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_%28personality_trait%29\" target=\"_blank\">grit</a>. Passion and perseverance for long-term goals; stamina. Sticking with your future, day in, day out. Not just for the week or for the month, but for the rest of your life. Duckworth says that those with grit look at life like a marathon and not a sprint. Covel notes that the idea of grit works perfectly with trend following: it's a marathon. There are ups and downs, but over the long haul <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> grit delivers a healthy mind as well as a healthy wallet.

There's going to be volatility and you can't make it go away; to operate with variability as the norm is to be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trader. If you try and make it go away, you might end up falling with the next 50% drop in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P</a> killing your account. Because it will happen. There will be another major equity drop. There will be the same panics that we saw in 2000 and 2002, the fall of 2008, and October of 1987. Most people will lose 50% of their net worth because they don't have a strategy that deals with variability. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100-year_flood\" target=\"_blank\">100-year flood</a> doesn't happen every 100 years; it happens every 2-3 years. Covel moves into a clip with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harding_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">David Harding</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winton_Capital_Management\" target=\"_blank\">Winton Capital Management</a> and quotes author <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb\" target=\"_blank\">Nassim Taleb</a> about surviving when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swan</a> flies in. It's the difference between taking a punch when you're prepared for it or being caught off-guard with a punch to the gut when you least expect it. Those that simply buy and hold and put their trust into the government and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve</a>? They're the ones getting a punch to the gut that they don't see coming. Next, Covel moves into another clip from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Lewis</a> (author of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker\" target=\"_blank\">Liar's Poker</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball:_The_Art_of_Winning_an_Unfair_Game\" target=\"_blank\">Moneyball</a>\") about what was behind \"Moneyball\" and how rather than being a story about baseball it is about misinterpreting value and misappraisal. Building off what David Harding said, Lewis also talks about the idea of measuring, counting, and using statistics to make good judgments. What David Harding and Michael Lewis are getting at is not generally accepted. Most aren't paying attention. Covel shares a quote from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford</a> psychologist: \"A man with a conviction is a hard man to change. Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.\" In many ways, that's what Covel feels like when he's trying to get the ideas of trend following across; that's what he's up against. He's also up against the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold\" target=\"_blank\"> buy & hold</a> mutual fund industry, who love fees. They have no desire to tell their clients about trend following strategies, how to look at the world from a statistical perspective, or how to prepare yourself for the next black swan. Covel is fully aware of the controversial nature of his views and the idea of trend following in general, and he closes by reading a polemic and playing a clip from author <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Hitchens</a>, as well as another king of controversy: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Danzig\" target=\"_blank\">Glenn Danzig</a>.

Morgan</a>. In the first quarter they were profitable on 63 out of 63 trading days. Think you can develop a trading strategy that can compete with J.P. Morgan? You can't. What J.P. Morgan has done is not trading performance; it's an incestuous union between them, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\">United States government</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve</a>. You don't make money 63 out of 63 days trading. That's not trading; it's a gift. Of course, if you have a position in J.P. Morgan, that's great; ride the trend. But what's unfortunate is that we're in the middle of a societal tsunami on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street</a> that makes it very difficult for the average person to know what's real. To the average person that wants to learn about trading, J.P. Morgan's performance looks like a noble goal. Unfortunately, this level of making money has nothing to do with a trading strategy. It has everything to do with being in a symbiotic union with the government and the Federal Reserve. It's not trading, it's taking. Can you replicate a trading strategy where you get the same advantages that J.P. Morgan does? And what happens when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swan</a> flies in? Covel goes on to explain comparing the performance records of <a href=\"http://www.dunncapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Dunn</a> to J.P. Morgan. When these black swan events happen, strategies like Bill Dunn's excel, and fundamental strategies don't. It's that simple. You're left with the idea of worshiping a false idol (JP Morgan) or the Bill Dunn strategy that doesn't make money every day, but in the long haul makes more money and protects you when the tsunami hits. Covel closes by talking about the high priest himself, \"Venus\",<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett\" target=\"_blank\"> the man from Omaha</a>. Even though his fourth quarter profit rose 49% on gains tied to derivatives--derivatives that he once called \"weapons of mass destruction\"--it's no matter to his worshipers. Covel gives him all the credit in the world for amassing his great fortune; he's one of the greatest capitalists of all time. However, it's the disingenuous, manipulative nonsense of telling people not to trade derivatives but then doing it himself that really gets to Covel. Venus pretends that his words don't matter.

Starting off with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Melon\" target=\"_blank\">Blind Melon's</a> \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Rain\" target=\"_blank\">No Rain</a>\" Covel sets the groundwork for what's inspiring him today. This isn't a trading specific podcast today, at least for those of you out there that think that trading psychology and trading philosophy are irrelevant. Covel meets people all the time looking for the \"secret sauce\". Today, you aren't going to get the secret sauce; or at least the secret as you perceive it to be. Inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Godin</a>'s recent thoughts on being picked Covel talks about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Maron\" target=\"_blank\">Marc Maron</a>, a comedian who recently has found success through his own podcast. Covel talks about how Maron wasn't picked through traditional means: Meeting with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_Michaels\" target=\"_blank\">Lorne Michaels</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live\" target=\"_blank\">Saturday Night Live</a>, Maron's meeting went sideways, he was rejected, and he ultimately had to carve out his own path. Maron started a podcast which became viral, and now even though Lorne Michaels did not pick Marc Maron, Maron sits with his own destiny in front of him, chosen by him. All because he looked at the world slightly differently. Today, he enjoys massive success through an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation\" target=\"_blank\">IFC</a> television show, a new book, and a top rated podcast all because of setting out on his own path. Circumstances forced him to do this, but he learned that being picked was not the end all be all. Covel relates this back to his audience: you weren't picked for the trading job, you weren't picked for the investment banking team, and you're already psyching yourself out. A lot of people do this: they don't get picked and then complain for the rest of their lives and essentially quit. If you don't see the relevance in picking yourself to success in trading, you might not ever see it. Godin received complaints through his article on Marc Maron and Covel has received similar complaints which he retells here in the podcast. Some people want to do specific things. Doing \"this\" requires being picked: \"I want to play the flute in this particular orchestra\", \"I want to trade for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs</a>\". At the end of it all, there is a great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism\" target=\"_blank\">Buddhist</a> thought: \"Live like a mighty river\". A mighty river flows. A mighty river does not complain. A mighty river gets it done. Covel talks about his own experience of not being \"picked\" for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>. They were looking for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Cramer</a>, Jr. Covel went into the meeting with his eyes wide open and was looking to get the experience to pass along to you today that CNBC, behind the scenes, is a farce. Covel wanted to see behind the scenes for himself, and he got that opportunity being interviewed for CNBC. Covel wasn't picked by CNBC, but they weren't picked by Covel either. That's the attitude to have. Covel concludes with a recent story about being picked that he experienced himself in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand\" target=\"_blank\">Thailand</a>, and with what Godin says in his blog post: The problem is that it's frightening to pick yourself, Godin says. \"It's far easier to put your future into someone else's hands than it is to slog your way forward, owning the results as you go.\" Free trend following DVD?

Through five flights, four cities, untold hotel rooms, two speeches before crowds of 500 people, and over a dozen presentations in front of some of China's largest hedge funds, <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Covel </a>brings the wisdom gained through his excursion back to his podcast audience. First, he responds to a reader from China who heard about one of Covel's presentations, and the criticism that Covel didn't give the \"secret sauce\" to win at trend following. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dennis\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Dennis</a> was famous for saying that he could publish his rules in the newspaper and nobody would follow them, and Covel could explain exactly how to be a trend follower and it'd go over many heads. So it's not surprising that in a crowd of 500 some would have their expectations of learning about some kind of \"secret sauce\" not met. Covel isn't trying to impress that person, and they aren't the type of person that would ever get it anyway. They're looking for the shortcut-- the angle, the quick fix. If you have Covel speak to your group, after fifteen years of his life spent researching the topic and putting together the best educational materials for new and experienced traders alike, if your first thought is \"you didn't give me the secret sauce\", it might not be for you. But Covel did reach a great many people, and he got a great deal of excellent feedback. He discusses the typical Chinese investor mindset and what got them to take a second look at trend following. Covel also waxes on the idea of trust in China, the parallels to America, and how the acceptance of \"the new\" in China might go down easier than elsewhere. Next, Covel adds some lessons to the overall <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> education. Covel's journey shows that an outsider can get to be an insider. Unfortunately, one of the common questions posed to Covel by the media in China was to ask if any average person could succeed in trend following. Covel discusses how this is a defeatist question. If you consider yourself average: quit now. Suitability, however, is something different. Is trend following, or investing in general, suitable for everyone? If you don't have the education, it might not be. Covel also gives some examples from his journey that help to put trend following in context. Covel notes a bit of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship\" target=\"_blank\">censorship</a> in his presentations via the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Securities_Regulatory_Commission\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese regulatory committees</a>. One slide was not allowed in his presentation. What was that slide? Covel explains. Also, Covel recently discussed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Dalio</a> at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Associates\" target=\"_blank\">Bridgewater</a>, the biggest hedge fund on the planet. Covel reads a letter from a listener that gives anecdotal evidence about how Dalio could be a closet trend follower.\u00a0Want a free trend following DVD?

Covel opens up today's monologue distinguishing between the two by answering a piece of listener mail. Covel gives credit to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ferriss\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Ferris</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the four hour work week </a>mentality, and discusses his ability to work from abroad and travel to a different country every two weeks. Next, Covel answers a piece of listener mail regarding his recent comments on day traders. Covel just gives his view. He's done his homework, done the research, and put the proof out there. It's not just Covel pontificating only about how the world should be, but trying to be objective. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading\" target=\"_blank\">Day trading</a> track records don't appear to exist, while <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> has a track record that's available for anyone to see in the back of <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com/translations\" target=\"_blank\">Covel's books</a>. Tons of people out there imagine that day trading is a legitimate way to operate, but there's just no proof that it works. Next, Covel reads another piece of mail talking about poor returns of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund\" target=\"_blank\">hedge funds </a>in the first quarter, and how certain hedge fund managers had picked the wrong direction. Covel gives another <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Seykota\" target=\"_blank\">Seykota</a> quote on the matter: \"Artful politicians and religious leaders carefully keep their promises in the future, and their tithing and taxation in the now.\" Covel adds: Investing gurus are part of that list because investing gurus all want to be paid right now. Covel also talks about outlier events. Are you prepared for an outlier event? Whether a crazy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il\" target=\"_blank\">North Korean dictator </a>drops a nuke, whether one of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank\">central bank</a> policies across the world don't work as expected, or something else? What if the prescribed plan doesn't work? That's where fundamentals break down and when they do you need a plan. There's a great video that Covel posted recently by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_L._Smith\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Vernon Smith</a> stating that standard econometric models were not explaining what was happening in the real world. They weren't explaining <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble\" target=\"_blank\">bubbles</a>, and not until Dr. Smith started studying the psychology of how people behave did he finally start to understand what was going on. Are you going to believe that Vernon Smith and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Kahneman</a> had figured something out about the human psyche when it comes to markets and money, or are you going to trust that government agencies have figured it out and are going to manage it all for you perfectly? If you do trust Dr. Smith, as Covel highly recommends, how are you going to prepare for the next event? Do you really think there's a chance that the S&amp;P will only go up, and will never drop by 50% again? Get a strategy to help you out when there's an outlier move. That's the key.

Covel talks about some of his experiences is Singapore and Vietnam, but first he shares a quote from legendary trend following trader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Seykota\" target=\"_blank\">Ed Seykota</a> regarding day trading: \"Traders use it medicinally as distraction from deeper issues.\" Seykota has a remarkable ability to take complicated thoughts and reduce them down to only a few words, holding a mirror up to you and your life in the process. Covel talks about the \"screen watchers\" who have to look at their trades all day long and questions their performance. Where are all the day traders' performance data? They simply don't exist with only a few exceptions for big traders like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_A._Cohen\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Cohen</a>. Take that and compare it to trend following which has the performance data to prove its success. Without that data Covel's \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/013702018X/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Trend Following</a>\" book would have simply been opinion with no foundation. Covel digs deeper into the Seykota quote and discusses the core issues of what he's really talking about: is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading\" target=\"_blank\">day trading</a> simply the answer to your other problems? It's very similar to the lottery mentality regardless of how people try and talk it up: there's a very small chance of you winning big in the end. Covel also recounts some of his experiences abroad and compares it to the situation in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_%28country%29\" target=\"_blank\">America</a> today. Compared to Singapore, America simply can't compete with what they are able to get done. Singapore has great economic freedom and there's a wide desire there to make money--not just live off the State nipple. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_freedom\" target=\"_blank\">Economic freedom</a> and the desire to make money, however crass, leads to a better life. Covel mentions a book he's currently reading about how the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarchs\" target=\"_blank\">Russian oligarchs</a> came to power and made their billions. It's really rooted in the system that was the old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union\" target=\"_blank\">Soviet Union</a> system: the state-run economy and taking advatnage of that. Everything was run by the state: the banks, the delivery of bread, the production of produce, etc. Covel brings it up because he's currently in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). Today, there's nothing that feels remotely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism\" target=\"_blank\">communist</a> to Covel. He saw a couple of flags on some government buildings, but that's about it. Instead, it's mostly commerce and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneurs</a>. There's an energy there and people are clearly ready to make something happen. Ultimately, this brings Covel back to America. America does not have the ability to build a Singapore right now. Covel discusses the voting process and whether it's better to have a system where you know you don't have certain rights and freedoms (like Vietnam) or to have a system that gives you those rights and freedoms, but it's more akin to a fantasy. He's not some angry ex-pat: Covel simply wants to point out that the American system was founded on pure and noble ideals, but the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy\" target=\"_blank\">bureaucracy</a> has gotten so big and so unwieldy that the average vote makes no difference. Even a change in political leadership doesn't make a difference, and those on the right and left have more in common than not in common. Want a free trend following DVD?

Finally, Covel ends with a clip of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Bernanke</a> walking down the street. Somebody asks him about Nassim Taleb, the author of \"The Black Swan\". You would think that after we've just listened to all of these pragmatic voices lay the foundation for why you have to know there's always going to be another black swan to arrive, Bernanke completely dismisses it and says he doesn't read Taleb's work. Isn't it good to know that Bernanke, the man who is control of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">the Fed</a>, doesn't even pay attention?

After working for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch\" target=\"_blank\">Merrill Lynch </a>for about five years, Tentarelli realized it wasn't the right side of the business for him; however, he still retained his passion for trading. Tentarelli set out on his own and picked up Covel's \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/013702018X/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Trend Following</a>\" where he learned about traders that didn't pay attention to the news or <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp\" target=\"_blank\">fundamentals</a>, used price as their primary data, and traded every market the same way.

Radge operates The Chartist (<a href=\"http://www.thechartist.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">www.thechartist.com.au</a>) and is the author of the book \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Unholy-Grails-Road-Wealth-ebook/dp/B007T97DJQ/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Unholy Grails</a>\". Radge lived in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore</a> for two years and he and Covel talk about their shared experiences traveling in Southeast Asia. Covel brings up the lack of familiarity with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> when giving presentations in Southeast Asia and how, just like in the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\" target=\"_blank\"> US</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe\" target=\"_blank\">Europe</a>, 99% of the people out there really don't understand what constitutes a real trend following strategy. Radge and Covel break it down to the basics and use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> as an example of how a trend following trader might look at one particular example. In Apple's case it's possible to see 700 as an anchor and think that although it's at 450 now, it's <i>got</i> to go back up. It's easy to take the value investing perspective and think that you're buying a quality stock on discount. However, there's one core thing that Radge stresses people have to understand is the undeniable truth: every company that goes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy\" target=\"_blank\">bankrupt</a> exhibits the exact same traits. They all trend down in a sustained manner; they don't just open and go bankrupt on one day. A company trends down over a sustained amount of time and eventually goes bankrupt. Of course, Radge isn't saying that Apple is going to go bankrupt; he simply says to pay attention and not get anchored to a higher price. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett\" target=\"_blank\">Warren Buffet</a>'s idea of buying a good company on sale doesn't apply because he's obviously looking at things that people can't or won't pay attention to-- and his performance can't be replicated. Anchoring yourself to a price is dangerous, and Covel and Radge break down the idea of \"anchoring\" even further. Radge defines it as when an investment has reached a particular level that an investor has become emotionally attached to and has future expectations of the investment reaching past performance peaks. A trend follower would follow a stock that is at least moving in the right direction to start. Covel and Radge further discuss education, how the trend following world is foreign to many people who have been educated in the \"right\" places, and how the idea of taking losses and being incorrect in your position seem to be counterintuitive to them; the importance of drawing distinctions between traditional value investing and alternative systems like trend following; how the name of the game for many <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundmanager.asp\" target=\"_blank\">fund managers</a> is not necessarily performance but funds under management; playing the game of mathematics vs. playing the game of picking the right stocks; why the US stock market has gone straight up despite all the fear going on elsewhere in the world, and why you shouldn't \"fight the tape\"; closet trend followers; why price can't be faked (and how <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment\" target=\"_blank\">sentiment</a> plays into the picture); trade restrictions, cultural attitudes, and the importance of being able to step out of the crowd; why individuals have an advantage over fund managers; the value of understanding trend following even when you don't actually use it as a strategy; spotting 'trends', how you can't spot a trend until it's started or until it's over, and using hitchhiking as an analogy for trading; how trend following is useful when outlier events and<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\"> black swans</a> appear; using rules and strategies to fight fear; the difficulty of using Warren Buffett as an example, and the problems the arise when managing larger amounts of money; and Radge's thoughts on being an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneur</a>.

Covel just saw an interesting article called \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/following-a-herd-of-bulls-on-apples-stock.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">Following a Herd of Bulls on Apple</a>\" by James Stewart. Covel reads through the article and gives his commentary and notes that the premise of the article is disingenuous at best and dishonest at worst. The main subjects of Covel's criticism are the people that they bring on to criticize the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street\" target=\"_blank\"> Wall Street</a> analysts. Covel isn't here to defend the Wall Street analysts--anyone that makes a buy or sell decision based on a report from a Wall Street analyst after looking at the last 20 years of Wall Street history isn't doing their homework. The \"funny\" part of the article, Covel says, lies in the people who were quoted in the article--and the author. Jim Stewart has been around Wall Street for a long time. Did he just dial this piece in? Stewart knew it was impossible to predict Apple's top. Yet, for this article, they find one guy out there who pegged the top. And we're all supposed to look at this guy as some sort of miracle worker? You don't pick the top. People who pick tops like Apple at 700 are lucky. It's not a skill. If you can only find one guy to do it, you've found the lucky survivor, and Jim Stewart built the article around him. Covel saves the most ire for the professors quoted in the article. The men who teach that markets are efficient. The ones who have the basics of finance wrong and continue to push this nonsense to their students: \"Markets are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis\" target=\"_blank\">efficient</a>\". The big scam is that the very people out there writing Wall Street research probably sat through that very professor's class. Wall Street is populated with people who obtained this sort of education. One other thing Covel covers is momentum: a great way to have traded Apple is through a momentum<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a> style. A momentum trend following style wouldn't have had you getting in at the bottom or out at the top. All you can hope for is capturing the the middle meat of the trend. The trend following way doesn't require you to be worried whether wall street <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyst\" target=\"_blank\">analysts</a> are right or wrong; doesn't require you to be worried whether or not Jim Stewart had an agenda; or whether a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard university</a> professor had conflicts of interest himself. Covel only brings it up to make a point and to sharpen the divide between these very different ways of looking at the world. On one side you have all the university nonsense; the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis\" target=\"_blank\">efficient market hypothesis</a>; Wall Street giving you buy/sell/hold decisions; and adulation for the one guy that picked the top. On the other side, you have the trend following traders who know that absolutely all of that is junk. Make your life simpler. Walk away from the nonsense and stick to the other side of that divide.

Covel discusses his thoughts on Russell, noting that he saw him speak in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego\" target=\"_blank\">San Diego</a> and followed his writings some in 2009-10. Here's the thing: Russell got it all wrong at the time. He was calling for the end of the world and the Dow has gone up--way up. Russell isn't a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trader; he was using subjective discretionary technical views on what he thought the markets were doing, would do, and what the government or Fed might do or was doing wrong. Covel shares many of Russell's views about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy\" target=\"_blank\">economy</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">the Fed</a>; however, his way of thinking about the markets in 2009 and 2010 was the kind of predictive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">technical analysis</a> that Covel has rallied so much against in recent podcast episodes. Bottom line, if the market's up, you're long; if the market's down, you're short. Trend following is not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle\" target=\"_blank\">Elliott Wave</a>, it's not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_theory\" target=\"_blank\">Dow Theory</a>, it's not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Delbert_Gann\" target=\"_blank\">Gann</a>, it's not anything <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_DeMark\" target=\"_blank\">Tom DeMark</a> is describing. It's price action based and that's it. Covel goes onto discuss the gentleman's blogpost in further detail, and notes how taking hold of data such as trading volume and confirming the Dow and transports together are almost fundamental-like in their approach. From a trend following perspective, all of this is irrelevant. The gentleman's blogpost ends with the phrase the pressure in the market is building, and we may be watching the beginning of the most spectacular stock market blowoff ever. Just before an even more astonishing decline.\" The operative phrase there is \"may be\": if you hear a sentence like that, it's not trend following. Covel goes on to discuss more local Malaysian food, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga\" target=\"_blank\">Yoga</a>, getting the tar beat out of him in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_massage\" target=\"_blank\">Thai massage</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton\" target=\"_blank\">General Patton</a>, and invites listeners to write in with questions about predictive vs. reactive technical analysis. Covel ends with a clip from famed basketball coach<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wooden\" target=\"_blank\"> John Wooden</a> at<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles\" target=\"_blank\"> UCLA</a>. He had a brilliant way about himself, inspired many, and Covel notes how Wooden got down into the nitty gritty in coaching--even teaching players how to properly put their socks on so they didn't get blisters.

Since February 25th he has been in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo\" target=\"_blank\">Tokyo</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur\" target=\"_blank\">Kuala Lumpur </a>(Malaysia). He's given 23 presentations--anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes long--spread over 4 cities. Covel speaks to us today from Kuala Lumpur where he was only supposed to stay for two days. However, Covel was so taken by the city that he decided to stay for three or four weeks. Covel weighs in on the food, the culture, and the experiences surrounding his recent travels before getting into the kind of presentations he has been giving abroad and the investment style of the people to whom he has been speaking. Unsurprisingly, many of the largest fund managers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur are unfamiliar with<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a>; they have the a similar understanding of many in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\" target=\"_blank\">America</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe\" target=\"_blank\">Europe</a>. Most of the fund managers Covel sat down with were long-only, <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental</a> and value-based. Perhaps they used some predictive <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp\" target=\"_blank\">technical indicators</a> on top, but that was it. Covel would go through the big picture differences between trend following and what his audience was doing. While most of these investors were unlikely to wholly adopt trend following, if you can bring a trend following strategy in-house that produces returns at a different point in time than your typical fundamental value returns--that's extremely useful information. Covel also discussed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics\" target=\"_blank\">behavioral finance</a> aspects, the idea of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swan</a>, and outlier move issues. Ultimately, it's about this scenario: you wake up tomorrow and you're on a desert island. You've got nothing except the closing price of the 75 most liquid global markets (which somehow magically appear in the sand), and a phone to your broker to make the trades. You have nothing else--no <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>, no<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal\" target=\"_blank\"> Wall Street Journal</a>, no <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>. Can you look at that data--and <i>only </i>that data--over time, and figure out a way to make money? That's the challenge. Can you find a positive mathematical edge in that stew of data from all those different markets? You don't even need to know the <i>names </i>of the markets you're trading. All you need are the prices. Can you find a positive mathematical edge in the great spirit of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O._Thorp\" target=\"_blank\">Ed Thorp</a> and \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Beat-Dealer-Winning-Strategy-Twenty-One/dp/0394703103/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Beat The Dealer</a>\"? That is the rallying cry of the trend following world--the desert island trading scenario. Even if someone elected not to make an allocation to a trend following firm (or did not want to trade as a trend follower themselves) Covel invited them to create a model portfolio. That way, you can at least know when trend following is doing well. That piece of information can be a useful piece of fundamental data for your fundamental trading shop. Some criticisms? The idea that Covel is not revealing the \"secret sauce\", holding back, or not revealing the \"new thing\". You have to ask yourself: Can you look at a trend following system? Test it? Look at professional trend following managers and see how they have performed? Compare it all? And believe in it? Or do you allow yourself to be distracted by other peoples' comments? Distracted by society? Ultimately that might be the big picture issue that Covel is seeing in his journey. Distraction kills focus.

Covel notes that this is how most young men begin their understanding of Wall Street: through the brokerage lens (hence the 2nd speech). It's how Covel first understood it, too: through the lens of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker\" target=\"_blank\">Liar's Poker</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Brothers\" target=\"_blank\">Salomon Brothers</a>. The idea is that if you work for this big investment bank and become a broker, you can make yourself a fortune. And you can call yourself a trader. But, being a broker doesn't make you a trader. You have to put your time in and you have to allow yourself to be in learning mode. Can you put off all the distractions and focus on the education of learning a trend following system and trend following psychology? Or do you operate under society's rule that if you lift a finger someone has to pay you first? If you have the opportunity to learn <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trading don't worry about the silly stuff: how much time it will take, how much money you'll have to spend, etc. As long as you don't go broke it will be fine. The important thing is taking the proper amount of time and effort to prepare. In stark contrast to the earlier clips Covel transitions into playing and analyzing several excerpts from legendary trend following traders <a href=\"http://www.dunncapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Dunn</a>, <a href=\"http://turtletrader.com/trader-parker/\" target=\"_blank\">Jerry Parker</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harding_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">David Harding</a>. These excerpts are not the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood\" target=\"_blank\">Hollywood</a> speeches: they're real, raw and full of priceless trend following insights. Covel ends with a quote by Harding: \"We know that we know almost nothing, but the almost nothing we know isn't completely nothing and we only bet on that.\" We all know the price action; we know whether a market is moving up or down. We can follow that flow. If you can follow the flow of a market either up or down you've got a chance. Don't try and predict tomorrow, it's impossible. Take what you do know for sure and look for a way to use it and be prepared for when the next <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swan</a> swoops in, the next big event appears suddenly.

Olen is there to promote her book, \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pound-Foolish-Exposing-Personal-ebook/dp/B006CUDCUM/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Pound Foolish: Exposing The Dark Side Of The Personal Finance Industry</a>\". Olen notes that how when those in the \"financial entertainment\" business such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Orman\" target=\"_blank\">Suze Orman</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Cramer</a> gives stock picks, the stock goes up. However, it almost always falls back down several weeks later. To that end, Olen recommends immediately shorting anything Jim Cramer mentions as a buy. However, towards the end, the interview takes a different tone as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart\" target=\"_blank\">Stewart</a> mentions that he doesn't understand \"why we don't value work more and why investment has become so valued\". Covel kicks into gear and comments on the interview, first noting that he's a fan of Stewart, but also pointing out the problematic attitude Stewart takes. There was something distinctly missing from Stewart's interview with Olen: personal responsibility and how the world really works. The search for security, especially in your investments, is fool's gold. But why did Covel play this clip? It's a lead into today's topic: how the world really works. Covel talks about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> clinging onto it's cash waiting for the right opportunity. Google is waiting for the good bet. Their hand is not being forced and they don't care what you think about them. So, Google can wait, but can you? They know the right move will come, and they know they have to have the capital when it does. So in a sense, Google is acting like a trend following trader. That's trend following 101. You have to wait for the home run. So what causes us <i>not</i> to wait? What screws us up? Covel plays a clip from Keith Chen to illustrate why in which he about how language can have an effect on your ability to save money. Covel comments on the clip, noting how being a trend following trader involves reacting to <i>right now.</i> You're not dealing with tomorrow. All you're dealing with is the here and now. Looking at the machinations of American investors through Chen's speech, Covel notes how we all want to deal with the non-existent future, but if you want to step outside of that bubble, it's up to you. It's your personal responsibility. Free trend following DVD?

Having just arrived in Hong Kong from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo\" target=\"_blank\">Tokyo</a>, Covel ruminates on the differences between the two places. Tokyo is a fantastic, organized, and civilized place. Covel discusses the feel of the city, especially loving green tea vending machines every hundred feet giving hot or cold tea perfectly every time. However, he notes a somewhat slow pace which is a direct contrast to the speed of Hong Kong. Hong Kong is on fire, and everybody is there trying to make things happen. You don't have to like it-- and it does have some rough edges-- but it's alive. It's a giant melting pot with a pulsating energy in the air of people making things happen. Covel also details the events surrounding the presentation he gave for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLSA\" target=\"_blank\">CLSA</a> at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt\" target=\"_blank\">Hyatt</a> in Roppongi, Tokyo. Following Covel's presentation, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Faber\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Marc Faber</a> spoke. Faber and Covel share a view that all of the misadventures happening in society today will eventually end badly. If you're going to try and trade all this uncertainty you'd better have a timing indicator. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">Trend Following</a> has a timing indicator built in: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_action_trading\" target=\"_blank\">price action</a>. You'll never get in at the very bottom and you'll never get out at the very top, but you'll get out alive and with a profit. Covel shares a quote from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Godin</a> on that subject and discusses alternatives to staying glued to the television. Is it really fun staying glued to the screen watching blips go by? Or do you do it because you think that's how you make money? Fortunately, you don't need to be worried what high frequency trading is doing and you don't need to be worried about the next <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">Fed </a>announcement. Consider the alternative: you want to be ready when markets move in larger trending directions and get aboard the trends that have much lengthier time horizons than fifteen seconds. You want to be prepared for when the next <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swan</a> swoops in. If you put the fifteen second news flashes aside and start trading something like a six month signal instead, doesn't that allow you a much nicer life than fixating on the minutia of every moment?

People just aren't needed anymore. This idea stuck with Covel and he explores the idea that, if people are needed less and less as technology increases, what do you do to get ahead? You can be replaced if you're working for the man. It's harder than ever to build a life around the beautiful little house and the white picket fence when your job might be taken out from under you as technology progresses. So what kind of strategy do you use in the face of that? You can become an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneur</a>. Covel thinks its one of the most exciting times ever for would-be entrepreneurs. Yes, some jobs are going away forever, but that just might be the kick in the pants you need to go and do something that matters: to make art of some kind, whether it's painting, creating software, designing a trading system, developing a new way of teaching, or trading your own account. When you're 90 years old you'll be able to day that you didn't just clock in for the man every day of your life. Who wants to be a desk jockey working for the man for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage\" target=\"_blank\">minimum wage</a>? Instead of being a cog in the wheel, you can make a new wheel. The simple notion of being an entrepreneur is the magic elixir in the face of the problem of technology arbitraging away the need for human capital: you create something new that is of value, someone buys it, and money is exchanged. The idea is that you control it. Technology can't take your place if you're bringing unique and new ideas to the table. Everyone has some sort of skill; everyone brings something to the table. But people are scared to make the leap. You have to have a belief in yourself; you can't fear failure. Making mistakes is the magic that leads you to success. If you don't have any mistakes under your belt, you have a fragile foundation. Ultimately, you can make people believe in you and compensate you for the value that you bring. All you need is your wit, your smarts, and your enterprising spirit to make something happen.

Currently in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand\" target=\"_blank\">Thailand</a>, Covel catches us up on where he's been so far. He notes the history of past conflicts in the area and his thoughts from a mountain view six-thousand feet above the ground looking onto the landscape below. Since leaving the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\" target=\"_blank\">US</a> Covel has especially enjoyed not paying attention to the news coming from America. The idea of noise is afterall pointless from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> perspective. If you can get away from it, either physically (like Covel) or mentally, it's a good idea to eliminate it in your life. Along the lines of what's needed and not needed, Covel plays a video called \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPy-QKXofQs\" target=\"_blank\">What Do Prices Know That You Don't?</a>\", a clip from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University\" target=\"_blank\">Duke</a> professor that discusses relying on price to make decisions. Even though the video doesn't come from a direct trend following perspective, it illustrates the danger of too much information. It's easy to play the game of waiting for one more news report, watching one more episode of<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28political_commentator%29\" target=\"_blank\"> Bill O'Reilly</a>, or trusting the promises of one last politician. That's where we are right now: we're in a game. So, if you are in a game, how do you navigate it? What do you do? What decisions do you make? And what happens when the game doesn't go the way the government has said? So, what lies ahead? Covel reads a piece of writing from <a href=\"http://www.transtrend.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Transtrend</a>'s newsletter regarding the role of the government and what you can expect, followed by a piece from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hussman\" target=\"_blank\">John Hussman</a>. Both readings seem to agree on one thing: something will happen at some point. Are you prepared? Or do you just want to just trust that the government will forever be able to prop up the market? Hussman makes the point to not follow prices, which Covel disagrees with--if the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Stock_Exchange\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese stock market</a> is going up, you want to be long. The issue isn't what to do in a market that's going up; the issue is having an exit strategy. Covel's view is to be long and be happy in a rising market, but have an exit strategy. That's the solution. If you can't wrap your arms around that you might think about getting out of the markets completely. Even if you don't ultimately adopt a trend following strategy, if you're going to be trading, it's of dire importance to understand the concept of trend following. It's essential to have it in your arsenal of tools.

Often when people come to trend following trading for the first time they get fixated on the rules alone, thinking there is a \"magic potion\". There are other factors to consider, and Covel examines them by relating to two articles: \"<a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ideas-innovations/Why-Are-Superachievers-So-Successful-186941231.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Are Super-Achievers So Successful?</a>\" from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_%28magazine%29\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian.com</a> and \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/opinion/sunday/secret-ingredient-for-success.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Secret Ingredient for Success</a>\" from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>. Covel examines the common threads of the super-achiever: self-awareness and self-evaluation; finding ways to connect themselves to people that would support their dreams goals; the skill of active listening; and patience. Covel highlights one part of the article that states \"you don't have to win every lap\", and points out a perfect parallel to trend following trading. The best traders out there don't win every day or every month, but they pick up the big wins when they come along. Do you want to allow yourself to be seduced by the buy and hold mantra, to be at the mercy of when the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500\" target=\"_blank\"> S&amp;P</a> will take it's next 50% dive backwards? Or do you want to be a super-achiever? Covel's training programs will put you in the position to be a super-achiever: his fifteen years of his experience; his insight of knowing exactly what to do in your own personal circumstances; the attitude and psychology necessary to be a successful trader; and the personal support and motivation to go out there and make it happen.

Their products, their style, and their stock. It was a great story as long as the stock was going straight up. On today's podcast <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Covel</a> talks about all things Apple: the worship; the seemingly romantic love of Apple stock; and the drop down to $450 a share from its peak above $702.10 in September (down 35% from its peak). Covel compares the fundamental viewpoint looking at Apple today to the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a> perspective that is purely based on price action. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street</a> analysts all seem to insist that they can predict the future, but none of them predicted this. So, what does this mean? Is Apple a \"broken company\"? Apple had a profit of 13 billion dollars, sold 28% more iPhones and 48% more iPads, and the stock still went down. Covel looks at several articles from Wall Street analysts and notes that none of these people were saying what they're saying now when the stock was at 700 a share. Covel creatively points out the complete drivel coming from these analysts, and notes how nothing has changed on Apple's end but the price of their stock. So why is this only being pointed out now? And what is Covel's ultimate point? Follow the price action. Trend followers don't have to know anything about what's going on inside the back room of an Apple store. This is a classic example of a trend: ride the train up, ride the train down. Is the stock cheap now? What if it's at 350 or 250 next month? Do you buy on the dip? If the market is going down, get out or short it. The price knows more than any Wall Street analyst. There is no way on the planet to attach all fundamental views to the movement of the stock price. If the best traders on the planet don't have these insights, how can the stock jockeys at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC </a>and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>, for example, have them?

You can have the intravenous drip straight into your arm, but what does all that commentary do for you? Ultimately, if you're a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trader or <em>any</em> type of investor you need a process. You need a set of rules that tells you where to enter, where to exit, and how much to bet of your limited capital at all times. Regardless of account size, volatility, etc. You need a process that determines that for you. If you have that then eliminating all other stuff is paramount. And it's not just for trading reasons; it's for life reasons. Covel goes through Ritholtz's list and compares it to his own. On the flipside Covel also goes through a list of the things he <em>does</em> care about: Knowing how the \"behind-the-scenes\" action really works; the traders that he has learned from in his books; having honest interactions with people; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Watts</a>; <a href=\"http://turtletrader.com/trader-ken-tropin/\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Tropin</a>'s white papers; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harding_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">The Winton Papers</a>; the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Habits\" target=\"_blank\">Zen Habits</a> blog; and <a href=\"http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Godin's website</a>. Covel relates several stories from traders such as <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com/salem_abraham/\" target=\"_blank\">Salem Abraham</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harding_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">David Harding</a> which taught him some valuable lessons. Covel explains that if you want to be good at anything you have to be passionate about it. You have to care, you have to get inside it, and you have to own it. In the next segment Covel talks about the idea of the efficient market hypothesis, which is one of the foundational pillars for academics. They claim to have mathematical formulas which can predict the future, even though the underlying assumptions are false. Life is much easier for a professor who can fall back on beautiful mathematics. Unfortunately, many people have been sold up the river using investment products based on efficient markets. Covel quotes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie Munger </a>of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway\" target=\"_blank\">Berkshire Hathaway</a> regarding extreme proponents of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis\" target=\"_blank\">efficient market hypothesis</a>. Munger, even though he's a value investing guy, knows there are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier\" target=\"_blank\">outliers</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swans</a>. He knows that markets aren't efficient. Munger notes that mistaken professors were \"too much influenced by rational man-models of human behaviors from economics, and too little by foolish man-models from psychology and real world experience.\" How can there be rational man when Jersey Shore gets high ratings? There's no such thing as rational today. Even if there was markets <em>still</em> might go in a completely different direction from what rational is even deemed to be.

Covel and Crittenden talk about Crittenden's beginnings, coming from a medical background and switching majors to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics\" target=\"_blank\">economics</a>. Crittenden got to see the world from two different perspectives: one from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics\" target=\"_blank\">biostatistics</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sciences\" target=\"_blank\">natural sciences</a> perspective, and also from a business school perspective.

Crittenden is a little different than some of his counterparts in the industry in that he focuses more on \"why?\" than \"what?\". Covel and Crittenden talk about sustainability vs. short term inefficiencies; being \"ultra long term trend followers\" and some of the reasons why he believes it to be the most robust approach; Crittenden's peers and influences--particularly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Basso\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Basso</a>; the start of Longboard Asset Management; why Wilcox and Crittenden decided on a \"trend following mutual fund\" model, and the benefits to that model; looking at performance data and understanding when trend following (or the media perception of it) falls \"below average\"; diversification and the markets Crittenden chooses to trade; risk control at Longboard; who can buy into Longboard and the minimum investment required; whether most of the large liquid markets work within the robust structure Crittenden has developed for trading--and the one (only, single) market that long term trend following would have produced a loss on within the last forty years. Crittenden also gives an explanation on the source of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> returns that might be one of the clearest explanations of the topic that Covel has heard to date.

Like most of Cash's music it's a simple song. It's powerful, but it works. And its simplicity is exactly why it works. Covel dedicates today's episode to the topics of simplicity, prediction, and risk, and presents three articles revolving around each of these ideas. First, Covel mentions an article that appeared in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Businessweek\" target=\"_blank\">Business Week</a> regarding how <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\" target=\"_blank\">Japan</a>'s fear of risk is getting dangerous. For those not aware the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Stock_Exchange\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese stock market</a> is down 76% still from its 1989 high. That would have to be an entire generation--an entire country--that no longer believes in the stock market. That's not the reason Covel brings up the article; rather, it's the \"play it safe\" mentality. He goes on to discuss the tendency to focus on downsides rather than opportunities. The attitude of risk-aversion in Japan explains why few Japanese students choose to study abroad, why regulators hold up vaccinations, and why 844 trillion yen (almost twice the country's yearly economic output) sits idle in cash at home and in savings accounts earning 0.02% interest. We're not far away from this attitude coming to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_%28country%29\" target=\"_blank\">America</a>, but with that comes an opportunity for you to profit. Covel isn't picking on Japan; it's just a useful example of the risk-averse attitude that seems to be spreading. Covel moves onto an article from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest\" target=\"_blank\">Golf Digest</a> called \"What Predictions Say About Us\". Predictions are about pretending to know. Covel points out one particularly compelling quote: \"Human beings are wired to predict. In ancient times, predictions served as a psychological counterweight to the extreme uncertainty of life. As we've gained more control over this daily existence, predictions help encourage the illusion that we're in charge of our own destiny. The more that is unknown, the greater the urge to predict.\" Somehow we've come to think that we can predict almost everything. It's hard-wired into us. If you can understand that so many people are destined to predict (and continually predict incorrectly) it can put you in the position to profit--if you've got a strategy that's predicated on *not* predicting, i.e. trend following. Covel moves on to discuss simplicity quoting an article called \"One Trick Pony\". The article talks about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning\" target=\"_blank\">Peyton Manning</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Moore_%28American_football_coach%29\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Moore</a>, who teamed up with a NFL strategy that they used with great success. Their strategy was based on running the fewest play concepts of any offense in the league. It's not about trying to surprise the opponent, but in mastering a strategy that works. That's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a>, too. It's relatively simple, it's robust, it's big, and there aren't a lot of moving parts. It is what it is--which is a great opportunity for profit.

Covel goes on to discuss an article about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harding_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">David Harding</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winton_Capital_Management\" target=\"_blank\">Winton Capital</a>--a trader who has become one of the major faces in trend following trading due to his track record in the last decade. The article notes Harding's -3.5% 2012, calls his success a \"blip\", and generally presents criticism without any foundational understanding of Harding's techniques. Covel tears the article apart point-by-point. It's a perfect representation of how the media misrepresents the facts. Covel's isn't motivated to critique this particular article because he's a David Harding fanboy--rather, his goal is to point out the intellectual dishonesty put on display so often in the media. Covel questions the motives of the writers; dispels the myth that massive computational power is needed to be a trend following trader; and questions how one 3.5% down year can possibly be considered a \"plunge\" or \"blip\" in the larger context of Harding's track record. The authors state that Harding was \"blindsided by market uncertainty\", but trend following is built on accepting the fact that a black swan can appear in at any moment--a fundamental concept that the authors clearly don't understand. Next, Covel discusses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ramsey\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Ramsey</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Edelman\" target=\"_blank\">Ric Edelman</a>; radio hosts who both are convinced that you can't make money trading. So, they convince you to buy and hold mutual funds (perhaps some of which they've helped create) and leave you hoping for the best. Covel takes both of them on and dispels their claims that no one in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_400\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes 400 </a>makes their money trading. So, why do Ramsey and Edelman persist in putting out such information? Because they have something to sell. Covel has something to sell too, but he gives both sides of the story. He lays out the buy and hold strategies and compares them to systematic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a>. It's just clear who the winner is when you see the whole picture. Ramsey and Edelman neglect to talk about trading successfully; it's all part of the propaganda machine. Think critically. Don't be a sheep. If you want to obtain something more than average, you've got to keep your eyes wide open and look for the propaganda.

The first, regarding a speaking gig in<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing\" target=\"_blank\"> Beijing</a>, concerns itself with distinguishing between reality and unreality. The second comes from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_and_Teller\" target=\"_blank\">Teller</a>, of Penn and Teller fame. Covel goes on to discuss whether a trading system should be specifically designed to suit your personality--something Covel doesn't necessarily agree with. He gives examples of the Turtles,<a href=\"http://www.ahl.com/london\" target=\"_blank\"> AHL of London</a>,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hite\" target=\"_blank\"> Larry Hite</a>, <a href=\"http://turtletrader.com/trader-ken-tropin/\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Tropin</a>--all traders who have different personalities but are similar in their systematic approaches. It's not about whether trend following trading \"fits\" your personality--it's about the fact that it works and there is performance data that proves it. The third example comes from a listener, and Covel discusses time decay and \"choppy markets\". The fourth comes from Jim Rohrbach, who put a piece out in late December in which he caught a radio show that stated \"the stock market is always right\". Paraphrasing Rohrbach, Covel notes that the market does what it wants to do. When the market doesn't do what a trader thinks it should do, they insist the market is wrong. We may not like or agree what the market is doing any any particular time, but it's futile to say the market is wrong or to invest opposite the market. It's as simple as being long when the market is going up, and being short when it's going down. Of course, you need rules to deal with that: choppy markets, knowing when to exit, and keeping losses to a minimum--that's what Covel teaches.

Their book is a step-by-step instruction guide to implementing Morales and Kacher's trading methods. Covel starts off by asking Kacher and Morales about the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff\" target=\"_blank\">fiscal cliff</a>\", why <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing\" target=\"_blank\">quantitative easing</a> is not the answer to economic growth, and why all of this isn't necessarily relevant to making money. None of it matters if the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average\" target=\"_blank\">Dow</a> ultimately goes from 13,000 to 26,000. Regardless of your political views you shouldn't be sitting on the sidelines if that happens. Ultimately, the trend is your friend. In a pure trading mindset, all this news, the fiscal cliff, the debt limits--they aren't necessarily relevant to making money. Covel, Kacher, and Morales go on to talk about their new book, \"In The Trading Cockpit with the O'Neil Disciples\"; the \"O.W.L.\" ethos, and the story behind it; reversion to the mean mentality, and how it can often be the kiss of death for traders and investors; trading psychology, the idea that \"you must lose to win\", how the least important statistic is your percentage of gains v. losses in your trading account; dealing with emotionalism and why clients often want to hear something that will make them feel better; teaching people to let go of the news and simply watch the price action; why people think that \"this time is different\", put their trust in the central economy, and why trend following will survive into the future; understanding that investing is always a process of changing along the way; and what mental clutter in the way of fears, biases, concerns and more can build up in the mind and get in the way of clear and decisive decision-making.

Now that we've got that out of the way, what are you going to do about it? Hide? Crouch in a corner and work as hard as you can to fit in? That's not safe either.

In his last podcast before Christmas 2012 Covel gives a cheat sheet podcast of sorts too; he presents invaluable audio clips from his collection of great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> traders. These legendary traders include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eckhardt_%28trader%29\" target=\"_blank\">William Eckhardt</a>; <a href=\"http://www.dunncapital.com/\">Bill Dunn</a> (talking about risk management from his perspective); and <a href=\"http://turtletrader.com/trader-parker/\" target=\"_blank\">Jerry Parker</a> (talking about the difference between mean reversion and trend following). Why is it hard to accept their principles outlined? They sound rational and reasonable, right?

Specifically, it's a book about writing, how to write, and how to think about writing. However, Covel notes that you can take the word \"writing\" and insert anything and have it apply: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_weaving\" target=\"_blank\">basket weaving</a>, running--it doesn't make a difference. That's the way the book was written, and that's what Michael Covel gets at in today's episode. Understanding the precepts that Covel talks about in today's episode are relevant to trend following trading, being an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneur</a>, having a good life, having good friends, or having a family. For those of you that might be \"quant jocks\", and might not think the emotional and psychology are as or more important than the numbers, Covel passes along an anecdote about legendary trend following trader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Seykota\" target=\"_blank\">Ed Seykota</a>. It's the internal, the ego, the psychology, the emotions--all these pieces wrapped together are the foundation for all success. Covel goes on to read selections from a new e-book compilation from several different authors, and connects the dots. He covers fascination, gumption, focus, leaping, timeless, confidence, passion, poker, and adventure. It's not time to just count another year. It's time to plan an adventure--whether it's travel, becoming a trend following trader, or anything else that speaks to you. Regardless of whatever success you want to achieve, this is it.

Covel and Weissman have some contrasts in their techniques, including Weissman's use of fundamentals in his trading, and they work out their differences along the way.

The two explore Weissman's path from how he started trading with his father in 1987 to how he made his way to where he is today. Further topics include the background to Weissman naming his book \"Trade Like a Casino\", and how Casinos and the gaming industry are the models for successful speculative trading; the influence of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Schwager\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Schwager</a>'s work; risk management; positive expectancy; how Weissman defines trends and signs of strength; the idea of \"don't anticipate, just participate\"; positive expectancy and the probability skew; the connection between table limits and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management\" target=\"_blank\">risk management</a>; how there are no truly \"safe investments\"; some tools that Weissman has used to influence his own trading psychology and smooth out the emotional highs and lows; not letting a high price stop you from buying, and not letting a low price stop you from selling; Weissman's concept of \"the opaque urn\"; and the three things you can guarantee. Weissman and Covel also go over some of Weissman's great one-liners: \"don't tug at green shoots\" and \"trade the market, not the money\".

Most people don't even want to think about it. <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Covel</a> discusses money and what it represents: It's the exchange mechanism amongst honest people. We use money to give each other our value. That's the way it works. So, in the spirit of this thought process, Covel reads an excerpt from \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged\" target=\"_blank\">Atlas Shrugged</a>\". He notes that he was given this book to read as a homework assignment after meeting famed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Seykota\" target=\"_blank\">Ed Seykota</a>. We all know there are vastly different opinions on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_rand\" target=\"_blank\">Rand</a>. Some people love her and build upon her work as the foundation of their ethos, and others refer to it as a childish teenage dream. Regardless of your views on Rand, the excerpt Covel reads can be appreciated for its intelligence and wisdom about money.

Covel relates and wishes that he could impart this message upon people. If you listen to the words that Covel says, perhaps the enthusiasm that he brings can also bring you to see your life as fanatical. You've got to be fanatical, whether you're going to be an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneur</a>, or a<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a> trader. You have to be focused, you have to be passionate, and you have to understand. You have to *want it*, otherwise you simply won't get there. Covel goes on to discuss a white paper by <a href=\"http://www.sebassetmanagement.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">SEB Asset Management</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden\" target=\"_blank\">Sweden</a>. There's always ups and downs in trend following strategy. A strategy that makes a promise to make you money every month is a fraud. There will be periods of time while you follow a trend following strategy where you have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawdown_%28economics%29\">drawdowns</a>. It's just the way it works. But if you live to play another day, you can come up on top in the end. However, if you believe that the world has changed forever in such a way that there are no more business cycles, no severe banking crises, real estate crises, government bond crises, and corporate crises; that there will never be any large movements in the currency markets, no longer any social or military crises, and no major recovery from these crises--then trend following investments is unnecessary. Do you really expect there to be no future change? If we accept unpredictability, trend following is the best strategy to follow. Covel goes on to talk about the Fed, and whether we want the Dow to be elevated at the expense of our interest income. Covel continues on with the idea of information overload. How do you make decisions with it all? You can't. It's not a day trading rat-race. The most successful people in the world take a step back and look at the big picture. Simple makes money, simple finds freedom, and simple can be inspiring. The complexity is useless. Knowing every single data point does nothing for you in the long run. It's just a game of trivial pursuit. Also: Covel announces product specials for the month of December--a great long term trend following system.

Ritholtz is deep down a quant guy, but brings strong views and opinions. However, he won't sit around and \"fight the tape\". Covel and Ritholtz talk about the price of paying attention and why you should be selective in what you watch, read, and listen to; the onslaught of political information; the insatiable need to consume information and knowing when it's the right time to quarantine yourself from being influenced by someone in particular; Ritholtz's views on gold, why attaching your emotional well-being to it is wrong, and how it won't be quite as valuable as most people think in the event of a crisis; cutting your losses short and letting your winners run; the real value of intuition; how Ritholtz views the world and where we're at right now, societal and economic cycles, and how you can't be a doom and gloomer seeing what's coming down the pipeline in the next generation; and the importance of not being cash rich and time poor, getting \"lost in the screens\", and leading a good life instead of always chasing money for its own sake.

Covel notes how the only constant in life and trading is change. Uncertainty is the root of<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a> and if you have a philosophy that's grounded in change, you'll have a strategy that responds well to the world of ebbs and flows. You'll have a strategy that won't leave you blindly sitting there and will let you participate when a market either goes up or down. It won't leave you at the mercy of the latest \"new new thing\". So, which strategy can make you money in unending change? Trend following is a fantastic option. Covel goes on to quote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mauboussin\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Mauboussin</a> and notes the importance of process vs. outcome and the tricky subject of luck: \"If you compete in a field where luck plays a role, you should focus more on the process of how you make the decisions and rely less on the short term outcomes. The reason is that luck breaks the direct link between skill and results. You can be skillful and have a poor outcome, or unskillful and have a good outcome.\" Covel discusses the criticism of people that expect positive trend following performance every month. Look in the books, look at the charts--trend following is a long term strategy. As Covel has said in the past any strategy that gives you a steady 1% a month is probably <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff\" target=\"_blank\">Bernie Madoff</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Term_Capital_Management\" target=\"_blank\">Long Term Capital Management </a>(i.e. soon to be exposed or busted). Covel goes on to quote an article by <a href=\"http://www.pfpg.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">PFP Wealth Management</a> regarding the essence of trend following. Covel also uses the classic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies\" target=\"_blank\">Pixies</a> song, \"Debaser\" and notes that it has about as much to do with your trading as turning on<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\"> CNBC </a>or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>.

He plays a speech by author and philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Watts</a> asking, \"What would you do with your life if money was no object?\" Covel shows you how you can make money, but asks: What will you do with it once you have it? It's about freedom, it's about finding options. It's not just about protecting it once you have it. So once you have the money you need what are you going to do with it? Covel goes on to discuss the importance of making something of yourself; of not sitting there and completing the dry obligations of the day. You need a shake-up in your life. It's time to find something different. Next, Covel plays a talk by author and blogger<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin\" target=\"_blank\"> Seth Godin</a>. Covel riffs off Godin's Q&amp;A session noting the importance of finding something you truly feel passionate about, but knowing that it might not necessarily mean you'll be the next Apple. The important thing is to start now; don't wait until you finally realize the industrial revolution is over. You don't have to have a plan--just put yourself into motion. That's what Covel did: Start with your passion, and figure out how to pay the bills around that. Whether it's investing, building a business, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneurship</a>, or anything else (like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a>). Godin is great at explaining that accepted systems are dead. You have to create and use your own microphone to get your message out. Covel also discusses resistance, being able to survive to play the next hand, the importance of bet size, and diversity in your betting. Don't become emotionally invested in one idea; you might have to adjust within the place that you love. Next, Covel talks about a recent experience he had with government <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy\" target=\"_blank\">bureaucracy</a> with regard to an international deal and how his experience might hint at future ills.

Hendry is not a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trader--at least publicly--and Covel gives some insight on how some very important trend following ideas have made their way into Hendry's work. Unlike Covel's comment on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harding_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">David Harding</a>'s interview from several weeks ago, this analysis is not about the skewed media perception of trend following, but rather how big name traders like Hendry use trend following philosophies in their trading, even if they would deny the label. Stick with it as Hendry talks about some of his fundamental views, because the trend following principles sneak up on you later in the interview. A narrative and a story is important in trying to sell yourself, and some of Hendry's thoughts belie the fundamental perspective on trading he presents to the public; Covel helps to read between the lines and see the underlying trend following thread inherent in Hendry's work. Covel comments as Hendry gives his thoughts on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank\" target=\"_blank\">central bank</a> manipulation and the consequences of those actions; how Hendry doesn't want to hear from the ridiculous analysts that can't help you in buying, selling, allocating to assorted markets in your portfolio, having a bet size strategy, and having a risk management strategy; how he made 50% in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308\" target=\"_blank\">October of 2008</a> (and how this leads Covel to believe some trend following strategies might have been employed); and how Hendry is a student of uncertainty.

His new book, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_%28book%29\" target=\"_blank\">Mastery</a>\" is out. Covel and Greene came together through their mutual friend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Holiday\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Holiday</a> (author of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_Me,_I%27m_Lying\" target=\"_blank\">Trust Me, I'm Lying</a>\"), a past guest on Covel's podcast and a former apprentice of Greene. Covel talks to Greene about the influence \"The 48 Laws of Power\" had on Covel's own writing; using the 48 Laws as a defense strategy rather than as a cutthroat offense; some of Greene's early influences that led him into his writing career; using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Buddhism\" target=\"_blank\">Zen Buddhism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation\" target=\"_blank\">meditation</a> as a tool to gain perspective and focus; the importance of using your unique life experiences in your career to create an irreplaceable style; and embracing opportunity. When \"The 48 Laws of Power\" unexpectedly pushed a button in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop\" target=\"_blank\">hip-hop</a> community, Greene and musician 50 Cent began a collaboration that eventually became \"The 50th Law\". Covel and Greene discuss the stories surrounding their collaboration, why 50 Cent should be taken seriously as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneur</a>, and how he embodies the paradigm found within Greene's new book, \"Mastery\". On the subject of \"Mastery\", Covel and Greene discuss how Greene mined the biographies of both contemporary masters and masters throughout history to discover how these people reached new levels and developed a different kind of intelligence. These people are highly creative, can connect ideas in a way that no one else can, and have become masters in their own respective fields. Greene made the startling discovery that genius, talent, luck, and intelligence did not lead his subjects to this power. Rather, they went through a process: They went through apprenticeships, mentored with the right people, knew how to observe what was happening around them, absorbed all of the rules of their field, developed skills, and had many failures.

Is it more useful to get all geared up about elections, or to listen to a Frank Sinatra sing a nice walk through life. A pleasant, easygoing way. Of course, the pleasant easygoing way is better. Covel discusses what the election means for both sides, even if he doesn't seem to care one way or the other: On the conservative side, if you keep running social issue candidates, you'll never win an election again. To the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberals\" target=\"_blank\"> liberals</a>, if you think the government can give you economic freedom, you'll never have economic freedom. So, where is Covel going with this? He goes the Frank Sinatra way, the go-with-the-flow way. Every couple of years, someone says \"trend following is dead\". Usually it's right at the time trend followers have a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawdown_%28economics%29\" target=\"_blank\">drawdown</a>. The idea is to have your wins far outweigh your losses. You'll have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">volatility</a> in your returns. Life is volatile and you can't predict what's going to happen. You can only make your bets, have stop losses in the market, and say \"I'm going to get out if I lose this amount of money\". Covel quotes Jason Gerlach of <a href=\"http://www.sunrisecapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunrise Capital</a> (a firm with a 30 year track record of success) as a response to those that say \"trend following is dead\": \"Trend following is no more dead than the sport of sailing or the act of kite flying would be considered dead if, for a period of time, the wind didn't blow. Like a sailboat, or a kite, a trend following trading model is designed to capture the power of environmental forces. When the requisite environmental forces don't occur for stretches of time, activities that depend on those environmental forces are not going to be successful. Once the winds started blowing again, sailboats will sail, and kites will again fly. The same holds true for trend following. Just as the wind will always return to blow in the future, the forces that drive price trends: greed, fear, euphoria, panic, will return at some point, and when they do, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trading models will make a great deal of money.\" Covel again notes AQR's paper discussing trend following's positive returns dating back to 1903 as evidence of this. Yes, there's a chance wind will never return, but do you want to bet everything on that?

Most Americans don't want to be on the endless treadmill, and maybe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> is a way to get the freedom that you need in order to find your calling. Next, Covel discusses a quote from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Prechter\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Prechter</a>, of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave\" target=\"_blank\">Elliott Wave</a> fame. Covel doesn't think that predictive techniques work, but Prechter had a fantastic piece of writing that Covel shares that analyzes some of the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\"> Fed</a> actions in the past compared to what they're doing now. Covel contemplates what this might mean, and how it shows the Fed might be in a panic. But what does this mean to a trend following trader? Very simply, it's just another reason to employ a trend following strategy. If the Fed has dampened <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation\" target=\"_blank\">speculation</a> in the past by raising interest rates to pop a bubble, and today you've got markets right back at the all-time highs but rates are still at 0%--what might this mean? If this scenario is accurate, what strategy do you employ? You can either trust the system, or you can put in place a strategy that only places trust in price action. Look at what Prechter says to inspire you to become a trend following trader. So how do you adjust? Covel goes on to discuss how to get \"unstuck\" quoting author <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Godin</a>: \"Starting without seeing the end is difficult, so we often wait until we see the end.\" Next, a quote from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Gawande\" target=\"_blank\">Atul Gawande</a> that talks about knowing your fallibility, and the importance of practice and nurture (in trend following).

Covel and Schwager discuss how Schwager was able to make \"Market Sense and Nonsense\" accessible to both professionals and laymen and touch on some of the subjects contained within: market fallacies and misconceptions; the idea of cable news \"experts\", and what would happen if you actually followed all of the picks made by people like<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer\" target=\"_blank\"> Jim Cramer</a> and other talking heads; comparing performance streams against each other, and why you have to consider more than just the number; volatility vs. risk; if coming to a good risk adjusted return is based more on a scientific approach or personal preference; leveraged <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund\" target=\"_blank\">ETF</a>s; the fear of hedge funds; the idea of leverage and why much of \"Market Sense and Nonsense\" was built around trying to understand it; and why fund-to-fund managers putting a large group of trend following traders together in one portfolio might not be a wise move.

Michael Covel explains the importance of maintaining an independent spirit, feeling comfortable standing alone and outside the crowd and being your own self. Covel contrasts this to the famous scene in \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho\" target=\"_blank\">American Psycho</a>\" where a group of executives compare the card stock and fancy presentation of their business cards trying to impress one another. That's the complete opposite of what \"Dancing With Myself\" gets at. Worry about yourself, not the crowd.

Hendry holds himself out in public as coming from a fundamental perspective, even though his hero is trend trader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Kovner\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Kovner</a>, who was trained by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Marcus_%28trader%29\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Marcus</a>, who was trained by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Seykota\" target=\"_blank\">Ed Seykota</a> (all trend following traders). You get the picture. Hendry honestly states that he doesn't know what's going to happen, but he puts himself in the position to have probabilistic bets that can profit when the market moves--in whatever direction. Covel moves on to quote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Einhorn_%28hedge_fund_manager%29\" target=\"_blank\">David Einhorn</a>, a hedge fund manager. What will the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">Fed</a> do if the bubble bursts when interest rates are at zero? Is Covel, in quoting Einhorn, trying to predict the future by talking about this subject? He's simply mapping out what he sees: A world that's rigged and manipulated, and a Federal Reserve that's trying to make its buddies at the big banks wealthy. In the midst of this how can you protect yourself and profit? The only way you can truly protect yourself is by looking at the price in the here and now from a trend following perspective. You can make decisions based on the price movement without having any idea what the Fed is doing behind the curtain. There is no certainty. There's only chaos, uncertainty, fractures, and cracks in the sidewalk. You have to have a plan before that fracture breaks. Although traders like Einhorn, Hendry, and John Hussman might not be trend following traders themselves, their observations certainly make the case for employing a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> strategy.

Covel defends studying the book as a psychological manifesto for \"navigating the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> waters\". Halfway through the book Covel realized how it sounded like all the trend following traders he's studied over the past fifteen years (even if it wasn't the author's intention). Covel isn't out to get you to start singing kumbaya and burning incense; he's just out to get you to look at the world differently so you can profit. Covel discusses Cullen Roche, author of the \"<a href=\"http://pragcap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pragmatic Capitalism</a>\" blog, who posted some quotes from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett\" target=\"_blank\">Warren Buffet</a> recently. Covel acknowledges that Buffett is one of the most successful <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneurs</a> in the history of modern man, but has no problem criticizing the myths that surround him. Buffett noted that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway\" target=\"_blank\">Berkshire</a> has $40 billion in cash on hand, but \"prices are difficult right now\". So, what does that even mean? Why is Buffett on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>? He's talking his \"book\", he's creating the aura, and perhaps confusing people into making decisions based off his advice. Or perhaps he simply needs his ego stroked. So, what do you buy based on that advice? How do you make buy and sell decisions? Trend following doesn't rely on vague statements, and the positive performance dates back to 1903. With trend following price is price. That is an under the radar concept though. Most people simply know Buffett's value investing<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold\" target=\"_blank\">, buy and hold</a> world. However, there are inherent problems in value investing and Covel investigates by quoting David Rosenberg and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hussman\" target=\"_blank\">John Hussman </a>along the way. From their fundamental perspective Rosenberg and Hussman lay the foundation for trend following without thst being their intention. Covel also goes on to discuss \"Finding Peace with Uncertainty\" from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Habits\" target=\"_blank\">Zen Habits</a> blog and announces a new $500 gun shooting video contest.

Inspired by watching beautiful tufts of grass that were only to be looked at and not stepped on Waters explains the lunacy needed to step out of bounds in society and step on the grass you aren't supposed to. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">Trend following</a> is all about standing in the middle of the grass and tearing it up to find enlightenment. On the heels of Waters' interview Covel discusses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Godin</a>'s new video, \"Stop Stealing Dreams\". Godin explains the number one purpose of school: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience_%28human_behavior%29\" target=\"_blank\">obedience</a>. Do as you're told and learn to be a cog in a wheel. Do you want to be an interchangeable part or do you want to create art? Waters sings about the lunatics who would dare to walk on the grass they weren't supposed to, and Godin questions the entire system of education. Why do people have such a hard time breaking out and finding a new way of thinking? Covel's analysis of Godin's work might give you some clues. All of this is a lead up to a fantastic white paper called \"A Century of Evidence on Trend Following Investing\" that tracks trend following performance back to 1903, which Covel discusses in detail.

The first comes from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Young</a>, his lyrics signifying the ups and downs of life and trading. The important thing is that we're along for the ride: \"I've been first and last, look at how the time goes past, but I'm all alone at last, rolling home to you.\" Covel discusses the unexpected inspiration he's found over the past few weeks leading up to his recent speaking engagement in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas\" target=\"_blank\">Las Vegas</a> arranged by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Sykes\" target=\"_blank\">Timothy Sykes</a>. As you would expect Covel found some important food for thought on his trip and he shares these eccentric lessons: A pamphlet found in a hotel room from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affliction_Clothing\" target=\"_blank\">Affliction Clothing</a>; a film called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi\" target=\"_blank\">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>\" that holds some important messages about passion and practice; a book that Covel received from his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga\" target=\"_blank\">Yoga</a> teacher titled \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Yoga-Works-Michael-Roach/dp/0976546906/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">How Yoga Works</a>\" that has more to do with trading than you'd ever expect; and the book \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Investment-Biker-Around-World-Rogers/dp/0812968719/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Investment Biker: On The Road with Jim Rogers</a>\". Covel also discusses a quote from famed trader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hite\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Hite</a> about how in the big picture nothing really changes. People are people and people are always motivated by greed and fear. A reader questions how high frequency trading and automation work into the equation and Covel answers. Covel also discusses some thoughts from more fundamental thinkers such as<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hendry\" target=\"_blank\"> Hugh Hendry</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hussman\" target=\"_blank\">John Hussman</a> (and why, whether it is their intention or not, they write great missives about why trend following works). From a strategy perspective how do you follow along and make money in a world where fundamentals don't offer you hope on the timing of things? How can you make money in that world? The answer is trend following. If you don't have trend following in your portfolio what are you missing? Covel also makes a big announcement for a special in-person seminar event in Las Vegas coming up in December. The event includes both of Covel's dinosaur systems (<a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com/trex/\" target=\"_blank\">T-Rex and Triceratops)</a>, a ton of materials (documents, audio, and video) that are unlikely to ever be released anywhere else, a long Friday night dinner, a full day session on Saturday--everything you need but the airfare.

He goes through the list and offers commentary on statements such as \"average people think money is the root of all evil; rich people believe poverty is the root of all evil.\" Money, Covel maintains, is just a medium of exchange and that's all it is. It's what you make of it that becomes good or bad. Readers will see that many of the precepts and principles in this article are straight out of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">Trend Following</a> 101. Further, commentary includes seeing money through the eyes of emotion vs. seeing it logically; following your passion vs. working for the man; setting low expectations vs. challenging yourself; knowing the markets are driven by emotion and greed; being a slave to debt; surviving vs. thriving; education vs. entertainment; finding comfort in uncertainty; and trend follower <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hite\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Hite</a>'s concept of asymmetric bets.

Melin has his fingers on the pulse of the nasty things going behind the scenes; specifically, over-the-counter (\"OTC\") markets and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Global\" target=\"_blank\">MF Global</a> scandal. Covel talks to Melin about his recent piece in Opalesque: \"<a href=\"http://www.imackgroup.com/mathematics/989981-the-untold-story-brooksley-born-larry-summers-the-truth-about-unlimited-risk-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">The Untold Story: Brooksley Born, Larry Summers & the Truth About Unlimited Risk Potential</a>\". Most understand stock and futures exchanges; you can trade in these exchanges and expect a certain amount of regulation and transparency, and people understand the balancing side of the equation. However, the OTC derivatives that Melin has been digging into are completely off the everyone exposed to a possible mega-implosion in the near future. Melin discusses the history of these unregulated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_%28finance%29\" target=\"_blank\">derivatives</a> and notes that if the problems that were initially identified by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooksley_Born\" target=\"_blank\">Brooksley Born</a> in 1998 are not properly addressed, the next market catastrophe could be worse than anything that has preceded it. Covel and Melin discuss the possible solutions; if politicians can actually be held accountable if there are no repercussions beyond not being reelected; and how the average American can digest this information and how it affects them. Covel also brings up the idea of the \"four political parties\": <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29\" target=\"_blank\">Republicans</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarians\" target=\"_blank\">Libertarians</a>, and Bankers. If you look at it from that perspective can they be defeated? (Covel: \"No.\") You can't vote the bankers out. Melin contends that if the debt crisis in Europe unfolds banks are going to expose the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_government\" target=\"_blank\">US government</a> to unlimited loss potential. Covel and Melin go on to discuss how people simply won't listen if the Dow is rigged to keep them happy; why the average person who sees the Dow at a high level today should care about this, and what they can do to protect themselves beyond sitting around and waiting for the sky to fall. Covel is the skeptic and Melin is the optimist in this fiery conversation about how to handle this situation before it implodes. Melin notes: \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">The Fed</a> cannot prop up the stock market forever.

In today's episode Covel closes this alienating gap with his explanation of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery\" target=\"_blank\">lottery</a> society\": The idea that you don't have to work--you simply make a small bet of your time and money and your your entire world can change through one single action (even though the odds say there is no chance). We've pushed aside the notion of purposeful, driven, consistent effort and work. You can see the concept of a \"lottery society\" beyond the notion of buying a scratch-off: the idea that the Presidential election will change your life, reality shows and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol\" target=\"_blank\">American Idol</a>'s instant fame fantasy and drugs and alcohol as the quick fix. It all sounds well and good, but the lottery mentality doesn't work. It sucks the life out of you. How did we even get to the point where being \"picked\" has replaced the notion of good, consistent hard work and creating something from scratch? It's the gap between wishing and doing. We're in a fantastic world of distraction and the lottery mentality is a perfect example of that distraction. Covel goes on to explain the parallels between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental analysis</a> and the lottery mindset; perspectives on the lottery mindset from writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Godin</a>; the perils of watering down a clear <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trading strategy with short term trading strategies, fundamental analysis, and media input; and the illusion that tools such as the iPhone make us more productive. Next, Covel notes how many want a hero these days (instead of viewing themselves as heroes). Currently, the \"hero de jour\" is Ben Bernanke, chairman of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\">The Federal Reserve</a>--except most don't have a grasp why his current rate policy is so problematic. When you have rates artificially reduced to zero it forces people to invest in the stock market. Covel offers commentary regarding current Fed policy by giving context via an exploration of recent tech and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_bubble\" target=\"_blank\">real estate bubble</a> histories. As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hugh_Smith\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Hugh Smith</a> (<a href=\"http://www.oftwominds.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.oftwominds.com</a>) has noted, \"If you prop up an artificial economy long enough, does it become real?\". Covel gives his personal view of the current situation: You know it's bad, you know it's eventually going to pop, but what do you do? That's the hard question. So how can you profit in the face of such uncertainty? Trend following is the profit answer when the black swan swims in.

You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me.\" <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Covel</a> opens up with one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time and notes some unexpected lessons that can be taken from the lyrics. Sticking with the theme of taking trend following inspiration from unexpected places, Covel then goes on to discuss several posts from<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Habits\" target=\"_blank\"> Zen Habits</a>, a blog that contains lessons from the perspective of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Buddhism\" target=\"_blank\">Zen Buddhism</a>. Covel discusses \"Finding Peace With Uncertainty\": \"Why is not knowing so scary? If you roll a dice and don\u2019t know what it will be, is that scary? No, it\u2019s not the 'not knowing' that\u2019s the problem it\u2019s the possibility that what comes up on that dice will bring us pain, suffering, loss.\" Covel relates this to a recent experiment he did that illustrates trend following through the roll of dice. If you get a two or a six, you win three pennies. Any other number, you lose a penny. The two and the six only come up a third of the time, and even though you don't win many of the rolls, the wins are big. The winners, because they're bigger, pay for the losers. That's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a>. So, how do you deal with uncertainty? Extricate yourself from harmful ideas and strategies: lose the small things that have no positive impact on your trading, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold\" target=\"_blank\">buy & hold</a> strategies, watching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>, etc. Know the worst case scenario. Become comfortable with waiting, and stop obsessing on uncertainty. Voltaire said, \"We never live; we are always in the expectation of living.\" That's the goal. It's not the expectation of living--it's the \"right now\" that's important. In the next section, Covel comments on some trading and life commandments--inspirational reminders that you need to hear, including \"The Ten Most Foolish Things a Trader Can Do\".

It's a personal fight and personal responsibility for all those out there. And if you trade to money the fight to understand the topic of losses should be at the top of your list of concerns. Most people want to hear \"instant profits\"; they want to run away from discussing losses. However, knowing how to strategically approach losses is one of the most important concepts to understand as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trader. Covel shares a note from a fan who made a connection between Covel's work and some of the ideas found in famed quarterback<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Montana\" target=\"_blank\"> Joe Montana</a>'s book, \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Spirit-Principles-Performance-Excellence/dp/073932294X/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Winning Spirit</a>\": \"In training for success, we shouldn't hide from failure. Just like football players in the film room, we study failure. We want to see how it happens and which strategies work to keep us from making the same mistakes again.\" This doesn't just apply to trading: The loss cutting can be a relationship, a business, a family member--it can be anything. How do you know when to cut your losses and get out? Covel goes on to talk about the concepts of opportunity costs and sunk costs. When you've spent the money and it turns out to be \"gone\" you can't fret about it. It's over--it's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost\" target=\"_blank\">sunk cost</a>. An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost\" target=\"_blank\">opportunity cost</a> is equally important: If you are doing A, you can't do B. It's a choice. If you invest your time, energy, or money in one relationship or one business, you can't spend your time, energy, or money with another. There is a cost to choosing one opportunity over another. Covel expands on these concepts relating them to familiar companies like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>. Covel goes on to discuss how people have difficulty letting bygones be bygones; why people have difficulty with stop-losses in trading; and why having a system that forces you to take losses is the foundation of trend following trading success.

Some people seem to have genetic disposition for certain skills; however, the drive to succeed supersedes any genetic disposition you may have.

However, Dalio says he isn't a trend following trader in the traditional sense: he's 100% systematic using fundamental information--not technicals. Covel goes on to surmise that there is evidence that some portion of Dalio's business is perhaps in the technical trend following space. Covel also talks managed futures: the origin of the term; how it describes an instrument and not a strategy; and its relation to trend following.

However, if you put the lobster in cool water and slowly bring it to a boil the lobster will accept its fate. <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Covel</a> notes that this is the scene for many investors today: they're like the live lobster in a pot of cold water as it's coming to a boil and they don't know what's coming. Covel presents this idea and several others in the context of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling\" target=\"_blank\">gambling</a>, chance, and uncertainty. Gambling can be a pejorative term for many, but Covel relates it to trading. Covel discusses an article entitled, \"<a href=\"http://knowledge.insead.edu/leadership-management/strategy/the-illusion-of-control-dancing-with-chance-2218\" target=\"_blank\">The Illusion of Control: Dancing With Chance</a>\" and relates its ideas to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> trading. Covel also discusses a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_%28conference%29\" target=\"_blank\">TED</a> video from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Evans\" target=\"_blank\">Dylan Evans</a>. Evans talks about three different types of gamblers: problem gamblers, leisure gamblers, and expert gamblers. Covel extends Evans' categorization to traders. These different types of gamblers play for different reasons, handle profit and loss differently, and bet on different games. Are you a problem trader, a leisure trader or an expert trader? Do you trade for fun or for money? While problem gamblers will bet the farm, leisure gamblers know their limits (using a nascent kind of stop strategy), and expert gamblers aim for profit. A problem gambler will bet on anything, but an expert gambler will only bet on games with an element of skill. Covel also analyzes Evans' three ways to make decisions: setting a threshold (how much are you willing to lose?); bet sizing (how much do you bet on each trade?); and the expected value (if you follow your strategy, what is going to be your average winner and average loser?) If you look at the market price of a diversified portfolio of markets, have an entry and exit strategy, and have a bet sizing strategy, then you can make money over the long haul if you have a positive expected value.

Covel talks about the Occupy movement, about criticism he's received in support of Jay-Z's stance, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> in general, and the culture of \"trolling\" that has popped up on the internet. Next, Covel covers some of the more technical details regarding trend following trading. How can you detect a trend? How can you measure it? For anyone with a pulse, it's really simple. A trend is from point A to point B. There are all kinds of different trend lengths, but you don't know the trend until it's over; you enter, you exit, and then you see where the trend was. The goal is to capture the \"meat\" in the middle. Covel covers the five basic precepts of trend following: What markets are you going to follow? What will be your signal to enter a trade? What will be your exit signal for getting out with a gain? What will your exit signal be for getting out with a loss? What will your bet size be? Covel also discusses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawdown_%28economics%29\" target=\"_blank\">drawdowns</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation\" target=\"_blank\">speculation</a>, and entry signals. He notes the connection between wildcatting/speculation and trend following, referencing P.T. Anderson's film about oil speculators, \"There Will Be Blood\". You can enter randomly, but if you can give yourself an edge on the entry, you should take it. Think about drilling an oil well: You show up and you start drilling holes. You can drill randomly, but if you do a little geological homework, you can find out where to drill to increase your odds. The same logic applies to trend following. You're going to drill a lot of holes: some of them are going to be dry, but you're going to hit a few gushers along the way. No one will care about the dry holes when you hit the gusher that pays for them all. You can either call Fidelity, give them all your money, and wait and hope that you have the timing correct for your own retirement; or you can craft your life around looking for the gushers with a strategy that gives you an edge.

Dr. Elder worked as a psychiatrist in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City\" target=\"_blank\">New York City</a> and taught at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia University</a>, and he shares with Covel how his experience as a psychiatrist provided him with a unique insight into trading. Dr. Elder's work has established him as one of today's leading experts on trading psychology and in the use of technical analysis with money management. Elder and Covel talk about the psychology of trading; how a high degree of education can sometimes be a hindrance; the most dangerous personality traits to have as a trader; the stages of trader development; the importance of money management; the importance of keeping records and diaries of your trades; the notion of exiting long positins and shorting weakness; the similarities and differences between traders in different geographic locations; and how financial markets can be like manic depressive patients.

And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.\" That quotation inpsired <a href=\"http://www.trendfollowing.com\" target=\"_self\">Michael Covel</a> to analyze the two political conventions in America over the past few weeks offering a trend following perspective as an alternative. Within politics people seem to be<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marionettes\" target=\"_blank\"> marionettes</a> attached to strings with invisible hands moving them all around. On either side of the aisle you have people blindly following \"their guy\" thinking their political win is the answer to their problems. Yet if you want the dollars in your account to go up clapping like a \"happy seal\" at one of this conventions ain't going to cut it. Covel compares today's landscape to the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_%28franchise%29\" target=\"_blank\">Twilight Zone</a> episode where Roddy McDowall finds himself crash landed on Mars only to realize the comfortable home that has been made for him is a prison where he is exhibited like he's in a zoo--an \"earthling in his natural habitat\". Covel also notes how technology is arbitraging away the need for human capital and how no politician in America is honest enough to admit it. If so, how do you succeed in this environment? You have to pick an option that's not simply a political belief in \"your guy\". So what's a way out? Covel lines up some of the basic trend following concepts and applies the eight key features of the scientific method. However, if everyone adopts trend following how can it still be successful? The vast majority of invested assets are in buy and hold <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds\" target=\"_blank\">mutual funds</a> and unless people stop <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling\" target=\"_blank\">gambling</a>, stop watching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>, and stop drawing false parallels, trend following will never be adopted by the masses. However, the fact that most people are unable to adopt<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a> gives you the leg up and a fantastic opportunity to mint cash. Get out of the human zoo. Stop being a marionette. Stop being manipulated. And do something big for yourself.

Burns' start came during the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_bubble\" target=\"_blank\">tech bubble</a> of the late 1990's, and he discusses how the bubble bursting helped to shift his perspective from a fundamental, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold\" target=\"_blank\">buy and hold</a> approach to the trend trading perspective he's adopted today. Covel expands on some of the chapter titles in Burns' book, such as \"New traders try to prove they are right, rich traders admit when they're wrong,\" and \"New traders bet the farm, rich traders carefully control position size.\" They also discuss the problems with buy and hold; how \"rich\" can be a mindset rather than a number; the role of luck and circumstance in trading; staying away from the need for constant action and waiting for the \"fat pitch\"; developing a robust system; staying away from predictive trading approaches; and viewing the markets as a video game as a means to help with trend trading understandings.

These articles are the digital stress and information overload of our lives. They don't help us make decisions; instead, they distract. Covel relates this to a white paper from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of England</a> called \"<a href=\"http://www.bis.org/review/r120905a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Dog and the Frisbee</a>\". Thousands of decisions and factors go into the simple act of a dog catching a frisbee, but does the dog ever think of all those factors? Does the dog crunch the higher math? No! This makes for an easy connection to trading. The objective is to reduce trading decisions down to a simple factors, and to make good buy and sell decisions with some sort of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management\" target=\"_blank\">risk-management</a> constraint. So, how do you reduce the buy/sell decision-making process down to something manageable?

Focusing on the thousands of factors that can go into any market decision will leave your head spinning; if you adopt a trend following approach, you can reduce all decision-making down to the price action up or down of the instrument you're trading.

Gibbons talks to Covel about how he got started in the markets; the fallacies of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold\" target=\"_blank\">buy & hold</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental analysis</a>; trading prices apart from everything else (and how this is close to playing the market like a video game, i.e. pong); the problem of when the media is simply \"making things up\"; how trading can be primarily psychological; the problems of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_market_hypothesis\" target=\"_blank\">efficient market hypothesis</a> (EMH) and academia; the benefits of having a trend following strategy during chaotic times; the danger of gurus; and separating your ego from your trading.

Covel received some feedback from a listener that took exception with Covel's characterization of Twitter and StockTwits, noting that the service isn't limited to one style of trading. Covel doesn't disagree, but notes that it's entirely irrelevant. If you're in the market to make money using a price-based trend following system, any other information is extraneous. The non-stop continuous flow of information never ends; it's simply a distraction. Covel also discusses the importance of consistency: If you don't have consistency in your thought process, how can you have consistency in your process of trading? Be consistent with your use of price as the basis of your system. Covel reads from an upcoming, updated edition of his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1118063503/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Little Book of Trading</a> with some new writing from Cole Wilcox. Wilcox's description of trend following as purely data-driven system that is immune to politicking is a perfect counter to someone who might be missing the point of why Covel takes issue with StockTwits, Twitter, etc. Covel also discusses a great passage by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Friedman</a>. Friedman discusses the impossibility of a single man manufacturing a pencil by himself. There are thousands of people who cooperate together to make a pencil, all motivated by the presence of a market. It's a marvelous example of how you can get a complex structure of cooperation and coordination which no individual planned; rather, it is coordinated by the market. It was not directed under the hand of state centralized authority. While the connections to trend following and Friedman's point may not be obvious, there is a connection on the psychological side. To the person who wants to get ahead on their own, the answer is there. Either you want the state to do/fix things for you, or you go out and try and get things done on your own. Everyone has to choose their path.

For those that recall <a href=\"http://trendfollowing.libsyn.com/dave-stendahl-interview-trend-following-manifesto-with-michael-covel\" target=\"_blank\">Covel's Dave Stendahl's interview</a>, Getson is an associate of Stendahl. Getson has a degree in psychology and philosophy from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University\" target=\"_blank\">Duke University</a>, an MBA and law degree from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University\" target=\"_blank\">Northwestern</a>, and has practiced corporate law. Getson is running a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund\" target=\"_blank\">hedge fund</a> today as well as a quant research shop, and he's in the business of systematically finding edges through all sorts of different approaches - not only trend following. Getson started his first business in the sixth grade, and he has always had the mind of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneur</a>. He talks about his legal background and how being a practicing corporate attorney influenced his trading and other business practices - as well as how a diverse background can help. Covel and Getson also discuss the \"E-gene\", and how entrepreneurism is at the core of what both Getson and Covel practice. In 1991, Getson left his law practice, became the CEO of a fast-growing technology company, and started trading. Covel and Getson pick up Getson's progress from there, and discuss how hunches can be dangerous; turning your hobby into your business; recognizing patterns; the \"three levels of mastery\" - cognitive, emotional, and physical; how minimum standards can define your life; how systematic trading can define your minimum standards; and controlling emotions through automation. They also discuss the importance of travel with a focus on Southeast Asia in particular and why this area of the world is so important to keep an eye on.

However, you don't stand much of a chance if you play the game like this. But how do you go about a strategy that gives you more than an outside chance of winning? The first step is to train the space in between your ears and develop a better philosophy. Covel plays a clip from \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickson_Gracie\" target=\"_blank\">Choke</a>\", a documentary on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship\" target=\"_blank\">UFC fighting </a>champion and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiu_jitsu\" target=\"_blank\">jiu jitsu</a> practitioner <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickson_Gracie\" target=\"_blank\">Rickson Gracie</a>. In jiu jitsu, everything is based on leverage. Gracie talks about momentum, putting yourself in the right position, and reacting to what your opponent gives you in the \"moment of now\". Your strategy must not be to anticipate what is going to happen, but to react. It's all about getting leverage on your opponent, getting in the right position, and adapting to the situation. Markets are the same way: they're going up and down constantly like a \"bucking bronco\", as trader<a href=\"http://www.dunncapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Bill Dunn</a> famously said. It's difficult to accept. Most people want to have control of their environment, but we're all in a great wave, and the only choice is to ride it with a strategy in place. Rickson Gracie teaches the philosophy, but once you move beyond that, you must know how to execute this \"moment of now\" strategy. Covel discusses a clip from author <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell\" target=\"_blank\">Malcolm Gladwell</a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink:_The_Power_of_Thinking_Without_Thinking_%28book%29\" target=\"_blank\">Blink</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point:_How_Little_Things_Make_a_Big_Difference\" target=\"_blank\">The Tipping Point</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers:_The_Story_of_Success_%28book%29\" target=\"_blank\">Outliers</a>) to illustrate this point. Gladwell's example focuses on emergency room doctors, and how diagnosing chest pain can be enhanced by simply limiting the number of factors to be considered. If you reduce the number of data points for a doctor to consider, and limit it to the four most important factors, his ability to become a better diagnostician increases exponentially. It's the same in trading, except there is only one factor worth consideration: price action. How many different data points can you actually digest? How are you going to take an action to buy or sell with millions of data points? It's simple: you must reduce the variables to something more manageable by focusing on price.

It's not smart to have a trading strategy that says, \"I must make a certain amount each day\". You must wait, be patient, and have a plan, but not act if there's nothing to do. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">Trend following</a> puts you in the position to benefit when something big or unexpected happens, and teaches you that when you're put in the right position, you jump on it. Covel talks about the importance of waiting, and how the best strategy to employ is to follow price movement. Covel excerpts a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_%28conference%29\" target=\"_blank\">TED</a> talk from Baba Shiv regarding when it's the right move to take the figurative \"passenger seat\" instead of the \"driver's seat\". Shiv's example is based on medical decisions, but this extends to every facet of life--especially trading. Baba Shiv reduced it to the simplest factors, and with trading it's a good idea to do the same. In this case, it's price. Reducing yourself to the passenger seat in following price movement is the best move you can make, and Covel explains why. Don't follow the news, don't follow the tweets; follow the price. Covel also discusses an article in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a> from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shiller\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Shiller</a>, talking about a home price rebound. Shiller discusses house prices, whether we're at the bottom, and momentum. Momentum (the tendency for prices to keep moving in the same direction) is caused by \"feedback loops\" according to Shiller. Covel contends that the article states that we need to make another fake <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble\" target=\"_blank\">bubble</a> to make everyone happy again. In the article, Shiller also contends that momentum doesn't apply to the stock market, but is exclusive to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_market\" target=\"_blank\">housing market</a>. Covel notes that, of course, the same feedback loops and the same momentum does happen in the stock market. While it's great that Shiller makes these observations about momentum, bubbles, and feedback loops, you can't predict these things. You have to have a strategy to take advantage of them when they do happen.

If following the global chatter about market information is so important, how come the world's greatest traders don't do it? Covel refers to an interview on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a> with the CEO of StockTwits. This day-to-day, mob-rule idea of following \"trends\" is sheep behavior, and following the news so tightly all day long is akin to sitting at the craps table in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas\" target=\"_blank\">Vegas</a>. Are you in the market to make money, or to talk about the market? Do you want to make a profit, or do you want to sit around talking about your trades at cocktail parties or on Twitter? Trading is not a group activity. If you have to constantly bounce your ideas off of others, it isn't good technique. Your basic system should tell you when to pull the trigger or take a loss. True trend following is the total antithesis of looking at day-to-day, minute-to-minute Twitter talk. The important principles include following a diversified group of markets, having a good entry strategy, knowing how much to bet of your limited capital, and knowing when to get out of the market. Taking an action based on random Twitter or StockTwits chat is not the way to be a great trader. Accepting the fact that you don't know which way the market is headed is really the ticket to success. The news and information never stop, and building your strategy around \"I don't know\" is one of the most important things you can do. It opens up a world of opportunity. Wait for the movement. Wait for the trending price. And put yourself in the position to make big money when the big moves happen.

Covel discusses a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Television\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg television</a> interview with Cole Wilcox of <a href=\"http://longboard-am.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Longboard Asset Management</a> (featured in Covel's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1118063503/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">Little Book of Trading</a>). Wilcox discusses how his strategy is purely based on price trends and catching the big waves when they come along, as opposed to any sort of predictive or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental analysis</a>. The Bloomberg reporters simply can't wrap their heads around the fact that Wilcox doesn't have any specific picks or predictions in the market. They ask about specific markets and push to create some sort of narrative (Where do you see energy going? Where do you see fixed income going? Where do you see stock indices going?). Covel notes that if the reporters don't have a story, they don't have a business - that's the bottom line. Wilcox's bottom line is price and profitability; nothing else matters. Despite the fact that Wilcox doesn't know where the market is going, that doesn't stop the Bloomberg folks from thinking that there is a way to figure it out. Covel relates this to a recent speech he gave in Vancouver. One of the slides he used in his presentation, a quote from trader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tudor_Jones\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Tudor Jones</a>, states that fundamentals are religion: \"The illusion has been created that there is an explanation for everything, with the primary task to find that explanation\". This is precisely what the Bloomberg reporters were doing to Cole Wilcox: they want an explanation, a story, a narrative. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">Trend following</a> drives a stake through the primary tenet of modern financial theory: the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_market_hypothesis\" target=\"_blank\"> efficient market hypothesis</a>. How do you reduce your decision-making to something that's easily digestible? You reduce it to price. There is an illusion that we can control the market; trend following dispenses with this illusion so you can follow the waves and concentrate on what really matters - the price. It's ok to say \"I don't know what's going to happen\", but you have no choice but to build a strategy around not knowing the outcome.

Covel and Rathe talk about some of the practical/physical factors involved in the futures pit in the late 80's/early 90's. In the off-season, some of Chicago's athletes would work in the pits, and Rathe was surrounded by ex-Bulls, Blackhawks, and Bears. It was a very physical game back then, and Rathe saw broken ribs in the pits. Rathe shares some great anecdotes about someone who sold his spot in the pit for $1 million dollars - even though there were no assigned spots to begin with. Covel and Rathe discuss the move to screen-based exchanges (computer trading) replacing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_trading\" target=\"_blank\">floor trading</a>; Rathe states that when you get off the floor, it takes on more and more importance to have a systematic, non-emotion based trading strategy. Rathe fell into working at<a href=\"http://www.globexintl.com/corporate/\" target=\"_blank\"> Globex</a>, which was just starting, and saw some of the beginnings of electronic trading.

Holiday discusses the hard truths behind the media today: the blog-online media cycle not only drives the offline cycle, but determines and directs culture itself. As Holiday notes, a famous journalist once said in the early 1900's: \"America is a country governed by public opinion, and public opinion is governed by newspapers. Isn't it critical that we understand what governs newspapers?\" Today, newspapers have been replaced by the internet, blogs, and online media - and the internet rules over us all. It's integral that we understand what governs us in a world where page views drive everything. Holiday shares several stories that illuminate the truth behind the media today: the presidential candidacy of Tim Pawlenty, how Andrew Breitbart was able to exploit the system; and how Holiday was able to manufacture a fake controversy and jumpstart an ad-campaign he was working on - only to create real controversy along the way. Covel and Holiday also discuss the media food chain; what goes into media manipulation; the lie of \"if you're doing something great, it will be heard\"; gatekeepers in the media; how blogs are our digital bloodsport; why being inaccurate and inflammatory gets more page views; and how we don't seek honesty or reality. Cicero used to say, \"Who benefits?\". Ask yourself and examine who is writing what, and what they gain from it.

In a recent speech, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama\" target=\"_blank\">President Obama</a> said, \"If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen\". While his speech noted some great communal national achievements, it negated the importance of the individual to a great degree. It's not a political issue; whether you're on the right or the left, you are responsible for your own work. The state can't fix your problems. It's up to you. America may have built the infrastructure and the roads, but an individual made the car. There are some great things that have come about as communal, national achievements; however, mitigating the individual achievements of entrepreneurs gets us nowhere. A few years ago <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush\" target=\"_blank\">President Bush</a> stated that he needed to suspend the free market system to save the free market system.

De Villiers had no background in finance until he left university. Instead, he studied experimental physics in superconductivity, which helped give him the background in analyzing and looking for patterns in data (that he later used in his financial career). Staying in South Africa, he found it difficult to find work, but met a woman at an investment bank--and that opened a door. He was assigned to a graduate development program and found his way into the trading room. The idea of hiring individuals with scientific backgrounds was just taking off at that time in South Africa, and De Villiers got in on the ground floor. De Villiers eventually teamed up with Brett Venter and founded Neural Capital in 2004. They started by looking at predictive investment models using neural networks; however, this didn't pan out, and they eventually found the trend following strategy that they employ today. Covel and De Villiers discuss that when you're at a big bank the performance can be based on the franchise you're working at; the connection of ego to performance; how to explain a trend following approach to clients; capturing the \"fat\" of the trend; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers\" target=\"_blank\">outliers</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" target=\"_blank\">black swans</a>; putting the unexpected moves in your favor; the relation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_finance\" target=\"_blank\">behavioral finance</a>; and insuring that you're in the game for when the big winners come.

Stendahl's world is 100% systematic, and he has been involved in conceptualizing and thinking up systematic approaches to trading the market for decades. But what is a system? Stendahl's explanation appeals both to the average person and to the seasoned trader. Stendahl's approach is that a system should have as few moving parts as possible; it should be simple enough to be explained on the back of a cocktail napkin. Covel and Stendahl make an analogy to cars, and how you can easily fix a simpler car in your garage as opposed to a complex Lexus. Stendahl explains that everyone is using a system in one way or another: every time you make a decision to buy or liquidate, whether it's based on a real system or based on advice from someone on the television, it's systematic in some regard. If you can talk it, you should be able to quantify it. If you can't quantify it, it might not really be there. Stendahl also talks about his beginnings, collaborating with his father in the mid 1970's. This was his exposure to the investment arena. It wasn't until college that he started taking \"technical\" things more seriously. When he was introduced to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">technical analysis</a>, and had the lightbulb moment, he realized he could make money based off of something other than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">fundamentals</a>. Interestingly, this was rooted in Stendahl's dyslexia. He turned this disadvantage into an advantage, and was forced to find his own solutions: to learn specifically how to automate everything from start to finish. This allowed him to look at numbers and trading from another light, and this approach ended up being very profitable for him. Covel also asks Stendahl about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Dalio</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Associates\" target=\"_blank\">Bridgewater</a>, who says that he is 100% systematic, but doesn't use any technical information. Stendahl explains that Dalio says he's looking at fundamentals from all these different markets, and this requires a huge amount of work. For Stendahl, he simply has one major input. Making price action systematic vs. taking in a massive number of fundamentals systematically. In the early 90's, Stendahl tried to work with fundamentals, but he found that the numbers were always changing, the data was slow, and given the amount of inputs, it would be much more complex and slow to put a good systematic program together. Stendahl chose to take the easier and more robust route, but he was very sophisticated in the way his systems were designed. Your system doesn't have to be complex to work. Sometimes the best system can be only four lines of code. Covel and Stendahl also discuss position sizing and money management, and how you can approach this systematically.

What you might not realize is that this philosophy is incredibly relevant to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> traders. Michael discuses one post in particular called \"<a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/allow/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wisdom of Allowing Things to Happen</a>\". In our Western society, we're doers and creators; we don't just wait for things to happen. Michael doesn't discount the amount of effort needed to start a successful business or to be a trend following trader, but there is immense value in simply allowing things to happen, observing, and responding to the change. Covel discusses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen\" target=\"_blank\">Zen</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga\" target=\"_blank\">Yoga</a>, and the aforementioned article from a trend following perspective. We think we're in control, but we're really not. We don't control the overwhelming power of nature or the market, yet we have the illusion of control in our lives. \"You learn how things work. Instead of trying to make things work the way you want them to work, just watch them work. You'll learn more about human nature, about the nature of the world, as you see things work without you controlling it. It might change you. The best you can do is take what is presented to you in the moment of now and respond to it. Covel relates several anecdotes that link the Zen mindset and trading. \"To control your cow, give it a bigger pasture\". By allowing things to happen, giving them more room to grow and prosper, your needs will also be met - and you've done no work.\" Ultimately, trend following is about allowing something to happen. With trend following, you can't control the cow, you can't control the market. However, you can react and respond to it. The trend follower's job is not to predict, but to observe and respond. You don't control the markets. You don't control how much you're going to make tomorrow. If you accept the fact that you don't know what will happen, you open yourself up to better ways to minimize risk, better strategies that embrace the unknown, and outcomes that you couldn't conceive of on your own. The wisdom of allowing things to happen is rock central to life success, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneurial</a> success, and trend following success.

Being part of the system is not going to reward you, and if you're awake to the outside world, you can see things you wouldn't otherwise notice that you can use to your advantage. From his childhood to early experiences doing opposition research in a political campaign, Covel offers several anecdotes regarding \"lightbulb\" moments that have come about as a result of thinking outside the box. Covel has used the same principles and outside-the-box thinking to get at the insights of how<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\"> trend following</a> really works. Trying to figure out how people like<a href=\"http://www.dunncapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Bill Dunn</a>,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry\" target=\"_blank\"> John W.

He relates the story that was the foundational thread for much of his later work. Covel also connects outside-the-box thinking to trend following in general: If there's anything hard about being a trend following trader, it's that you have to be comfortable being by yourself. You can't take solace in the crowd, and thinking differently is the key.

Profit From It</a>.\" Covel talks to Dever about being an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneur</a> from an early age and making his first investments in his early 20s. Starting with $5,000 in 1979, Dever quickly ran it up to $60,000 and learned some of his first trading lessons along the way. After deciding to set up some systematic trading models to help protect his investments, he put together his first fund in 1981. Dever had some interesting experiences at a fairly young age with some people who became big names on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street</a>: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tudor_Jones\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Tudor Jones</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry\" target=\"_blank\">John W. Henry</a>. Deciding to get outside brokers to manage a fund to diversify his own business, he ended up starting funds with both of these legendary traders. Covel and Dever discuss some of the myths discussed in \"Jackass Investing\"; how everybody is a market timer; the stigma against investing in futures; return drivers; the risks you take by being risk averse; and the shift in attitudes towards volatility in America. In 2011, Dever relaunched Brandywine; he discusses why strategies based on sound return drivers are so important to his firm and where he's at today. Dever was on the show many months ago, but this episode goes much more in depth with some really fantastic color regarding the early stages of the managed money world.

Covel and Patterson trace the history of high speed trading and electronic communication networks (ECNs) back to Josh Levine, who founded Island, the computer system that led to the high frequency trading we see today. Patterson discusses the technological revolution behind Island, and how its transparency led to dark pools - opaque markets where bids and offers are not made public. Dark pools have the benefit of operating in the shadows, helping institutions do what they do without anyone checking in on them. Today, Patterson goes on to propose that the entire market has gone dark.

Despite his scientific background, he's always had a strong interest in finance.

Covel disputes the criticism that, if you teach something, the sheer act of being compensated to provide information to people disqualifies you from having a valid opinion. If Nobel prize winner <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Kahneman</a> gets paid to teach at Princeton, does that invalidate his work?

He made quite a bit before the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_bubble\" target=\"_blank\">tech bubble </a>burst; when it popped, he was left with the feeling that there was still plenty of opportunity, and he forged forward. He moved to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_city\" target=\"_blank\">New York</a> with his then-girlfriend and wound up living directly behind the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Stock_Exchange\" target=\"_blank\"> American Stock Exchange</a>, where he spent six or seven months handing out his resume (litetrally on the streets to Wall Street warriors). Eventually, he found himself working for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Mulheren\" target=\"_blank\">John Mulheren</a>. Bazile relates a story where Mulheren went on vacation after taking a large position. When Mulheren's team sold 80% on the second day of what would become a three week rally, Mulheren returned from his vacation furious, and Bazile learned one of his most valuable trend following lessons. This sent him down a path where he visited <a href=\"http://www.dunncapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Dunn</a> in Stewart, Florida, and eventually ended up working for <a href=\"http://turtletrader.com/trader-ken-tropin/\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Tropin</a> at <a href=\"https://www.grahamcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Graham Capital</a>.

Aponte tells some revealing anecdotes along the way, including a run in with casino security that ended with them actually asking for his autograph. A must listen for any investor--blackjack player or not.

Covel also talks about an article called \"Spotting Bulls*** in Financial News in a Few Easy Steps\". He profiles one young writer in particular, and how anybody right out of college with a journalism degree can reach millions of people in the financial markets, yet still not have any idea what they're talking about. Not to pick on this young writer, Covel discusses how dangerous articles like this can be for an inexperienced trader. Staying in the world of media, he discusses two videos on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a> in the last week. One interview with Jason Gerlach of <a href=\"http://www.sunrisecapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunrise Capital</a> had CNBC, in typical style, asking for specific picks; Gerlach explained that this is not in line with a trend following approach, to complete confusion from CNBC on air types. Another CNBC piece with Jeff Applegate from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley</a> had him explaining managed futures as a relative safe haven. Of course, CNBC's reply left Covel shaking his head. Covel also discusses the Facebook IPO craze, puts it in context of the last tech bubble, and takes a look at how you can't trade it from a trend following perspective - yet. He also previews an upcoming podcast with a member of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Blackjack_Team\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Blackjack Card Counting team</a>, as discussed in the book <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_Down_the_House_%28book%29\" target=\"_blank\">Bringing Down The House</a>.

In fact, two of the original turtles were on competing blackjack teams. Covel waxes that wisdom can be gained from people from other walks of life, especially those closely related to the trading world.

When institutional funding stood in the way of working on a particle accelerator, a unique opportunity to work in the financial markets beckoned. After answering a mysterious newspaper advertisement in 1996, Vaca ended up working at the legendary C&amp;D Commodities (see book: '<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061241717/trendfollowin-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Complete TurtleTrader</a>'); he was handed a copy of<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Schwager\" target=\"_blank\"> Jack Schwager</a>'s '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Wizards\" target=\"_blank\">Market Wizards</a>', and quickly realized the achievements of his new employers.

An education major in college, Stewart was introduced to the financial services world before ever entering the classroom as a teacher. Stewart started his career in finance around 1995, and he shares some of his experiences coming of age during the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotcom_bubble\" target=\"_blank\">dotcom bubble</a>. Once the bubble burst, he immersed himself for ten hours a day for several years studying books such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Schwager\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Schwager</a>'s \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Wizards\" target=\"_blank\">Market Wizards</a>\", which led him to his lightbulb moment; he explains how this led him into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following\" target=\"_blank\">trend following</a> space. Stewart also relates an interesting experience he had at a panel in November of 2008 where he explained, in song, how he wasn't able to predict the markets. Afterwards, an esteemed guest brought up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Taleb\" target=\"_blank\">Nassim Taleb</a>'s \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_%28Taleb_book%29\" target=\"_blank\">The Black Swan</a>\" - and somehow missed the point that Stewart was following the markets rather than following luck. This leads to conversation about how ego can hurt you in the trend following world, why a majority will never really want to adopt a trend following perspective, and the zen of accepting that you'll never be able to accurately predict where the markets might go.

First, Michael discusses former<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers\" target=\"_blank\"> Lehmen Brothers</a> veterans starting a \"systematic innovative volatility fund\". Michael cuts through the jargon and gets down to the core issue: at the end of the day, a trend following strategy has to be clear, and this one sounds confusing. Michael also discusses a newsletter from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hendry\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Hendry</a>, although technically a fundamental trader, Michael brings up how Hendry might indeed be a \"closet\" trend following trader. Hendry's core ideas are important to trend following philosophy, such as taking control of your own destiny, and the belief that the unexpected will happen. \"You're on your own, you must take ownership of your own destiny\".
