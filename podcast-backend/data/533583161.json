Many listeners are discovering the power of feedback, of taking it out of the realm of the rare and into the stream of the every day. Not to sound repetitive, but most managers see feedback as akin to holding their breath - waiting as long as possible, and then creating a lot of sound and often fury. The Feedback Model tells us to see feedback like breathing - so regular as to become unnoticed.Many of you have written asking questions about how to counter some of the typical responses to the feedback you give. \"What do I do or say when they tell me they'll 'think about it'? What if they SAY they'll make the change, only to continue in their ineffective behavior patterns? As you might imagine, we've dealt with these issues before, and this show talks about the approach to take, and once again, gives you SPECIFIC things to say and why they work.We do a brief review of the feedback model at the front of the cast, but still encourage you to give a listen to our original cast, in the July Archives.", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/0c/09/71/0c0971b6-450a-2867-a71e-7926c03d94a4/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/0c/09/71/0c0971b6-450a-2867-a71e-7926c03d94a4/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://podcasts.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-2005-10-10.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 533583161, "seriesTitle": "Manager Tools Basics", "pubDate": 1121722165, "title": "Giving Effective Feedback - Part 4 (Updated)", "author": "mauzenne", "summary": "In this week's podcast, Mike and Mark share a technique managers can use to give feedback to their team members.
