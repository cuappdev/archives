She's divorced, holds no retirement savings, and will only receive a tiny Social Security check. Her health is worsening, and she'll need to step away from work shortly.\u00a0The caller wants to help her mother-in-law ... but how?<br /> <br /> Our second question comes from Erin, a listener who's moving to California and needs to buy a car. She's new to the world of car-buying, and wants to know how she can get a great deal. What red flags should she watch out for?<br /> <br /> Our third question comes from Hong, a 32-year-old mother of two who's interested in early retirement.\u00a0She's thinking about saving money in a 401k until she maximizes her employer match, then switching to a Traditional IRA, and then switching back to saving in her 401k. Should she pursue this strategy? How can she maximize her tax advantages?<br /> <br /> Our fourth question comes from John, who wants to know what I've learned from building an online course. He's contemplating creating one of his own.<br /> <br /> Finally, I answer a question from Adalia, who wants to know if my online business and real estate business are structured as part of the same company, or operated as two separate entities. She asks if I can talk about how I made my business structuring decisions.<br /> <br /> Have a question? Record it from your smartphone or computer.

We refused to accept the defaults that were handed to us. We viewed our investments as a way to create a more sustainable, meaningful life.<br /> <br /> We rejected the limiting belief that a creative, meaningful life is somehow more 'pure' when it's lived in scarcity and deprivation. We embraced abundance. We asked \"how can I create this?\" We viewed every problem as inherently solve-able. We took responsibility for everything that crossed our paths.<br /> <br /> Most critically, we decided that we weren't going to let any excuses hold us back.<br /> <br /> We accepted radical responsibility for our own lives. We wouldn't allow ourselves to get trapped in a victim mindset, a comparison (\"they-have-it-easier!\") mindset, or an external-factors-are-holding-me-back mindset.<br /> <br /> I rarely meet people who have committed to the inner work of internalizing these lessons. Emma is one of those rare people.<br /> <br /> And that's why I'm excited to share our breakfast conversation with you.<br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy this episode.

It's trite and impersonal and overused.<br /> <br /> But it's also true.<br /> <br /> Your potential to earn and grow is limitless. But it's not free. You need to invest time and money into developing your potential.<br /> <br /> Your time and money are limited, though, and you could also choose to invest in market-based assets, like stocks, bonds or real estate.<br /> <br /> How do you make that decision?<br /> <br /> Are you going to invest in yourself? Or the market? Or both -- and in what proportion?<br /> <br /> How do you make these choices?<br /> <br /> When you're buying a few shares of a total stock market index fund, you have a generally clear idea of what you're getting. You've seen the historic returns. You can predict, to a reasonable degree, the consequences of that investment over a multi-decade span.<br /> <br /> But when you're investing in yourself -- e.g. learning a new skill, developing a side business, or taking a class -- you can't rely on the same formulas or models.

What is expected value? It\u2019s the sum of all possible values for a variable, with each value multiplied by its probability of occurrence.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u201cWhaaaa? What does that mean?\u201d</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here\u2019s a simple example:</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Imagine that you have a full-time job. You\u2019ve also built a side business that\u2019s earning $20,000 per year.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You\u2019re trying to decide whether to stay in your full-time job vs. quit your job and focus on growing your side hustle into a full-time business.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You ask your two best friends for their opinion. One says, \u201cthat\u2019s risky! What if you fail?\u201d The other says, \u201cyou could become a millionaire! Whoa!\u201d</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You realize that both of those remarks are fueled by emotion and speculation. You want to make a more informed decision, so you decide to compare the \u2018expected value\u2019 (EV) of both options in Year One.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After assessing the market (e.g. studying customer demand, etc.) you determine that in your first year of running the business full-time, under best-case-scenario conditions, you could earn $250,000. There\u2019s a lot of promise within your field; you calculate a one in four chance of this happening.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In worst-case-scenario conditions, you don\u2019t make a dime of additional money; your business stagnates at its current income. There\u2019s a lot of competition within your field; you assess that there\u2019s also a one in four chance of this situation unfolding.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In middle-case-scenario conditions, you\u2019d make around $100,000 per year. This is the most likely outcome, and you give it 50% odds.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What\u2019s the expected value of diving full-time into this business?</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">EV of biz =</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">25% chance of earning $250k = $62,500</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">50% chance of earning $100k = $50,000</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">25% chance of earning $20k = $5,000</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">EV = $117,500</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Okay, great. Next, what\u2019s the expected value of staying at your current job?</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">EV of job = Salary\u00a0+ $20,000 in additional income</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Of course, this is an over-simplified example, for the sake of illustration. Obviously, the decision gets more complex, because you need to account for future growth of your business \u2014 the 5-year outlook, the 10-year outlook \u2014 as well as future career growth potential within your 9-to-5 job. You\u2019d also need to assess revenues vs. profit margins, etc., etc.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But this simple example illustrates the concept of using the expected value formula to inform your decision-making. Rather than just saying, \u201coh, that\u2019s risky!\u201d without any data, you can use EV as a starting point for a conversation about probability and risk.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The point is, when you're making a decision, your emotions and other people's opinions often override any rational thought you might have. Those emotions don't take\u00a0risk or variance into consideration. Expected value does.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">By running the numbers and identifying the worst-, mid-, and best-case scenarios, you can take calculated risks that have a higher likelihood of paying off.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Find out\u00a0how Billy built a seven-figure business by applying this one incredible rule to his decision making process in this episode.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Enjoy!</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">-- Paula</span></div> <div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"font-family: georgia,serif;\"> <br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Resources Mentioned:</strong></span><br /></div> <ul> <li class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"font-family: georgia,serif;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://foreverjobless.com/ev-millionaires-math/\" target=\"_blank\">Billy's site, Forever Jobless\u2028</a></span></li> <li class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"font-family: georgia,serif;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia - Expected Value</a></span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Find more about Billy Murphy and his podcast, Forever Jobless, in the show notes at <a href=\"http://affordanything.com/session56\" target=\"_blank\">http://affordanything.com/session56</a></span></p>", "duration": "55:23", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/42/2b/67/422b67a4-4808-7726-e84f-7a0d325c89c6/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/42/2b/67/422b67a4-4808-7726-e84f-7a0d325c89c6/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.cast.plus/57b04b389655d0cb71d77f6c/traffic.libsyn.com/paulaandjaymoney/AA056_BIlly_Murphy.mp3?dest-id=337584", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1079598542, "seriesTitle": "Afford Anything | Make smart choices about your money, time and productivity", "pubDate": 1481525700, "title": "#055: From Money Moron to Millionaire, with Scott Alan Turner", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Scott Alan Turner used to be a money moron. (In his words.)<br /> <br /> He traded a Jeep for a Porsche in his 20s, purchased a 3,000 sq. ft. house with two mortgages, and bought luxury furniture on credit.<br /> <br /> The Porsche cost him $800 per month. The house cost $200,000. The furniture? Who knows.\u2028<br /> Scott didn't have a budget and never tracked his spending. He only knew that he could afford the monthly payments on these luxuries ... until one day he realized his mortgage was due in a few weeks.<br /> <br /> And his bank account was rather empty.<br /> <br /> And he didn't have an emergency fund.<br /> <br /> Oops.<br /> <br /> Scott realized he was drowning in debt. So he decided to make a change.<br /> <br /> He sold the Porsche and paid $6,500 cash for a truck.<br /> <br /> He paid off his credit card.<br /> <br /> He aggressively attacked the mortgage on his house.<br /> <br /> Step-by-step, he made strides toward improving his financial future. After listening to Clark Howard on the radio, he realized it was important to free his money from the grip of debt and put it toward savings and retirement.<br /> Once he got married, he sold his house and downsized to his wife's town home. They then downsized to a 1,000 sq. ft. rented house, and downsized once more to a 300 sq. ft. bedroom with his in-laws.\u2028<br /> Throughout all of this downsizing, Scott kept saving money. He eventually saved enough to become a millionaire at age 35. Today he writes and speaks about personal finance full-time. He hosts the Financial Rock Star podcast. And he's stayed debt-free -- including mortgage-free -- since 2009.<br /> <br /> How did he go from money moron - buying expensive cars and furniture - to disciplined saver?<br /> <br /> He can answer that question in one word:<br /> Contentment.<br /> <br /> He doesn't need to buy more, because he's happy with what he already has.<br /> <br /> Scott credits his frugality to feeling satisfied with his possessions, rather than running on a hedonistic treadmill of always wanting more.<br /> <br /> While he still appreciates fine craftsmanship -- a gorgeous house, a designer car -- he realizes that he doesn't need to\u00a0own\u00a0luxury items. He can appreciate art and design without making a purchase. He prioritizes spending on his values: more time with friends and family; more life experiences. He doesn't spend to impress others, which is a losing game.<br /> <br /> Discover Scott's fascinating philosophy on the link between frugality and contentment (and learn from his money mistakes!) in this episode.<br /> <br /> Enjoy!<br /> <br /> -- Paula<br /> <br /> For a full list of resources, or to leave a comment, visit <a href=\"http://affordanything.com/episode55\" target=\"_blank\">http://affordanything.com/episode55</a></p>", "duration": "53:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/42/2b/67/422b67a4-4808-7726-e84f-7a0d325c89c6/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/42/2b/67/422b67a4-4808-7726-e84f-7a0d325c89c6/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.cast.plus/57b04b389655d0cb71d77f6c/traffic.libsyn.com/paulaandjaymoney/AA055_Scott_Alan_Turner.mp3?dest-id=337584", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1079598542, "seriesTitle": "Afford Anything | Make smart choices about your money, time and productivity", "pubDate": 1480924440, "title": "#054: Ask Paula - Automating Savings, Starting a Blog, Emergency Funds, Investing in Real Estate Confidently, and More", "author": "", "summary": "<p>It's the first Monday of the month, which means I'm fielding questions from the audience.<br /> <br /> We start with a question from Nicole.<br /> <br /> She's a new listener, and she's stuck in a confusing situation.<br /> <br /> You see, Nicole is self-employed. She'd like to save a percentage of her income -- but she doesn't get regular paychecks. How can she automate her savings, when she doesn't know how much she'll make each month?<br /> <br /> She asks a second question, as well.<br /> <br /> Nicole has $15,000 in savings and wants to buy her first rental property. However, she's intimidated by the unknown market. What should her first steps be?<br /> <br /> Next, we move to a question from podcast listener David. Should he invest his emergency fund?<br /> <br /> David is contemplating putting his emergency savings in the Vanguard Immediate-Term Investment Grade Fund (VFICX). Is this a good idea?<br /> <br /> Saul, another podcast listener interested in real estate investing, recently sold his home and has a decent chunk of change. Should he buy a 3 bed / 2 bath townhome with a small commercial space on the first floor? Or should he buy a duplex?<br /> <br /> Podcast listener Albert is wondering: should he buy a home for himself, and rent it out a few years later? He'd like to travel and work remotely. What are the downsides to this idea? It can't be that easy ... right?<br /> <br /> Finally, Abbey started a personal finance blog, and wants to know:<br /> <br /> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When should she start promoting her blog?<br /> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How much content should she write?<br /> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does she have to share her blog with her friends and family, or can she stay anonymous?<br /> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should she write about other things besides money and travel?<br /> <br /> I tackle these questions in this month's edition of Ask Paula.<br /> <br /> Enjoy!<br /> <br /> -- Paula<br /> <br /> P.S.\u00a0 Trying to make a decision?

They're the people in your life that are sabotaging your efforts to improve your net worth.<br /> <br /> Sometimes they're friends, sometimes they're family, and other times, they might just be people that have no business asking about your financial situation in the first place. \u2028</p> <p><br /> Whoever they are, we've all known one at some point or another.\u2028</p> <p><br /> In fact, I bet one of these sounds familiar:\u2028<br /> 1. The Entitled Frenemy: \"Can you spot me? I'll get you next time!\"<br /> 2. The Budget-Buster: \"You deserve it, you should buy it!\"<br /> 3. The One-Upper: \"You got a $1,000 bonus? Nice. I got a $10,000 bonus.\"<br /> 4. The Priers: \"How much do you make?\" \"How much did you spend on that?\"<br /> 5. The Green-Eyed Monster: \"Must be nice that you can afford such a big house.\"<br /> 6. The FOMO Frenemy: \"You can spend your money just this once!\"<br /> <br /> Navigating conversations with these financial frenemies can be tough, but Mary Beth has some awesome advice on how to do it and not feel bad about your words.\u2028<br /> Even though it might sound scary, honesty is the best policy.\u2028</p> <p><br /> While saying, \"I don't feel comfortable answering that\" means enduring a few moments of awkwardness, the alternative is answering truthfully and proceeding to wonder if your \"friends\" are judging you...every single time you interact with them.\u2028</p> <p><br /> Finally, we need to realize that what they're saying isn't a reflection on us - it's a reflection on them. If they're jealous, feel the need to one-up you, or discourage you from your financial goals, that's on them, not you.\u2028<br /> Mary Beth offers other great tips on how to deal with financial frenemies in this episode, and we even role-played a scenario to give you a script to follow.\u2028<br /> Resources Mentioned:</p> <p><br /> \u2022 Workable Wealth\u2028<br /> \u2022 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692627332/?tag=afforanyth-20\" target=\"_blank\">Work Your Wealth\" on Amazon</a><br /> \u2022 Mary Beth's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marybstorj\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> & <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marybstorj/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram\u2028</a></p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>-- Paula</p>", "duration": "47:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/42/2b/67/422b67a4-4808-7726-e84f-7a0d325c89c6/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/42/2b/67/422b67a4-4808-7726-e84f-7a0d325c89c6/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.cast.plus/57b04b389655d0cb71d77f6c/traffic.libsyn.com/paulaandjaymoney/AA051_Mary_Beth_Storjohann.mp3?dest-id=337584", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1079598542, "seriesTitle": "Afford Anything | Make smart choices about your money, time and productivity", "pubDate": 1478505000, "title": "#050: Ask Paula - Retirement Savings in Your 50's, Starting a Side Hustle, Buying Health Insurance, Home Warranties, and More", "author": "", "summary": "<p><br /> Mark, a 55-year-old listener, has no savings. He's been listening to personal finance podcasts. He recently read Tony Robbins' Money: Master the Game. He called this podcast to tell us that he's feeling overwhelmed by the scope of what's ahead of him. Mark doesn't know how to apply this information -- and he's afraid of needing to work in fast food when he's 80 years old. What can he do?<br /> <br /> We tackle his question first on today's Ask Paula episode.<br /> <br /> Next, we take a call from Adalia.<br /> <br /> Adalia, another podcast listener, wants to earn extra money on the side. She's intrigued by the idea of becoming a virtual assistant -- a side hustle that allows her to work from home, setting her own hours. How should she start? Where can she find clients?<br /> <br /> Tyler, a podcast listener and fellow FinConner, is carrying $20,000 in credit card debt, with interest rates ranging from 11% - 23%. He also runs a side business on Amazon, making\u00a0 43-50% returns for every dollar he puts in. Should he focus on reinvesting money back into his lucrative business, or should he pay his credit card debt off?<br /> <br /> Podcast listener Carlos just purchased his first rental property, and wants to know: are home warranties are worth the money?<br /> <br /> Todd, another listener, is curious to know if he and his wife should go without health insurance as the cost of premiums increase. He has an HSA, emergency fund, makes a good living, is in good health, and saves everything he can. Could going without insurance really save him money?<br /> <br /> Our last question comes from listener Lynsey, who has her sights set on financial independence. She works a second job during the cold Minnesota winters, which pays $25/hr. However, she wonders if she should use that time to invest in her future earning potential, by starting a business or getting an advanced degree. Should she go after the immediate cash, or focus on her future?<br /> <br /> All of these questions are answered in this episode of Ask Paula!<br /> <br /> Enjoy!<br /> <br /> -- Paula<br /> _____________________<br /> <br /> I also want to take a moment to thank the sponsors for this episode.<br /> <br /> First, huge thanks to Nerdwallet.

It's your attention. Most knowledge workers spend their day franticly hopping between meetings, emails, phone calls and social media. But that's not the best way to stand out in the modern economy. Emails are necessary, says author and professor Cal Newport. They'll keep you from getting fired. But they won't get you promoted. Instead, focus on deep work, Newport says. Dedicate your mental energy towards cognitively-demanding tasks that stretch the limits of your capabilities. Develop your skills as a writer, investor, programmer, mathematician, musician, artist, or whatever field you practice. You'll achieve bigger success from honing rare, valuable skills than you would from sending a few additional tweets or replying to emails at a faster pace, he says. You'll also enjoy more meaningful work. Deep work isn't something that you cram into the margins of your life. To the contrary, focusing on deep work allows you to boost your productivity at work and feel more fully present at home.

On today's show, I answer a handful of phone calls from listeners who posed\u00a0questions about real estate investing.<br /> <br /> One caller from Atlanta said that he's thinking about buying a rental property from a turnkey investing company. (These are companies that buy, renovate and rent out properties, and then sell those properties to investors.) On the surface, this sounds appealing: all benefit and no work. But what are the drawbacks? Are those risks worth it? Should this listener buy a turnkey property? Or\u00a0should he stay wary of red flags?<br /> <br /> Another caller, who\u00a0says he\u00a0loves real estate investing,\u00a0mentioned\u00a0that he's curious about the lack of compound interest\u00a0in\u00a0the real estate game. If you're investing in an index fund, he noted, your dividends and gains are automatically reinvested. That's not the case with a rental property. Sure, you can reinvest the cash flow from that property into buying more properties (or buying other investments, like index funds), but that's not\u00a0the same thing. So ... what does this mean?\u00a0When you take compound interest into consideration, are rental properties still a good deal? Or are real estate investors missing out on this crucial wealth-building tool?<br /> <br /> Another wanted to hear more details about a couple whom I mentioned in\u00a0Episode 4,\u00a0The Ultimate Beginner Guide to Real Estate Investing. This couple's\u00a0strategy is to buy a home as a primary residence, live there for at least one year, move out,\u00a0convert\u00a0their former home into a rental property, and repeat. They've done this over and over, and now they're raking in the rental cash.\u00a0The listener\u00a0wanted more details about that strategy ... which I offered in droves. (And yes, I led myself into another little rant.)<br /> <br /> Finally, one\u00a0listener called to share his success story. In an earlier episode, he asked whether he should repay his\u00a0credit card debt, or save for the downpayment on a house. I told him to pay off his credit cards ... and he's now DEBT-FREE!!!!!!
