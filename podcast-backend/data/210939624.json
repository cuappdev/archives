A perk you didn't know was there... hence her love of LA's Magic Castle\u00a0and other restaurants and bars and venues that are little known gems out in the world.

It is adorable, fun to sing and fantastic. \nLaurie Kilmartin\u00a0and Kathleen Madigan\u00a0had the longest conversation, before this, at the Comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach two weeks ago. They learned that they were Kennedy dorks. And here they are REALLY talking about the Kennedys. It was fascinating and quite perfect for TDF. They are also hilarious and you should see them do standup out there. \nNotes on this show: 1. The picture on this show is of Rosemary Kennedy. This photo is mentioned on the show. I could not find a workable family tree image in the heartbeat I looked if you want to \"play along.\" 2. John Winthrop and Anne Hutchinson are the Puritans that I refer to - not by name - that are the ancestors of John Kerry and George W. Bush. 3. Around minute 102:00 Laurie Kilmartin announces her new job!! First place to be announced! (except to loved ones I assume). 4. Right after that I run out of memory on my flash card. So... min 104:00 ish... smash cut to us wrapping it up. I will buy a larger one... and... 5. The show ends with me wandering in my mind about things and\u00a0a reprise of Mexican Hat Dance by Mike Ruekberg by request. Thanks for listening!
