Lartigue's use of action in his photographs set him apart from many photographers of the time.\n\n\t\t\t\tAfter the family money started running out in the 1930's, Lartigue spent the next 30 years making a meager salary off of his paintings. He had a few photographs published in the 1950's, but it wasn't until the 1960's that his work was shown to John Szarkowski at MoMA in New York and he became known as one of the great photographers of the 20th Century. Lartigue was near 70 by the time this happened.\n\n\t\t\t\tBook shown in this video:\n\t\t\t\tJacques Henri Lartigue http://amzn.to/289mCRy\n\n\t\t\t\tAlso recommended:\n\t\t\t\tLartigue: Life in Color http://amzn.to/289nfL4", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4a/b4/38/4ab43871-e583-a72f-85ea-43a4f9421456/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4a/b4/38/4ab43871-e583-a72f-85ea-43a4f9421456/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": null, "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Jaques Henri Lartigue", "classic photography", "history of photography", "photographers", "photography movies", "photography videos", "photographer documentary", "the art of photography", "photography", "tutorial", "film photography", "photography tutorials", "photography podcast", "ted forbes", "video podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 294540619, "seriesTitle": "The Art of Photography", "pubDate": 1464662034, "title": "Its Been Crazy", "author": "Ted Forbes", "summary": "Its been a crazy few weeks traveling - here's a catch-up with what's been going on with the Artist Series.\n\n\t\t\t\tIrving Penn video featured on PetaPixel\n\t\t\t\thttp://petapixel.com/2016/05/30/exploring-work-irving-penn-museum-curator/\n\n\t\t\t\tKeith Carter\n\t\t\t\thttp://www.keithcarterphotographs.com/\n\n\t\t\t\tDavid Brookover\n\t\t\t\thttp://www.brookovergallery.com/\n\n\t\t\t\tGordon Parks at Art Institute of Chicago\n\t\t\t\thttp://www.artic.edu/exhibition/invisible-man-gordon-parks-and-ralph-ellison-harlem", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4a/b4/38/4ab43871-e583-a72f-85ea-43a4f9421456/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4a/b4/38/4ab43871-e583-a72f-85ea-43a4f9421456/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": null, "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Artist Series", "Keith Carter", "Mexico", "David Brookover", "Jackson Hole", "Wyoming", "photographer", "artist series", "documentaries", "photographers", "photography movies", "photography videos", "photographer documentary", "the art of photography", "photography", "tutorial", "film photography", "photography tutorials", "photography podcast", "ted forbes", "video podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 294540619, "seriesTitle": "The Art of Photography", "pubDate": 1464489234, "title": "Welcome To Jackson Hole", "author": "Ted Forbes", "summary": "Off to Jackson Hole, WY to film David Brookover for the Artist Series.\n\n\t\t\t\tDavid is the greatest photographer you've probably never heard of.

At the age of 16, she moved from her native Italy to the United States with her father. Modotti soon developed an interest in performing arts and appeared in several plays, operas and silent movies while living in San Francisco. Five years later, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film. Modotti became known for playing the femme fatale and in 1920 landed the staring role in The Tiger\u2019s Coat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTina showed an interest in photography from an early age. Her uncle Pietro Modotti ran a photography studio in Italy and later her father ran a similar studio in San Fransisco. After moving to Los Angeles with her boyfriend Robo Richey, Tina soon became friends with Edward Weston. Weston became a mentor and inspiration for Modotti\u2019s development as a fine art photographer an by 1921 she was modeling for Weston and the two soon began an affair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tModotti\u2019s boyfriend, Robo went to Mexico in December of 1921. Unaware of Tina\u2019s affair with Weston, he took a portfolio of Weston\u2019s work hoping to work out an exhibition in Mexico. While Tina was on her way to Mexico to join him, she found that he had died 2 days before her arrival of smallpox. The following year, Tina mounted a two week exhibition of Robo\u2019s and Weston\u2019s work at the National Academy of Fine Arts in Mexico City.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWeston moved to Mexico the following year leaving behind his wife and 3 of 4 children. Tina set up and managed Edward\u2019s studio in return for his mentoring her as a photographer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWeston was taken by Mexican culture and was inspired by local folk art and landscape. Modotti was more interested in people and the Modernest aesthetic. She soon found a community of cultural and political avant-gardists who she became closely associated with including Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAs her photography skills began to mature, Modotti\u2019s work included lyrical images of peasants and workers and experiments with architectural interiors, flowers and urban landscapes. Mexican photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo notes 2 distinctions in Modotti\u2019s work being both \u201cromantic\u201d and \u201crevolutionary\u201d. The romantic aspects of her work undoubtedly influenced by Weston and the revolutionary from her growing interest in politics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 1926, Weston signed a contract with writer Anita Brenner to photograph her book on Mexican folk art. Modotti and Weston were joined by Edward\u2019s son Brett. The job was quite large requiring over 400 8\u00d710 negatives and prints. Brett was brought up to speed at a breakneck pace and learned how to make prints while traveling through Mexico in search of lesser known native art. The project took months and by the end, Edward\u2019s relationship with Tina was over. At the end of the project, Edward and Brett returned permanently to California.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tModotti continued her works as a photographer and in 1929 did her first one-woman retrospective exhibition at the National Library which was advertised as the \u201cFirst Revolutionary Photographic Exhibition In Mexico\u201d. By this time, Tina had been a member of the Mexican Communist Party for several years and her work was very politically focused. In 1929, Modotti\u2019s close friend Julio Antonia Mella was assassinated presumably by agents of the Cuban government. Soon there was an assassination attempt on Mexican President Pascual Ortiz Rubio and Modotti was questioned about both crimes. In 1930, she was expelled from Mexico as the result of an anti-communist and anti-imagrant press campaign. Modotti evaded police through Rotterdam, Berlin and Switzerland before making her way back to Italy to join the anti-fascist resistance before proceeding to Moscow in 1931. After this move to Russia no photographs survive and it is presumed that Moditti never photographed again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the rise of the Spanish Civil War, Modotti left Moscow for Spain. Following the collapse of the Republican movement, she returned to Mexico under a false identity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTwo years later, Modotti died under somewhat suspicious circumstances though the official autopsy indicated heart failure. She was 46.\n\t\t\t\t\tine art photographer an by 1921 she was modeling for Weston and the two soon began an affair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMoMA Collection :: http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4039\n\t\t\t\t\tPhiladelphia Museum of Art Collections :: http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/results.html?searchTxt=modotti&amp;keySearch=+Search+&amp;searchNameID=&amp;searchClassID=&amp;searchOrigin=&amp;searchDeptID=&amp;accessionID=&amp;page=1", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4a/b4/38/4ab43871-e583-a72f-85ea-43a4f9421456/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4a/b4/38/4ab43871-e583-a72f-85ea-43a4f9421456/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": null, "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "photography", "art", "black and white", "tina modotti", "mexico", "mexican art", "frida kahlo"]}, {"seriesId": 294540619, "seriesTitle": "The Art of Photography", "pubDate": 1430188434, "title": "How Do I Develop My Own Style?", "author": "Ted Forbes", "summary": "These days everyone seems to be a photographer.

Working in New York as a fashion photographer, Saul Leiter amassed an amazing collection of personal work that came to the attention of Howard Greenberg in the 2000's. Before Saul's death - the release of \"Early Color\" changed Saul's career finally bringing the attention and praise he long deserved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year Greenberg/Steidl released a 2 volume book set called \"Early Black and White\". Divided into 2 volumes (I. Interior and II. Exterior), the portfolio shows a much different side of Saul. The images are just as beautiful as the Early Color work, but they are made with a completely different approach. In some ways they could have been done by a completely different photographer, but there's a hallmark of the style that is obviously classic Saul Leiter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe impressive part is that Saul treated black and white vs color as 2 different mediums. Much like an artist who paints and sculpts, the respect for these 2 \"mediums\" speaks to Saul's passion and respect for photography as well as his extraordinary talent as an artist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGet the book here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3865214134/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=3865214134&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepublbroa-20&amp;linkId=XQTLHOONB2PTZ7DX\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe for more videos!\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=theartofphotography\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTwitter: http://twitter.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\t\tInstagram: http://instagram.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\t\tFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/aop.podcast\n\t\t\t\t\tPinterest: http://pinterest.com/tedforbes\n\t\t\t\t\tWebsite: http://theartofphotography.tv\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWatch More Episodes:\n\t\t\t\t\tWho Influenced Saul Leiter?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9y_F7PSGss\n\t\t\t\t\tSaul Leiter - Early Color ::  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdIJkt3Gz8\n\t\t\t\t\tFred Herzog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6qv9o-Syuo\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd get on our mailing list to stay up to date on photography news and the latest episodes:\n\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://theartofphotography.tv/about/mailing-list/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks for watching - if you like this video, remember to share it with your friends!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTed Forbes\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Art of Photography\n\t\t\t\t\t3100 Main St #135\n\t\t\t\t\tDallas, Texas 75226\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMy name is Ted Forbes and I make videos about photography.

You can get an entire system for a fraction of what you'd pay for a Hasselblad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBut how is the quality? Is it worth it? Or is it easier to save a little more and upgrade to an actual Hasselblad rig?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've had mine for years. I've had 2 actually - the first one died on me. They are great, but you earn every shot you take. They are extremely finicky and awkward to use. I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about photography though when I first started shooting mine so I believe their value is in what you want out of a camera.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you're new to medium format or new to photography for that matter - you will learn a lot. And they are super cheap so its definitely an easy way to get into medium format.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Kiev 88 was produced in the Ukraine up until about 2009. There are third party companies that bought remaining inventory and modify them. Unfortunately this starts getting expensive so I still advocate the original model.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Kiev 88 is a copy of the Hasselblad 1000F. Originally known as the Salut - they later boasted a hot shoe and renamed the model the Kiev 80. A few more improvements lead to the classic Kiev 88 design.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've covered this camera on the show before, but not in a full deep dive review.
