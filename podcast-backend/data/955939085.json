How it works is if you\u2019re a parent or someone who wants to gift clothing to children, you can go on the website, sign up for a membership. They ask you a series of questions about your child; age, measurements, but also the taste of your kid. What kind of a kid do you have? Is he or she active? They gather all that information, all that intel and send you a personal box to your door with about 12 items for your child. It\u2019s really functional, really affordable, and the clothing is very unique. I have to say, as someone who\u2019s now been buying clothes for little people for the past two, three years. It gets very redundant. When you go on the playground, a lot of the kids are wearing the same things. It\u2019s nice to find a resource, like Rockets of Awesome, that kind of does a lot of the work for you, brings the clothing to your house, catered to your family, and for very affordable price points.<br /><br />Prior to starting this company, she was the CEO of Cricket\u2019s Circle, a trusted resource and editorial engine for everything baby and toddler.

I\u2019m actually surprised that it took me this long to bring my parents onto the show. They have been one of my biggest supporters since day one but particularly with this podcast. They knew how much it meant to me. They listen every day and give me feedback. They\u2019re my biggest fans. We talk about it on the show so often that who we are as people, especially when it comes to our values, perspectives and emotions around money, stem from childhood and often how our parents communicated over money and interacted with money. So I talk about all of that with Adam and Sheila Torabi. In Farsi or in Persian, they're known as [Pharog] and [Shayda], but they changed their names. I finally get to the bottom of this in our official podcast interview today and it was a blast going all \"Barbara Walters\" on them. I didn\u2019t let them off the hook. I asked them why they fought about money when I was a kid because that\u2019s the sort of stuff that really sticks with you for life, right? I was a little scared to ask that question because I\u2019m sure it brings up as many emotions for them, as it does for me. But I really wanted to know, and more importantly, how did they reconcile those differences? And of course, we\u2019ll talk about their immigration and the importance of education. My dad just got laid off, believe it or not, at 62. How\u2019s he dealing with that? All that and more plus my mom\u2019s number one tip for a lasting marriage.

I discovered in interviewing her that she is home schooled, so that helps with giving her the time and the flexibility to pursue all of these things. But it\u2019s not just the flexibility of her school schedule that has awarded her of all this successes, she is an instigator, visionary and she\u2019s not afraid to be afraid. Maya started her own company, Maya's Ideas, at just 8 years old and then went on to create an eco-friendly clothing and accessory brand where she donates 10-20% of her profits to local and global charities. This also inspired her to start her own non-profit, Maya's Ideas 4 The Planet, where she works to give back to girls in developing countries. Maya is also the youngest person to give back-to-back TED Talks, three in total. Her latest TEDWomen Talk received over 1.2 million views and is one of the top 15 TEDWomen talks of all time.

Wendy's photographs have also been featured in numerous exhibitions and shows across the country and have even earned her accolades. Wendy also has over 25 years of marketing, PR and management experience. She's also switched careers several times serving as the president of Vendeloo, a consultancy she founded in 2001, working as the Chief Brand Officer of a NYC-based global eyewear brand and owner of a bar in Manhattan. So, in the interview we discuss, how did she decide to go to North Korea? Why, really? What were her expectations going into the country and were they met? Would she recommend you and I go to North Korea and if so, what should we take with us? Wendy is also an entrepreneur. We transition nicely to talk about money. We talk about learning about money as she lived in a neighborhood that was pretty wealthy. Why she says she doesn\u2019t really think about money.

She didn't go about this in the most normal way... Patti took a tour through the fjords of western Norway and came across a tour of the country's largest salmon hatchery. Along the way she noticed the workers hands looked much younger than their faces and because they worked with their hands in the water Patti knew where to look for the secret. Shortly thereafter Restorsea's proprietary Vibransea complex was born, which is anchored by Aquabeautine XL, a natural enzyme salmon release into the water at birth enabling them to safely emerge from their eggshells. She even secured the exclusive global rights to use the enzyme in all of Restoresea's products.

This woman has worked for some of the biggest names on Wall Street. Cynthia DiBartolo's resume consists of jobs at Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney and Citibank. She also has her law degree from the Villanova University School of Law. In 2009, while working for Citibank, Cynthia was diagnosed with head and neck cancer. After undergoing extensive surgery, she was left unable to eat or speak. Her colleagues at Citibank feared people wouldn't have the patience to communicate with her, so she took a leave of absence. During this time she applied to FINRA and the SEC and felt empowered to start her own company for the next chapter, Tigress Financial Partners. Cynthia was inspired by 'Tigress' because it meant strong female. Her firm is a woman owned and operated service that provides research, corporate and executive services, asset management, sales and trading, wealth management and investment banking services. She also serves as the Chair of Greater New York Chamber of Commerce. In our conversation with Cynthia, we learn about how she climbed the Wall Street ladder in the 1980\u2019s when the so called 'glass ceiling' was actually a really thick brick ceiling. We talk about her devastating personal complication in 2009, and how did she find the strength to bounce back even higher? And why, today, she describes herself, her approach to money, as a conscious capitalist. So, what does that mean exactly?

So, if you're planning on being in Portland, OR in August you might want to check it out. In our interview, Chris talks about how his new book is really meant to help people win the career lottery. But what does he actually mean by that? That term actually makes me nervous because when I think of career lottery, you have no control over your career path and I would hate to believe that. Plus, did you know that Chris has been to Iran? He kind of puts me to shame because I\u2019m Iranian and I\u2019ve only been there once and was way too young to remember.

Anyone here remember getting the catalogue growing up in the 90\u2019s? We used to get the catalogue and it wasn\u2019t very risqu\u00e9 back then. The woman who was in that catalogue more than any other woman that I remember growing up was Frederique. She was a famous super model back then. Little did I know, this woman was quite the entrepreneur as well. Back then, models were starting to become more household names. They were more than just a face and a body, they were individuals that had personalities and you knew where they were from and maybe they had some side businesses. Now, 30 years later (probably) here I am interviewing the one and only Frederique. She\u2019s doing some press right now because she\u2019s promoting a new E-commerce site that she created called Frederique\u2019s Choice. It\u2019s the ultimate location for beautiful curated flowers, directly from the growers and where every bouquet tells a story. So, I\u2019m curious to find out why Frederique wanted to start this particular kind of business? Also, since she began her journey as a model, how she parleyed that into entrepreneurship and what kind of business she likes to go in to. Also how did modeling create a platform for her to be able to be a business woman. Frederique is from Holland and she really believes growing up in that country gave her this down to earthiness that she was able to use as an asset, as a model and then later as an entrepreneur.

I rely on Uber a lot. It might be one of those things that I \"splurge\" on to make my life easier or better at times, like I ask of my guests at the end of the show. There's a point to all of this I promise. Today's guest was once a full-time aerospace engineer and a part-time Uber, Lyft and Sidecar driver. Harry Campbell discovered Rideshare as a passenger several years ago and when he moved from San Diego to Orange County and decided to give it a try as a driver. We get into why in our interview today. Harry thought driving was a fun, flexible way to earn extra income. He found himself liking the flexibility in hours and enjoyed how it felt like running his own mini-business. Harry was interested in finding resources for drivers who were just starting out but realized there were little out there. That's when his blog The RideShare Guy was born. In early 2015, Harry actually left his job as an engineer to pursue blogging full-time. He also is a tech contributor to Forbes and hosts his own podcast The RideShare Guy. In the interview I want to know first and foremost why he made the transition to The Rideshare Guy Blog and why he wanted to quit aerospace engineering. What kind of fulfillment he finds in this new job that he wasn\u2019t finding in his previous job? Is it really a practical way to make extra money? I know that some of you have even written in, wondering if, \u201cHey, I\u2019m thinking of taking on Uber or Lyft as a part time side gig. Should I do this? Is it worth my money and time? Because obviously, you have to invest in a car and gas and maintenance and all of that.\" He talks about whether it\u2019s worth it, who should be doing this and who shouldn\u2019t. He also has really established a cool brand for himself. He\u2019s out there speaking, he\u2019s partnering with brands, he\u2019s got sponsorships on the website and now he's got the podcast. He\u2019s really growing a little bit of an empire here. So, I want to ask him about that and how he learned how to do this. I don\u2019t think they teach you this in aerospace engineering school, right? He breaks it down for us.

He's been writing in, not just praising the show, but he has a really interesting story of his own about getting out of $50,000 worth of student loan debt. His name is Joe Koss. He is an accountant by trade and teaches as an adjunct professor at several colleges and universities on the topic of accounting and personal finance. Joe was once saddled with debt, a lot of it, everything from credit cards to auto and student loans. Most recently he had $50,000 in student loans and he worked to pay that off on time and as quickly as possible. He had about $28,000 left in that student loan figure and it was the biggest push he made to get rid of that in just 14 months. It turns out that teaching personal finance to a bunch of college students is what gave Joe the motivation ultimately to practice what he preached to his students. Some take away from our conversation with Joe. He shares the specific steps he took to get out of that $50,000 in student loans and why he was adamant about it. It wasn\u2019t a very high interest rate, he was on a fixed payment plan. Why be aggressive with the student loans? How he budgets and it\u2019s not very sophisticated but it works and the anonymous donation he gives to his students that\u2019s helping them get a head start in life.

Andrew Fiebert is also the host of the popular podcast operating under the same name. If you listen to this show and you love money and personal finance, I suspect you might know Andrew Fiebert\u2019s voice and his show. You know, Andrew\u2019s passion started with money when he took a job at an investment bank. And this bank no longer exists, the Lehman Brothers. There he was, a data engineer, right out of college. He became fascinated with getting the most out of his hard earned money and his wife, Laura, suggested that, \u201cYou know what Andrew? You should start a podcast.\u201d She was onto something and here he is, hosting the show, working to educate the community that he\u2019s created on personal finance. So naturally, I had to ask Andrew about the time that he worked at Lehman Brothers, the day specifically that it collapsed, what happened, what did he see, a scary time of course for everybody particularly for those working at the bank. And what happened on that infamous day. We talk about why he broke up with his original host of Listen, Money Matters, Matt Giovanisci. There are rumors and I wanted him to clear the air. What happened, why did you guys break up? Matt Giovanisci\u2019s has been on this podcast. I didn\u2019t asked him, but now I have Andrew on the call, I wanted to know what happened. Why are they no longer together? He\u2019s never shared the story and he does with me. We also talk about taking Listen, Money Matters, which was a daily show to three days a week and now, to just one day per week. Can you imagine if So Money became one day a week? I don\u2019t know if I could ever do that. I feel as though it would just be a show about nothing. I mean one is not enough but it\u2019s proving to be just enough for him and his listeners. His audience really loves it. He hasn\u2019t really noticed a falloff in listeners so kudos to him. I want to learn how he has managed to do that.

I think I was maybe 11 or 12, I knew I wanted to go into news and journalism but then I got sidetracked and I did finance but hey, I found my way back. My guest today remembers vividly at three years old that she wanted to be a television anchor. And she did become a television anchor but it wasn\u2019t without challenge. I first encountered Joya Dass when I was a graduate student interning at CNN. It was an incredible internship. I had a chance to go backstage at New York Fashion Week. I had a chance to work closely with some amazingly talented journalists and I got a chance to watch from the sidelines how anchors like Joya prepared for live shows and reported on stories from oil markets to student loans. Joya Dass is one of the first South Asian females to be seen on mainstream television in the United States. She\u2019s been a business anchor for major networks for the last 15 years including CNN as well as ABC and Bloomberg and right now, she\u2019s on the New York Stock Exchange floor every day for NY1 News and CBS. I just watched her give an incredible TED talk called Rethinking Failure, which we dive into on this podcast. We talk about what made her want to do that and the struggles that she had growing up in her family. In 2014, Joya was named the executive director of the South Asian International Film Festival presented by HBO. She also helms a documentary production company bearing her name. Joya is currently running a woman\u2019s networking initiative called LadyDrinks. It champions the South Asian female entrepreneur. You want to listen to this interview because we talk about Joya\u2019s determination with a capital D. That time in college for example when she went to the bursar\u2019s office and the financial aid officer told her that no one had paid her tuition bill and she was not allowed to come back to school and she said, \u201cWell actually, I\u2019m going to figure this out\u201d and so at the ripe age of I don\u2019t know, maybe 19 or 20, she figured out a way to pay her own way through college.&nbsp; We also talk about the entrepreneurial path of journalist today, why you need to think outside the box. If you want to be a TV anchor maybe you want to be TV anchor and other things because there\u2019s not, as it used to be, a direct path to getting on television and being on television frankly isn\u2019t the end all anymore.

I would actually take Todd to my 1st period history class my senior year in high school and have a special note that allowed me to leave school at 8:30 to go drop Todd off at kindergarten and come back to school. I was single parenting at 17! Proud to say that Todd \u2013 a MILLENNIAL! \u2013 has gone on to achieve a great deal in his early 20s. He is currently a product designer at Petrolicious, a media company and award-winning film series showcasing the powerful relationship between vintage cars and their owners.

He helps run a 10-week User Experience Design course at the technology school, General Assembly. He loves to play basketball and tennis. He is a die hard Patriots Fan and has recently taken up meditation. You wouldn\u2019t know we\u2019re related based on those interests\u2026except the tennis part.

So interesting that she ended up as a financial journalist and she talks about that journey, how she became the woman that she is today. What was the path that took her to CNBC? The opportunities that led her to financial journalism. You know she admits she was a little unsure of covering business news as a young reporter. We also discuss why Sharon is not worried about the fluctuations in the market place. This interview was recorded in late August when, as we know, the markets went on quite a rollercoaster. We had a tumultuous end to August and so what does Sharon make of all these heavy moves in the market, and what are her predictions as we go into the fall? The financial lessons she learned from launching her parents - that's another topic that we talk about with Sharon because she says, interestingly enough her parents did not really talk about money, but she still learned quite a bit from mom and dad and she shares that with us.\nFor more information visit www.somoneypodcast.com.", "duration": "1985", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF6600206272.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1442214000, "title": "246: Mimi Ikonn, Co-Founder of Luxy Hair and YouTube Sensation", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "Today\u2019s guest considers herself a \u201cglobal citizen\u201d and documents her travels and fashion through a blog, a wildly successful YouTube channel and popular Instagram account (just shy of 1M followers popular...WOW!).\u00a0 Her name is Mimi Ikonn a\u00a0co-founder of\u00a0Luxy Hair\u00a0and\u00a0YouTube sensation.\nOn her\u00a0YouTube\u00a0channel she documents tutorials from everything to her morning and nighttime routine to her favorite outfits to how to clean out your closet.

Jeff Yeager, dubbed \u201cThe Ultimate Cheapskate\u201d by Matt Lauer on NBC\u2019s Today Show, specializes in teaching others how to spend smart in order to spend less and living frugally.&nbsp; He is also an accomplished author of several books on the topic, including \u201cDon\u2019t Throw That Away!\u201d \u201cThe Cheapskate Next Door\u201d and \u201cThe Ultimate Cheapskate\u2019s Road Map to True Riches\u201d. He hosts The Cheap Life on YouTube which also provides video content about living the good life at a fraction of the cost. If you\u2019re an AARP member, perhaps you may recognize today\u2019s guest as he is one of their saving\u2019s experts. &nbsp;", "duration": "2522", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF9814130159.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1437894000, "title": "196: Ask Farnoosh, Is plastic surgery a good investment?", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "In today's episode of Ask Farnoosh, I answer your biggest questions about umbrella liability insurance, paying off your car, transition from working in the public sector to the private, investing in plastic surgery, entrepreneurship, saving for your kids future and breakups.", "duration": "1238", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF5208039759.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1437807600, "title": "195: Ask Farnoosh, Are Robo-Advisors any good?", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "In today's episode of Ask Farnoosh, I answer your biggest questions about where to put short-term savings, best way to save for college, negotiating your salary and benefits, managing your 401K, robo-advisors and starting a blog.", "duration": "1452", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF6794585289.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1437721200, "title": "194: (Replay) David Bach, 9 Time New York Times Bestselling Author", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "Happy Friday everyone.

Her husband just joined her and quit his 9 to 5 to join her and build this online empire - Gregg is her husband - and build her online empire.

And I think that's something that a lot of us can relate to. You make money, you spend it, you have the things that you want but there's still more that you wish you had - not more in a sense of stuff, but you have a future to build and you wanna be able to feel confident that you're gonna be able to retire well, send your kids to school, buy that home that you want, and so how do you get there?\nSo Holly and Greg started tracking their spending, and as a result Club Thrifty, that first blog, was born. To not only encourage themselves, but others as they say, \"Stop spending, and start living\". It was this little side hustle that eventually turned into an incredibly profitable source of income for them and as I said, it's allowed Greg to quit his job and focus on the business as well.\n3 Takeaways from our interview with Holly: Why she thinks that couples should have one again, just one, shared account - and I happen to disagree. One key and simple detail to have on your personal blog for all you bloggers out there, that can help you make money. And Her top advice for landing online, writing opportunities. If you're interested in getting some side income from freelance writing, you'll wanna hear what she has to say.", "duration": "1532", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF4976515210.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1434870000, "title": "161: Ask Farnoosh: Are Flip Flops Appropriate at Work?", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "In this episode of Ask Farnoosh I answer questions on investing in the stock market, inviting a new guest on the show, flip flops at work and more.", "duration": "572", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF3771744171.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1434783600, "title": "160: Ask Farnoosh: Should I Get the Car Rental Insurance?", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "In this episode of Ask Farnoosh I answer questions on rental insurance with your credit card, maxing out on your 401K investments, sharing a great article and more.", "duration": "665", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF6357498015.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1434697200, "title": "159 (Replay): Gretchen Rubin: Mastering Money Habits", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "Capping off our week of So Money replays\u00a0is NYT Bestselling author of The Happiness Project,\u00a0Gretchen Rubin, who is here to share her best advice for mastering habits to improve your financial life.", "duration": "1434", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/df/98/17/df981756-6c57-1c26-5401-4393e34059ce/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.megaphone.fm/SMF9004218253.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955939085, "seriesTitle": "So Money with Farnoosh Torabi", "pubDate": 1434610800, "title": "158 (Replay): Danielle LaPorte and Financial Spirituality", "author": "Farnoosh Torabi", "summary": "One of my interview from the early days of So Money, Danielle LaPorte discusses how gratitude is part of her bottom line.

He doesn't drive flashy cars or wear expensive clothing, but he does take great, great vacations. We're gonna talk about that. Also, we're gonna talk about why he recommends not hiring a financial advisor, his philosophy that we should make decisions emotionally but support them rationally, and (this is great) his step-by-step advice for first time investors.

His name is Simon Cunningham, and he runs the Seattle-based company that promotes peer to peer lending education.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you're not familiar with P2P lending, it is exactly what it sounds like. It's the practice of lending money to unrelated individuals, or peers, without going through a traditional financial institution or a bank. In other words, people are able to sidestep the banks to lend and borrow directly to one another. And P2P lending typically offers more attractive terms if you are a borrower than a traditional unsecured loan or credit card. And can be a godsend if you've got multiple high-interest debts and need to consolidate.\u00a0\nPeer to peer lending is a full-fledged fast growing business and part of a whopping $3 trillion consumer debt market. And Simon is really at the crossroads of all of this, offering consumers a website to really engage, understand, to learn more about this so that they can make educated choices if they choose to enter this market.
