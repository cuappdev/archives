Her techniques of choice have included meditation and manifestation \u2013 two things I\u2019ve never personally explored in my own business until now.</p>\n<p>Why it made the list:</p>\n<p>I know the question some of you may be asking: Am I still meditating?</p>\n<p>The answer is YES! I have made it a 10-minute morning habit to meditate. Gabby\u2019s urging to do so was definitely a jumping off point for me. And I feel that it has given me so much more clarity of the projects that I want to work on and where I want to spend my time.</p>\n<p>And another really cool factor: It\u2019s allowed me to worry less. I\u2019m a worrier by nature and that 10 minutes in the morning has lessened me from unnecessary worrying and replaced it with more clarity . . . which has lead to more confidence in my daily decisions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>#9: \u201cPreparing for Future Traffic Declines: What Content Creators Need to Know\u201d with Mike Stelzner (Episode 134)</p>\n<p>The gist: I give you the latest trends in social media marketing with the man who knows best: my early mentor, friend, and founder of Social Media Examiner, Michael Stelzner.</p>\n<p>Why it made the list:</p>\n<p>I have to admit that I was a bit scared to share this episode because it has an undertone of doom and gloom when it comes to social media and the online landscape.</p>\n<p>However, the insights and the suggested strategies that Mike shares in this episode are so incredibly valuable that this was a discussion that needed to be had. I also felt that there\u2019s nobody better than Mike (as founder of Social Media Examiner) to share some of the findings. And I think that you will find it very actionable for your business!</p>\n<p>#8: \u201cHow to Grow a Profitable Facebook Group\u201d with Josh and Jill Stanton (Episode 97)</p>\n<p>The gist: My guests on the podcast, the irrepressible Josh and Jill Stanton from Screw the Nine to Five, share their secret strategies for using private Facebook Groups to build a community of affinity and trust around your brand.</p>\n<p>Why it made the list:</p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s landscape has changed considerably over the last year. And where I used to say that you want to put all of your efforts into your Facebook Page and build engagement, I am now convinced that you will get a bigger bang for your buck if you create your own private Facebook Groups around a specific topic and build your community that way.</p>", "duration": "7:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_139.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1480579161, "title": "#138: How to Plan Your Promotional Calendar Like a Boss", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>If I ever did a list of Amy\u2019s Favorite Things (in honor of the one and only Oprah), today\u2019s topic would be number one.</p>\n<p>We are talking about PLANNING.

If you adopt these three amazing rules, your rituals around money management will empower you to see what is possible personally and help you grow your online business.</p>\n<p>Now, I like to think I\u2019m a smart girl. I run my own business. I\u2019m a planner. I understand my finances.</p>\n<p>However\u2014</p>\n<p>I was blown away at how much one tip in particular changed my entire outlook and the way I managed money. And, then seeing how that affected positive change in my business\u2014the results were fantastic.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I want to share this with you so badly.</p>\n<p>You may have heard me say it already\u2014 but I believe that when growing your own business, it often feels that what\u2019s personal is business and what\u2019s business is personal. This could not be more true than for this very sensitive topic, money.</p>\n<p>Money is one of the most important common denominators in the management of your business and your personal life.</p>\n<p>These habits, once you adopt them, can truly help your online business grow.</p>\n<p>So, do these questions sound like you?</p>\n<p>\tDo you compare your vacations, your home, your car, your clothes to others?</p>\n<p>\tDoes social media make it worse for you?</p>\n<p>Rachel\u2019s first money habit will tell you some surprising realities about what you\u2019re seeing in your newsfeed and WHY we compare what we see to our own story.</p>\n<p>Then, she tells you what you should be thinking and how to flip the script to actually make it incredibly positive\u2014personally and professionally. Rachel shares how to turn this bad habit into a good one.</p>\n<p>Go here to listen.</p>\n<p>The second habit:</p>\n<p>You must have a plan for your money. Yes, I\u2019m talking a budget.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t cringe!</p>\n<p>Not knowing where you\u2019re money is going can cause stress and anxiety. These pain points affect your personal life and your business evenly.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s personal is business and what\u2019s business is personal.</p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s flip the script!</p>\n<p>Rachel\u2019s second habit is based on the categories that everyone needs to include in their budget. It\u2019s these SPECIFIC categories that make this habit so achievable. These categories are relevant for not only you personally, but for your business too.</p>\n<p>Does your budget give you permission to spend your money exactly how you want?</p>\n<p>Rachel\u2019s does. I hear you\u2014that sounds counterintuitive. I promise you it\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>And, even better you won\u2019t feel guilty. I LOVE IT!</p>\n<p>This MUST-DO habit will address both your work and your home budget and help your business grow!</p>\n<p>Rachel\u2019s third habit might be the most important one here.</p>\n<p>This is the one that will give you the permission you need as a business owner to take risks. WHY?</p>\n<p>Because this is the one thing you can do so that you are never forced to fail. If you have this, you will feel confident to go the extra mile, to go for launching your first course, to take that risk.</p>\n<p>You work hard for your money. If you adopt this habit, are wildly patient, and make it a priority, it will pay off.</p>\n<p>As a business owner, there will come a day when you will be able to reap those rewards from your hard work. Or, you will have the ability to save your business or your home because you did this one thing\u2014and you did it consistently.</p>\n<p>Listen in to get the three habits you need for growing your online business.<br />\nLinks mentioned in this episode:<br />\nRachel Cruze: Love Your Life, Not Theirs<br />\nPodcast Details:<br />\nClick here to download the transcript of this week's episode.<br />\nClick Here to Subscribe via RSS (non-iTunes feed)</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.com/2016/08/121-3-money-habits-growing-online-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\">#121: 3 Money Habits for Gro...", "duration": "27:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_121.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1469689164, "title": "#120: The Bonus Brainstorm: How to Create a Bonus Package for Your Next Course Offer", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Are you looking to create amazing bonuses that will make your offer irresistible?</p>\n<p>Today, I\u2019m showing you how to do just that with my new Bonus Blueprint mini-workshop.</p>\n<p>I LOVE getting bonuses when I sign up for courses.

Your testimonials will shine with the help of this awesome tool.</p>\n<p>Now, why do you need a good testimonial?</p>\n<p>Your credibility is everything when wanting your audience to trust you. Social proof is invaluable when it comes to this.</p>\n<p>Testimonials are the best way for you to address objections or hesitations that you may be seeing.</p>\n<p>Testimonials allow for your community members to speak up for you and persuade others to buy your product or sign up for your course. If you can have a quote from a community member on an opt-in or sales page, it can be the selling point for on-the-fence potential buyers.</p>\n<p>Listen in and get started now!</p>\n<p>The most important objectives when building your audience are that you want them to know you, like you and trust you.</p>\n<p>Then you have the ability to capture outstanding testimonials that let potential new audience members know how amazing you are.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, in this episode we are getting into the who, what, when, where and how of outstanding testimonials.</p>\n<p>Here are the first few spoilers I have in store for you in this week\u2019s episode:</p>\n<p>\tYou don\u2019t need to only have testimonials from customers.<br />\n\tYou don\u2019t need to use a testimonial verbatim, as it is sent to you.<br />\n\tYou don\u2019t need to wait until your students have completed your first course to start collecting testimonials.<br />\n\tYou don\u2019t need to just have a dedicated testimonials page.<br />\n\tYou don\u2019t need to wait for kudos to come to you.</p>\n<p>There are many people\u2014outside of customers\u2014that you might not have thought of who can provide you with testimonials. I tell you who those people might be for you and explain how to successfully solicit a testimonial from them.</p>\n<p>When someone sends you a testimonial, you don\u2019t need to use the exact verbiage they send you. Most people aren\u2019t writers and don\u2019t know what components go into an exceptional testimonial. In this episode I tell you how to work with your students to create an outstanding testimonial that will make you shine and convince potential students to buy your course.</p>\n<p>Also, the components of a good testimonial are so, so important. I give you the framework for a perfect testimonial to ensure that every reference is a home run for your business.</p>\n<p>Next, you can always be looking to capture testimonials. However, beyond that you don\u2019t need to wait for your first course to complete before you start capturing kudos about your work.

(Scroll to the bottom to learn how to grab your seat.)</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a list of the questions we answered on this recent episode:</p>\n<p>\tCould you share a case study about Facebook ad spend, list growth and conversions?</p>\n<p>\tWhat do I do if my ads aren\u2019t converting well?</p>\n<p>\tHow are people getting around the character limit on Facebook ads?</p>\n<p>\tShould I use an image or a video?</p>\n<p>\tIs there any way to get more insight as to why Facebook rejected my ad?</p>\n<p>\tIs what I spend per ad too much?</p>\n<p>\tHow do I know if my pixels are set up properly and reporting accurately?</p>\n<p>\tThe pages I want to target are not coming up for me. Am I targeting correctly?</p>\n<p>The answers from Rick are killer and I don\u2019t want you to miss them. If you want to jump right in, click here.</p>\n<p>During our chat, Rick shares the case study of a holistic health practitioner who saw an avenue for growth by teaching her way of business to her peers. She created a video campaign and ran with it. Only, she inadvertently made a \u201cmistake\u201d and drove traffic to a site that I would otherwise say is unwise\u2014but it WORKED for her.</p>\n<p>In making this \u201cmistake\u201d her conversion rate grew to 40%-50%. She spent $3,000 and earned a return of $30,000. You have to listen to Rick\u2019s explanation of why this worked.</p>\n<p>Rick insists that if you aren\u2019t converting your leads, you must keep it simple and take a look at the top one or two statistics that are most relevant to your outcome. Do you have the right target audience? What is your conversion rate? What is your click through rate?</p>\n<p>Rick tells you the general cost per conversion that you should strive to spend. He also likes to see a 20% and above conversion rate on a landing page. He explains strategies and actions that you can take to make sure you\u2019re on the right track to achieve this.</p>\n<p>For those of you dying to know how your competitors are adding more text to their Facebook ad than is allowed, Rick tells you precisely how. We also discuss when it\u2019s best to post a video or an image with your ad.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite insights was that Facebook\u2019s chat helpline is up and running. You heard me right . . . LIVE FACEBOOK AD CHAT! He explains where to find the live chat session, and he raves about the good results he\u2019s gotten from reaching out.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Rick talked about targeting and what to do when you can\u2019t find the Facebook Pages you want to target. He shares three sure-fire tips for successful targeting. It may take some detective work at times, but it will pay off.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to register for one of Rick\u2019s three, FREE, live webinars (on April 12 and 13) to discover how you can create an automated system that gets leads and sales everyday for your business.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m thrilled to tell you that Rick has agreed to come on more regularly to answer your pressing questions. We know that you need these answers to keep moving forward.

Steve goes into detail on how he and his wife grew their business by driving traffic to their e-commerce site in this week\u2019s episode.</p>\n<p>First and foremost determining the best sites for your e-commerce marketing depends on what your value proposition is. What are you looking to market online with e-commerce?</p>\n<p>If it lends itself to searches; for example, Google shopping converts very well. But you see, if you\u2019re selling something general like T-shirts, Google might not be your best bet. And, you might want to go with the targeted marketing on Facebook for better conversion rates.

It\u2019s all tied to his latest book, Living Forward: A Proven Plan to Stop Drifting and Get the Life You Want, which Michael co-authored with Daniel Harkavy. </p>\n<p>Why, you might ask, is a life plan more important than many areas of your business? </p>\n<p>Because, as Michael says:</p>\n<p>\u201cA failure in one area can reverberate and cascade into other areas of our life.\u201d</p>\n<p>So when you\u2019re overall life plan is off track, then your business is naturally off.

This can create an environment for failure.</p>\n<p>Michael helps you understand that by getting your priorities in line, so you can be prepared to make the little decisions you need to get the big results you want out of your business, and in life.</p>\n<p>Because, it\u2019s not the big moves that determine the quality of our output, it\u2019s actually the little actions. In last week\u2019s episode, I explained how I grew my business via incremental steps and not one large move.</p>\n<p>Michael takes this one step further to help us decide what we should be focusing on in our lives, so that we are prepared and patient enough to conquer those little steps.</p>\n<p>To get started, he prompts you to ask yourself:<br />\n1.     How do you want to be remembered?<br />\n2.     What is most important to you?<br />\n3.     How do I get from here (wherever that is) to where I want to be?</p>\n<p>Michael then shares the surprising reality about putting yourself first.

Let me tell you that the confidence I feel makes a world of difference in the midst\u00a0of pre-launch craziness.</p>\n<p>And that\u00a0got me thinking about how insanely important it is in your business to have your mind right!</p>\n<p>We don't think about this too much--we're too busy looking for the right tools, the right strategies, the right technology, etc. But if your confidence is struggling even just a bit, no strategy is going to\u00a0work inside your business the way it should.</p>\n<p>That's why today's podcast episode is all about lies, lies, lies...</p>\n<p>And, of course, the truth that we need to replace them.</p>\n<p>As you likely already know, to win the game of becoming a successful entrepreneur, you\u2019ve got to focus occasionally on what\u2019s going on between your two ears.</p>\n<p>Today's post is all about the lies that I've personally dealt with! And sometimes, in low moments, I still hear them creeping up on me.</p>\n<p>But with the help and advice of other friends in the online business world, I know what to tell myself when those lies show up...and that's what I want to pass on to you today.<br />\nLie #1: You have to be the best in your market.<br />\nSometimes, when we're just starting out, we feel like we need to be number one, the best, and out on top in our market. That's not always the case. Click here for my take on the all too common lie we tell ourselves, and what the truth really looked like for me, even when it came to getting real with my signature course offering.<br />\nLie #2: You have to find the balance between your work and your family and all that comes in between that.<br />\nYou might be surprised to hear that I don't believe in balance. While working with Tony Robbins, I learned a very important lesson that I continue to reflect on during different seasons of my business growth. I encourage you to listen to the full episode to hear exactly what balance looks like in my business. I share some powerful takeaways that I've learned recently that you don't want to miss!<br />\nLie #3: Your failures that are adding up are proof that you\u2019re never going to make this work.<br />\nSometimes,\u00a0when things aren\u2019t working as we\u2019re trying to build our businesses online, we go to a really dark place, where our\u00a0whole business idea looks like a disaster and we start wondering if\u00a0we are going to have to go back to the 9-to-5 job. Oh, boy have I been in place where I hated where my business was headed. Listen here, and I'll tell you what I did to make things shift.<br />\nLie #4: Every opportunity that comes your way is big, and you can\u2019t miss out on it or you\u2019ll be left behind.<br />\nIf you know my story, you know that for the first couple of years, I really struggled, and thought I constantly had to seize every opportunity that came my way, or I might miss my big break. Whether you're a full blown entrepreneur, or still working a corporate job while you transition, there are huge lessons I learned from this mindset. I'll share a few of them here, as well as some sage advice on what might work for you if you struggle in this area.<br />\nStopping the Lies = Knowing the Truth<br />\nI know it\u2019s not enough to just tell you what these\u00a0lies are. You need to know how to flip them around with truth! Once you have the truth, those\u00a0lies can't hold you back anymore, and you can really start building momentum in your business.</p>\n<p>Since we're all about truth-telling today,", "duration": "45:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_98_mixdown.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1455177353, "title": "#97: How to Grow a Profitable Facebook Group", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Today we're diving into a new aspect of Facebook marketing that may very well surprise you!</p>\n<p>If you've hosted a webinar or an online course, you have probably also created a private Facebook group as a bonus for your clients. In addition to offering extra support and relationship, private Facebook groups are an amazing way to galvanize your clients into a true community. (Always a great thing when it comes to brand loyalty!)</p>\n<p>But did you know that the community-creating power of private Facebook groups can be\u00a0a hugely effective sales tool?\u00a0</p>\n<p>My guests on the podcast today are Josh and Jill Stanton from Screw the 9 to 5, and they're going to share their secret strategy\u00a0for using private Facebook groups to warm up your audience for sales.</p>\n<p>Using Facebook groups in this way is really unique to Josh and Jill--as far as I know, nobody else out there is using this strategy to grow revenue.</p>\n<p>That's because we usually think of Facebook groups as being an \"after the fact\" thing. You create the product, people buy it and then they're part of the group.</p>\n<p>But what Josh and Jill have realized that there's a ton of sales power in\u00a0making your audience\u00a0\"part of the group\" before they ever spend a dime with you!<br />\nRe-think Your Page<br />\nRight off the bat, Jill makes a statement that could ruffle the feathers of a lot of online marketers:<br />\n\"Facebook Pages are dead to me.\"<br />\nOnce you recover from that bombshell, don't rush to the \"Delete\" button on your page! There's definitely a place for Facebook Pages...even Jill and Josh still use\u00a0theirs.</p>\n<p>But what Jill is saying is that the Page setup is really more of a one-way street when it comes to interacting with your audience. For example, when fans comment on your page, their words show up in a sidebar...not exactly a real conversation, is it?<br />\nTurning Your Brand into\u00a0a Facebook Family<br />\nBy contrast, a Facebook group lets the \"family atmosphere\" of your brand\u00a0really flourish. When you gather the people who have genuine interest in your business into a private setting--one in which they can interact with you as another member (an extra-knowledgeable\u00a0and authoritative member, of course)--you're able to build a\u00a0community of affinity and trust around your brand. </p>\n<p>A community in which you are the go-to source for what your audience wants to know/solve/accomplish.</p>\n<p>A community that is brought together by the experience\u00a0of your program, product or service.</p>\n<p>If you're ready to find out the nuts and bolts of this ingenious Facebook marketing strategy, click here to listen to the whole episode now!</p>\n<p>...Oh, and be sure to pay attention for\u00a0a special bonus topic in my conversation with Josh and Jill: what to do when you realize that you don't really like your business model.

You do a little research on it and, by the end of the day, feel a growing sense that this idea of yours has\u00a0real selling potential. Maybe you even ask\u00a0your audience directly if they'd be interested in this idea, and they give\u00a0it a resounding \"Yes, please!\"</p>\n<p>And then, after all this, you put your great\u00a0idea into action...and it doesn't sell. Nothing comes of it.</p>\n<p>When you spend time, effort, and money putting together something for your audience, only to hear crickets when you put it out into the world, it can really crush your confidence, not to mention put a dent in your bottom line.</p>\n<p>But what if you could take your idea through a proven process that makes sure it's a good fit for you, your business, and for your audience?<br />\nNow that's a\u00a0pretty good idea, right?</p>\n<p>My good friend Pat Flynn\u00a0has tested many, many great ideas over the course of his online career. And believe it or not, even Pat has had a few ideas that he thought were great end up dead in the water.

It's a great episode and you're going to want to hear the whole thing--trust me!</p>\n<p>Pat is one of the hardest working guys out there. But even more impressive than his work ethic is his transparency. If you've visited his site, you've seen that he publishes his monthly revenue reports so that viewers can see real-life proof of how well his ideas work.<br />\nSuccess Isn't Overnight<br />\nAs entrepreneurs, we're always talking about launching.\u00a0Launching is a big part of what we do,\u00a0but how often do we talk about what happens after you launch? Is your idea\u00a0actually going to take off? Is it going to fly? Is it going to keep going or is it going to crash?</p>\n<p>Whether you need permission to really get moving on your latest idea, or if you require\u00a0some\u00a0\"tough love\"\u00a0in order to\u00a0let this one go and keep searching for inspiration, Pat's book is going to give you some fundamental tools for entrepreneurial success.</p>\n<p>The Three Validation Tests<br />\nOne of the best things Pat's book offers is the three validation tests that show how an idea fits into your life, your strengths, and the overall goal of your business.</p>\n<p>\tThe Airport Test</p>\n<p>Imagine that it's five years from now. You're at the airpot and you run\u00a0into someone you haven't seen in the past five years. They ask you\u00a0\"How's life?\"<br />\nNow imagine you answer \"Life is great. It couldn't be better!\" What would be happening, five years from now, to make you say that?<br />\nNow ask yourself: is the idea you're working on\u00a0right now contributing\u00a0to that five-years-from-now goal?</p>\n<p>\tThe History Test</p>\n<p>This test makes you\u00a0analyze three or four of the different jobs you've\u00a0had in the past. You call to mind the position, the environment, the people you worked with, specific memories that are either pleasant or painful.<br />\nWhen you do a review like this, it helps you see what those jobs might have had in common...and why that pattern might be attracting you over and over. Does it point out a skill or a preference that you have? Whether they were good jobs or bad jobs, they have something valuable to tell you about\u00a0who you are...and that will give you a better understanding of how your idea fits into your skill set.</p>\n<p>\tThe Shark Bait Test</p>\n<p>Imagine you are a contestant on the show Shark Tank,\u00a0standing in front of the celebrity investors and pitching your idea. Doing this honestly, from your gut, takes away the salesmanship from the exercise, and makes you really speak to why\u00a0you and your idea\u00a0are special and\u00a0why people would be crazy not to get on board with it.<br />", "duration": "50:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_95.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1453363160, "title": "#94: Using Periscope to Grow Your Business", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>By now you've probably heard about Periscope, the live streaming\u00a0social media platform that lets you talk to your fans in real time. It's the fastest growing social media platform\u00a0of all time! Since Periscope launched in March 2015, it already has 15 million users. And get this: those users upload three years' worth of video content every day.</p>\n<p>I dabbled with Periscope for a while in 2015, and to be honest, I couldn't figure out if I loved it or hated it. Mostly, I just didn't really understand how to use it to its fullest potential.</p>\n<p>That's why I was so glad to talk with today's\u00a0podcast guest. Zack Spuckler is a genuine Periscope ninja, and he has used the platform to do amazing things with his email list.</p>\n<p>Whether\u00a0you're an early adopter who is already\u00a0using Periscope on a daily basis, or a skeptic who wonders if this medium is really going to last long enough to be worth the time it takes to learn it, this episode is one you just can't miss.</p>\n<p>I'll be the first to admit that my biggest obstacle in using Periscope is the whole \"live stream\" nature of it. Frankly, it makes me nervous--I like to have a plan, a script, and a lot of chances to correct my mistakes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I recognize the real power of livestreaming to\u00a0break the barriers between you and your audience. They get to come\u00a0inside your world, and you get to be more personal and engaging with them. It lets your audience\u00a0see a side of you that really no other social media platform offers.</p>\n<p>Having said that, there are some do's and don'ts that go a long way toward making Periscope truly effective as a marketing tool. That's where Zach's expertise comes in!</p>\n<p>In addition to offering tons of pro tips and insider tricks on how to use Periscope to best advantage (and a good estimate on how long it takes to really hit your stride) Zach has created a freebie just for you. It's a worksheet with five simple steps to guide you through your first Periscope broadcast. Click here to get it now!</p>\n<p>The Numbers<br />\nIn Zach's first 30 days on Periscope, he did $10k in sales. (Listen to the podcast if you want to hear my reaction to this unbelievable number.) It's even more amazing when you find out that previous to this, Zach's all-time revenue high had been $1700 in a month.</p>\n<p>So he started plugging all his channels into Periscope, to see what kind of results he got.</p>\n<p>\tWould people\u00a0convert on a webinar from Periscope? They would.<br />\n\tWould they convert from a funnel on Periscope? Sure enough.<br />\n\tWould they sign up for a lead magnet? Yup.<br />\n\tWould they like him on Facebook? Even that.<br />\n\tWould they buy $1500 product packages in the midst of a live stream? Yes, indeed, they would.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks of this, people were noticing! They were asking Zach how he got these amazing results...so, naturally, he created a Periscope training course and sold it via Periscope.</p>\n<p>I'll let Zach tell you\u00a0what happened:<br />\n\"I sold about $1,200 of the course at a $97 intro price. Then I did it again the next day. We\u00a0ended up doing about $2,200 in sales with about an hour and a half of Periscopes. We\u00a0hadn\u2019t sent emails. We didn\u2019t even have a sales page.<br />\n\"Then I launched my Periscope course and really drove people there from\u00a0Periscope. This will really tell you the power of it: I didn\u2019t have a freebie ready for\u00a0Periscope. I threw together a lead page that said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make a really cool Periscope\u00a0freebie. I have no idea what it\u2019s going to be, I just know that you should sign up for it.\u201d\u00a0We had over 200 people opt in for that and when all was said and done, in the course of\u00a0the first 30 days and a little beyond that because we had launch, we had sold 60 copies of\u00a0the course.\"<br />\nThe Real Power Behind Periscope<br />\nZach has tons of tips and tools that will help you create results like these on Periscope.

If you're measuring your list's health in terms of numbers,\u00a0it can really get you down sometimes. It's easy to feel\u00a0like the fate of your business is at a standstill until your list numbers in the thousands (or at least\u00a0the high hundreds).</p>\n<p>My guest on the podcast today is going to blow that myth out of the water! Rachel Luna is living proof that you don\u2019t need a gigantic list to gain success. What really matters about your list isn\u2019t the number of names and addresses on it, but the quality of those people in terms of their engagement with you.</p>\n<p>Rachel\u2019s success story is really a one-two punch. Not only does she show the power of what you can do with a highly engaged list, but she\u2019s also a stellar example of how to do affiliate marketing right.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve thought about doing affiliate marketing but haven\u2019t tried it\u2026or if you\u2019ve gone through it before with mediocre results\u2026Rachel\u2019s story is going to truly inspire you.

You can get it by clicking here!</p>\n<p>Secrets of an\u00a0Affiliate Marketing Superstar</p>\n<p>Last spring, Rachel worked with my business coach Todd Herman and chose to be an affiliate promoter of his 90-Day Year program.\u00a0As a business/life coach to other entrepreneurs, Rachel is\u00a0ultra-focused on taking action and setting goals, which made her a perfect fit for this\u00a0promotion. Her message is all about breaking through negative thoughts and limiting beliefs to achieve\u00a0the success you want. This promotion really gave her a chance to practice what she preached. Rachel came into Todd's affiliate program with\u00a0a list just over 5000. That may sound like a lot, but bear in mind she was working among affiliates who had lists upward of 100k! She was a small fish in a very big pond. Actually, I also happened to be working with Todd as an affiliate for this program, as well. And\u00a0as the promotion got going, I started seeing this name I'd never heard before popping up on the leader board. Her numbers were going up at an astonishing rate. Other affiliates were starting to talk about her. \"Who is this Rachel Luna, and what is her secret?\" Finally, I decided to get in touch with her to find out just that. And today she is sharing the secrets of her affiliate marketing\u00a0success with all of us! Click here to start listening now. </p>\n<p>The\u00a0Steps\u00a0to Affiliate Marketing Success</p>\n<p>Rachel had done a few affiliate promotions in the past--by the time she got involved with Todd's 90-Day Year program, she had some solid standards\u00a0for success in place:</p>\n<p>\tShe had rules to determine\u00a0which affiliate programs she participates with. Rule #1 is not to promote anything she has not personally used. Rachel knows that to keep her list's trust, she has to limit her promotions to things that she knows will work and that she can offer knowledgeable\u00a0support\u00a0around.</p>\n<p>\tShe had a plan. It\u2019s easy to think that because you\u2019re working for someone else, you don\u2019t have to put as much work into your launch. But Rachel really makes her affiliate partner\u2019s business her own. She even created a Facebook group where she shared the details of her own success in using Todd\u2019s program.</p>\n<p>\tShe had a revenue goal. This was Rachel\u2019s fourth ever affiliate promotion, and she\u2019d built up her capability over the previous three times. So this time, her goal was $14,000.</p>\n<p>\tShe set expectations. Right from the beginning, she let her audience know how long she\u2019d be offering this free content from Todd.

But if you're still struggling to nail\u00a0your Facebook ad strategy, or if you're just getting started in this world, this episode is most definitely for you.</p>\n<p>I work with a lot of\u00a0business students who are just getting started with Facebook ads or have been dabbling in ads for a while without seeing much success. The number one mistake I see them\u00a0making is targeting the wrong people. This usually happens for two reasons.</p>\n<p>\tSome of my students truly don\u2019t understand who their avatar is.<br />\n\tOthers...the majority, in fact...know who their avatar is, but they just haven\u2019t dug deep enough to understand them in a way that Facebook ad targeting could make a huge difference for them in their business. Specifically, they haven\u2019t done the research or\u00a0documented their successes and losses, so they aren\u2019t really sure what\u2019s working.</p>\n<p>Here's what I always remind them:\u00a0when you get really good at Facebook ad targeting, there is no doubt you are going to see some major shifts in the impact you have with your audience and a major increase in your revenue streams.</p>\n<p>That's why I've created a roadmap that will let you know exactly where to focus, along with what needs to be on your radar from the get-go. It's really simple--just the way I like it--and it's set up\u00a0so that you can keep adding to it as you learn exactly who your audience is and how to get in front of them. Basically, it's the key\u00a0to\u00a0unlocking\u00a0the most valuable resource in your business.</p>\n<p>I've put a lot into this\u00a0episode for you, so make sure to listen to the whole podcast to get everything you need to start the new year off successfully!</p>\n<p>I've also created a great freebie to help you with this plan--the Facebook Ad Targeting Starter Guide. It's a\u00a0list of\u00a0ten questions that you MUST be able to answer about your audience in order to fully optimize your Facebook ad targeting.\u00a0Grab the special guide by clicking below!</p>\n<p>Like I said, you've really got to listen to the whole episode to get\u00a0all this great information I've put together for you. But to outline it for you,\u00a0Facebook ad targeting\u00a0breaks down into four specific opportunities:<br />\nTargeting Opportunity #1: Target Your Own Audiences<br />\nSay\u00a0you already have an email list of at least 1,000 people. You can upload that email list to Facebook, Facebook will match your email list with their database and voila! You\u2019ve got a targeting opportunity with your best, fastest-converting leads.<br />\nTargeting Opportunity #2: Targeting Your Own Facebook Fans<br />\nThis list is\u00a0not as warm as your own email list, but it is still a group of engaged people who are going to pay attention to you. Here\u2019s the huge plus: you will almost always pay less with your Facebook ads when you target your own fan base versus a cold audience. If you ever needed a good reason to focus on building your Facebook fan base, I think this is the #1 best reason to do so.<br />\nTargeting Opportunity #3: Target Other Facebook Pages<br />\nThis is where I want you to put the most time and energy when it comes to research and experimentation. Targeting other Facebook pages is\u00a0the strategy that allows you the most opportunities.</p>\n<p>I've also got a \"super tip\" to help you find out which pages you should be targeting. Click here to listen to the podcast now!<br />\nTargeting Opportunity #4: Creating Lookalike Audiences<br />\nA lookalike audience is basically you taking a custom audience that you have and then asking Facebook to find an audience that is really similar to your own audience you have already created</p>\n<p>If you want to get a little bit more strategic with that (and I know you do!) you can try a technique called layering.

I am thrilled to ring in the New Year with you.</p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I love new beginnings. The clean slate, the opportunity to brainstorm amazing new projects and create strategies and systems around getting them done\u2026it gets my creative juices flowing like nothing else.</p>\n<p>And the podcasts I have planned for 2016 are no exception! There are some really exciting episodes in store for you. We\u2019ll be focusing on list building and building campaigns in your business so that you can sell more online. We\u2019ll talk a lot about content creation and making sure that you\u2019re getting in front of the right people to make the biggest impact. And we\u2019ll make sure you are creating a business that you love as well as creating online training programs and products that your audience can\u2019t get enough of.</p>\n<p>But to get us set up for success in all these areas, I\u2019m going to kick off the new year with some advice from my good friend John Lee Dumas. John is a favorite guest to have on this podcast because his brand Entrepreneur on Fire is a stellar example of the kind of success we\u2019re all shooting for. And after hosting over 1200 interviews with successful entrepreneurs, John is definitely an authority on what it takes to achieve online business success.<br />\nSMART Goals = Surefire Success<br />\nJohn said that over the past few years, a pattern emerged in the emails he received from his audience. A lot of people were struggling with online business because they didn\u2019t know how to set and accomplish goals in an effective way.</p>\n<p>Contrast that with what John saw in the success stories of his Entrepreneur on Fire interviewees:<br />\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer there is no silver bullet. It\u2019s all hard work and getting your nose down to the grindstone, for sure. But I step back and ask what is one thing the Amy Porterfield\u2019s and Pat Flynn\u2019s and Michael Stelzner\u2019s of the world all do well. \u2026 These people all know how to set and accomplish goals.\u201d<br />\nSo John decided to dedicate 2015 to creating a structure for his audience to take action with setting goals.</p>\n<p>And now, in 2016, he has an amazing and beautiful product to help them do just that! It\u2019s called the Freedom Journal: Accomplish Your Goals in 100 Days.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a hardbound, 300-page physical book that walks you step by step through the process of not only setting a goal but accomplishing it within 100 days.</p>\n<p>(True story: I have this journal right in front of me, and let me just tell you that simply holding it in your hands is a powerful thing. Something about this beautifully created physical product is inspiring and empowering in a whole new way. Looking at it makes you want to take action. Pretty amazing stuff!)</p>\n<p>Step by Step Guidance for Your 2016 Goals<br />\nThe Freedom Journal starts with John guiding you through setting a SMART goal. You probably already know this acronym: it stands for Smart, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.<br />\nThe rest of the journal offers step-by-step guidance and accountability in carrying out your goal one day at a time.</p>\n<p>In the remainder of this podcast, John and I talk through the process of two different real-life SMART goals. The first one is about John launching Entrepreneur On Fire; the second one is about how I launched Webinars That Convert. After hearing us explain how SMART goals guided our most successful ventures, you\u2019ll have some super actionable example of how you can use the Freedom Journal to accomplish your own goals\u2026did I mention in just 100 days?!</p>\n<p>Click here to listen to the full episode now!</p>\n<p>Links mentioned in this episode:<br />\nJohn Lee Dumas<br />\nEpisode 22 with John Lee Dumas<br />\nEntrepreneur On Fire<br />\nThe Freedom Journal<br />\nPencils of Promise<br />\nThe Miracle Morning<br />\nPodcast Details:<br />\nClick here to download the transcript of this week's episode.<br />\nClick Here to Subscribe via RSS (non-iTunes feed)</p>", "duration": "41:54", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_91.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1451548476, "title": "#90: 7 Ways to Work Smarter in 2016", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Can you believe 2015 is over already?</p>\n<p>I know, it's a cliche thing to say, but it's true--I feel like the year has just flown by!

More importantly, what feelings do those images create inside you?</p>\n<p>When I think of Apple products, I think of elegant, simple design and the feeling of effortlessly getting stuff done. Lululemon brings back\u00a0that sensation of looking\u00a0amazing when I'm working out (even if my workout itself feels less than amazing). And Morton Salt? I think of my mom's kitchen cupboard, which feels warm and nostalgic and makes me want to go bake cookies.</p>\n<p>Here's the\u00a0answer to the quiz: all three of those brands share the power of fascination.</p>\n<p>Fascination, as my podcast guest Sally Hogshead defines it, means an intense focus.<br />\n\"When you\u2019re fascinated by a person or a brand, you\u2019re completely consumed in that moment. It\u2019s that feeling you have when you\u2019re working on a project and you\u2019re totally in the flow. You feel creative, you feel confident, you feel focused and energized by what you\u2019re doing. Or when you\u2019re out at drinks with a friend\u2014the time flies by, and you seem to be building epiphanies together in your conversation.\"<br />\nClick here to listen to the full episode with Sally.</p>\n<p>For years, Sally's day job was helping big name brands like Nike and BMW find the perfect words to describe themselves. The first half\u00a0of that search was understanding what they offered to their customer base that nobody else did; the second half was knowing how to capitalize on that uniqueness and capture it in language.</p>\n<p>At a certain point,\u00a0Sally realized that nobody had really brought that idea over from products to people. Business owners\u00a0were all about finding the right words to get customers fascinated with their products, but they weren't finding the right words to help people understand who they are and how they add value.</p>\n<p>These days,\u00a0she\u00a0parlays\u00a0her understanding of what works in advertising world into a training to help entrepreneurs understand how people perceive them through their communication.</p>\n<p>So here's a followup question:</p>\n<p>What makes YOU\u00a0fascinating?</p>\n<p>And before you mumble \"I'm not that fascinating, Amy\" I'm going to stop you right there with what\u00a0Sally told me:<br />\n\"You don\u2019t learn how to be fascinating; you unlearn boring.\u00a0You\u2019ve already been fascinating your entire life.

In business, the key\u2014especially if you\u2019re trying to grow a business online\u2014is for you to have a very clear idea of the areas in which you can confidently deliver.

The fact is that I've been learning a ton about them myself, and every time I learn a new technique or crack the code on a revenue-boosting system, I can't help but pass it on to you!</p>\n<p>This week, though, I'm doing something a little different. Rather than walk you through a step-by-step system, I'm going to focus with you on one very specific strategy that I learned from\u00a0Tim Paige,\u00a0the host of the podcast Conversion Cast and the leader of all LeadPages webinars.</p>\n<p>Today is all about an engagement\u00a0strategy that\u00a0I've just\u00a0begun applying it\u00a0to my webinars. I\u2019ll be sure to let you know how it's going,\u00a0once I really get it\u00a0off the ground. But I'll be completely honest with you: it's a little awkward, in the beginning. I've done a lot of webinars, and I still am finding my sweet spot.</p>\n<p>The thing is that Tim, in addition to being a pal, is a true webinar ninja. This man has done 410 webinars to date! (Who knows--he may be up to\u00a0more, by the time this episode airs.) No joke--his\u00a0application is pending for the Guinness Book of World\u00a0Records for most webinars done in a 12-month period. This is a guy who really\u00a0knows the ins and outs of webinar success.</p>\n<p>So when he tells me this strategy is worth working through, I believe it!</p>\n<p>Listen to the full episode to get all the details on this amazing strategy from Tim Paige.</p>\n<p>You can also\u00a0check out Tim putting this revolutionary engagement strategy into action--just click here to join\u00a0his latest webinar.</p>\n<p>We all know how important engagement is for our webinars. There's nothing worse than crafting and delivering a dynamic, informative presentation only to hear crickets during the Q&amp;A.</p>\n<p>Scratch that--there is one thing worse: delivering your presentation and seeing only a faint dribble of sales by the time you log off for the day.</p>\n<p>What you're looking for is that special spark that sets fire to your content and gets your audience fired up in response to it.</p>\n<p>Early on, I wanted to test the idea of taking every\u00a0opportunity I could throughout the process of presenting a webinar to look over in the\u00a0questions box and start answering questions live as we went, as long as they were relevant\u00a0and weren\u2019t off topic.</p>\n<p>I found in answering questions, not only did I see a 98% stick rate (98% of the people that joined the webinar in the beginning stuck around all the way until the end) but in one split test I also saw a tripled revenue from one webinar to the next.\"<br />\nUm...did you get all that? A 98% stick rate and a 300% revenue increase?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'd say this strategy is well worth trying, wouldn't you?So how does this work? If you're like me, you may be already thinking about how taking questions in the middle of your presentation will interrupt your flow. What if the questions make\u00a0me get ahead of myself? Am I allowed to not answer questions if they\u00a0aren't on topic? How is this supposed to work with replays and automated webinars?</p>\n<p>...And just what is it about this strategy that makes it so incredibly powerful?</p>\n<p>Listen to the full episode for all the answers--it's a short but intense masterclass on a single technique that is a true webinar game changer.</p>\n<p>Do you want to see Tim\u2019s webinar engagement strategy in action?

And as we all know, loving an IMPORTANT process you used to hate is a\u00a0cornerstone of achieving the\u00a0success you want.</p>\n<p>If you're ready to dive into Melanie's amazing system, click here to listen to the full episode now.</p>\n<p>Below, I've got the bullet-point version to get you primed for what you're about to learn.<br />\nMake a\u00a0Dream Team List</p>\n<p>The first place to start is identifying what you need/want help with. Melanie says not to start with your limitations--instead, imagine what positions you'd create and fill if money, time and managing were no objection.<br />\n\"One of the harsh realities of being a business owner is you end up doing a lot of the work\u00a0that you really don\u2019t want to do. And just because you can be doing everything in your business doesn\u2019t mean you should be doing everything.\"<br />\nCreate a Revenue Goal<br />\nThis anchors\u00a0your hiring to a concrete need for your business. Your revenue goal\u00a0lets you know what you need from the new position, how soon you need it, and\u00a0how much you can invest into it up front.</p>\n<p>\"A lot of times the growth of your business is correlated to adding more\u00a0people to your team. A lot of times your business will grow as you grow your team because it starts opening up more bandwidth for you to be focusing on the things that only you can do and really excelling at them.\"<br />\nHire with a Sales Page<br />\nWhen you're looking for top-level talent, you need to create a top-level advertisement to attract them to\u00a0the position. Melanie's \"help wanted\" ads are\u00a0as beautiful, polished and persuasive\u00a0as any sales page she creates for her products and services. This is what draws the right people to apply for her dream team.<br />\nHire to Fit<br />\nIt sounds elementary, but you really need to find the right person with the right skills and the right attitude for your position. In other words, you can't simply hire an amazing person and adapt them to the role. An exceptional person in the wrong position will only end up frustrated...and so will you.</p>\n<p>By contrast, when you take the extra time and make the hard decisions,\u00a0it pays off like you wouldn't believe.</p>\n<p>\"When you get the right\u00a0people in the right positions incredible things are possible.\"<br />\nWondering how long the process should take?

We\u2019ve talked about the mindset of list building, and then we\u2019ve gotten really specific about what you need to do to build your list.</p>\n<p>Today I want to step back a little bit and look at the big picture and look at our team and how we\u2019re running our business and setting things up. I thought there was no one better to do that than my new friend, Dale Partridge.</p>\n<p>You probably already know Dale, either from Sevenly (the company he founded that became one of the fastest growing social-good startups in history), or from his many keynote speeches and feature interviews\u00a0on the topic of doing business with integrity, or maybe from his recent book People Over Profits.</p>\n<p>Dale is\u00a0a creative leader whose mission is to influence an industry to rethink the models of how we do business today. And I invited him on the show today to help you (and me) learn about how to\u00a0set a solid foundation for our long-term success.</p>\n<p>One thing Dale's book really dials into is the importance of recognizing the pivotal moments in our businesses when small decisions could have major impact.</p>\n<p>Dale went into business for himself\u00a0at 18 years old...which means that even though he's still a young man, he's old in entrepreneur\u00a0years. Within that time, he says, his whole mindset around business shifted from making major profits to making a major difference in people's lives.</p>\n<p>\"In the search for purpose and meaning I wanted to create a company that was more than just putting money at the bottom line. It wasn\u2019t until I really shifted my thinking from how to make a million dollars to how to help a million people that really pushed me into business.\"</p>\n<p>This is the core of Dale's\u00a0\"people over profits\" message . . . and what I really want to stress in today's episode is that it's never too early in your business to think about how you're prioritizing people against your profits.</p>\n<p>When you're\u00a0in the early years of building our business, you're\u00a0all too aware that every\u00a0interaction in every business relationship matters. You're\u00a0hyper-focused on bringing real, personal value to your customers with your unique talent and expertise, because you know that it's the key to your success.</p>\n<p>But Dale points out that greed, dishonesty and customer contempt are not relegated to big corporations . . . that's just when they get caught in a big way. It's super important, he says, to set the foundation of your business integrity in these early years, while you're small, and learn how to self-correct in those moments when it's easy to make small compromises.<br />\n\"I don\u2019t want to be the most successful person that nobody respects or that nobody trusts. And I don\u2019t want to create the biggest company that has great products but people don\u2019t really connect with it.\"<br />\nDale has done some impressive research on the most successful companies (and the ones who fell the hardest) of the past century. According to his research, the companies (and leaders)\u00a0who really stood the test of time have seven core beliefs in common:</p>\n<p>\tPeople matter.<br />\n\tTruth wins.<br />\n\tTransparency frees.<br />\n\tAuthenticity attracts.<br />\n\tQuality speaks.<br />\n\tGenerosity returns.<br />\n\tCourage sustains.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Listen to the full episode to hear Dale explain more about how these principles show up in\u00a0online business practice, and how we can train ourselves to build businesses that uphold\u00a0them.<br />\n\"Whatever your dream is, make sure you crush on it because it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about them.\"<br />\nIn the end, Dale says, our businesses' potential for growth\u00a0is dependent on the integrity we build\u00a0into our relationships with clients, vendors and colleagues. It can take real courage to honor a long-term relationship over short-term convenience.", "duration": "37:42", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_86.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1448521023, "title": "#85: 5 Marketing Lessons That Have Shaped My Online Business", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!</p>\n<p>First of all, can I just be a little corny and express my gratitude for all of you?

Sometimes I share \"quick-win\" strategies with you, but this week I wanted to go a little deeper with you.

But I\u2019m going to share some more insights that I\u2019ve never shared before about masterminding and finding a mentor.</p>\n<p>A big thing I learned from my mastermind group was the power of webinars.

Then I will give you some actions to start investigating this in your business.<br />\n3) My partnership.<br />\nYou may or may not know that I actually have a business partner. I\u2019ve never really talked about him much, and I want to share with you how that happened, when it came about, why it came about, and what it looks like in my business (if you\u2019ve ever thought about maybe adding a partner to the mix).

It's going to help you sort through the obstacles that are holding you back from building a healthy, growing list.</p>\n<p>Let me say at the outset that, for all my talk about the crucial importance of list-building, I truly understand the difficulty involved. When you're in the beginning days and months\u00a0of your business, it feels like every opportunity is more important than the simple, daily effort of building your email list.</p>\n<p>But I learned from the sad experience of my very first product launch just how essential the list really is. Listen to the podcast episode for the full story--it's eye-opening. For now, let's just say that with all the bells and whistles\u00a0of my program design and the sparkle of my marketing strategy, the promotion totally tanked.</p>\n<p>The reason? I had a weak email list.</p>\n<p>I couldn't understand it. I'd been networking with all the right people, even getting invited to speaking engagements and guest blog spots, and I'd spared no effort to create an amazing product.</p>\n<p>But because\u00a0I was not actively\u00a0focused on list building, I wasn't able to\u00a0build the business that I really wanted.</p>\n<p>(By the way, when I say \u201cactively\u201d focusing on it, I mean that I would think about my list\u00a0every day...but it was that horrible \u201cI should be doing this, I\u2019m far behind, I know I need a list\" kind of thinking.)</p>\n<p>Everything else about my business just seemed more important, in those stressful early days.</p>\n<p>That's why I've created this download for you--to help you think through what is pulling your attention away from the cornerstone of building your business. Once you understand why it's so easy to focus on other things, you'll be able to turn the trend around and start seeing the results you want.</p>\n<p>Listen to today's episode first--it will really help you with the mindset around list-building, and allow you to process the questions honestly.</p>\n<p>And when you're done, drop me a comment to let me know what you're thinking!

I have a fun topic to cover in today's episode:</p>\n<p>The Online Entrepreneur's Worst Nightmare. (Cue spooky\u00a0music.)</p>\n<p>Sorry...I couldn't resist. Blame the post-Halloween sugar overload.</p>\n<p>The actual topic is how to keep your Facebook account from getting shut down.</p>\n<p>Now, this is a topic that I know truly does scare some of you...maybe you've\u00a0received warnings from Facebook about your content, or maybe you know somebody whose account has been shut down.</p>\n<p>I know how upsetting this can be, not just to the people it occurs to, but to every other online entrepreneur in their community. It's just like that feeling when someone you know gets their house or car broken into. Suddenly it feels like the whole world is out to get you.</p>\n<p>I don't want you going through your business day freaking out about this. That's why\u00a0I'm devoting this episode to defusing the scare out of this \"nightmare.\" Seriously...breathe. It's going to be OK.</p>\n<p>There's nobody who knows more about protecting your Facebook account than my friend Rick Mulready. Much of the credit for today's episode goes to him.</p>\n<p>When I was talking to Rick about this issue, the first thing that came up was how often Facebook's ad guidelines change. If you've ever felt like the old FB is a little trigger-happy on the guideline updates, you're not crazy. Not only\u00a0do the guidelines\u00a0change very often, but they're always couched in vague verbiage. It's just not a simple \"Don't do this, this and this\" with Facebook.</p>\n<p>Rick told me\u00a0that it's important to understand the foundational principle of Facebook's guidelines. For them, it all comes down to creating a great user experience. In other words, Facebook wants to protect all Facebook users from feeling lied to, \"sold to,\" bullied, harassed...you get the picture.</p>\n<p>If you're thinking,\u00a0\"Amy, I would never lie to my audience!\" ... believe me, I know. And I'm on your side.</p>\n<p>But Facebook is going the extra mile to protect users from people who do lie.</p>\n<p>So they're not letting people make bold, specific promises to our audience about concrete things (like saving money, making money, losing weight, etc.). And they're not letting us use highly specific imagery that suggests these things (like images of idealized body types,\u00a0huge stacks of cash, etc.).</p>\n<p>Why? Because some people hear/see those things on the internet and feel bad about themselves. And feeling bad is not a good user experience.</p>\n<p>So what is an online entrepreneur to do? Answer: get creative!

Rather than feeling defeated, think about how you can beat Facebook to the punch by creating content that makes all users feel amazing, hopeful, inspired, uplifted. That's a win for everybody--Facebook, your audience, and you.<br />\nTip #1: Add a privacy policy to your registration page.<br />\nIf you\u2019re running an ad to a page where you're collecting name/email (or any information) from people, you need to have a clear explanation of what you will/won't be doing with the information you're collecting.</p>\n<p>We explain a lot more about how to do this in the full episode. Click here to listen now.<br />\nTip #2: Disable all pop-ups on the page where you are sending your ad traffic.<br />\nA lot of people will send Facebook ad traffic to a blog post. Facebook loves this (because users don't have to opt-in to get the content), but what they don't love is if a pop-up ad shows up 20 seconds after the user clicks. Pop-up ads have a bad rap, what can I say?<br />\nTip #3: Pay attention to your reputation on Web Of Trust.<br />\nThis is a third-party reputation site that Facebook looks at frequently to decide if an account should be shut down.

Truly a great example to all of us working on our online businesses!</p>\n<p>And you'd better believe Lewis didn't get to this level\u00a0by aiming for \"good enough.\"</p>\n<p>His recent book School of Greatness is all\u00a0about the importance of striving for greatness--in our personal lives, our health, our relationships\u00a0and, of course, in our businesses.<br />\nWhat Does \"Greatness\" Really Mean?<br />\nAs entrepreneurs, we're a little obsessed with the idea of \"success.\" The symbols are always changing--this year it might be making a decent profit, next year maybe it's hitting six figures, and the year after that, it could be landing a book deal or paying off your house or...who knows?</p>\n<p>This is the danger of becoming too obsessed with success--the target is always moving. Which means we run the risk of never being satisfied, no matter how much we accomplish.</p>\n<p>But by focusing our sights\u00a0on greatness, Lewis says, we're able to experience\u00a0satisfaction with where we are in our business, and so much more besides.<br />\n\"Greatness is discovering what your greatest gifts are, your talents, what you were born to do, maximizing those gifts, and impacting the maximum amount of people in the world with those gifts.\"<br />\n8 Principles of Greatness<br />\nLewis' book breaks\u00a0greatness into eight simple steps:</p>\n<p>1. Clarifying Your Vision</p>\n<p>Before you set out on your personal quest, you have to clearly see the action steps to make it happen.</p>\n<p>2. Embracing Adversity</p>\n<p>Challenge and struggle are a natural part of growth.</p>\n<p>3. Cultivating a Champion's Mindset</p>\n<p>You can't guarantee that you'll win every time, but you can always set yourself up for\u00a0the opportunity to win.</p>\n<p>4. Committing to Hustle</p>\n<p>A\u00a0willingness to do whatever it takes\u00a0will take you where mere talent can't.</p>\n<p>5. Mastering Your Health</p>\n<p>Your health (emotional, mental and physical) can either hold you\u00a0back or drive you\u00a0forward--which way do you choose?</p>\n<p>6. Practicing Positive Habits</p>\n<p>Without intentional habits, life turns into a nothing but a series of reactions.</p>\n<p>7. Realizing You Can't Achieve Greatness Alone</p>\n<p>A powerful, reliable team is the key to building\u00a0something that\u2019s bigger than yourself.</p>\n<p>8. Being of Service to Others</p>\n<p>The crowning moment of greatness is giving your gift to the world.</p>\n<p>This is just a summary of Lewis' eight principles--you need to hear these in detail! So click here now to listen to the full podcast episode.</p>\n<p>Going Deeper<br />\nMy chat with Lewis did more than just outline what it means to be great. It illuminated some of the finer points that past experience had \"muddied up\" for me.</p>\n<p>For example...</p>\n<p>\tThe word \"hustle\" gives me a little bit of shudder, because I remember my corporate job days where I was really diving in, giving it my all, but felt like I lost myself. Fortunately, Lewis' definition of hustle doesn't mean prioritizing\u00a0one aspect of your life at the expense of\u00a0everything else important.<br />\n\tEven someone as multi-talented as Lewis feels exhausted and overwhelmed sometimes. Greatness requires a careful check-in system with yourself,", "duration": "45:39", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode__81_.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1445495256, "title": "#80: Ask Amy", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>It's time for another edition of Ask Amy!</p>\n<p>Every now and then, no matter how good your business system is, you reach a moment where everything kind of splinters. I'm having one of those moments this week, trying to reassemble my podcasting setup after moving it into a bigger home studio.</p>\n<p>While I'm glad to have this bigger space devoted to my podcast, I don't have the acoustics worked out yet--which means I'm a little bit stalled in terms of production. Little issues like this can really bother me, if I let them!</p>\n<p>I'm sure you've experienced this, too. Think with me\u00a0about an area in your business where you feel stuck because something else has to happen before you move forward. Maybe something\u2019s not working properly and you have to figure it out first. Or maybe you\u2019re just not comfortable moving forward and you\u2019re not sure why.</p>\n<p>All of today's questions deal with\u00a0different things, but they all center around this core issue of obstacles holding back the progress of our business.</p>\n<p>Let's take a look!</p>\n<p>Question #1: How early do you contact affiliates if you want them to work with you to promote your course?</p>\n<p>While I'm no expert in affiliate partnerships,\u00a0I have worked with a small, carefully selected\u00a0affiliate base over the last few years.</p>\n<p>And one of the ways I select them is whether they're prepared enough with their annual business strategy\u00a0to join me in planning at least three months ahead.</p>\n<p>As my free download for this week, I'm doing a mini-training video of my\u00a0new WordPress affiliate membership site. It's a great\u00a0solution if you're pulling together all the materials for your affiliates. Not only does it help you get organized, but you can just show it\u00a0to a programmer and tell them you want \u201cthis.\"</p>\n<p>Question #2: Remembering back to the first product you created, what would you tell us now that you wish you would have done differently back then?</p>\n<p>I\u00a0definitely wish I would have spent a little bit more time on developing a concept around my product suite.\u00a0When\u00a0you have a really solid product suite, you're\u00a0able to help people in your niche that are at different phases in it.</p>\n<p>Without this, you end up pushing away potential clients to other people. They ask you \"What should I do in this phase?\" and because you don't have a product around it, you point them elsewhere. That's fine if it happens just occasionally, but when you get asked this a LOT (like I do with, say, creating online courses), your opportunity bells will start ringing like crazy and\u00a0it starts to make you think \"Why don't I offer a product for that?\"</p>\n<p>Question #3: What do you do when you see another site steal your content and sell it?</p>\n<p>Um...throw something at the monitor? Just kidding. This has happened to me a lot, though. In fact, it happens with every new program I release.</p>\n<p>One of the first things I do is remind myself that the \"client\" who would find my program on a shady site that is clearly not mine and go ahead and buy it is NOT a client I would want to work with. At the end of the day,\u00a0it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about the quality of people we\u2019re attracting to our businesses.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, a lot more I could say about this...and do! Click here to listen to the full podcast to hear all my thoughts on this issue.</p>\n<p>Question #4: As an entrepreneur, how do you stay focused on what is at hand and not get distracted with wanting to start new projects, create new things, try a new form of social media? How do you stay focused?</p>\n<p>First and foremost, I use Scrum. If you haven't heard of it, it's a system of project management that I explain in detail in Episode #75.</p>\n<p>Of course, the success of this system depends on the things you can't get away from. Consistency. Deadlines. Accountability.

It\u2019s going to put you way ahead of your competition.</p>\n<p>It starts with recognizing that it\u2019s simply human nature to take our time and stay on the fence as long as we can, until we are pushed one way or the other. That push comes from learning that we must act.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what urgency is: making sure that your audience knows they need to act now.</p>\n<p>You want to build urgency into every promotion you create. There are lots of ways to do this, but\u00a0the best way I\u2019ve found to build it in is with a one-two punch: a combination of bonuses and deadlines.</p>\n<p>I'm going to share several of my favorite strategies in this blog post, but this week's free PDF has even more urgency tactics from some of the biggest names in online marketing. Click here to download it now!</p>\n<p>Bonuses</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, I\u2019ve actually had people buy my programs just for the bonuses! While you definitely want to spend the bulk of your time crafting a great core offer, bonuses can sometimes make or break the offer by pushing people just a little bit further to finally say, \u201cYes, I want this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, it\u2019s important to note that not all bonus offers have urgency attached. Sometimes you\u2019ll create a bonus add-on to your core offer just to sweeten the deal.</p>\n<p>Urgency bonuses are the ones that show up later in the promotion. They come in different \u201cflavors. You do not need to do them all. You can mix and match them, based on what feels best for your offer.</p>\n<p>1. Timely bonus</p>\n<p>During your promotion, you pick a time where for a certain period\u2014say 48 hours\u2014you offer a specific add-on to your program. You email your promo list explaining quickly and thoroughly what the bonus is, why it\u2019s valuable, and what\u2019s in it for them. You paint the picture and tell them on what date and what time the bonus will go away.</p>\n<p>When I do a timely bonus, I always email my list at least one more time, usually 24 hours before the bonus is going to end, to let them know that time is running out.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you, it works really, really well. When you\u2019ve got a really good, juicy bonus, especially one that addresses a pain point. The main thing here, is to be very clear when it expires.</p>\n<p>2. Fast action bonus\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a bonus that you give away during a live situation. For me, it\u2019s when I\u2019m live on a webinar that I\u2019m using as part of my promotion. If you attend the webinar and respond to the offer at the end, right then and there, you get the special bonus I\u2019m offering.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been doing these fast-action bonuses for a long time. But that didn\u2019t stop me from making a big, fat flub during my recent \u201cWebinars That Convert\u201d promo! Click here to listen to the episode where I explain all about it\u2026and how you can make sure to avoid it!</p>\n<p>3. The sweeten-the-pot bonus</p>\n<p>This kind of bonus doesn\u2019t have a timeline. Everybody who buys your product gets it. But this style of bonus allows you to add something during your promotion\u2026which means you get another reason to email.</p>\n<p>Finding really good reasons to email is an essential part of the puzzle in a successful promotion.", "duration": "43:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode-79.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1444281936, "title": "#78: How I Generated $170K from One Upsell Strategy", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>In the process of building my business, I\u2019ve made more than my share of mistakes. The silver lining is that I get to pass the wisdom I\u2019ve learned on to you. It\u2019s always easier to do something right when you\u2019ve got someone guiding you past the ways it can go wrong.</p>\n<p>However, today\u2019s post is all about something that recently worked really well in my business. It\u2019s something you can apply quickly to your next promotion.</p>\n<p>Ready? Let\u2019s talk about upsells!</p>\n<p>What Is an Upsell?<br />\nFirst, let\u2019s get our definitions straight.</p>\n<p>Say someone buys a program or product from you online. They fill in all the credit card details and finish the transaction completely. They are officially now a member of your program.</p>\n<p>Before you take them to the purchase thank-you page that\u2019s when you can offer an upsell. You are giving your new purchaser one more opportunity to buy from you within the same interaction.</p>\n<p>Pretty cool, right?<br />\nPutting Together Your Upsell Offer<br />\nThree vital things to consider when doing upsells:</p>\n<p>\tWhat is the best upsell you can offer as it relates to the program you just sold?<br />\n\tHow do you price your upsell?<br />\n\tThe flow of the upsell process.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m no expert in upsells. I\u2019ve been in business a while, and just recently started using them.</p>\n<p>But the success I\u2019ve experienced has shown me that there\u2019s a certain flow that\u2019s really important to the overall strategy of your upsell.<br />\nAn Example from My Promotion<br />\nIn my most recent promotion, Webinars That Convert, I welcomed over 1,000 new members into the program in just under two weeks! That alone was awesome\u2026but even more awesome was the fact that 58% of those new members purchased the upsell I offered! That generated an extra $170k in revenue!</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I designed that upsell\u2014both the product and the process.</p>\n<p>\tI put together a product that perfectly complemented the program I was selling. In this case, it was a pack of 5 slide deck templates. You need a slide deck for your webinar, and these templates gave purchasers five unique, polished looks for their presentation. They also made the setup process a lot simpler.<br />\n\tI had the template pack price fixed, BUT I offered buyers three different options. They could purchase the pack in one fell swoop, they could split up the purchase into two payments, or they could purchase a \u201clite\u201d pack of just two templates.<br />\n\tI structured the upsell offer with a great deal of strategy. Here\u2019s how it worked: if someone saw the offer and bought the five decks at full price, they would never see the two-pay offer or the lite version. You wouldn\u2019t see the lite version unless you declined the first two offers. See how it works based on the potential buyer\u2019s behavior? It also allowed me to learn more about the segments of my audience.</p>\n<p>I go through a lot more the details of how to create your upsell (with ideas you\u2019re welcome to steal!) and structure your offer in the podcast. \u00a0Also, there is ONE THING you do NOT want to do when\u00a0creating an upsell. \u00a0I share the \"don't do this\" details in my podcast as well. \u00a0Click here to listen to it now!</p>\n<p>For this week\u2019s free download, I\u2019ve included the actual upsell page I used in this promotion, so you can see exactly what I did and make it your own.</p>\n<p>Links included in this episode:<br />\nSamCart<br />\nKajabi</p>\n<p>Dot Com Secrets<br />\nClick To Tweet<br />\n99 Designs<br />\nPodcast Details:<br />\nClick here to download the transcript of this week's episode.<br />\nClick Here to Subscribe via RSS (non-iTunes feed)</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.com/2015/10/78-how-i-generated-170k-from-one-upsell-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">#78: How I Generated $170K from One Upsell Strategy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amy Porterfield</a>.</p>", "duration": "32:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/The_Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_78.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1443678868, "title": "#77: 5 Video Marketing Mistakes Most Businesses Make", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>I know it\u2019s\u00a0only October,\u00a0but I\u2019m already thinking about how to boost my business in 2016. And one of my biggest goals is to do more video.</p>\n<p>Video is a complex issue for a lot of entrepreneurs. You know that it could help you make an amazing connection with your audience. But all the tinkering that goes into it--the lighting, the camera setup, the script--is a surefire way to fry your brain.</p>\n<p>Now, you actually may be\u00a0killing it with video right now. Maybe you\u00a0have a natural eye for what looks good on camera, you\u2019re a master of improvising quick, witty nuggets of wisdom on the fly, and talking into a lens brings out all the warmth and sparkle of your personality (instead of turning you into a cardboard cutout like\u2026um\u2026some people I know).</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s you, my hat is off to you. But if not, maybe you're more like me\u00a0\u2014you\u2019ve made some videos, it went okay, you know you can do better\u2026but it's easier to just save it for another day. (Or year.)</p>\n<p>My good friend James Wedmore dropped by the other day, and we started chatting about video, and before long I had to ask him if we could turn the conversation into a podcast interview. He has so much great stuff to share about why video is important, and how to make it really practicable for your business.</p>\n<p>James says that learning to connect with his audience on video changed his business and his life.</p>\n<p>Our interview was OUTSTANDING video tips and tricks.\u00a0I want you to listen to the whole thing so you don't miss any of it. I also want you to make sure to access the three-part FREE series he put together just for you on how to make great videos for your business.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s just a tease of what we covered:<br />\nFive Video Marketing Mistakes<br />\nShoddy camera work\u00a0</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to be Martin Scorsese or anything, but you do have to avoid those black bars on either side of your video\u2014they\u2019re a huge turnoff to your audience. (Easy fix: record video with your camera or phone held lengthwise, not up-and-down.) Other no-no\u2019s include shaky camera action, bad framing, and fuzzy focus.</p>\n<p>(If these no-no\u2019s are already breaking you out in hives, relax. All of these are easy, one-step fixes that James spells out.)</p>\n<p>Lighting</p>\n<p>Newer cameras and phones can correct for this, but it\u2019s worth it for everyone to learn how to set up quality lighting. The bedroom lamp is just not going to cut it. Nothing makes your video (and your brand) look instantly amateurish like bad DIY lighting. James gives the name of his favorite lighting kit that's cheap and reliable.\u00a0Click to listen.</p>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<p>James says stop using your in-camera microphone. Doesn\u2019t matter if you have the fanciest phone or DSLR out there\u2026the onboard microphones will not pick up quality audio and your beautifully shot video will either sound like it\u2019s coming from the bottom of a well OR sound like your grandmother shouting over a long-distance call.</p>\n<p>Again, just a little bit of cash outlay will get you a great-quality lapel microphone that connects into your camera or phone. Your audio will get instantly synched, and you\u2019ll be able to talk in your normal tone of voice without worrying that the mic isn\u2019t picking you up.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t Be Boring</p>\n<p>A lot of people protest that they can\u2019t do video because they aren\u2019t funny, they aren\u2019t loud, they can\u2019t talk fast, they aren\u2019t an extrovert.</p>\n<p>Well, guess what? You don\u2019t have to be any of those things to have an engaging video. As James puts it,<br />\n\"The opposite of boring doesn\u2019t mean funny.\"<br />\nWhat you do have to be, James says, is passionate. And\u2026well, just listen to what else he says. You\u2019ll have no reason to doubt your \u201cinterestingness\u201d ever again.</p>\n<p>Not Doing Video</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a rule that \u201che or she who has the most video wins.\u201d (In fact, it\u2019s definitely possible to do too much video, especially if you have no strategy.)

Gretchen says her research led her to discover that the really important first step in changing our habits is to begin by figuring out what is true for us.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we want to figure out how to change our habits, we have to figure out what\u2019s going on with ourselves and the change has to come from a true understanding of who we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\tIf there is something you are struggling with, ask yourself if there was a time in the past where you did a better job with this. Was there a time when it came easily to you? What was different? Why was it easy then and it\u2019s not easy now?</p>\n<p>\"A lot of times people, due to pressure, feel like they are failing because what all of the experts say should work doesn\u2019t work for them.\"</p>\n<p>\tGretchen points out one of the puzzling things about habits: it\u2019s easy to understand why we find it hard to make a habit of something we don\u2019t want to do, but it\u2019s often just as hard to make a habit of something we love! (And yes, she gives an answer to why this is the case.)</p>\n<p>\"The secret is to question all the ways you could think about setting it up so that it would work for you. You can find a way that will allow you to succeed and be the most productive and most creative, the healthiest.\"</p>\n<p>\tAccording to Gretchen\u2019s research, all people fall into one of four types when it comes to how you respond to expectation (your own or someone else\u2019s). Those types are upholders, questioners, obligers, and rebels. Knowing which one you are makes it a lot easier to know what it takes for you to come through on a commitment. (You can take this quiz at Gretchen\u2019s website to find out which type you are.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThe secret of adulthood is accepting yourself and expecting more from yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\tThe \u201cjust accept yourself\u201d message gets frustrating to people who are very progress-oriented. But the people in \u201cgrow, grow, grow\u201d mode eventually feel dissatisfied that they can\u2019t ever just be okay with themselves as they are. Gretchen talks about the mindset that allows all of us to strike a happy medium between these two.</p>", "duration": "57:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_76.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1442429948, "title": "#75: How to Launch \u2014 The #1 Project Management Method I Can\u2019t Do Business Without", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>If you\u2019ve been listening for a while, you've heard me mention the word Scrum. When you hear this word, you do one of two things:</p>\n<p>\tFeel your heart surge with pride and joy because, as a fellow Scrummer, you know how amazing this approach\u00a0is for running a small business.<br />\n\tScratch your head / do a Google word search / roll your eyes because you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about.</p>\n<p>Listeners in both these camps are going to love today\u2019s episode, because I\u2019m going to talk about this amazing project management method\u00a0and how it has revolutionized the way I get my business done.</p>\n<p>To start off, Scrum is not my own made-up word\u2014I got it from a book called Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time. (Sounds pretty good, right?)</p>\n<p>And basically, the concept of Scrum is just that: managing a team of employees and contractors in the smartest way possible.</p>\n<p>I used Scrum throughout the process of creating my newest product, \u201cWebinars That Convert.\u201d Basically, I set up a checklist of every single thing that needed to get done on this product\u2014from creation to promotion to sales to management\u2014and my team and I \u201cScrummed\u201d our way through it!</p>\n<p>Not coincidentally, it\u2019s the same checklist I used for promoting the Profit Lab last spring. That\u2019s why I\u2019m offering the same giveaway this week\u2014the step-by-step project plan checklist that puts all the chaos of a new product launch into sanity-saving order.</p>\n<p>This checklist goes hand-in-hand with today\u2019s topic\u2014download it and you\u2019ll be well on your way to Scrumming your first project.<br />\nWhy Scrum?\u00a0<br />\nThere are the four main ways that Scrum really helps my business reach its productive sweet spot:</p>\n<p>\tIt increases your team\u2019s speed to completion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My team is able to get through projects so much faster now that we use Scrum.</p>\n<p>\tIt highlights performance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Scrum approach really pays attention to the work people are getting done and gives them the ownership on that performance.</p>\n<p>\tIt creates cross-functional teams.\u00a0</p>\n<p>People are empowered to make decisions.</p>\n<p>\tIt fosters consistent communication.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is probably my favorite part of Scrum\u2014it allows us to make sure everything is working smoothly. When it\u2019s not we fix it instantly.<br />\nScrum for Small Businesses<br />\nThe book about Scrum was written with big corporations in mind, so I had to do a little tweaking to make it work for my small business.</p>\n<p>For instance, the Scrum team is made up of the product owner, the team, and the Scrum master.</p>\n<p>The product owner (that\u2019s me) takes the vision of the project and translates it into a backlog (that\u2019s the project plan checklist I put together).</p>\n<p>In a giant company, the product owner would handle the backlog all by herself. But I\u2019m lucky enough to have a small team of awesome employees that can help me develop the backlog. They\u2019re going to see things that I miss and have valuable input. And because it\u2019s a small team, it\u2019s a manageable number of voices contributing to the project vision.</p>\n<p>Next, the team develops the product or completes the project envisioned by the product owner. For me, that means delegating tasks to a couple of part-time employees and a slew of awesome contractors.</p>\n<p>Finally, there\u2019s the scrum master. That is the project manager. It can be a designated employee on your team, it can be a contractor, or it can even be one of your team who serves as scrum master temporarily for a particular project.</p>\n<p>Note: I do not think the project owner should be the scrum master. This is a surefire way to end up burned out. I definitely fell victim to burn-out in the past, whenever I tried to fill both of those roles.</p>\n<p>Hiring the role out is going to be better for you and for your team. Yes, you won\u2019t necessarily know what\u2019s going on at every minute of the day with your project, but take it from me: that is a beautiful thing.", "duration": "46:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_75.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1441862180, "title": "#74: Write Better Copy: Quick Tips for More Confident Communication", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>I know I have talked about copy many times.

Webinars offer a platform that lets you\u00a0connect with people on an entirely new, personal level you just don\u2019t get with\u00a0most marketing strategies.</p>\n<p>And what other marketing strategy can offer the opportunity for consistent on-the-spot revenue?</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve done successful webinars in the past and are looking to make even bigger revenue, OR if you\u2019ve never done webinars before or maybe have just\u00a0dabbled with them in the past, today is going to be quite a pleasant surprise.</p>\n<p>Starting with this number: $62,000</p>\n<p>As the title says, just three little webinar-related tweaks\u00a0made a $62,000 difference in my bottom line. I knew they'd have an impact, but the size of that number surprised even me.</p>\n<p>See, I knew\u00a0there were aspects of\u00a0my webinar strategy that could use a shot in the arm.</p>\n<p>\tI\u00a0wanted more sales generated from my\u00a0webinars<br />\n\tI wanted more people to show up live during my\u00a0webinars<br />\n\tI\u00a0wanted to attract a new audience and grow my email list with the webinars.</p>\n<p>Whenever you want to reach a new goal, you know some parts of\u00a0your strategy\u00a0are going to have to change. </p>\n<p>So I set to work making adjustments, starting with:<br />\nTweak #1: The Sales Page</p>\n<p>This might surprise you, but I always do a sales page for any promotion I put together. Where some people might drive webinar attendees\u00a0right to their product\u00a0order form, my style is to give people extra information, especially if they are on the fence.</p>\n<p>In the past we used to send people directly from the webinar to the sales page to read all about the product and then buy. But over time, we realized I wasn\u2019t getting as many sales on the webinar as I had thought I should.</p>\n<p>And that's how this simple tweak came about. I still use the sales page, but I'm using it smarter. That single change resulted in instant sales from the very next\u00a0webinar, as well as a bigger boost of those instant sales.</p>\n<p>(Click here to listen to the full episode and find out the simple\u00a0tweak that boosted instant webinar sales!)</p>\n<p>Tweak #2: More\u00a0Webinars During Promotion<br />\nI want to give a shout-out to a member of the mastermind I used to be in. He's the one who\u00a0suggested this tweak\u00a0to me.</p>\n<p>He said if webinars work really well for me, I should be capitalizing on that.</p>\n<p>This idea--do more of what's already working for you--was so simple, it was revolutionary.</p>\n<p>In the past, I'd do one webinar for each promotion. But at his suggestion, I stepped up my game.</p>\n<p>It took a while for this tweak to hit its stride. But once it did, I saw amazing results.</p>\n<p>Click here to sign up for a master class that shows\u00a0the exact steps that I take in my own business to create a webinar system.</p>\n<p>Tweak #3: Facebook Ads<br />\nThis is one I learned from my amazing coach, Todd Herman.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0found that when I'm running Facebook ads for a webinar promo to a cold audience that probably doesn\u2019t know much about me, that ad needs to look a whole lot different than an ad to a warm audience (my fan base, my own email list, or a retargeting list).</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<p>The warm-audience ad</p>\n<p>The warm-audience ad is more \"talky\" and personable. It has a lot more of my branding in it, in terms of colors and design. These people already know me and like me, so it plays on that familiarity we have.</p>\n<p>Compare that to...</p>\n<p>The cold-audience ad</p>\n<p>The cold-audience doesn't have\u00a0a lot of branding to it. The text is short, punchy\u00a0and\u00a0blatant: \"This is what we have going on, sign up here.\" Because this audience doesn't know me, I keep it much more generic.</p>\n<p>Find out more about how to tailor your Facebook ads to different audiences.

Click here to download it so you can get started right away!</p>\n<p>Should\u00a0I Pay to Join a Mastermind?</p>\n<p>There are lots of opportunities out there to join an existing mastermind for a subscription fee. I did this early in my business, and it was helpful...but Jaime says that the most valuable\u00a0masterminds don't involve money changing hands.</p>\n<p>\"Peer masterminds,\" as they're sometimes called, have these advantages over paid groups:</p>\n<p>\tYou have equal say to everyone else in the group--no single person is controlling it.<br />\n\tThey tend to last longer than paid subscription-based groups.<br />\n\tIt's easier to form true friendships with others in the mastermind.</p>\n<p>Should My Mastermind Only Have People from\u00a0My\u00a0Niche?</p>\n<p>Definitely not! Jaime is in a mastermind with a financial advisor, an internet marketer, and a professional sword swallower! What they do have in common is a high regard for systems and processes, and a\u00a0level of success that they're trying to reach.</p>\n<p>\"You have heard the quote, 'You are the average of the five people that surround you.'\u00a0We want the level of just about everyone else in the group to be about the same, or at least have different niches of what they can talk about. You want to make sure that\u00a0each person has an expertise that other people could use.\"</p>\n<p>It's also a good idea to\u00a0reach out to at least\u00a0one or two people who are way more experienced or profitable than you currently are. These people will raise the bar on the meetings and bring insight\u00a0that could take you months (or years!) to achieve. These people should be at the top of your list to invite to your mastermind...even if it's a little scary to reach out to them.</p>\n<p>\"If it scares you, that\u2019s a good thing. You are going to be creating something that you can have for three to five years.\u00a0This group could help your business make so much money.\u00a0Yes, you might be super scared to email them once. But what\u2019s the worst that will happen?\"</p>\n<p>What Happens in a Mastermind Meeting?</p>\n<p>You can organize a mastermind meeting in any way that makes sense, but here is the rough\u00a0outline that Jaime's mastermind uses:</p>\n<p>First 15 minutes: The group goes around on the call and shares their wins from the previous week.

In fact, the presentation constitutes no more than 15% of an entire, well-integrated webinar STRATEGY.</p>\n<p>A truly effective webinar strategy involves 5 Key Stages (planning, pre, live, post, automated), all of which MUST be executed in perfect harmony in order for cash to change hands at the end of your presentation.</p>\n<p>In short, a webinar isn\u2019t a single tactic, but an entire system with many moving parts, specific timelines, and delicate levers to pull.</p>\n<p>My webinar system\u00a0is so much more than just a set of slides pulled together in a presentation deck.</p>\n<p>Specifically,\u00a0my webinar system\u00a0includes strategic content designed to be precisely aligned\u00a0with\u00a0my paid program. \u00a0It also\u00a0includes a list building component, an email marketing plan, a technology strategy, a focus on scarcity and engagement, special Q&amp;A sessions to eliminate objections and so much more.</p>\n<p>And when everything lines up perfectly, your business grabs hold of an effective, efficient sales machine that acts as the backbone of your business and gives you the opportunity to grow, scale and automate at will.</p>\n<p>Myth # 2: Webinars are a TON of effort and involve too much expensive technology.<br />\nTrue.

It's the best way to\u00a0get your name out there, and to help people get to know you.</p>\n<p>Just ask Darren:<br />\n\u201cI have discovered over the years that when I go to a conference people come up to me and hug me and say, 'I love you!' I always wonder why because I have no idea who they are. But it\u2019s the regular contact, the personal aspect of blogging, that really helps people to like you. Then over time they come to trust you.\u201d<br />\nDarren says the key to writing an effective blog post is to focus on one of these three aspects--knowing, liking, and trusting--in each post that you write.</p>\n<p>And he points out a few simple ways to get it done:</p>\n<p>\tHelping\u00a0people know you</p>\n<p>Highly shareable content that gets your name out there where people haven\u2019t heard of you yet. This could be humorous imagery, inspiring quotations or informative infographics.</p>\n<p>\tHelping\u00a0people like you</p>\n<p>Personal stories, motivational content, anything that inspires empathy, emotion and a sense of belonging. This is also a great category to embed photos, audio or videos that helps you connect on a face-to-face level.</p>\n<p>\tHelping\u00a0people trust you</p>\n<p>How-to guides, case studies, even sharing mistakes you made in the past and what you learned from them. This is where you show readers that you know what you\u2019re talking about.</p>\n<p>Reinvent the SWOT Test</p>\n<p>Would you believe that when Darren started ProBlogger, he\u2019d only been an actual pro blogger\u00a0for less than a year? With so little experience under his belt, he was fearful of being called\u00a0out for not being a seasoned expert. (I\u2019m sure we can all relate to that!)</p>\n<p>But rather than let his inexperience hold him back, Darren used this\u00a0\u201cweakness\u201d to his advantage. He was transparent in his posts about aspects of blogging that he didn\u2019t understand yet or was just\u00a0learning about.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, the transparency was a big hit with his audience, and earned him even more followers.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo position myself as someone who was on the journey, maybe a few steps ahead of you but I still haven\u2019t gotten it all together, really resonated well with my audience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve run a SWOT test (strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats) on your blog, go back and reconsider the weaknesses and threats you found. They can actually be the ideal ways to differentiate yourself in your field. So many people out there position themselves as bulletproof experts, that your audience may find your \u201cinexperience\u201d very refreshing.</p>\n<p>Become a Title Master</p>\n<p>Darren leaves no uncertainty about the importance of titles:</p>\n<p>\"The title of your post changes the destiny of your post.", "duration": "42:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_69.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1438146325, "title": "#68: Planning a Foolproof Live Event with Rich Brooks", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>A lot of you have asked me if it's a good idea for you to start planning live events. You see the entrepreneurs\u00a0you admire staging weekend retreats where they get up and set their audience on fire with excitement, education and motivation. Maybe you've even been to one and thought \"Hey, I could do that!\"</p>\n<p>The short answer is Yes!\u00a0I started planning and participating in live events very early in my business, and while my inexperience made it a little terrifying at first, I couldn't deny the powerful boost it gave me--not just in terms of leads, but also in terms of confidence.</p>\n<p>That's why I invited Rich Brooks to join me on the show today.\u00a0Rich is a small business owner who just happens to be an event-planning powerhouse.\u00a0I asked Rich to let me pick his brain for\u00a0the fundamentals of planning a successful live event.</p>\n<p>The Who and the Why<br />\nIf you've ever attended Rich's amazing Agents of Change conference in Portland, Maine, it may surprise you to learn that his live event track record began with a simple lunch meeting.</p>\n<p>The purpose\u00a0of a live event isn't to wow everyone with your multimedia presentations and dynamic speeches. Those are great bells and whistles to add as you gain experience, but the real heart of a live event is to do four things:</p>\n<p>\tGet your name out there and establish your\u00a0credibility<br />\n\tDifferentiate yourself from competitors<br />\n\tGenerate leads for business<br />\n\tTurn a profit</p>\n<p>The more you work on your online marketing, the more you start to notice how crowded it is out there. It's getting harder and harder to get noticed in people's social media feed, no matter how valuable your content is. So why not get the edge on your competitors and take your message directly to your audience, face to face?</p>\n<p>Yes, it takes more time and effort to plan an event than to post something on Facebook. But, Rich says,<br />\n\"A\u00a0live event could be that thing that really separates you and raises you above all of the other people out there in your industry. If you are looking to kind of change up the way you engage with people, a live event may be the perfect thing for you.\"</p>\n<p>3 Phases\u00a0of a Live Event: Speakers, Sponsors and Seats</p>\n<p>Rich says that all live event planning boils down to these three phases.</p>\n<p>\tSpeakers -\u00a0Getting people to offer valuable content for\u00a0your audience<br />\n\tSponsors -\u00a0Getting\u00a0people\u00a0to contribute to\u00a0your audience's experience<br />\n\tSeats - Getting people to show up in your\u00a0audience</p>\n<p>First Things First - Who Is This For?</p>\n<p>Before you start worrying about getting people to show up (we'll talk about that later), spend some time thinking about who you want to show up. The key thing here is quality over quantity. Here's what Rich has to say about it:</p>\n<p>\"The #1 is that you are putting on an event for people. Who is this audience? What do they look like? Who is your avatar? What kind of information do they want to consume? What are they looking to accomplish? What are they looking to do?\"</p>\n<p>As in all other forms of marketing, you need to narrow in on your ideal audience member, and design the perfect event for them. I know it's counterintuitive, but being super specific\u00a0will actually help you attract more people.</p>\n<p>Once you know who you're planning this event for, you'll have a firm foundation to build on with the three phases.</p>\n<p>Phase 1: Speakers</p>\n<p>There are three main ways of attracting speakers to help lead your event:</p>\n<p>\tGet them to do it for free as a way to gain visibility.<br />\n\tPay them.<br />\n\tHave them pay you.</p>\n<p>If that last item made you do a double-take, considering that\u00a0many potential sponsors are eager to\u00a0be seen as thought leaders, and would love the chance to get up and present to your audience. (Too many of these type of speakers can kill an event, though, so limit it to one or two sponsors whose product or service would truly benefit your ideal audience.)</p>\n<p>Obviously,", "duration": "55:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode-68.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1437619960, "title": "#67: Should You Narrow Your Niche?", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Do you ever find yourself in the middle of a challenge with your business and wondering,</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did I get here\u2026again?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Nothing feels worse than the suspicion that you\u2019ve been spinning your wheels for the past month. (Or quarter. Or year.) The last thing we want is to get caught in a downward spiral, where we never get to overcome our struggles and rise past a certain level.</p>\n<p>But what if that spiral was actually going up, not down?</p>\n<p>I spoke with Nathalie Lussier, world-class digital strategist and email building expert, about this problem that confronts all of us: how to understand the recurring patterns in our business.</p>\n<p>Not only does she give some sage advice on how to deal with these patterns, but she shows how embracing them can actually help you build your business by narrowing your niche.</p>\n<p>We usually think of business strategy as being a line between Point A and Point B\u2026and measure our success by how straight that line is.</p>\n<p>But in real life, Nathalie says, the path is more like a spiral staircase. As we make our way up to the next level, we revisit the same issues, challenges and themes over and over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you come up against circumstances that make you think \u201cHow did I get here again?\u201d, flip the way you\u2019re looking at them. Even if it\u2019s the same issue, you\u2019re in a different place with it than you were six months (or even six weeks) ago.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, each time you revisit that same situation, you learn something a new and deeper lesson about it, which you can then pass on to your target audience. They\u2019re all climbing spiral staircases of their own, and they need your story to help them keep going.</p>\n<p>Three Things that Define Your Niche</p>\n<p>Whether you say \u201cnitch,\u201d or pronounce it \u201cneesh\u201d like Nathalie (who is French),\u00a0 you already know that digging deep into your niche is a cornerstone of your business\u2019 success.</p>\n<p>According to Nathalie, your niche is the sum of three things:</p>\n<p>\tYour topic<br />\n\tYour story<br />\n\tYour audience</p>\n<p>Each time you make another look on the spiral staircase, you go deeper into each aspect of your niche. Here\u2019s how:</p>\n<p>\tYour topic - Each \u201cspiral\u201d builds new expertise that narrows the focus of your business. It takes you from a broad category (\u201cI help people achieve better health\u201d) into a very specific component of that category (\u201cI offer natural healing methods that cure migraines in ten seconds or less\u201d).<br />\n\tYour story - Each \u201cspiral\u201d is a new chapter in your story, which creates new opportunities for connection with your audience.<br />\n\tYour audience - Each \u201cspiral\u201d lets you understand more about your own challenges and develops new strengths to overcome those challenges. As a result, you have renewed insight into who needs you the most.</p>\n<p>Narrowing Your Niche Helps You Build Your Audience</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to assume that it\u2019s better to go bigger in the beginning stages of your business, to collect as many people in your audience as possible, and then narrow your niche once you\u2019ve got a solid email list going.</p>\n<p>In fact, Nathalie recommends just the opposite: Go narrow in the beginning. Establish yourself as an authority in one very specific area, build a small but mighty email list, then unfold into new products and new ideas when you\u2019ve built the relationship with those clients.</p>\n<p>\u201c[When] people already know you as an expert in one thing, it\u2019s easier to add expertise in other topics.\"</p>\n<p>Narrowing Your Niche Helps You Say \u201cNo\u201d</p>\n<p>Narrowing your niche also helps you save a lot of time (and headache) by giving you opportunities to say \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p>When all you want is to build, network and grow, it can be terrifying to turn down opportunities. The problem is that every time you say \u201cyes\u201d to one opportunity, you have a little less energy to invest in all the other opportunities you\u2019ve agreed to.</p>\n<p>You have to decide ahead of time what the smart \"yes-es\" are,", "duration": "41:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode-67.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1436934010, "title": "#66: How to Get Your Business Back on Track", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>I started out this year\u00a0with a fully fleshed-out calendar.

I mean everything--creating content, training, phone calls, reading emails, writing emails. It's crucial to know how you've been spending your time.</p>\n<p>Step #2 - Perform a\u00a0Brain Dump</p>\n<p>Think ahead to the next six months, and write down\u00a0all of the things you need to get done. People to contact,\u00a0products to create, events to attend, blog posts\u00a0to write . . . I mean everything. (Warning--don't use this as an opportunity to come up with new ideas! This is just for what you've got in the works right now.)</p>\n<p>Step #3 - Identify the Revenue</p>\n<p>Now that you've got your list of six months into the future, take a highlighter pen and highlight every item on that list\u00a0that will\u00a0produce revenue for you, either directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how you can\u00a0successfully \"regroup.\"\u00a0Click here to listen to the full episode.</p>\n<p>Step #4 - Identify\u00a0Misspent Time</p>\n<p>Now take another highlighter pen in a different color, go back to the list you made in Step #1, and highlight the tasks that were either a big waste of your time or that you could have\u00a0delegated but didn't.</p>\n<p>Now go back to the Six Month list, take a third highlighter pen, and\u00a0highlight all of the things that you could either do farther into the future, or\u00a0that can be leveraged or delegated.</p>\n<p>Lots of highlighter action, I know. But this is all about identifying where you should and shouldn't be spending your time.</p>\n<p>Step #5 - Color Code Your Calendar</p>\n<p>I use Google calendar, which makes it very easy to highlight each entry in a certain color. The point is that to\u00a0have different colors for different categories--planning a project,\u00a0upcoming deadlines,\u00a0content creation,\u00a0podcasting, being interviewed with someone else,\u00a0even time\u00a0off or personal errands (like getting my hair cut).</p>\n<p>Once you do this, you can step back and see the big picture of your schedule. Where are your biggest blocks of time being spent? Is that enough, given what you know about your work flow? Are you spending enough of your week\u00a0doing the things you really love? After all, isn't that a big part of why we start our own business?</p>\n<p>Don't forget to download Amy's template that walks you through this whole exercise, step by step.

You now have a bird's-eye view of what your schedule really looks like.

She\u2019s a publicity expert (as well as a screenwriter and an actress), and if you read her own About page, you can see that she is an expert on how to write about yourself in a way that comes out warm, genuine and authentically irresistible.</p>\n<p>Why Is An About Page Important?<br />\nMelissa compares the About page to the gown a Hollywood actress wears on the \u201cred carpet.\u201d It\u2019s the way to show off both your importance\u00a0and your individuality at once, impressing people and engaging them at the same time. The About page is where you give people just enough information about you to want to know more.</p>\n<p>In other words, you don\u2019t want to give away the whole story on your About page\u2014it\u2019s their intro to all the excitement that awaits if they choose to work with you. For the reader, it should feel like they\u2019ve met you in person, looked you in the eye and shaken your hand.</p>\n<p>So how do you convey that feeling in words?<br />\nThink About How You Serve the World<br />\nRather than begin by talking about what you do, begin your About page with a line or two about why you do it. This\u00a0should be the element that guides you through the writing process for your About page. If you get stuck or are wondering if you are including the right kinds of details, ask yourself if what you\u2019ve written paints a picture of the world/society/lifestyle/change that you are trying to build with what you do.</p>\n<p>Hear more of Melissa's tips\u00a0on how to make your About page shine. Listen to the full interview here.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nMake Your Credentials Fun<br />\nIt\u2019s important to list the things that give your business credibility\u2014an advanced degree, an impressive title or certification, a number of years in your field or successful working relationships with noteworthy people. But rather than just list them, Melissa advises having fun with them! Try translating your credentials into an analogy that helps your audience understand what that kind of cred means in your industry. (\u201cI attended the Harvard of health coaching schools\u201d is a good example.)</p>\n<p>By listing your credentials this way, you can use your bragging rights to gain your readers\u2019 trust and build engagement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Show Your Non-Professional Side<br />\nWould it surprise you to learn that the part of your About page that really sells you is the part where you talk about something besides work? This, Melissa says, is what really seals the emotional connection with people and allows them to get to know you on a more personal level. Not only that, but this section is what sets you apart from your competition. Nobody else has the same story, the same style, the same lovable quirks and personal motivations that you have.</p>\n<p>As Melissa says in her \"Better Bio Challenge\" blog post,<br />\n\"Personal details aren\u2019t 'frivolous' \u2014 they anchor you in the reader\u2019s mind and showcase the 'person' behind the 'business.'\u00a0Try to include at least ONE little detail about your passions, guilty pleasures + personal life, in your bio \u2014 and you\u2019ll sparkle off the page, every time.\"<br />\nCounterbalance Your Accomplishments<br />\nIf your About page starts\u00a0feeling a little self-indulgent, Melissa says an easy way to lighten it up is to \u201cshow your brushstrokes.", "duration": "56:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_65.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1435839158, "title": "#64: A Backstage Pass to My Most Successful Launch Yet", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Two weeks ago, in Episode #62, I\u00a0reviewed the project plan I use for all of my promotions. And if you downloaded the free Project Plan Checklist that I offered, you might have had some questions about the bigger action items on that list.</p>\n<p>I'm going to break down some of those bigger items in upcoming episodes. Today, though, I'm going to walk you through some of the details that led to the overwhelming success of\u00a0this promotion.</p>\n<p>This blog post is going to be just a tease for the podcast, for the simple reason we cover a lot of ground in the audio version! If you haven\u2019t listened to this week\u2019s episode yet, I really encourage you to download and enjoy the whole thing.</p>\n<p>But for now, here are the basics:<br />\nLaunch in Review<br />\nMy recent launch of the Profit Lab was very different from past launches. I took some risks by changing things up and I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I was a little worried. But those risks paid off in a big way.\u00a0It turned out to be the most successful launch I've ever done, with sales just under a million dollars, and some amazing new insights that will make future launches just as profitable.</p>\n<p>Here's what really paid off this time:<br />\nConsistent Content<br />\nThis launch came during the most consistent year I\u2019ve had, in terms of offering free valuable content. Between my podcast, my blog, and the downloadable giveaways I offer each week, I was able to build a huge amount of affinity and trust with my audience. That really paid off when I started promoting my program for sale.<br />\nSurveying My\u00a0Audience<br />\nA few months before the promotion began, I put a survey out to learn more about my audience. (I talk about that survey in Episode #55, if you haven\u2019t checked it out yet.) That survey gave me immense insight into how my audience feels, what they need and, best of all, how they talk about those feelings and needs! When it came time to promote my program, I was able to speak their language better than ever.<br />\nA Targeted Giveaway<br />\nThe Product Maximizer, which I gave away a few weeks before the launch, was more than just a free download. It was targeted at the exact people that I knew would benefit from my program. I had over 7,300 people opt-in for that free giveaway. When it came time to promote the program, I got to speak to those 7,000 people in a different way than anybody else on my list, because I knew they would be keenly interested in exactly what I was going to offer.<br />\nEducating My Target Market<br />\nAnother pre-promotion I did was a live webinar series, where I taught on a topic related to the Profit Lab. The reason I did this was to help my target market understand what they truly needed for making more money online (i.e., a sales funnel). That gave me a perfect segue into selling my program, which is all about creating that sales funnel!<br />\nRebranding<br />\nThis year\u2019s Profit Lab had a brand-new look and a brand-new name. The name change was a risk, but I went for it and it paid off. And I think the facelift had a lot to do with that! Everything from the ads to the imagery to the course materials was done by one great designer. As a result, the whole thing had a very distinctive look that appealed to people who had never heard of my program, and renewed interest from people who had heard of it.</p>\n<p>Retargeted Ads<br />\nThis was the first time I\u2019d ever done this. Retargeting means running ads specifically to people who showed interest in a product but then didn\u2019t \u201cpull the trigger.\u201d In this case, it meant people who had visited a sign-up page for the free webinar I was offering, but then didn\u2019t register for it. I created retargeted Facebook ads to reach those people and encourage them to go back and sign up. For those who did sign up, I retargeted them with an ad that sent them directly to the Profit Lab sales page.</p>\n<p>There are so many more details of this launch that I want to share with you, including what worked and what didn\u2019t work so well,", "duration": "1:08:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_64.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1434739510, "title": "#63: How Podcasting Can Complement and Grow Your Business with John Lee Dumas", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Last year, one of my most popular podcasts was an interview with John Lee Dumas. But I invited him back this week because I wanted to talk about podcasting again, in a whole new way.</p>\n<p>Today, I want to focus on about podcasting for somebody who already has a platform.\u00a0Maybe you have a business with a blog. Maybe you have an online training program or course that you\u2019re constantly perfecting and promoting from one year to the next. Maybe you are a coach or consultant.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, you have something important to say. And maybe you\u2019ve been thinking the podcast thing seems to be growing even bigger, and might be a good way to help your business get bigger, too.</p>\n<p>Well, you\u2019re right. It is.</p>\n<p>No question, podcasting requires a fair amount of work, especially to get it all set up. But it can also be a huge boost to your business\u2019 visibility, to establishing your brand as a leader, and\u00a0 ultimately to your sales.</p>\n<p>John is a podcasting superhero. His show Entrepreneur on Fire is consistently ranked among iTunes\u2019 top business podcasts\u2014he even got a Best of iTunes recognition within his first year! More impressively, though, he puts out a new episode every day! (As in seven days a week\u2014no weekends off for this guy.) This makes him the perfect person to explain why podcasting is worth it, how he gets it done, and how he manages to stay fired up about it every single week.<br />\nWhy Should You Podcast?<br />\nAs entrepreneurs, we are always looking for other avenues to grow our audience. That\u2019s why we use Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, that\u2019s why we blog and send emails to our list. The podcasting sphere is just another way to reach more people\u2014a lot more people. iTunes has 525 million active subscribers, and SoundCloud, Stitcher and Spotify are catching up fast.</p>\n<p>Podcasters are an obsessive crowd\u2014they are constantly looking for new content to listen to during their commute, while walking their dog, while they\u2019re waiting at the airport\u2026you name it!</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the great thing about podcasting\u2014it doesn\u2019t require you to say \u201cno\u201d to something else, the way a lot of content does. In our multi-tasking culture, it\u2019s the perfect way to get your message heard and deliver free, valuable and consistent content to your audience.<br />\nWhat Kind of Work Is Involved?<br />\nThe great news is that you really don\u2019t have to create that much more work to keep a podcast going. You just repurpose content that you\u2019re already creating for one outlet into another outlet.</p>\n<p>To get started, simply go back to your best blog posts (or videos, or images, or even social media posts), the ones that got the best engagement, and turn them into a bullet point flow. Then switch on the microphone and talk your way through them. Beef it up by talking about what led you to create that piece of content. Talk some of the comments you received. Talk about what you liked best about it. Talk about how you feel toward that content now.</p>\n<p>By doing this, you\u2019re getting the attention of people who may never find you on Facebook, or who always mean to read your blog and just don\u2019t make the time to do it. You\u2019re getting them in the midst of their busy day, and becoming a familiar voice in their\u00a0 lives.</p>\n<p>How Do You Get It Done?<br />\nFirst let me assure you that you don\u2019t have to create a seven-day-a-week podcast for it to be a valuable tool in growing your business. But even recording once a week can feel daunting, especially when you\u2019re just getting into the groove, or you get sidelined by a busy week and suddenly realize that you\u2019re scheduled to post a new episode tomorrow.</p>\n<p>The key to getting it done is batch processing. This approach is one that will save your sanity, if you stick to it. And it all depends on one big thing\u2026<br />\nScheduling<br />\nThe key here, John says, is owning your schedule.

And what I know by now, more than anything, is that the key to making a sales plan work is having a proven, foolproof\u00a0system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So today, I'm going to walk you through my project management system, line by line.\u00a0This is one I've spent hours mapping out with my team. Some of it will be familiar to you, but it's in the little details that you'll find the most value--the tiny things that make your promotion polished, professional and, most importantly, effective.</p>\n<p>Another great thing about\u00a0putting together a promotion with this system is that it sets up your content to be \"evergreen\"--meaning you can use it over and over again to sell your product and build your business.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of content in this post and in the podcast. But don't worry. I've put together a special checklist for you, so that you can put all this information into action right off the bat.\u00a0No matter what kind of promotion you're planning,\u00a0this checklist has all the basic steps you need to make sure it launches successfully. Click here to download it instantly.</p>\n<p>I divide all my promotional planning into three categories:</p>\n<p>The Pre category is everything you do before the cart opens (i.e., your\u00a0product becomes available for\u00a0sale).</p>\n<p>The Live category is everything you do when the cart is open.</p>\n<p>The Post category is everything you do after the cart closes.</p>\n<p>I've launched promotions\u00a0in the past that I've had just a few weeks to pull together. As my business has grown, I've had more time to plan and prepare. But here's the thing: it's never enough time! Let me encourage you to always get started on this system earlier than you think. There will always be last-minute tasks that have you scrambling. That scramble will be a lot less stressful, the sooner you get started.\u00a0(Right now, I'm already starting on this system for a\u00a0promo set to launch in October!)<br />\nCategory #1: Pre-Promotion<br />\nAs you might guess, 80% of the work happens in the Pre phase. I\u2019ve broken them down into smaller categories, starting with\u2026<br />\nAdmin<br />\nThe cornerstone of Admin is making all your decisions in advance, getting organized and scheduled, so that when you \u201chit the red button\u201d for your launch, you can enjoy (mostly) smooth sailing through your promotion.</p>\n<p>\tOrganization</p>\n<p>The first thing we do might surprise you: we organize our Dropbox. We have a folder for everything\u2026no file floats alone. But\u00a0 I\u2019ll admit to being a little crazy about this, but let me tell you\u2014it saves you from going a lot crazier in the long run, wondering where those files are that you need to send to your designer so you can launch in two hours!</p>\n<p>\tConfirm and Document All Promo Dates</p>\n<p>Before getting started, I put each stage of the promotion down on the calendar. For example, in my recent Profit Lab promotion, I had to nail down when I\u2019d start running various Facebook ads, when I\u2019d release each promotional webinar, when the early bird pricing began and ended\u2026all of those little pieces are determined before anything gets started.</p>\n<p>\tSchedule Promotion Phases</p>\n<p>I have different phases in each of my promos. Phase 1 includes offering free content that warms up my target audience by offering value before I promote anything for sale. Remember the Product Maximizer from a few weeks back? That was a pre-promo content piece, scheduled for Phase 1. Phase 2 included free webinars that ended with a product pitch. Phase 3 was when the cart opened, so it includes lots of timely bonuses and heavy ad running to people who have shown interest. And the final phases are all about \u201cTake Action Now! Cart Closing Soon!\u201d<br />\nThese are my phases\u2014you\u2019ll have your own.

Pictures in particular--we\u00a0process them very quickly--faster than text, video, or\u00a0audio. Pictures allow us to\u00a0make a really quick decision about whether we are going to engage with something.</p>\n<p>It's no secret that some of the most successful brands in the world owe their popularity to their visual content strategy. Notice I said strategy--in other words,\u00a0not just any visual content will do.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, one of the world's biggest experts in visual social media and content strategy is also a good friend of mine.</p>\n<p>You probably know Donna Moritz already as the power behind Socially Sorted, the award-winning blog about using visual content on social media. I know her as my #1 student from the very first Profit Lab course I ever launched. She's also shown up on this site more than once--I interviewed her briefly a few weeks ago, and she created an amazing guest blog for me about Pinterest.</p>\n<p>But today, Donna is here to school me--and you--in how to set up a visual content strategy that supports your sales and sends your message.</p>\n<p>She's also put together an amazing freebie for us--a three-part video series that walks you through the process of creating polished imagery. This is where you'll learn how to use all the tools mentioned in this episode. Trust me--it's a must-have.</p>\n<p>Before she became the renowned expert she is today, Donna learned all the ins and outs of visual content strategy through simple practice. After working in several different businesses--sometimes for others, sometimes for herself--she saw how visual content really created that initial resonance with a target audience that makes them want to learn\u00a0more.</p>\n<p>The main thing with your visual content is to \"stop the scroll\"--in other words, arrest your audience's attention so that their finger pauses above their mouse or smartphone screen, and they take the time to engage with your message.</p>\n<p>The more Donna learned, the more excited she got about the potential\u00a0of various kinds of visual content. If you've ever felt overwhelmed by the sheer variety of visual content styles out there, don't worry--Donna is here to break it into three basic levels.</p>\n<p>1. Shareables</p>\n<p>These are the really easy-to-create, easy-to-share individual images that would be on Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram. Think\u00a0funny photos, behind-the-scenes shots, images that incorporate\u00a0quotes, tips or other short bits of text. They are really a good jumping-off point to lead into a longer message.</p>\n<p>Here is a sample batch of quote images, observational humor, business tips, questions and motivational images ready to go (and all created on Canva and WordSwag).</p>\n<p>These types of images are designed to increase reach and engagement.</p>\n<p>Shareable images get their strength from their simplicity. But that doesn't mean you can only use them for short, simple concepts. By attaching an image with a call to action or link, you can increase shares (such as retweets\u00a0on Twitter) and generate more\u00a0visits to your blog or other \"landing content.\"</p>\n<p>Also, remember that\u00a0tweets with images get retweeted twice as often...so post images!</p>\n<p>Remember, on all platforms, it is important to keep a balance of your own helpful and entertaining content, and curated content from other pages or businesses. This earns you the right to post some promotional images with calls to action.</p>\n<p>You can also work with your designer if you want to save time (and money) or can't design the images yourself. Ask your designer to create a template which you can then add text to.\u00a0 This way, you can create a series of quotes or tips using a great design, but reduce the cost and time involved in hiring a designer.

Just a few years ago, Facebook engagement looked very different. It\u2019s changing all the time. And maybe you've started to feel frustrated by the changes, or have just given up keeping track of them.</p>\n<p>I get where you're coming from, that feeling of angst every time Facebook adjusts\u00a0an algorithm. It can be daunting to keep up with Facebook's constant changing of its own rules. But Facebook is still a valuable place for you to gain traction for your business. That's why my\u00a0mission for you in this post is to help you understand what\u2019s working right now on Facebook, and how to make it work to your advantage.</p>\n<p>First, I want to tell you about the free download I have for you. I've collected 20 different posts from all over Facebook that I've seen capture maximum engagement--not just views, but likes, comments, and shares.</p>\n<p>On this free cheat sheet, I explain in a few words just what is so engaging about each post. Download this cheat sheet for free and use these posts\u00a0as rough guides for creating your own super-engaging Facebook content.</p>\n<p>To begin with, let's talk about why Facebook\u00a0engagement matters, starting with...</p>\n<p>The Facebook Definition of Engagement</p>\n<p>Facebook (or FB, as the kids call it) defines engagement in one way and one way only: fingers clicking specific buttons. If a fan doesn\u2019t engage with your post in at least one of five ways\u2014like it,\u00a0leave a comment,\u00a0share it with others, watch it, or click on a link\u2014it\u2019s not considered engagement by Facebook standards. Period. So what does non-engagement look like? Here are things that your Facebook fans may be doing that do not count as FB engagement:</p>\n<p>\tRead\u00a0your update.\u00a0Kind of makes you rethink how much time you spend crafting the perfect status, doesn't it?</p>\n<p>\tView your image. Photos, infographics, inspirational quotes,\u00a0etc. are great ways to grab attention, but simply having them seen does not constitute engagement.</p>\n<p>\tClick on a photo. If your photo is not linked (via OpenGraph or some other plug-in) to a specific site, all that will happen is that the photo will open in a bigger window. That's an opportunity to giving your reader yet\u00a0another\u00a0chance to engage...but in itself, FB doesn't count it as fan\u00a0engagement.</p>\n<p>\tLike your page.\u00a0You heard right. People liking your page doesn't affect engagement; it only counts when they like specific posts.</p>\n<p>Engagement from a Purely Relational Perspective</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how Facebook sees\u00a0engagement; let\u2019s explore what engagement might mean to you. When someone interacts with the content you have posted, they are expressing interest in you. That means your WHY, your meaning, your purpose. What do you do, and how do you do it? Don\u2019t sell yourself short. Your why and how are powerful stuff to people out there. If you are message driven, sharing what you care about in a true attempt to educate, entertain, or inspire people,\u00a0and those people communicate back to you or push it out to\u00a0the world\u2026\u00a0that is\u00a0a\u00a0reflection that you are\u00a0doing\u00a0something right!</p>\n<p>So Why Does\u00a0Engagement Matter?</p>\n<p>This is\u00a0where mindset\u00a0enters the picture. Mindset is what will connect\u00a0the dots for you between fan engagement (likes, comments, shares, and\u00a0clicks) and exposure to your business (such as getting your posts into your tribe\u2019s News Feed).

I met him way back in my corporate job days when my boss hired him to work his magic on a new sales letter for a product we were launching. That was when I saw the true power that words can have in generating sales and building a business. Since then, I decided to become a devoted student of copywriting, and a student of Ray\u2019s, in particular.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Ray loves teaching, and he\u2019s very generous with his expertise. You may remember him from way back in Episode 33, but I wanted to have him back to help you dive even deeper into the techniques of writing sales copy that gets results and comes from the heart.</p>\n<p>What Counts as\u00a0Copy?<br />\nRay often encounters confusion about what constitutes \u201ccopy\u201d\u2026how is it different from simply writing?<br />\n\"The first level is sales copywriting, which is the copy that is on the sales page\u2014where we ask people to press a button and buy something from us.</p>\n<p>\"On the other level, though, I believe that all writing is meant to persuade people either that they can do something, or that they should do something.\"<br />\nBasically, if you\u2019re writing something to either empower people so that they feel they can do something, or to persuade them that they ought to do something, you\u2019re writing copy.</p>\n<p>\u2026I\u2019d say that applies to just about everything I write for my business, wouldn\u2019t you?</p>\n<p>As our freebie for this week, Ray is graciously offering more than 100 email and headline templates that he uses for writing amazing copy every day. Click here to get them now!</p>\n<p>Why Is Persuasion So Important?<br />\nIn a perfect world, we could just say \u201cHere\u2019s what I have, it\u2019s good, buy it if you want to,\u201d and all the right people who need our product would click Purchase. But the thing is, we\u2019ve all become really smart, and really skeptical.</p>\n<p>Ray points out that even Apple isn\u2019t immune to the need for writing sales copy\u2014they\u2019re just so good at how they present it that we don\u2019t realize we\u2019re consuming their copywriting!</p>\n<p>Very few of us like thinking about \u201csales writing.\u201d It makes us think of smarmy used car salesmen, trying to con hardworking people out of their money. Ray is familiar with this aversion to copywriting, and here\u2019s how he explains the way to avoid sounding \u201csales-y\u201d:<br />\n\"I think people get confused about persuasion versus manipulation. I like to define the difference this way: persuasion results in you making a buying decision that you will celebrate later; manipulation leads to you making a buying decision that you will regret later.</p>\n<p>\"The key to guiding your clients toward a decision they will celebrate is\u2014no surprise\u2014knowing your clients really well! You think of the problem that you\u2019re solving, and you write about it from the perspective of the person who has the problem, and you describe their pain. Someone once said that the more accurately you can describe the pain of the person you\u2019re selling to, the more they feel as though you automatically have the solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>\"There\u2019s plenty of brain science that tells us that almost all, if not all, of our decisions are made emotionally. All the rationale that we come up with is to support the emotional decision that we\u2019ve already made. If you can just support the emotions that they\u2019re feeling, and you can do it with integrity\u2014you really do have the solution\u2014then you don\u2019t really ever have to sell hard, or even push to sell. You just give the persuasive story of why what you have is going to help them, and they\u2019ll make a buying decision.\"<br />\nWhew.

Instead, they are looking for just a single, useful suggestion. Something they can take action on and see results.<br />\nIn advertising firms, they refer to this as the Rule of One--focusing\u00a0on one powerful emotion within your reader.<br />\nToo many ideas sends the reader\u2019s mind in too many directions. You can use any number of different stories, predictions, statements or promises, but they all have to support that one\u00a0Big Idea that your reader will grasp immediately.<br />\nHere are a few classic examples of headlines that use\u00a0the Rule of One:</p>\n<p>\t\u201cIs the Life of a Child Worth $1 to You?\u201d<br />\n\t\u201cWhen Doctors Feel Rotten, This is What They Do\u201d<br />\n\t\u201cHow I Improved My Memory in One Evening\u201d</p>\n<p>When you stick with this Rule of One, it makes the copy stronger AND it makes writing the rest of the sales letter easier.<br />\nLearn how to use\u00a0the Rule of One in our free guide--click here to download it now!</p>\n<p>#2: You need to provoke emotion.<br />\nStrange but true fact:\u00a0people respond to emotion before they respond to reason.</p>\n<p>So you need to grab your readers' attention by appealing to their\u00a0current emotions.

I invited you to throw all your\u00a0questions about online marketing at me! What do you want to know? Where are you stuck? What are you confused about?</p>\n<p>Well, the overwhelming majority of the questions people posted on my Facebook page were\u00a0about--surprise!--Facebook. And the questions showed me that it's time for a major reframing of how we\u00a0think about Facebook. Most people are just not looking at Facebook in a way that's going to serve them.</p>\n<p>And since my mission is to help you get results with your online marketing, including your Facebook marketing, we\u2019ve got to address that...stat!</p>\n<p>The Facebook System that Changes Everything!</p>\n<p>\tLarissa asks:</p>\n<p>\"How do I increase my FB followers? It seems I have hit a plateau. Also, I don\u2019t want to spend copious amounts of money with FB ads\u2026I feel they keep changing the algorithm to line their pockets by making you pay for advertising through them, and no one will see your post.\"<br />\nIf you feel this way about Facebook ads, then I\u2019m guessing they haven\u2019t been working for you. And believe me, I don't want you using Facebook ads if you're not generating revenue.</p>\n<p>This is where we need a reframe. I want to help you see FB as a place where putting in a little bit of money will result in bringing back a lot of money.</p>\n<p>The first thing to realize is that\u00a0Facebook ads cannot work on their own. You have to incorporate them into a\u00a0social media sales funnel--a system that\u00a0turns your fans and followers into subscribers to your email list, and turn those names into paying clients.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I know lots of people who make money every week from Facebook ads, but they aren't just using that ad to send people\u00a0to their sales page. They're using those ads as part of their\u00a0sales funnel system. That\u2019s the key to getting the Facebook marketing results you\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<p>(I'm actually doing a free master class on this very topic right now.

This is happening to everyone. Free organic reach is way, way down. No matter how many Likes you have on your page, it\u2019s entirely possible that very few of your fans are seeing your posts!</p>\n<p>This causes a lot of people frustration\u2014why should I have to pay to get my fans to see my posts? I won't sugarcoat it--these changes to Facebook's algorithm do kind of suck for people who have worked hard to build their Facebook following.</p>\n<p>You could get frustrated and abandon ship...or you could start to look at Facebook differently.</p>\n<p>Paying will get your posts seen by more people...so you want to make sure that they're seeing something that makes them want more.</p>\n<p>To get your fans to engage\u2014sign up, respond, make a purchase, take any kind of action\u2014you have to make sure you're offering them\u00a0something they see as valuable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Toni\u2019s case, it might be a discount, free shipping, an add-on product.

Something so critical it can actually make or break your online business dreams.</p>\n<p>I'm talking about what\u00a0you believe regarding\u00a0your ability to achieve success in your business.</p>\n<p>Now before I dive into these 3 things that you have to believe in order to see the results you are yearning for, we need to dip a toe into psychology first.</p>\n<p>The thing about belief is that it\u2019s one of the few things that you can\u2019t be taught to do. You and I both know that you don\u2019t just flip a switch to believe something. That\u2019s because belief is not an outward action that you take; instead, it\u2019s a state of your inner being.</p>\n<p>I can teach you how to do a lot of things, but I can\u2019t teach you to believe.</p>\n<p>Because belief is such an individual experience, it\u2019s important from the outset to identify how you most often come to believe something for yourself.</p>\n<p>Do you believe\u2026</p>\n<p>\tBased on your own experience<br />\n\tBased on the experience of others<br />\n\tJust by acting \u201cas if\u201d<br />\n\tBecause it seems to make sense\u2014logically or intuitively<br />\n\tBy trusting a mentor<br />\n\tHaving an \u201caha moment\u201d<br />\n\tThe opposite hasn\u2019t worked for you</p>\n<p>It's okay if you need to think about this and can\u2019t answer right away. Maybe there are even several answers to how you believe, not just one on the list. It\u2019s just something to keep in mind as we continue talking about the three critical beliefs you need to have for success in your business.<br />\nThe 3 Beliefs You Must Have to Achieve Success in Your Business<br />\nBelief #1 - I believe that one of the biggest strengths in my business is knowing my target market intimately. Knowing how they think, what they need, and what words and emotions they use to express themselves is crucial to my success.</p>\n<p>Belief #2 - I believe that I am not alone, shipwrecked on a desert island needing to have all the answers myself. I thrive and my business thrives with a few core mentors that I trust and can turn to again and again.</p>\n<p>Belief #3 - I believe I have a great idea (product/service) that will impact people\u2019s lives, and that my idea needs a clear and easy-to-navigate system to generate sales.</p>\n<p>Whew\u2026how did that feel? Chances are that at least one of these beliefs\u2026and maybe all three\u2026felt like a big effort for you to even read, let alone internalize.</p>\n<p>Maybe it felt too audacious, too daring, to really own those beliefs for yourself. \u201cI\u2019d like to believe those things, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m really the kind of entrepreneur she\u2019s talking about here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe you felt skeptical. \u201cYeah, down the road maybe I\u2019ll believe those things, if things work out well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe you\u2019ve just lost so much confidence in the past few months that reading those beliefs made you even more hopeless. \u201cI wish I believed those things\u2014I used to believe them.

Everything you do online is content. </p>\n<p>A Facebook post counts as a content piece, whether it's video or words or simply an image. So does a tweet. An\u00a0email (whether to your whole list or just a segment of it), the text and imagery on your landing page, a free giveaway, a podcast, a thirty-minute webinar...</p>\n<p>You get the idea.</p>\n<p>We all have our favorite places to post content. Maybe you're Twitter-happy and can post 140-character quips all day long. Or maybe you love doing quick video updates from wherever you happen to find yourself.</p>\n<p>So don't worry if you're not the world's most prolific blogger. If you're making your voice heard\u00a0online, you're creating and posting\u00a0content, and you are ahead of the game.<br />\nConsistency Is Key</p>\n<p>This is one thing I have learned from all of my mentors: the people that are most consistent in terms of posting content beat out the competition in reaching any given market.</p>\n<p>This is because consistency is one of the primary ways you earn the trust and respect of your target market. They come to rely on hearing from you every two days, or every other Thursday, or whenever it is that your regular updates take place. It's less important\u00a0how often it is, and more important that it happens on a regular basis. I'll say it again: Consistency is Key.</p>\n<p>Believe me, I know how hard this can be. It seems like every time I get on a roll with posting content regularly, a product launch derails my schedule and all of a sudden I'm scrambling to come up with new content.</p>\n<p>For me, the key to being consistent is batching.

I make new videos, I rewrite the worksheets, all that good stuff.</p>\n<p>This year, as I\u2019ve been getting this product ready for launch, I wanted to make sure I was truly connecting with my target audience. After you\u2019ve had some success with a product, it\u2019s easy to start coasting on that success, which means you stay the same while your audience continues to grow and change and develop new needs. Not my style. \u00a0;-)</p>\n<p>To find out more about my target market, I needed to find out:</p>\n<p>\tWhere they are at, in terms of their business goals and growth.<br />\n\tWhat they needed from me<br />\n\tWhere they were struggling, not just in their business as a whole but with the versions of the Profit Lab I\u2019d released before.</p>\n<p>Knowing all this was going to help me tailor this new version of the Profit Lab into exactly what my target audience desperately needs right now.</p>\n<p>So I put together a survey. And the responses knocked my socks off!</p>\n<p>The thing is, I knew who my target audience was, but I didn\u2019t really know them the way I thought I did. The survey gave me a chance to understand how they think, what kind of language they use, what keeps them up at night, and why they come to me as opposed to anybody else in the online marketing world.</p>\n<p>I learned so much from this experience of surveying my audience that I wanted to share some of those insights with you\u2026how to create a survey that gets you into the minds and hearts of your target audience, so you design, redesign or market your products in direct response to their needs.</p>\n<p>The result of this will be that you sell more of your products to them.</p>\n<p>And don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re just starting out and your list isn\u2019t that big yet.

Click here to download it now!</p>\n<p>First Step: Design Your Questions<br />\nRemember, your survey isn\u2019t a Gallup poll. You\u2019re probably not trying to find out whether your audience is in their 20s or their 50s, if they are male or female, or other information like that. So before you start drafting questions, take a minute to think about what your survey is really trying to find out about your target market.</p>\n<p>We all know that endless surveys with loads of questions get really, really boring. And you want to steer clear of that with your survey. So make sure that your questions are all focused on the goal of learning something specific about your target market that relates to the product you\u2019re offering them.</p>\n<p>You want to include bigger picture questions that give you a clearer picture of who they are and how they define success, as well as more focused questions, such as what products/services in your niche they're already using, and what specific needs do they have that aren't being fulfilled?</p>\n<p>To get more in-depth\u00a0guidance on how to design your survey questions, click here for\u00a0the full episode.<br />\nSecond Step: Get People Engaged<br />\nObviously, the first step in the survey process is putting together something that they will agree to participate in.</p>\n<p>While it never hurts to offer an incentive to entice people to take your survey, it\u2019s a lot more effective to create a survey that is as painless as possible.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular opinion,", "duration": "58:23", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_55.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1428570054, "title": "#54: The Secret Mindset Shifts For Success With Ramit Sethi", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>I hope you\u2019re buckled in, because my guest this week is an online business expert who is renowned for \u201ctelling it like it is.\u201d Ramit Sethi is a master communicator who pulls no punches. When it comes to sheer mental confidence, there's no one quite like him in the online marketing world.</p>\n<p>As a result, he\u2019s had massive success in developing products that get huge results for his clients. His secret to developing these products is just one of the things we discussed in our interview. Our conversation was\u00a0a great mix of lessons on mindset and tactical product creation strategies.</p>\n<p>You\u00a0should really listen to the whole interview, because there's way too much to fit into a blog post. But here are some of the highlights:<br />\nRedefining a Rich Life<br />\nRamit\u2019s landmark book is called I Will Teach You To Be Rich. But the strategies he teaches in this book and elsewhere aren\u2019t aimed exclusively at people who want to blow $5,000 on a weekend in Vegas (but if that's your jam, Ramit thinks it's great!). Ramit says that the rich life is different for each person. For many of us, a rich life simply means being able to work from home, take our kids to work with us, building a business where money is automated and we can focus more time on the things we love.</p>\n<p>In other words, money is an important part of having a rich life, but money is not the whole picture.</p>\n<p>No matter how you define a rich life, Ramit says it all comes down to just a few big \u201cwins.\u201d If you get just five or ten of these wins, you don\u2019t have to sweat the small stuff, and you can focus more on the things you really love.<br />\nHow Fear Will Hold You Back<br />\nRamit talks candidly about the toxic influence of fear, which gets in the way of achieving these big wins. You\u2019d never know it to hear him talk now, but Ramit himself struggled a lot with fear in the early days of starting his online brand.<br />\n\"I had been writing my blog for about two or three years and I had never made a cent. I didn\u2019t want people to think I started my blog just as a way to make money because that was never the intention. I was absolutely petrified that people would not buy it or, even worse, that they would call me a sell out. You can see it in the sales copy that I wrote. The way I wrote that sales copy was so cowardly. I literally said, 'Why should you pay for this? I know you can find a lot of stuff for free.' My self confidence was so low that anyone would buy it that \u2026 I literally tried to defend it before they even bought.\"<br />\nBut people did buy it. And they thanked Ramit for putting his information out there. What\u2019s more, those buyers ended up opening his emails, joined other courses he offered, and took action on the things he taught them.<br />\n\"The real people, the people I actually wanted to focus on, were buying and they were delighted to pay.\"<br />\nIn other words, Ramit had found his target market. (Want to listen to the entire interview? \u00a0Click here now!)<br />\nLearn to Fail Well<br />\nIf you read Ramit\u2019s blog, you\u2019ll find a tag in it labeled \u201cFailures.\u201d This is where Ramit keeps an ongoing log of the things he has tried that haven\u2019t worked out. Believe it or not, even go-getters like Ramit crash and burn sometimes. He even told me about one occasion, not that long ago, where one of his courses had a flaw in it so bad that within an hour of releasing it online, he was getting refund requests from people who had just purchased it!</p>\n<p>Ramit says he has trained himself to look at failures not as catastrophes, but as tests. Every failure reveals data, he says, and every bit of data you get is pointing you in the right direction.</p>\n<p>In the situation above, if he\u2019d simply decided his course didn\u2019t work and then moved on to the next one, that would really have been a waste of time, effort and resources. Instead, he took it as a test of the course\u2019s weak points, found the problem, fixed it, added some new material,", "duration": "50:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode-54.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast", "Podcasting"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1427846341, "title": "#53: How to Discover Your Calling with Jeff Goins", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Today\u2019s topic is very near and dear to my heart.</p>\n<p>We are talking about how to find\u00a0your calling--what you were put on this earth to do.</p>\n<p>Even those of us with jobs we love can sometimes feel unclear on whether we're really making the best use of our talents and utilizing our passions to the fullest. Even I find myself in this place sometimes, wondering if I'm on the right track or if certain decisions or circumstances are causing me to veer off course.</p>\n<p>I know there are a lot of you out there who feel this way. You have talent to burn, and dreams of putting\u00a0your best out into the world. Some of you are hustling hard every day to make those dreams a reality.

Instead, he\u00a0offers\u00a0beautiful stories of real-life people that have found their calling in a multitude of different ways. He gets into the\u00a0day-to-day stuff that, if you pay attention, helps you discover what your calling is.</p>\n<p>This was such a great\u00a0interview, you should really just listen to it on the podcast. But I'll give you\u00a0a few highlights from my talk\u00a0with Jeff:<br />\nWhat\u00a0Is a \"Calling,\" Exactly?<br />\nContrary to popular belief, your calling is not the same thing as\u00a0your passion. Passions change as we mature, learn what really matters to us, and refine our understanding of what kind of impact we want to have on the world.</p>\n<p>Calling has more to do with purpose. Jeff says it's not a single moment of sudden understanding; it's more a lifestyle, a constant evolution of understanding what you're here for.</p>\n<p>It's Never Too Late<br />\n...Or, as some of you may be dreading to ask, when is it too late for a person to find their calling?</p>\n<p>If you've been in the same line of work for a while, it's easy to think that you're stuck in the track you've created, and that your current job is simply your \"default\" calling. Maybe you feel like you wasted your past, that the opportunity to really take hold of your purpose has passed you by.</p>\n<p>Jeff says that couldn't be farther from the truth. In fact, he tells me the story of how he found his calling as a writer after being quite well established in a marketing career.</p>\n<p>I wanted to change my life. I was one of those people who had one job, and it was a good job. I kind of felt guilty for not loving it. But I wanted something else.</p>\n<p>Jeff says that one of the biggest things he learned from the interviews in The Art of Work is that\u00a0your\u00a0past prepares\u00a0you for what is to come. You can use everything as an apprenticeship for what is coming next. He calls this listening to your life. Everything about where you've been up to now--the passions you've had, the failures you've experienced, the opportunities you did or didn't take--can help you figure out the larger purpose is in your life.

I've been seeing instant traction when I post a video on my page, much more than a post with a static image.

It\u2019s called \u201cThe Anatomy of High-Converting Paid Ads.\u201d Get it by clicking here now.</p>\n<p>There are three main types of ads that you can and should be using now:<br />\nNative ads<br />\nA native ad is an advertisement that sends people to a piece of content (as opposed to a direct opt-in form or sales page). It could be a blog post, a video, even show notes from a podcast.</p>\n<p>The great\u00a0thing about native ads is that they contribute to your brand\u2019s total value. They put helpful content out into the world that adds value right off the bat, in addition to pointing to other things (your program or service) that can be of even more value.</p>\n<p>When people end up on your content page, that\u2019s where you can introduce an opt-in form, a lightbox or some other kind of offer for your program or service. Just make sure it\u2019s relevant to the content that you\u2019ve sent them to.</p>\n<p>They also allow you to retarget people who visit the content that your ad is pointing toward, and put them on a separate list from your regular email list.</p>\n<p>This separate list that comes from native ads is what we call a \u201cwarm list\u201d\u2014it lets you know a very specific interest group within your list. So if you\u2019re running a native ad for a particular program or service and people click on it, you know that next time you promote that same program (or a similar one), those are definitely people that you should retarget.</p>\n<p>Retargeting is also something you need to know about for our next kind of paid advertising:<br />\nFacebook ads<br />\nAround here, we talk a lot about Facebook ads. The fact is that Facebook changes its setup all the time, and what worked six months ago or even six weeks ago may have changed dramatically. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to be consistently checking out Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions for ads. Check the help pages to stay current with the rules, so that you know your advertising isn\u2019t going to get pulled out from under you!</p>\n<p>These days, Facebook\u2019s foundation for advertising is a lot like the native ads we just talked about...ads have to add value\u00a0to Facebook users.\u00a0In other words, the less salesy you can be with your ad, the better.</p>\n<p>To be honest, this change benefits you as the business owner\u2014running an ad that leads to a blog post is a lot cheaper in what you pay per click, versus running an opt-in page ad. It also builds trust with your users. They click on your ad, get to a page of real, valuable content, and they feel good! That\u2019s something that people will keep coming back for.</p>\n<p>Retargeting comes into play when you set up your Facebook page to target who you want to be tracking and what pages you want to track. That way, you can build a specific list from\u00a0anybody coming to any page o...", "duration": "42:23", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_50.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1425443094, "title": "#49: How to Know If Your Idea is Profitable", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Today\u2019s post reminds me why I love doing this podcast so much. Not only is the material great, but it comes from two of my favorite people\u2014a power couple in the online marketing world.</p>\n<p>Their names are Joshua and Jill Stanton and together, they run a business called Screw The Nine To Five where they teach people who are dissatisfied with their day-to-day\u00a0jobs how to take their skills and transform them into a self-run online business.</p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re well on your way in creating your online business, just getting started, or even simply circling the waters trying to decide whether to get your feet wet, this post is tailor-made for you. It\u2019s all about mining the raw material from which online businesses are built, and crafting it into the cornerstone of your success.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs are an idea-happy bunch. You probably have tons of ideas swimming in your head right now. Maybe you\u2019ve even grown used to hearing people say \u201cThat\u2019s crazy\u201d or \u201cWow\u2014that\u2019s going to take you a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s never a good idea to pay much attention to the naysayers.\u00a0The fact is that nearly every idea is a good one, if you can figure out how to make it profitable. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s where Jill and Josh come in. They are showcasing some of their concrete strategies for determining any idea\u2019s profitability.</p>\n<p>Actually, we\u2019ve condensed their strategies into a series of four step-by-step tests that you can run any idea through.</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert\u2014those tests are today\u2019s free download. Click here to get it now.</p>\n<p>Josh and Jill have been making money online for quite a while, but their spunkily named website came about after they were\u00a0asked repeatedly how they did it. They decided to start a program specifically for training others to do the same thing they did--a place where they could just send everyone asking their advice.</p>\n<p>Ever since, they've been helping people see how they can translate their day job skills into an online job that\u00a0generates\u00a0way more income in way less time. In other words, you don't have to learn a brand new skill set in order to start an online business. You simply take what you know and strategically\u00a0build a business around it.</p>\n<p>The \"strategic\" part is where we can all use Josh and Jill's expertise. Because of course you need to see whether your idea for how to translate your skills to your own business has wings...or not. Odds are it does, but it's not going to be a get-rich-quick situation. However, if you put the passion and hustle and hard work into it, you'll be amazed\u00a0what you can do online.</p>\n<p>I can speak to this personally. Back when I was working my own 9-to-5, I was dreaming of starting my own online business but resigned to the fact that\u00a0none of my knowledge would translate into the outside world.</p>\n<p>All it took was a good friend who reminded me that I worked in marketing...something every\u00a0online business needs to know how to do well. I was sitting on a gold mine.</p>\n<p>You might be, too. Here are the four tests that will help you find out.</p>\n<p>Test #1: Udemy.com</p>\n<p>This is best\u00a0suited to people who might want to sell digital products or programs. Udemy\u00a0is an online learning marketplace. They have five million customers and they have digital products and programs ranging from everything from crocheting to IT. In other words, there's\u00a0a lot of opportunity here.</p>\n<p>I have to say, it's pretty great that there is a resource like Udemy, where you can simply\u00a0go and see if somebody else is currently making money with your course idea. It\u2019s that simple.</p>\n<p>Test #2: Amazon.com</p>\n<p>This, again, is best suited to digital products and programs. But you can also use it if you want to start a service-based business. It\u2019s not limited to information products. As you may know, people can skew their Amazon ratings by canvassing\u00a0their audience to buy books or post reviews at certain key periods of time.

On one hand, still no flying cars.

It\u2019s changing all the time. Just a few years ago, Facebook engagement looked very different. And maybe you've started to feel frustrated by the changes, or have just given up keeping track of them.</p>\n<p>I get where you're coming from, with that. It can be daunting to keep up with Facebook's constant changing of its own rules. But Facebook is still a valuable place for you to gain traction for your business. That's why my\u00a0mission for you in this post is to help you understand what\u2019s working right now on Facebook, and how to make it work to your advantage.</p>\n<p>First, I want to tell you about the free download I have for this week. I've collected 20 different posts from all over Facebook that I've seen capture maximum engagement--not just views, but likes, comments, and shares.</p>\n<p>On this free cheat sheet, I explain in a few words just what is so engaging about each post. Download this cheat sheet for free and use these posts\u00a0as rough guides for creating your own super-engaging Facebook content.</p>\n<p>To begin with, let's talk about why Facebook\u00a0engagement matters, starting with...</p>\n<p>The Facebook Definition of Engagement</p>\n<p>Facebook (or FB, as the kids call it) defines engagement in one way and one way only: fingers clicking specific buttons. If a fan doesn\u2019t engage with your post in at least one of four ways\u2014like it,\u00a0leave a comment,\u00a0share it with others, or click on a link\u2014it\u2019s not considered engagement by Facebook standards. Period. So what does non-engagement look like? Here are things that your Facebook fans may be doing that do not count as FB engagement:</p>\n<p>\tRead\u00a0your update.\u00a0Kind of makes you rethink how much time you spend crafting the perfect status, doesn't it?<br />\n\tView your image. Photos, infographics, inspirational quotes,\u00a0etc. are great ways to grab attention, but simply having them seen does not constitute engagement.<br />\n\tClick on a photo. If your photo is not linked (via OpenGraph or some other plug-in) to a specific site, all that will happen is that the photo will open in a bigger window. That's an opportunity to giving your reader yet\u00a0another\u00a0chance to engage...but in itself, FB doesn't count it as fan\u00a0engagement.<br />\n\tLike your page.\u00a0You heard right. People liking your page doesn't affect engagement; it only counts when they like specific posts,</p>\n<p>Engagement from a Purely Relational Perspective</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how Facebook sees\u00a0engagement; let\u2019s explore what engagement might mean to you. When someone interacts with the content you have posted, they are expressing interest in you. That means your WHY, your meaning, your purpose. What do you do, and how do you do it?</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t sell yourself short. Your why and how are powerful stuff to people out there. Knowing about you is reward in itself.</p>\n<p>If you are message driven, sharing what you care about in a true attempt to educate, entertain, or inspire people,\u00a0and those people communicate back to you or push it out to\u00a0the world\u2026\u00a0that is\u00a0a\u00a0reflection that you are\u00a0doing\u00a0something right!</p>\n<p>So Why Does\u00a0Engagement Matter?</p>\n<p>This is\u00a0where mindset\u00a0enters the picture. Mindset is what will connect\u00a0the dots for you between fan engagement (likes, comments, shares, and\u00a0clicks) and exposure to your business (such as getting your posts into your tribe\u2019s News Feed).</p>\n<p>The equation is simple: Boost your engagement (likes, comments, shares, & clicks) and get rewarded.</p>\n<p>See, the more often your fans engage with you in the ways listed above, the more often your posts will be pushed out into th...", "duration": "45:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_48.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Engagement & Community", "Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1424357055, "title": "#47: How to Gain Confidence, Increase Productivity, and Move Toward Mastery Each Day", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>If you\u2019re anything like me...or if you're just human...you have faced your share of\u00a0challenges and fears in the process of growing your own business.

They're a place for you to record\u00a0the day-in-the-life of your brand, to explore new possibilities\u00a0and take the occasional\u00a0look back to see how far you've come. This is precisely what makes\u00a0your blog\u00a0the primary place where brand loyalty is fostered. Your posts allow\u00a0your audience to come along with you and experience\u00a0the development of your brand as it happens. Ideally, your blog is\u00a0your audience's closest connection to you. That's why it's a good idea to step back now and then to reexamine your blog. Even\u00a0if you've had a blog for a long time and your subscriber numbers are strong, it's always a good idea to find ways to breathe new life into it. Don't worry--I'm not talking about\u00a0a whole new site redesign. There are lots of simple, no-cost ways to tweak, amplify and expand your blog's potential, making it more valuable for subscribers to read...and more streamlined and effective for you to use.  To help us really understand what launches\u00a0a blog from good to great, I've invited master blogger, Mike Stelzner, to share his insights and tips. If you don\u2019t know Mike Stelzner yet, he\u2019s the founder of Social Media Examiner, the world\u2019s largest social media magazine, and the host of the top-rated podcast \u201cSocial Media Marketing.\u201d Mike and I go way back\u2014he offered me my first paid gig when leaving my corporate job. That feels like a lifetime ago, but in reality, it was just a few shorts years ago! You\u2019ll\u00a0also learn about a really cool way to make sure that all of your blog posts look fantastic when they are shared on Facebook. \u00a0This is SO CRUCIAL to attracting new visitors to your blog!

Here are just a few of the things we talked about in my recent podcast episode:<br />\nChoosing Content<br />\nSocial Media Examiner churns out huge amounts of quality content in the form of long, newsy blog posts\u2026every single week! How do they choose what to blog about?<br />\n\u21d2\u00a0Run smart surveys<br />\nAs of my conversation with Mike, Social Media Examiner was producing their 2015 survey to find out how marketers are using social media to grow their businesses. It\u2019s coming out soon!\u00a0You'll learn about trends in mobile optimization and social integration,\u00a0which\u00a0content categories and social platforms to prioritize, and what to expect from the future of social media marketing. (If you can\u2019t wait until the 2015 one comes out to see what one of these surveys looks like, click here to see\u00a0the 2014 version.) The data collected in these surveys is used to decide what their audience wants more of as they design\u00a0their editorial calendar for the year. This narrows down the field considerably to topics that will instantly catch on with their readers. There\u2019s still a lot of brainstorming to be done, but it\u2019s focused within certain categories that are important to the Social Media Examiner audience.<br />\n\u21d2\u00a0Reach out to great writers<br />\nMake it worth their while. A lot of talented writers contribute to Social Media Examiner in exchange for their huge number of page clicks. Find out what exposure on your site can offer your writers, and start sending out feelers. If you find a couple of truly standout writers, snap them up\u2014put them on retainer or hire them for specific blogging projects. When you can marry great content to an engaging, authentic voice, you\u2019ve got blogging gold.<br />\n\u21d2\u00a0Pay attention to what your audience likes<br />\nFacebook shares and \u201clikes,\u201d retweets and comments are important, but they aren\u2019t always the most important. In their first couple years, Social Media Examiner would take their cues on content from the number of tweets and page views any given post received. If an article got a lot of Twitter play, for example, they would write more articles on that topic.

Ouch!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s frustrating and discouraging, the kind of thing that can make you second-guess everything you know about online marketing.

As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, email marketing is the most effective means of online marketing. The gateway to that email\u2014the first thing your customers see\u2014is your subject line. It has to contain hints of everything your email has to offer\u2014the specificity of your product, the authenticity of your brand, the urgency of your offer. It has to convey not only your knowledge and authority, but also your personal empathy for your audience\u2019s needs. Tall order, right? Fortunately, crafting an enticing subject line is not rocket science. The best subject lines can be broken down into five basic strategies, each built along a simple formula.<br />\nStrategy #1:\u00a0 Focus on the Benefit</p>\n<p>\tWith this strategy, you focus on the end result your reader wants most.<br />\n\tMeet your readers where they currently live by speaking to their wants, desires, interests and concerns.<br />\n\tAnswer their\u00a0question: \u00a0\"What's in it for me?\"<br />\n\tHere's an example of a benefit-driven subject line:</p>\n<p>\u21d2 Example: \"See How Easily You Can Learn to Paint\"<br />\n\u21d2 Formula: See How Easily You Can Learn to [insert topic you are going to teach]<br />\nClick here to download a free cheat sheet with even more benefit-driven subject line formulas!</p>\n<p>Strategy #2:\u00a0 Be Specific</p>\n<p>\tSet the hook for your readers by hinting at something super valuable contained within your email.<br />\n\tIdentify your target audience very clearly: age group, professional demographic, special interest<br />\n\tGive a couple of specific details to ground your hint\u2014let them know that you know what you\u2019re talking about.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a highly specific subject line:<br />\n\u21d2 Example: \u201cWhat Every Accountant Ought to Know About New Tax Laws\u201d<br />\n\u21d2 Formula: What Every [identify your target audience] Ought to Know About [something specific you will teach them]</p>\n<p>Strategy #3: Get Relevant</p>\n<p>\tRelevance = useful + timely.

You may have heard me say it a million times on this site, but I\u2019ll say it again here: the energy of your business is directly tied to the strength\u00a0of your email list.</p>\n<p>But don\u2019t just take my word for it.<br />\n\u201cI have literally built a million dollar business on the strength of my email list. Ninety percent of my income comes from it. Even today, my email list is still my #1 business priority and asset.\u201d (Michael Hyatt)</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout a doubt, our email list is the best investment we\u2019ve ever made.\u201d\u00a0(Douglas Karr)</p>\n<p>\u201cEmail is the most important channel for you to cultivate in your online business.\u201d (Mike Stelzner)<br />\nThese guys are heavyweights in the online marketing world; each of them has a subscriber list numbering well over 100,000. But don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that a list in the hundreds, or even thousands, makes your email marketing strategy less important.</p>\n<p>No matter what your subscriber numbers are, your email list is one of the most valuable assets you have in the quest to help your business thrive. When you really understand the value of that list, you\u2019ll be more than happy to invest your time, energy and budget to help that list thrive.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I\u2019m going to highlight three foundational strategies for growing your email list. Once you implement these strategies, you\u2019re well on your way to creating smart marketing funnels that will put your list-building efforts on warp speed, as well as lead to increased revenue from each email you send out.<br />\nThe Main Thing: Quality over Quantity<br />\nWhen my good friend David Siteman Garland (of The Rise to the Top) started out, he had an email subscriber list of just 500 people. In those early days, he did a small product launch and generated $19,800 on the strength of that list.</p>\n<p>These days, David\u2019s email list is much larger. What hasn\u2019t changed is the incredible loyalty of those subscribers. Whenever I do any kind of affiliation with David, I\u2019m astonished at the way his list gravitates immediately toward any email he puts out.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all because he started with a focus on list quality.</p>\n<p>David never fails to infuse\u00a0his emails with his authentic personality. He is genuine, super funny, and a little bit quirky\u2026all reasons why his subscribers love him and keep coming back for more.</p>\n<p>David is a prime example of my first strategy for growing your email list.<br />\nStrategy #1: Build Remarkable Content<br />\nThis means more than simply content that people want to share. Remarkable means truly leaving your mark by ensuring that you\u2019ve niched your business well.</p>\n<p>When you direct your communication in general terms toward anyone who might be listening, no one feels like you are talking to them. The key is talking to a very specific audience about a very specific message.</p>\n<p>When it comes to content, niching yourself can make all the difference between great and remarkable.</p>\n<p>The difference starts with how it affects you, the content creator. The people that get very specific with their message tend to get much more excited about their business, because they know exactly what they\u2019re doing and who they\u2019re trying to reach. Creating the content stops being a chore, and starts to simply flow out of them.</p>\n<p>A message that tries too hard to fit too many different types of people is not only less rich, it\u2019s just not as exciting to create.</p>\n<p>In contrast, niching your business empowers you to send an extremely powerful message. This is what attracts the people who are going to stay with you. Those are the subscribers who constitute a quality list.<br />", "duration": "37:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_42.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1417658355, "title": "#41: 3 Lessons I Learned in 2014", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, we are going to dive into a new way of goal-setting and business planning. Now if you follow my content, you already know that I am a bit of a fanatic when it comes to planning for the New Year. I love it! I love new beginnings. I love looking back on the year, examining what worked and what did not work and then building something new or improved from there.\u00a0 I am going to cover 3 Lessons from this year that I am taking into the New Year. Some of them were easy lessons to learn, some not so easy. So let\u2019s go ahead and dive in!<br />\nLesson #1: If you don\u2019t build in the margin now, you will struggle to find it all year.<br />\nMargin is all about finding time to breath, to be creative, and taking time away from the computer to recharge. \u00a0Margin allows you to be better when you return and dive into your big projects. Finding margin is\u00a0easier said than done and in this episode we are going to talk about ways to make it actually happen! \u00a0In this lesson I will also share with you how you can use an at-a-glance wall calendar to see the pockets of margin in advance.<br />\nLesson #2: Build a team around your core skills.<br />\nWe all know that building a team is crucial for longterm success. \u00a0In this lesson I suggest a different way to approach your next hiring decision - one that will help you do more of what you love. Building\u00a0your team is one of the most important steps you may take in the new year - this lesson will help you do it better.<br />\nLesson #3: Add some soul to your goal-setting experience.<br />\nI realized that goals without the \"why\" are empty promises, meaningless in fact. They can quickly deplete your energy, make you feel unproductive, create massive overwhelm and suck the creativity right out of you.\u00a0Who wants to feel like that? In 2015, I am changing things up - I am approaching this whole goal-setting thing differently and starting with the WHY.</p>\n<p>These 3 lessons are exactly why I am so passionate about helping you change your goal-setting experience. I want your new goals to move you forward, invite in new opportunities and make you feel fully alive. In my journey to a more meaningful goal-setting experience, I was introduced to Michael Hyatt\u2019s goal setting philosophy. He also believes in starting with the WHY, getting to the root of what we really want and focusing on what matters most.</p>\n<p>Right now and for the next week or so, Michael will be releasing a video series on goal-setting - it\u2019s totally free and 100% aligned with creating a more powerful goal-setting experience. I encourage you to check it out! He put a lot of effort and time in this series and it shows. It\u2019s quality stuff.<br />\nYou can check out his free goal setting trainings at www.AmyPorterfield.com/Goals but only for a very short time, so don\u2019t wait to check it out!</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways:<br />\nThe three lessons I learned this year that you too can apply to your planning process as you get ready for the new year.<br />\n#1: Build margin into your year IN ADVANCE. Don\u2019t wait to find<br />\npockets of time that you can take off - be intentional about this<br />\ntime and protect it with your life.<br />\n#2: Get strategic about your hiring plans and build a team around<br />\nyour SKILL SETS - find that one person or the people that will<br />\naccentuate your skill sets and talents.<br />\n#3: Create goals with more meaning. Specifically, identify the<br />\nWHY before you set your big goals for the new year. Don\u2019t set<br />\nany goals that you don\u2019t identify WHY you really want it.</p>\n<p>Links\u00a0mentioned in this episode include:<br />\nClick to Check Out Michael Hyatt's FREE Goal-Setting Training</p>\n<p>Danielle LaPorte's Website</p>\n<p>My Favorite\u00a0\"At-A-Glance\" Wall Calendar<br />\nPodcast #23 \"5 Lessons I Learned in 2013 That I Will Repeat in 2014\"<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click here to download the transcript.</p>\n<p>Right click to download the .mp3.</p>", "duration": "46:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast-Goal_Setting.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "business planning", "Danielle LaPorte", "goal setting", "Michael Hyatt", "online marketing made easy podcast", "podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1414674023, "title": "#40: How to Attract Leads on Instagram", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, I interview my new\u00a0friend, Chalene Johnson.

The more you share, the more your\u00a0\u00a0audience will understand your journey and connect deeper with your message. The more honest and transparent you are when telling your story, the more your audience will relate to you and your message.<br />\n2) Video crew or One-Man-Crew:<br />\nTry your best to invest in a great video quality production but don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you can\u2019t launch your product or services until you can afford an expensive video crew. It can be done on a very small budget.</p>\n<p>3) Written scripts or off the cuff dialog:<br />\nIf you have\u00a0trouble feeling comfortable speaking in front of a camera, writing out a script and reading from a teleprompter will ease the tension and make sure you don\u2019t miss any key points. However, there will be times where just speaking to another person on the set will help you appear more passionate and sincere. (Below I list a couple of teleprompters I recommend.)<br />\n4) Location choices for added professionalism:<br />\nRecording the videos at your own home will always give you that internal feeling of comfort-ability, sort of like the \u201cHome Court Advantage.\u201d However, if you\u2019re going for a more professional appeal, renting a hotel suite or renting a Co-Work space for the day, will definitely increase the production value and really put a polished look to your videos.<br />\n5) Have a keen ear on set during each recording:<br />\nBy having another person on set whose only purpose is to pay very close attention to what is being said, is a surefire way to catch those inevitable mistakes you and your video person likely won\u2019t catch. This will avoid having to reschedule the entire shoot and post production editing nightmares.<br />\n6) Express your honest opinion about each shot selection:<br />\nReview a still of the shot selection before recording. Don\u2019t feel you are being \u201cdifficult\u201d if you don\u2019t feel it is the most flattering image of you. Instead of just going with the flow, suggest a new angle or shot setting.<br />\n7) Become comfortable in your own skin:<br />\nIf you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re not used to seeing yourself on camera and may view the final footage with an overly critical eye. Just remember that your audience is well aware they are not watching a Hollywood production and they definitely know we are not glamorous actors.

And many marketers were finding success in their calls to action; that\u2019s why these types of posts has been flooding the News Feed\u00a0on Facebook.</p>\n<p>The challenge is that the click bait strategy is making it hard for users to see content they genuinely want to see and care about. Facebook is viewing click bait as gaming the system to get out into the News Feed. Because Facebook has a\u00a0viral component built into their Algorithm, these click bait post were gaining a lot of exposure.</p>\n<p>The more people click on the link, even though they\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re even interested in the content on the other side of that link, the more that post shows up in the\u00a0News Feed.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s why Facebook became concerned with this practice and made this recent change that no longer allows click bait.\u00a0Your content will be negatively impacted\u00a0when you use a click bait type of posting strategy.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to craft your post so that you\u2019re not a victim to this algorithm change and your posts get as much News Feed\u00a0exposure as possible.<br />\nTip #1: \u00a0Create or Only Share Quality Posts<br />\nFocus more on quality versus quantity. I would rather see you post two times a day with high-value content versus a bunch of posts that won\u2019t get you the engagement that Facebook is actually paying attention to each time you post.</p>\n<p>When people click on the link and go to your website\u00a0from Facebook, make sure the content is interesting, exciting and engaging so they will STAY longer on your site.</p>\n<p>Now, this isn\u2019t particularly new news. However, most of us don\u2019t think about how long people are spending on the other side of our links that we include in our Facebook posts.</p>\n<p>Make that content valuable enough to keep them there and you will boost your engagement on Facebook . . . for free!<br />\nTip #2: \u00a0Be Specific With the Titles of Your Facebook Posts<br />\nThe more descriptive you are with your headlines in your post, the more likely people will genuinely be interested in your content when they actually get to your website.</p>\n<p>This would not only safeguard you, but it will help you with targeting. You will attract the ideal audience on Facebook with each of your Facebook posts.<br />\nTip #3: \u00a0Post a \u201cPreview\u201d of Your Content When Posting on Facebook</p>\n<p>What is a preview?<br />\nA preview is when you include a link to your article in the post and an image and a blurb under the image are automatically pulled into your post.</p>\n<p>Facebook has said that they will favor posts that have links that include a standard preview in the post versus posts that include a link with a photo but no preview.<br />\nWrapping Things Up<br />\nFacebook is all about their users having a great experience when they go on to their website.

Would you like to learn an easy trick to link\u00a0your Profile and Fan\u00a0Page together so that your visitors to your Profile would have direct exposure to your Fan Page?</p>\n<p>You will learn all of that and more in this weeks Episode of Online Marketing Made Easy - Ask Amy Podcast.</p>\n<p>On this episode I answer a question from one of my listeners about how to get your Facebook friends to like your Facebook Page.</p>\n<p>This is the question she asked:<br />\n\u00a0Kathy Sacks: \u201cI have more than 500 friends on my Facebook Profile. Since it would take a long time to get that many \u201clikes\u201d on my Facebook Page, I\u2019d like to get my friends on my Profile to to like my new business Page. Do you have any advice for me?\u201d<br />\nNow, the short answer is that there is no foolproof way to move your friends over to your Page.\u00a0 There are a few things you can try and I\u2019ll go over those things with you but I want to encourage you not to spend too much time trying to move your friends over to your Page. Instead, I would encourage you to spend more time on developing your Page, the content, the engagement, your list-growing strategy, all of that can be done on your Page. I wouldn't suggest you spend too much time on this strategy although I am going to give you some helpful tips to get you started to make that transition. \u00a0I understand that if you are growing a Facebook Page you want to build your fan base quickly and it makes sense to start with the friends on your Profile since they seem to have an interest in what you are posting. \u00a0Sounds logical, although, it doesn\u2019t happen as though we think it should.</p>\n<p>One thing you might want to think about is this: Are those friends that you have on your profile genuinely interested in your business? \u00a0Some of them likely are but definitely not all of them are.</p>\n<p>To be upfront, some of your Profile friends\u00a0just aren\u2019t interested in hearing from you about your\u00a0business. That\u2019s why I just want to caution you, it's likely on your Profile, you have a mix of people that are friends or just want to know you personally and have no interest in what you are doing for business. \u00a0That's just how it is.</p>\n<p>In my experience, moving friends to fans is a slow process that is rarely a raving success.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you to spend too much time in this area. \u00a0However, I will say, it is worth an effort to give it a shot. \u00a0Do it and then move on to bigger and better things.<br />\nI did promise you a few things that you can implement to build your new fan page with your existing friend base from your profile.<br />\n1)\u00a0The first suggestion I have for you is make sure that you link your Profile and your Page. \u00a0In the video below I\u2019m going to show you how to link your Profile and your Page so if somebody comes to your Profile they can easily click a link right there on that timeline and go over to your Facebook Page and become a fan.\u00a0This can be\u00a0tricky because the step-by-step process I am going to show you (it's quick, I promise!)\u00a0doesn\u2019t always work for everybody, so I am also going\u00a0to show you a quick workaround in the video. \u00a0I've got you covered ;-)<br />\nLinking your Profile to your Fan Page</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) For about two weeks, start a campaign where you are actively promoting your Page on your Profile. \u00a0What this means is that you\u2019re telling people that you are now posting regularly on your Facebook Page about (...you fill in the blank here)\u00a0and that you would love for them to come over and become a fan. Make sure you tell them to click \u201clike\u201d on your Page to become a fan. \u00a0Give them an action so that you can actually stay in touch with them in the newsfeed. Do this for a week or two; that should be enough to create the awareness. \u00a0 You then need to take it one step further and give them a reason why they should come over to your Facebook Page.<br />", "duration": "17:17", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/OMME_37_Change_Facebook_Profile_to_a_Page.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Ask Amy", "Podcast", "ask amy", "facebook fan growth", "facebook marketing tips", "online marketing made easy podcast", "strategies to get more facebook fans"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1406816155, "title": "#036: 3 Keys to Understanding Your Audience to Increase Sales with Pam Hendrickson", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, I interviewed my good friend, Pam Hendrickson. Pam and I go WAY back. She is actually the person who interviewed me for my position with Tony Robbins, and was my first \"big boss.\"</p>\n<p>Pam and I have spent many hours working and traveling together. We joke that we spent more time together during certain seasons than we did with our husbands!</p>\n<p>Pam worked for Tony Robbins for close to 20 years before going out on her own. Considering her experience with Robbins, she thought launching her first products would be easy, but she was wrong. In spite of the fact that the products were great, she made very few sales.</p>\n<p>The turning point for her was when she learned how to give her customers what they want, and in this episode, we dive in deep about how to do that.<br />\nIn this episode, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:</p>\n<p>\tA key success principle for business<br />\n\tWhat will cause your business to fail even if you have the best content in the world<br />\n\tThe necessary foundation for great marketing<br />\n\tCommon mistakes when defining a target market<br />\n\tTools for understanding your target market<br />\n\tHow to cultivate relationships<br />\n\tWhy technology will never replace face-to-face interactions<br />\n\tAnd so much more!</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>\tA key to success in business is not being afraid to make mistakes<br />\n\tGreat content alone isn't enough. If it isn't want your customers need and want, it won't be successful.<br />\n\tThe foundation of our marketing comes from understanding who our target audience is, and creating all of products and services based around that.<br />\n\tIdeal customer exercises are great, but they don't go deep enough. It's important to go beyond who and really dive deep into their pain points.<br />\n\tProduct creation and marketing are easy when you truly understand your audience.<br />\n\tThere are three primary areas to focus on:</p>\n<p>\tTactical<br />\n\tRelationships<br />\n\tEmotional connection</p>\n<p>\tTactical focuses on learning more about your audience. This is an ongoing process. In order to learn this information, you can conduct surveys, look at what your competition does to see what's working for them, and conduct market research using tools such as Keyword Spy and Ispionage.</p>\n<p>\tRelationships focuses on really getting to know your audience, and enable you to go deeper when it comes to truly understanding them and therefore really knowing how to meet their needs. A great example that Pam gave was that if you went to the gym and someone had you \u00a0fill out a survey, they would have a certain level of understanding about your needs. In contrast, if you went to the gym and spent time talking with the person exercising next to you, you would have a much deeper understanding.</p>\n<p>\tEmotional connection is when you really begin to FEEL what your audience feels. It goes deeper than having an intellectual understanding of their needs, and enables you to basically put yourself in their shoes so that you better understand them on an emotional level. This is the opposite of the tactical side of things because it focuses on feelings rather than facts.</p>\n<p>Action Steps</p>\n<p>\tFor a week or two, spend ten minutes per day researching your target market using tools such as Keyword Spy, Eyespionage \u00a0and Pew Research.<br />\n\tTo help you build relationships with your audience, pick one or two live events to attend. The goal is to have an opportunity to connect face-to-face with your target audience.<br />\n\tSet aside 20-30 minutes to get quiet and FEEL the problems and pains of your customers.</p>\n<p>A Special Gift from Pam for My Audience<br />\nPam really went the extra mile by creating a special gift just for you, a free video training and report, which you can get here.<br />\nItems mentioned in this episode include:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\tMake Market, Launch It<br />\n\tPam's Website\u00a0<br />\n\tPam's video training and report,", "duration": "35:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/OMME_36_Pam_Hendrickson.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "interviews", "OMME", "online marketing made easy podcast", "pam hendrickson", "podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1406205004, "title": "#035: How to Hire Your First Project Manager with Laura Roeder", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, I interview my good friend, Laura Roeder.</p>\n<p>I've had Laura on the podcast before, but I wanted to have her on again, because she is a master in setting up processes and systems to grow your business.

You can set the pixel to track for 30, 60, or 90 days.<br />\n\tRetargeting ads are great because they allow you to target the people that really care about your brand; they help you connect with your website visitors on Facebook.<br />\n\tYou CAN place retargeting ads in both the newsfeed and in the right hand column.<br />\n\tIt\u2019s important to set up your retargeting ads in the Power Editor.<br />\n\tI have better results with ads placed in the newsfeed, but it\u2019s important to experiment to find out what works best for you.<br />\n\tLookalike audiences are very valuable but the results you get back from Facebook can be huge -- as many as a couple of million people. To narrow down the results, when inside of the Power Editor, under the \u201cAudience\u201d tab, you can select age, gender and so on to target even further. In addition to that, you can further refine your targeting by indicating that they need to be a fan of at least one of the Pages you add to the interest section (again, under audience).

This is a new feature that I've added to my podcast. As I mentioned in episode 30, every other week I\u2019m going to be answering your questions all about online marketing, Facebook marketing, Facebook ads, webinars and email marketing.</p>\n<p>If you have a question, I likely am going to have an answer for you! All you need to do is go to\u00a0amyporterfield.com/askamy\u00a0and leave me a recorded message.\u00a0Your question just might be the very next one I choose for the show!</p>\n<p>Here's the question for this episode:<br />\nI'm a huge fan of your podcast and your content. . . My question is I've noticed that the Facebook layout has changed and things have moved around a little bit. Is there anything I need to know about this new layout to help me maximize my impact and exposure on Facebook?<br />\nThis is a great question, and is very timely since Facebook is rolling out the new Facebook Page layout, and if you don\u2019t have it already, you\u2019ll be getting it soon. If you don\u2019t yet have it and want to see what it looks like, you can check it out on my Facebook Page, http://facebook.com/AmyPorterfield.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start at the top, and I\u2019ll break it down for you!<br />\nStats Located on the Right</p>\n<p>As shown in the image above, in the new layout, to the right of your cover photo, you\u2019ll see the following stats for the week:</p>\n<p>\tNew Page likes<br />\n\tOverall post reach<br />\n\tUnread messages (This will be blank if like me, you don\u2019t use the private message button)<br />\n\tNotifications, which includes clicks, likes, shares and comments on each of your posts</p>\n<p>How to use this information: On a weekly basis, track these numbers in an Excel or Google spreadsheet and pay attention to whether or not you\u2019re making improvements in these various areas.<br />\nTab Management</p>\n<p>Beneath the cover photo you\u2019ll see tabs. The tabs are like the boxes that were across the top on the old layout. When you click on them, they take you to custom apps\u00a0inside your Facebook Page.</p>\n<p>All of your tabs won\u2019t display across the top, but you can change the order of them to position them. You do this by clicking on the \u201cMore\u201d dropdown menu, and clicking on \u201cManage Tabs\u201d as pictured above.</p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on tabs, because unless you\u2019re using Facebook ads to drive traffic to the tabs, they don\u2019t convert well because most people never go to your Facebook Page, but instead, likely see the majority of your posts in the newsfeed. If you do want to use tabs, be sure to use ads to drive traffic to them.<br />\nScheduled Posts</p>\n<p>If you schedule posts directly from your Facebook Page, in the new layout, you\u2019ll see a notification that says, \u201cScheduled Posts,\u201d the number of posts you have scheduled, and when the next scheduled post will be published.</p>\n<p>I love this feature because since I schedule my posts directly on my Facebook Page, I can now easily see where to find the scheduled posts, and can quickly view and edit them.<br />\nThe About Section</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to be strategic with how you use the \u201cAbout\u201d section of your Facebook Page. As you can see from my example, I put a link to a free webinar, to help grow my email list. Other types of lead magnets such as eBooks, cheat sheets, checklists, and so on work as well.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, I also put a link to my website in the About section. One thing to be aware of is that this option is not available if your Page is a local business.<br />\nPages to Watch</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of the coolest features about the new layout is found inside of Insights and is called, \u201cPages to Watch.\u201d This feature provides a great opportunity to see what\u2019s working for other Pages, specifically Pages that also attract your ideal customer.

The great thing is that I dove into this extremely important conversation with the pioneer of all online marketing launches, Jeff Walker.\u00a0Jeff is known for a system he created called The Product Launch Formula and is truly one of the top internet marketing experts and leaders.</p>\n<p>He tells a great story of how he got started, and to get the full scoop, you\u2019ll need to listen to the interview because I wouldn\u2019t be able to do his story justice, so for now I\u2019ll just say that before he started his first online business, he had never ran a business before. He had absolutely zero sales training and no marketing skills.</p>\n<p>He jokes that he was always the kid that couldn't sell more than one bag of donuts for the Boy Scouts fundraiser every year and that one bag was usually purchased by his parents. \u00a0So as you can see, sales and marketing didn't necessarily run in his blood from day one. \u00a0He was an average guy who made an extraordinary impact on many people's lives and continues to do so through his teachings. \u00a0That's why I am honored to have Jeff on the show today.</p>\n<p>Before you listen to the interview, I want to share one more thing with you and that is that Jeff just wrote a book called, Launch: An Internet Millionaire's Secret Formula To Sell Almost Anything Online, Build A Business You Love And Live The Life Of Your Dreams, and for a very limited time, you have an opportunity to get the book for free -- you just have to pay for shipping and handling -- and in addition to the free book, he\u2019s throwing in a bunch of free bonuses.

In the first month, I've got about 130-something likes and I just love to see that, but I want to keep the momentum going. I want to know what the next step for me might be, whether it's Facebook ads or whatever you think would be the most efficient thing for me.<br />\nAnd here are images that show what was referred to in the question:</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<p>\tAnytime you get new leads from Facebook, it's important to be ready to nurture those leads.<br />\n\tFollow up with your new leads with a weekly email, with the focus initially being on pure value, instead of selling.<br />\n\tAfter 4-6 weeks of pure value, select one opportunity to \u00a0promote. Send 3-4 emails that talk about this opportunity. Be sure to make those emails about them, rather than about you and your offer.<br />\n\tWork on sharpening your copywriting skills. This is important even if you plan to hire someone to write them for you in the future.<br />\n\tIf people don't purchase, put them back into a value-add sequence, and when you're ready to promote again, go back to 3-4 emails about an opportunity.<br />\n\tUse Facebook ads to drive traffic to a lead magnet rather than to a sales page. The goal of ads is to grow your email list. This is how to turn your efforts into profits.<br />\n\tEven though it's hard to get organic reach on your Page, it's still important to provide good content for the people who see your posts.<br />\n\tEmail is more intimate than Facebook, when you really understand how to use email.<br />\n\tIt's useless to have a big email list if you never use it to promote.</p>\n<p>Items mentioned in this episode include:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\tRealTennisNetwork.com<br />\n\tRay Edwards<br />\n\tJohn Carlton\u00a0<br />\n\tCopyblogger<br />\n\tOMME #28:\u00a07 Steps to a Profitable Facebook Marketing \u00a0Plan<br />\n\tAsk Amy</p>\n<p>Click here to download the transcript.</p>\n<p>Right click to download the .mp3.</p>\n<p>Click Here to Subscribe via RSS (non-iTunes feed)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.com/2014/06/what-to-do-after-running-a-contest-on-facebook/\" rel=\"nofollow\">#030: ASK AMY:  \u201cI ran a contest on Facebook.

But before we get to that, I wanted to tell you about some changes coming your way related to my podcast.</p>\n<p>First, starting in June I am going record one episode per week, rather than every other week like I have been doing. Look out for some extra podcast love coming your way!</p>\n<p>Second, I am going to add an extra layer to my podcast and start recording an \u201cAsk Amy\u201d segment where you get to send me your questions and I will address them on my show. In full disclosure I took this idea from my good friend, Pat Flynn who now has a show called AskPat. I called Pat to ask if he minded, and in true Pat fashion, he encouraged me to go for it.\u00a0Gotta love good friends like that.</p>\n<p>So if you would like me to address any questions you might have about online marketing, Facebook marketing, list building, content creation, webinars - anything goes - so just go to www.amyporterfield.com/askamy and you can be one of the first to leave me a question.</p>\n<p>OK, switching gears, let\u2019s get back to our topic for today, Facebook ad targeting. I\u2019ve invited my really good friend, Rick Mulready to come on the show with me so we could talk about what we both are seeing that\u2019s working right now with ad targeting.</p>\n<p>Rick has an extensive online marketing background and teaches Facebook advertising to entrepreneurs and small businesses. The cool thing is that he is in the trenches daily experimenting with ad campaigns and getting some pretty big results; the guy knows his stuff.</p>\n<p>So Rick lives in San Diego and lately we\u2019ve been meeting up at Starbucks and sharing insights about our experiences with Facebook ads. (Does that sound super geeky? We can't help it - we love this ad stuff!) The discussions have been so good that I wanted to get Rick on the show and invite you all into one of the most valuable\u00a0discussions we\u2019ve had, which is focused on Facebook ad targeting.<br />\nIn this episode, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:</p>\n<p>\tThe most valuable Facebook ad targeting options, including Interests, Custom Audiences\u00a0and Lookalike Audiences.<br />\n\tWhich targeting option to choose when you are just starting out.<br />\n\tHow to target your website visitors with your Facebook ads.<br />\n\tHow to expand your targeting options if you feel you can't seem to find a big enough target that is effective.<br />\n\tWe'll answer the question, \"How many people should I target with my\u00a0ad?<br />\n\tWe will also discuss which ad metrics to pay close attention to so you know your ad is working.</p>\n<p>To help you navigate your Facebook ad targeting, I've included additional details in this post so you can understand how\u00a0each target works and where to locate.<br />\nI suggest you create your ads in the Power Editor. \u00a0Think of the Power Editor as a more robust \"Facebook Ads Manager\" dashboard. You can do more in the Power Editor and I highly recommend you test it out. (It's a bit confusing at first, but I promise it gets easier once you understand where everything's located!)</p>\n<p>I can't stress this enough: \u00a0The\u00a0MOST important part of your Facebook ads campaign is targeting. Below I will walk you through some of the most important targeting features.</p>\n<p>There are two different places where you will set up your\u00a0ad targeting. \u00a0When you are totally new to ads, two\u00a0of the easiest\u00a0targeting features you can use are \"Demographics\" and \"Interests.\" To locate these two targeting features, go into the Power Editor, and under the \"Ads\" tab you will see \u00a0the \"Audience\" tab in blue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once inside the Power Editor, when you click on \"Ads\" you will see the \"Audience\" tab.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Under the \"Audience\" tab, if you scroll down a bit you will first see \"Demographics\" where you can set the age, gender\u00a0and location for your ad targeting. \u00a0Scroll down some more and you will see: Interests, Behaviors and categories. \u00a0Let me briefly\u00a0explain each to you.", "duration": "50:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/029_Targeting_with_Facebook_Ads.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "amy porterfield", "Facebook", "facebook ad targeting", "facebook ads", "interviews", "podcast", "rick mulready"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1398344426, "title": "#028: 7 Steps to a Profitable Facebook Marketing Plan", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, I decided to do something a little bit different.

In addition to that, this plan will actually help you produce leads and revenue on a consistent basis on Facebook.</p>\n<p>People have a lot of concerns about Facebook: </p>\n<p>\tThey aren\u2019t sure what they\u2019re doing and they feel stuck<br />\n\tThey are frustrated with their list building strategies; their list is growing painfully slow<br />\n\tOr, they are just frustrated with Facebook in general, but are still holding out a little hope because they really want Facebook to work for them because they\u2019ve put a lot of effort and in some cases a lot of money into it but just haven\u2019t gotten the results they were hoping for.<br />\n\tAnd some people are just looking for a plan so they get see more fans, leads or sales through Facebook.</p>\n<p>If you can relate to any of that, this podcast is perfect for you! .<br />\nSpecifically, we covered the following 7 steps that you need to Create a Facebook marketing plan that really works.<br />\n1. Create Your Lead Magnet</p>\n<p>To build trust and affinity with your Facebook fans, create a free irresistible giveaway that solves a problem or offers immense value. To ensure that your giveaway attracts your perfect ideal audience on Facebook, create something that is SO GOOD your audience would pay for it.</p>\n<p>2. Set Up Your Lead Capture Page</p>\n<p>The next step is to create a webpage that will collect name and emails in exchange for your giveaway.\u00a0 A well designed lead capture page is critical because it must convert. Instead of paying for a programmer and designer to create this page for you, look into using LeadPages. With this tool you could have a lead capture page up and running in 10 minutes!</p>\n<p>3. Create a \u201cGotta Have It\u201d Facebook Post and Turn It Into an Ad</p>\n<p>At this point you want to create a Facebook post that entices your fans to sign up for your irresistible giveaway. This post will become your Facebook ad.\u00a0 To get maximum exposure and results, create an Unpublished Page Post (also known as a \u201cDark Post) in the Power Editor ads dashboard. Only run this ad in the News Feed.<br />\nIn this episode I promised to show the current Facebook ad I am running that is generating over $30,000 a month for me via my Facebook Marketing Plan.</p>\n<p>My Unpublished Facebook Ad</p>\n<p>When you go into the Power Editor, you will see the option to create an \"Unpublished Page Post\" and when you click on that link, this box will pop up. \u00a0This is where you want to include all of your copy and the image. \u00a0Note the image size in the example below:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. Only Show Your Ad To Your \u201cPerfect Customer\u201d Target List</p>\n<p>To ensure that your ad is only seen by Facebook users who will be genuinely interested in your free giveaway, use Lookalike Audiences on Facebook as your targeting strategy. Not only will this help you target your perfect customer profile, it will also allow you to reach a larger, targeted audience.</p>\n<p>5.

This interview came at a perfect time, because the evening after completing the interview, I got on a plane to the Philippines to speak at Chris' event, Tropical Think Tank.</p>\n<p>This was an exciting trip for me because not only is this my first trip to the Philippines, I also had the opportunity to speak with some some really fantastic people, including Pat Flynn, John Dumas, Greg Hickman and Natalie Sisson, and of course Chris Ducker himself, so it was a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>On today\u2019s show, we are talking about the power of virtual support and outsourcing. This is an important topic for me, because I recently learned a valuable lesson, something I did not believe for so long until I finally experienced it personally in my business.</p>\n<p>So many successful people I look up to have told me that it is possible to work less and make a bigger impact, which includes bigger profits. That was hard for me to believe because it went against everything I knew about hard work paying off.</p>\n<p>However, on episode 23, I talked about how I experienced this very thing in 2013. I tell you this because with the right support, you truly can do less and make more. That\u2019s why I think the topic today is so valuable to anyone building a business online.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve actually had Chris on the show before and so today we are going to dive a bit deeper into this topic. For those of you who do not know Chris, Chris is a serial entrepreneur, virtual staffing expert, blogger, podcaster and author of the new book Virtual Freedom (which is a FANTASTIC book and one I highly recommend.)</p>\n<p>In this episode, right from the start, Chris gets personal about a recent experience he had with burnout - and how his burnout did not effect his business AT ALL.</p>\n<p>Also, Chris dives into the mindset and mechanics around expanding your team with virtual support. The mindset requires a different way of looking at your business and your role in your business, seeing the value of letting go of some of it, and leveraging it by entrusting certain aspects of it to someone else. The mechanics include specific strategies and tools you can use to maximize your outsourcing experience.<br />\nIn this episode, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:</p>\n<p>\tMindset and the mechanics of expanding your team<br />\n\tThe value of letting go and leveraging<br />\n\tChris' burnout, and what he did about it<br />\n\tThe importance of taking care of yourself and switching off regularly<br />\n\tWhat entrepreneurs should do with the time they save by outsourcing<br />\n\tHow a virtual team kept Chris' business going in the midst of his burnout<br />\n\tThe importance of entrepreneurs going off the grid from time to time<br />\n\tWhat super hero syndrome is, and how to overcome it<br />\n\tThe impact of ego on your business<br />\n\tWhat will defeat the benefits of your outsourcing efforts<br />\n\tHow you can make more by working less<br />\n\tHow to counter the feeling that you can do things faster yourself than telling someone else to do it<br />\n\tThe biggest problem when training your virtual staff<br />\n\tHow to throw little curve balls to your VA, and why you should<br />\n\tWhy you need to take care of your team ahead of all else<br />\n\tWhether you should outsource locally or overseas<br />\n\tThe 3 basic ways Chris communicates with his staff<br />\n\tThe point where a lot of businesses begin to fail and how to avoid it<br />\n\tAnd so much more!</p>\n<p>When training your virtual staff, the biggest challenge you'll run into is yourself [Tweet This]<br />\nItems mentioned in this episode include:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\tChris' new book, Virtual Freedom<br />\n\tThe Three Lists to Freedom<br />\n\tBranding Bootcamp<br />\n\tBasecamp<br />\n\tOMME #16: How to Outsource Online Marketing<br />\n\tOMME #23: 5 Lessons I Learned in 2013 That I Will Repeat in 2014<br />", "duration": "46:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/026_ChrisDucker.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "business", "chris ducker", "interviews", "outsourcing", "podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1392904801, "title": "#025: How to Promote with Twitter with Mike Stelzner", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, we talk all about Twitter.</p>\n<p>Since I am not a Twitter expert,\u00a0I have\u00a0invited my friend and\u00a0mentor, Michael Stelzner, on the show to talk about some very specific strategies he uses to promote his live and online events with Twitter.Mike would say that he too is not a Twitter expert, but I would disagree because he is doing things on Twitter that are\u00a0getting some serious results - and he\u2019s been perfecting his Twitter strategy for many, many years, so in my book, he\u2019s a pro.For those of you who might not know Mike,\u00a0he is the founder of \u00a0the best social media site around, Social Media Examiner, which he launched \u00a0in October of 2009, which has exploded, to say the least.\u00a0Last year more than 7.5 million people visited the site.\u00a0 He's the author of two books (Launch & Writing White Papers) and is host of the Social Media Marketing Podcast. He also founded the parenting blog\u00a0MyKidsAdventures.com.</p>\n<p>5 Strategic Ways to Promote with Twitter<br />\n1. Transactional Tweets</p>\n<p>This type of tweet has a psychological component to it. When people have just made a purchase or signed up for a newsletter, they're poised to take action, and are more likely to do the next thing you ask them to do. Therefore, as soon as the transaction is complete, send them to a thank you page, and on the page, add a text link with a request.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may have a text link that says something like, \"Click here to tweet your excitement about (coming to an event, a course they just purchased, etc.). When they click on the link, have it open up a pre-populated tweet that says something like, \"I'm attending/just purchased. . .\" \u00a0Be sure to include a link to the event or item being tweeted about.<br />\n2. Verbal Tweets<br />\nPodcast listeners are often on the go. They may be listening from the gym, while they're driving, etc, so give them a URL that is easy to remember. Mike directs people to go to SocialMediaExaminer.com/love. I actually stole this idea from Mike, and on occasion in my podcast you'll hear me ask you to go to AmyPorterfield.com/love. If you click on that link, you'll see that it opens up a window with a pre-populated tweet about how much they love my podcast. This is a great way to get your podcast listeners to spread the word about your podcast!<br />\n3. Shout-Out Tweets<br />\nShout-out tweets are a great way to give love to someone! An example of how Mike uses this technique is that he lists all of the speakers for his events and asks people to click on the name of their favorite presenter. When they do, again, a pre-populated tweet opens up that says something like, \"Hey [name], I'm really looking forward to meeting you at [event].\"<br />\n4. Affiliate Tweets<br />\nWrite up 10-15 different tweets that promote your product or event, and put them on a blog page or in an email. All people have to do is add their affiliate link to the tweets you've crafted, and they can then easily be shared. The easier you make things, the more likely people are to share! You can use this same strategy even if you don't have affiliates, but have other offerings that you want your audience to help you promote.<br />\n5. Custom Tweets<br />\nSocial share buttons such as Digg Digg have been around for awhile, but when people use them, they promote only the specific page or post the person is on. But you may not want the person driving traffic to the page they are on, such as on the page with information on hotels for an event that is being promoted.</p>\n<p>The solution is to craft custom tweets, and then embed that code on any page. This enables you to include a link to the page you want people to go to, regardless of the page they tweeted from. This also gives great social proof because instead of having several Twitter buttons with smaller tweet counts, when you use the widget, the tweet count is aggregated.<br />\nHashtags<br />\nIn the final third of the show,", "duration": "39:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/025_MikeStelzner_Twitter.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "engagement", "Social Media", "Twitter", "Twitter apps"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1391695258, "title": "#024: 3 Mindset Pitfalls Entrepreneurs Face and How to Push Beyond Them: Interview with Marie Forleo", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, I share with you some insight I\u2019ve recently discovered about myself. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve always known on some level, but I\u2019ve just recently really owned it and started to be actively aware of it. I decided to share it with you, because maybe you can relate.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the deal. Sometimes my mind is a pretty scary place to live as a result of the stories that I create\u00a0\u00a0about my experiences. When I\u2019m in my head, these stories are completely true and real, but in reality, they are just perceptions.</p>\n<p>As an example, in the early years of my business if I promoted something and it didn\u2019t go as well as I thought it should, the story that would play in my mind was that I\u2019m just not as good as my peers, that I didn\u2019t have what it takes to be a success, that I\u2019m in over my head, and that I should have never left Tony Robbins. These stories crushed my confidence!</p>\n<p>Now that I\u2019m more aware of these stories, I try to spend as much time as possible in the present moment, where life is actually happening, rather than focusing on these stories that I\u2019ve made up. This approach has helped me quiet fears, doubts, and worries as they pop up as I\u2019m building my business.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sharing this with you because these stories are something we all have to deal with from time to time. Because of that, I invited my good friend and mentor, Marie Forleo, founder of B-School,\u00a0best selling author and the creator of the award-winning web show MarieTV.com, back to the show as my first repeat guest.</p>\n<p>I specifically asked Marie to come on the show to explore these mindset pitfalls, because Marie is not only a marketing pro, \u00a0she also has a great way of pulling you out of your head and into the present moment where things tend to look very different than they do in our minds.</p>\n<p>Marie and I discuss the following three mindset pitfalls that entrepreneur\u2019s tend to face as they\u2019re building their business:<br />\n#1: How Do I Deal with the Competition?<br />\nCompetition can be destructive, especially when you\u2019re first starting out and are vulnerable. It can cause a downward spiral that Marie refers to as \u201cthe comparison hangover.\u201d You may be tempted to look at someone else\u2019s videos, Facebook Page, Twitter stream and so on and feel like you\u2019ll never get there. The comparison hangover can make people feel like crap and some people even use it to take themselves out of the game.</p>\n<p>But competition is actually a very positive thing that can fuel you and drive you to succeed. It can be a healthy form of peer pressure that can actually push you to strive for more.</p>\n<p>One thing I learned when I was working with Tony Robbins is that it\u2019s important to surround yourself with people who are more successful than you so that it motivates you to strive to do even better. While you\u2019re doing so, it\u2019s important to remind yourself that they used to be right where you are and didn\u2019t attain their level of success overnight.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s up to each of us to pay attention to these signals and the type of story we\u2019re making up in our minds regarding our competition, and choose to make competition a positive thing.<br />\n#2: How Do I Deal with Criticism in My Business?<br />\nIf criticism shows up on the doorstep of your blog or your Facebook Page, it\u2019s important to deal with it head on. In many cases, critics just want to be heard, so if you acknowledge them and their point of view, and tell them you respect where they\u2019re coming from and perhaps even find a point in their criticism that you agree with and acknowledge it, it works wonders.</p>\n<p>By doing so, you completely disarm them and open up a dialogue. When you respond with something like, \u201cI completely agree with you on that point\u201d or \u201cI can really see where you\u2019re coming from,\u201d both of you may actually end up learning something!</p>\n<p>Naturally, we\u2019re not talking about rude and tasteless comments or things that are sexually offensive,...", "duration": "31:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/024_MarieForleo.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "business", "challenges", "entrepreneur", "Marie Forleo", "podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1390485635, "title": "#023: 5 Lessons I Learned in 2013 That I Will Repeat in 2014", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>This episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast\u00a0\u00a0is all about some of the big business lessons I learned last year and that I'm taking with me into this New Year.</p>\n<p>I call them lessons, but really they were big wins that just really worked well that you can apply to your own online business.<br />\nIn this episode, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:</p>\n<p>\tWhy you should create a year-long promotional calendar<br />\n\tThe importance of documenting all planned promotional emails<br />\n\tHow I earn the right to promote my programs<br />\n\tHow to know when to say no to opportunities<br />\n\tHow to do more with less<br />\n\tMy revenue in 2013<br />\n\tHow I optimized my online programs<br />\n\tWhat to do if you're just starting out in your business and don't know what to focus on<br />\n\tThe importance of focusing on one big project at a time<br />\n\tHow to create marketing funnels for increased revenue<br />\n\tMy experience (both good and bad) with masterminds<br />\n\tAnd so much more!</p>\n<p>Items mentioned in this episode include:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\tOnline Marketing Made Easy episode #22<br />\n\tMarie Forleo's B-School<br />\n\tAWeber<br />\n\tInfusionsoft</p>\n<p>Click here to download the transcript.</p>\n<p>Right click to download the .mp3.</p>\n<p>Click Here to Subscribe via RSS (non-iTunes feed)</p>\n<p>Question: What's one big lesson you learned last year?

I highly recommend podcasting to anyone that is looking to expand their brand and take things beyond their blog and website.</p>\n<p>This episode is extremely valuable.

If you do so, you can hit the ground running and get your year off to a great start!</p>\n<p>As I was planning this episode, I started to wonder how other people -- specifically the people I admire who are getting big results in their online marketing businesses -- actually get things done and how they plan and set their goals. Instead of just wonder, I reached out and asked them! Specifically, I asked Michael Hyatt, Pat Flynn, Melanie Duncan, Chris Ducker and Michael Stelzner how they plan for the New Year.<br />\nTake the Time to Focus on Your Business<br />\nDuring this episode, I want you to take this time to really focus on your business. My hope for you is that you actually take these tips and strategies and put them to action right away.<br />\nGoal Setting Tip #1: Get Very Specific</p>\n<p>Before I get into the specifics of getting very specific, I want you to do a quick exercise.</p>\n<p>First, grab a piece of paper and fold it in half.<br />\nWhat Worked in Your Business?<br />\nOn one half of the paper, write what was great or what worked well for you this year. What got you excited? What did you love doing? What did your customers love? What made you money?</p>\n<p>Get really clear on what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what you really enjoyed. This is important because the emotions behind the work you do play a big part in your success.</p>\n<p>Before you even you even think about writing down goals for new things you want to do, first focus on enhancing, improving, and optimizing what already worked for you this year.</p>\n<p>What I personally realized when I did this exercise is that I need to focus more on what is already working. For example, I already have three successful programs, so instead of creating more programs, I\u2019m going to focus on making the programs I already have even better.<br />\nWhat Didn\u2019t Work in Your Business?<br />\nOn the other half of the paper, write what needs to improve or what didn\u2019t work. What were the failures? (We all have them!) What frustrated you or stopped you from moving forward? What should you stop doing?</p>\n<p>It can be just as important to think about what you need to stop doing as it is to plan for what you want to accomplish.</p>\n<p>As an example, I plan to travel and speak less in 2014 than I did in 2013, because I ended up being away from my family more than I wanted to this year and also found it hard to accomplish some of my more important goals since I was on the go so much.<br />\nSet Your Goals<br />\nOnce you\u2019ve done the above exercise, it\u2019s time to set your goals!</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an important goal-setting tip for you: fit all of your goals onto one page. If you write pages and pages of goals, you\u2019ll be overwhelmed, and you won\u2019t likely focus on all of them anyway, so keep your goals simple and concise.<br />\nHere\u2019s what to include on one-page goal setting sheet<br />\n1. Revenue projections </p>\n<p>The first thing on my list is all of my revenue projects, specifically how much money I\u2019m going to make, and where that money is coming from.</p>\n<p>While it may seem like revenue shouldn\u2019t be the top goal, my good friend, Stu McLaren helped change my perspective on making money. He says, \u201cMoney is a leverage tool for impacting more lives than we could ever reach on a personal level.\u201d I love that, because not only is it important to make money to provide for my own family, this perspective gives me a higher purpose for making money.</p>\n<p>Since this is a top priority for a business, it\u2019s important to not only list how much money you plan to make, but to also project how you plan to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>As an example, for myself personally, I\u2019ve planned out income funnels such as what I\u2019ll make through my programs,", "duration": "48:36", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/21_GoalSetting.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast", "business planning", "goal setting", "new year", "planning for the new year"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1384430433, "title": "#020: Creative Ways to Run a Business From Anywhere in the World with Natalie Sisson", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Right click to download the .mp3.</p>\n<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, I interviewed Natalie Sisson, also known as the Suitcase Enterpreneur.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Natalie left her home country of New Zealand and since then has been traveling the world and living out of a suitcase -- all while building a successful online business. </p>\n<p>On her blog, Natalie teaches creative ways to run a business from anywhere in the world, using outsourcing, along with online tools and social media.</p>\n<p>She's also written a new book about how to create freedom in business and adventure in life.<br />\nIn this episode, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:</p>\n<p>\tHow Natalie started with nothing but an idea and created a successful and profitable Facebook app<br />\n\tWhat caused Natalie to cry herself to sleep at night and how she overcame it<br />\n\tWhat it takes to make significant changes in your life business<br />\n\tHow to avoid undermining your progress<br />\n\tHow to know your special sauce and how to use it to your advantage<br />\n\tHow to get good feedback from those who know you well<br />\n\tThe two big things Natalie did to launch her book<br />\n\tNatalie's 30-day blog challenge<br />\n\tAnd so much more!</p>\n<p>Items mentioned in this episode include:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\tNatalie's blog<br />\n\tNatalie's new book<br />\n\tArticle on Think Traffic about Natalie's 30-day blog challenge<br />\n\tKickstarter</p>\n<p>Thank Natalie for sharing such great tips! < -----<br />\nTranscript<br />\nClick here to download the transcript. </p>\n<p>Right click to download the .mp3.</p>\n<p>Click Here to Subscribe via RSS (non-iTunes feed)</p>\n<p>Question: Does the thought of being a \"suitcase entrepreneur\" appeal to you, or are you more of a homebody?</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.com/2013/11/run-business-anywhere/\" rel=\"nofollow\">#020: Creative Ways to Run a Business From Anywhere in the World with Natalie Sisson</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amy Porterfield</a>.</p>", "duration": "44:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/020_NatlieSisson.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Interviews", "Podcast", "kickstarter", "lifestyle business", "natalie sisson", "online business"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1383186602, "title": "#019: How to Set Priorities In Your Business with Pat Flynn", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>Right click to download the .mp3.</p>\n<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, my guest is one of my very favorite people - Pat Flynn.</p>\n<p>I know most of you already know Pat, but if you don't, he is a well-known and highly successful online entrepreneur.

You want an army of raving fans talking about you - and Facebook can do just that!</p>\n<p>Also, your Facebook fan count acts as social proof. \u00a0That means when someone comes to your Facebook page and sees you have a few thousand fans (or more!) they think, \"Ok, this company is legit.\" \u00a0Crazy, I know. \u00a0But true! \u00a0We want to become fans of pages our friends and peers like. \u00a0The more fans you have, the more new fans you can get.<br />\nIn this episode, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:<br />\nIn this episode, I share with you three super simple, but highly valuable, Facebook fan attracting tips. \u00a0Implement these and start seeing more fans overnight. Simple as that!<br />\nStrategy #1: The Facebook Like Box</p>\n<p>Here's why you should add a Like Box to your website:</p>\n<p>\tYour website audience is a warm audience and are very likely to follow you on Facebook too.<br />\n\tIt's easy to implement (takes less than 5 minutes!) and is one of the more effective ways to grow a quality fan community.<br />\n\tThe Like Box will \u00a0get you more fans, but NOT move your existing website traffic over to Facebook.</p>\n<p>Strategy #2: Target Friends of Fans with Facebook \"Like Ads\"</p>\n<p>Here's why \"Like Ads\" work like gangbusters:</p>\n<p>\tThese ads are the\u00a0simplest\u00a0ads to set up, and the cheapest too.<br />\n\tWhen you attract fans who are friends with your existing fans, you are more likely to attract a \"quality\" fan.<br />\n\tWhen you run Like Ads, your exposure, reach and impact on Facebook increases quickly.</p>\n<p>Strategy 3: Increase Your Engagement<br />\nHere's how engagement will help you attract more fans:</p>\n<p>\tOne of the most common reasons why people on Facebook struggle to get more fans is that they don't have any engagement on their Facebook page. When you don't have engagement you won't be seen in the news feed and the news feed is where all the action is on Facebook.<br />\n\tWhen you get people talking about you on Facebook (liking your posts, commenting and sharing your content) your exposure organically increases (meaning you don't have to pay for the engagement, it just happens natuarally). \u00a0When your exposure increases, your fan base increases.<br />\n\tI will show you how to make sure you never have another moment where you say, \"I can't think of anything to post on my Facebook page today!\"</p>\n<p>Remember! \u00a0This episode is\u00a0Part 1 of a 3 Part Mini Facebook Training. \u00a0In episode 8 I will show you how to promote your programs, products and services on Facebook and in episode 9 I'll show you the smartest strategies to use when selling on Facebook. \u00a0So make sure you don't miss those upcoming sessions!<br />\nItems mentioned in this episode include:</p>\n<p>\tWordpress Like Box Plugin<br />\n\tLike Box from the Facebook Developer Site<br />\n\tPDF: \u00a0Step-by-Step Details on How to Create a Facebook Like Ad<br />\n\tHow to Install Facebook's Power Editor<br />\n\t5 Killer Strategies to Skyrocket Your Facebook Engagement</p>\n<p>Right click to download the .mp3.</p>\n<p>Click Here to Subscribe via RSS (non-iTunes feed)</p>\n<p>Click here to download the transcript.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.com/2013/04/007-how-to-get-more-facebook-fans/\" rel=\"nofollow\">#007: How to Get More Facebook Fans</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.amyporterfield.", "duration": "37:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/91/95/73/919573d5-856d-7eef-60af-90366029c195/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/amyporterfield/Amy_Porterfield_Ep_7.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["Podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 594703545, "seriesTitle": "Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield", "pubDate": 1364482732, "title": "#006: 5 Systems to Put in Place Before You Launch Your Next Program, Product or Service", "author": "Amy Porterfield: Entrepreneur, Social Media Marketing Strategist, and Online Marketer", "summary": "<p>On this episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy Podcast, I interview Anne Samoilov, on the topic of online launches.

To help you better understand each strategy, I've included image examples below:<br />\nExperiment with Facebook Offers<br />\nFacebook Offers are a FANTASTIC list building strategy. \u00a0Offers are highly valuable because they get out into the news feeds of fans, friends of fans and non-fans, depending on your targeting focus.</p>\n<p>Step 1: Create Your Facebook Offer and Promote it with a Facebook Ad</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Step 2: An Email is Set to the Facebook User's Personal Email</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Step 3: Drive Traffic from the Email to Your Opt-In Opportunity</p>\n<p>YouTube List Building Strategies<br />\nIt\u2019s important to strategically leverage your videos to drive traffic to your opt-in opportunities.
