When introducing a new product or service, do you really have to \u201cgo big\u201d, or can it really be done with minimal stress and effort?</p> <p>You might feel stuck because you don\u2019t have a support team in place and launching something live adds a certain level of pressure, but if you set the right intention from the start, an \u201ceffortless launch\u201d can happen for you.</p> <p>James\u2019 team had a successful promotion last summer using only emails to sell a $49/month membership product. This generated about $40,000 in revenue, so it was not only effortless, but also lucrative.</p> <p>He notes that big launches aren\u2019t sustainable or something that can be done every month, or every quarter, as that would lead to a certain level of burnout.</p> <p>First step, you need to define what a launch means to you. What ingredients, or pieces go into a launch? Giving your customers a free experience with value, content and information will set the stage and create the desire. When doing this you need to identify that problem and address what the possible solution is. Once the offer is presented and objections are addressed, a deadline has to be set. By offering the right offer to the right audience, you are giving them the opportunity, or reason, to take action <em>now</em>!</p> <p>Most people online are sharing their top-level sales numbers, which often leads to comparison. It\u2019s easy to fall into this trap, but are we really comparing the same things? It\u2019s important to know all of your numbers when launching, including such items as refunds, affiliate payouts, advertising costs and more. Knowing how to minimize your costs will make your next launch more efficient and improve your bottom-line.</p> <p>Launches can take a lot of time to manage and then build rapport with your community after the promotion, which is why Phoebe says you need to consider the opportunity cost of everything involved.</p> <p>Give yourself permission to do less! It\u2019s easy to keep adding more elements to your launch, but what is the minimal amount of components needed to generate the desired results? This known as the \u201cMVP\u201d, or minimal viable product/promotion).</p> <p>At the end of the day, the offer is 99% of it. Marketers may have a great product, but they can struggle with communicating how it will solve the problem for someone.</p> <p>There are three P\u2019s to an offer: the promise, price and the process. The promise is the transformation, results or way out of the problem they are experiencing. Price is the actual cost of the offer, and the process is how you are fulfilling your promise and delivering (via online courses with modules, bonuses, video training, resources, etc.).</p> <p>James feels that if you actually listen to what your people want, putting together an offer becomes really easy. A great offer isn\u2019t just great because the customer gets what he or she wants, but because you\u2019ve communicated it effectively to the person. This is why knowing your audience is so crucial!</p> <p>One of his highest converting launches had no sales page and people were directed to a checkout page with no sales script, after having been directed there from a webinar. He likes to use this classic framework, of \u201chere\u2019s what I\u2019ve got, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do for you and here\u2019s how you get it.\u201d</p> <p>An important component to add to this is irresistible urgency by setting a deadline. However, you don\u2019t want to cheapen your brand by discounting your offer. Instead, add to the offer by stacking it with content and items that make it unbelievable to those that are buying it.</p> <p>All ready to launch your product? Consider what\u2019s the least amount of work and elements needed to still see maximum results \u2013 and give your audience the reason to take action now!\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/9/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 009: The Launch Aftermath</a></p>", "duration": "37:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode082EffortlessLaunching_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1488360600, "title": "Episode 081: Non-Salesy Copy That Converts with Ray Edwards", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On today\u2019s show, James and Phoebe are joined by Ray Edwards, a sought-after copywriter, author, speaker and communications strategist (and true legend!) who has worked with some of the most recognizable names in the industry. Ray discusses the conflict we often have about wanting to be of service to others while making money at the same time, the distinction between manipulating and persuading your audience, and so much more.</p> <p>James feels that everything comes down to copy, and to improve any aspect of your life, communication has to be involved in some way.</p> <p>Ray started his journey by entering the radio business at the age of 14. He realized from the beginning that it was the salespeople, and not the on-air personalities, driving the nice vehicles. He befriended the sales staff and their clients and began coming up with promotional ideas and writing ad copy for them.</p> <p>After 30 years in the radio business, Ray recognized that technology and the Internet were changing the way content was being consumed. He knew he had a talent to create copy that motivated people to buy, and he transferred this skill to the online world.</p> <p>Ray missed being on radio and got into podcasting, by hosting his own weekly show. He shares that the medium has had an enormous impact on his business, and that it allows him to get in his audience\u2019s ears, without censoring his content.</p> <p>He\u2019s an introvert, which has been both a struggle and a gift, and he\u2019s had to manage how much time he\u2019s in and out of the spotlight.</p> <p>Ray believes that copywriting is like any skill; there are people that are born with an innate talent for it, and there are others that have to work to get good at the art. Someone can get good at copywriting with enough desire and practice, but he feels that to get to the level of being great, it takes a special gift.</p> <p>James wrote his own copy for 9 years and hired out for it during his last launch. He was always resistant to doing this, but admits that he could really see the difference in the quality of work done by a professional copywriter versus his own.</p> <p>To Ray, copywriting is simply constructing language in a way that persuades people to either believe something you want them to believe, or do something that you want to do.</p> <p>He stresses that you must learn to sell; if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll no longer be in business. However, it\u2019s important to do this in a humane and heart-centered way while coming from a place of service. The most effective selling happens when you actually care about the people that you\u2019re selling to!</p> <p>Ray adds that it\u2019s good to want more money and to succeed in business. This means that you\u2019re really helping people over the long-term as they keep wanting to give you money for what you do.</p> <p>James says that people don\u2019t value what\u2019s for free and there\u2019s something magical that happens when someone steps up to invest in something, and his or herself. In fact, most of his testimonials come from his paying clients, not someone that got the product for free.</p> <p>Ray does put quality content in his sales copy though to give to his audience something for free, as a way of compensating them for their time to read his material.</p> <p>There is a line that is fairly visible between ethical and \u201csalesy.\u201d To Ray, it comes down to the intent of the seller, and also his or her ability to accurately assess how helpful the product is to the purchaser.</p> <p>There is a difference between manipulation and persuasion. Manipulation uses external pressure, such as embarrassment, to get someone to do something. With persuasion, internal pressure is used and it highlights the true inner need that the person has</p> <p>Ray realized early on that as an individual providing services, he could only work with so many people. For that reason, he started offering products to help multiple people, starting with group phone calls and leading to courses that people could purchase to learn from him.</p> <p>Storytelling is one of Ray\u2019s favourite topics and he says that you absolutely must use it because it\u2019s the most powerful way of communicating with, and persuading, others.</p> <p>He learned from Donald Miller of StoryBrand that a good story has a character with a problem, who meets a guide that offers a solution and a plan. The character can either follow the plan and enjoy the success, or not do this and meet failure.</p> <p>Ray says to make sure the story relates to the listener you\u2019re selling to; you\u2019re not the hero of the story, they are. Also, the story you should tell is the one you\u2019re most afraid to!</p> <p>If you try to \u201csqueeze\u201d your brain for a story, it will refuse to co-operate in these moments. Every time a new story happens to him, Ray writes it down to refer to later, and he uses bullet points and tags the themes to remind him of what the story is about, or what lesson it is trying to teach.</p> <p>It\u2019s the seemingly small or insignificant stories that people will really relate to. Ray suggests people \u201cbath\u201d in their stories, and he uses the following acronym for coming up with your own stories: Make them <strong>B</strong>rave, <strong>A</strong>uthentic, <strong>T</strong>ransformative and <strong>H</strong>ealing!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://rayedwards.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ray\u2019s Website</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/Ray\" target=\"_blank\">Ray\u2019s Free Training Series</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/71/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 071: The Power Of Your Story</a></p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.danpink.com/books/to-sell-is-human/\" target=\"_blank\">To Sell Is Human</a></em> by Daniel H.

Her online programs and guided courses help people to change their brains, to remove negative core beliefs and to draw abundance into their lives. Today she shares all about self-states, what to do when you get triggered and ultimately, how to gain a deeper sense of awareness.</p> <p>Like most clinicians and therapists, Dr. Mcayla shares that she grew up with dysfunction but didn\u2019t really know what her story was until she was asked to speak about it at an event.</p> <p>She realized that she grew up with certain lies in her head about herself. Not wanting to ignore it, she was curious to understand herself, while helping others. This led to the study of the brain and neuroscience.</p> <p>Dr. Mcayla didn\u2019t just want to train people to manage their lives, but rather to start real change with them. She wanted to find a specific modality to specialize in, which led to EMDR, or \u201ceye movement desensitization and reprocessing.\u201d This modality focuses specifically on core beliefs, and how we can actually change them.</p> <p>Although the brain is often talked about, she notes that the mind isn\u2019t and there is still a lot to learn about the psyche.</p> <p>She shares that as we grow up, we\u2019re constantly defining ourselves, especially during deep sleeps or when in REM mode. This is done so that our brain comes up with some sort of solution of what it says about ourselves. However, as a child, the brain doesn\u2019t have much logic and we end up filling in the gaps. We often do this with distorted truths that become our core beliefs. This is an issue because as we get older, we don\u2019t go back and re-assess these beliefs to determine if they are in fact true.</p> <p>95% of our actions, feelings and behaviors come from the subconscious mind, but not many of us know what we actually have there. Dr. Mcayla stresses that there\u2019s a difference between what we know to be true, and what we feel to be true, and she says that a core belief is anything that feels true to us.</p> <p>Our core beliefs create a guideline to what\u2019s possible, but our egos will resist anything that challenges us to grow as it\u2019s programmed to help us survive. This is why most people have learned how to survive, but few have learned how to really live.</p> <p>James survived by being invisible when he was younger, which is a big contradiction of the personal brand that he is today. He admits that it\u2019s taken a lot of mindset work for him to get to the point where he is today.</p> <p>Dr. Mcayla\u2019s work also focuses on self-states, or the bundles of information that are living in our subconscious minds and make up a memory. When we are resistant or fearful, usually it\u2019s because of these self-states.</p> <p>The role of the subconscious mind is to look and appear normal in society, at all times. For that reason, it will push back memories that don\u2019t make us look good. However, these thoughts are still very much active in our minds.</p> <p>She explains that we can\u2019t lose our self-worth, but when things happen in life we feel like we have, and we\u2019ve suddenly become \u201cnot good enough.\u201d We then spend the rest of our lives trying to become worthy again, which becomes a cycle.</p> <p>Society doesn\u2019t define our truths; what defines us is the kind of person we are. We can\u2019t trust our perceptions as they are often not based in logic and can be distorted. Dr. Mcayla notes adds that if we don\u2019t gain self-awareness, then we\u2019ll simply accept our present circumstances because we are looking at them through a distorted lens of the past.</p> <p>EMDR allows us to reprocess a memory associated with a belief by using bi-lateral movements. The ultimate goal of EMDR is to open up communication between the conscious and subconscious minds and James found that it gave him a deeper appreciation of how much importance he was giving the opinions of others.</p> <p>Dr. Mcayla reminds others not to take their perceptions to be real. Never stop wondering and asking questions; stay on your journey as we can be either in survival mode, or be truly living!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://drmcayla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Mcayla\u2019s Website</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/71/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 071: The Power Of Your Story</a></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Mazing-ebook/dp/B004CR6AM4\" target=\"_blank\">Who Moved My Cheese?</a></em> by Spencer Johnson</p>", "duration": "01:14:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode080StopSurvivingStartLiving_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1487583000, "title": "Episode 079: Essential Ingredients to Your Inevitable Success", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode, James and Phoebe explore what\u2019s really needed to take a new business to 7, 8 or even 9-figures. Is this even possible, and if so, what\u2019s holding you back? Grab your pen, because today they\u2019re sharing the essential ingredients that will get you to that next level!</p> <p>First, it helps to define what success means to you. You really can\u2019t have money as the only measure of this, as you\u2019ll have to weigh the costs associated with achieving a certain level of \u201csuccess.\u201d This could include considering the sacrifices you will make to your health.</p> <p>Entrepreneurs are always building their businesses or vision, but tend to never really stop to consider what it will look like when finished.</p> <p>To Phoebe, <strong>confidence</strong> and an openness and ability to sort our your personal stuff is a key ingredient of success. James notes that true confidence comes when you have <strong>self-worth</strong>. If you\u2019re always driven to compensate for worthiness, what you get will never really be enough. Confidence is a state of being, and it can\u2019t be described until you have it! This also ties into <strong>acceptance;</strong> both of the good and bad sides of yourself.</p> <p>Taking full <strong>responsibility</strong> for everything that happens in your life is a lot harder than you may think, but necessary. Don\u2019t play the victim, and stop blaming the economy, politicians and even technology for where you are today. It\u2019s up to you; take action and responsibility for your own results!</p> <p><strong>Patience</strong> and the ability to commit to the long game, instead of looking for instant gratification, will help get you to where you want to go in life. A lot of times, by taking action just to do something, you\u2019ll be inefficient and no further ahead. Know that your success is inevitable, and don\u2019t let the fear of it not working out steer you, which will ultimately steer your results.</p> <p>A <strong>commitment</strong> to yourself and what you want, as well as to the service of others, is a common characteristic of successful people. Often we minimize what we know and our gifts because our gifts are what comes the most easy to us. Use them to help others and have them impact someone else\u2019s life, which is an extraordinary experience. As well, having <strong>compassion</strong> for others, and being able to put yourself in their situation, is a key ingredient that entrepreneurs are often missing.</p> <p>A big piece\u00a0of being an entrepreneur is financial, and you have to <strong>get comfortable with asking\u00a0</strong>for money, or your worth. This can be the scariest part of this whole process (but also the most fun). The transformation starts at the transaction and you really just have to get over this fear and ask!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/71/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 071: The Power Of Your Story</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance/dp/1477800832\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Rise of Superman</em></a> by Steven Kotler</p>", "duration": "01:03:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode079WhatsMissing.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1487151000, "title": "Episode 078: What It Takes To Launch", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On today\u2019s episode, James talks with Online Business Strategist Zach Spuckler about the major mindset shifts he has made over the last year that\u2019s enabled him to grow his business exponentially. Zach also shares an effective alternative to doing a really big launch, which you won\u2019t want to miss!</p> <p>When Zach first joined James\u2019 Inner Circle Mastermind a year ago, he worked by himself and had just hit the 6-figure mark in his business. He now has a team made up of multiple people, but notes that it was the inner work he did that allowed him to expand to this.</p> <p>Zach admits that he used to be a workaholic, and that his health started to suffer because of this. He had to step back and ask himself why he originally wanted to start the business, which was to have freedom. Here are just a few of his major breakthroughs:</p> <p><strong>Hire a team</strong></p> <p>Hiring his first VA helped give Zach the systems, and space to grow. During his last launch, he realized that hiring was never an external issue, but he was so busy working that he didn\u2019t know internally what he really wanted.</p> <p>He says that it\u2019s not difficult to find exactly what you want when looking for someone to help; be clear about what you want and need, and put it out to your online community!</p> <p>James believes it\u2019s important to ask yourself what it\u2019s costing you to not hire someone. How could you fill that time and space by doing something else that focuses on the big vision of your company and drives revenue?</p> <p>The internal struggle may get quieter at the level you\u2019re at, but it will start back up again at the next level and will always be there in some form or another. When you think that you\u2019re ready to hire somebody, Zach recommends you trust yourself to take the risk and to handle the fallout if it doesn\u2019t work out, or find people to support you if this should happen.</p> <p>James feels it\u2019s important to know that a lot of people have an illusion that they have to get rid of the fear around hiring or investing in themselves before doing it, but this just isn\u2019t the case.</p> <p><strong>Entrepreneurs are rewarded for taking the risks</strong></p> <p>Remember that other people will love doing the tasks that you assign them, and you don\u2019t have to feel guilty for giving them work. Zach says it was important for him to understand that his team wouldn\u2019t resent him for this and they respect him for giving them work and paying them for their time. As an entrepreneur, you can actually enjoy your life and business, while at the same time empowering your team to grow with you! James likes to remind others that part of the \u201cwork\u201d is actually resting so that you can recharge yourself.</p> <p><strong>Charge more money</strong></p> <p>As Zach has \u201clevelled up,\u201d he charges more so that he can create intimacy with his higher-level clients. By charging more, he also attracts the right clients. If you don\u2019t increase your prices, he says that the only thing you\u2019re doing is de-valuing yourself in the process.</p> <p>James adds that so often people base their pricing on what people will pay for the product or service, which can be a mistake as there will always be people that can, or can\u2019t afford it at every level.</p> <p>Zach realizes that as his business grows, everything he does has an opportunity cost and his time is limited. He is careful not to undercharge so that he can continue to serve others through his business.</p> <p>Pricing really comes down to valuing yourself and it\u2019s important to have a logical conversation with yourself and know the true value of what you can offer.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s an easier (and lighter) way to launch</strong></p> <p>Zach notes that so many people get paralyzed by the thought of launching. Webinars can take many months to perfect, and video series can be expensive and time consuming. You don\u2019t have to get overwhelmed though; by doing a challenge (or a \u201cweek long event\u201d as Zach likes to call it), you don\u2019t even have to charge people money for them to have the opportunity to see what it\u2019s like to work with you.</p> <p>When doing a challenge, you just have to show up, give them simple step-by-step tasks and let them prove to themselves, and you, that transformation is possible.</p> <p>Remember, people <em>want</em> to be sold to on the last day of the event, just because you\u2019ve shown them what\u2019s possible. Show your audience what you can do for them and let them decide if you\u2019re a great fit or not!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jameswedmore.com/challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Plan & Build Your 5-Day $10,000 Challenge-Style Launch</a></p>", "duration": "56:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode078WhatItTakesToLaunch_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1486978200, "title": "Episode 077: Tapping Into Abundance", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On today\u2019s show, James and Phoebe are joined by Melanie Bundock, an Emotional Freedom Technique practioner and creator of the <em>Tapping Into Abundance</em> online program. Melanie shares what EFT is all about, as well as taking listeners through an actual tapping session that can help shift emotional states and release any blocks that might be present!</p> <p>Melanie has worked with James, using EFT to help him with the stress and anxiety he has around flying. Phoebe shares that she\u2019s had experiences with EFT as well and recently has seen some positive results from it.</p> <p>Melanie says that as humans, we are all governed by our emotions. EFT is used to free us from our emotions and it has a many benefits associated with its use.</p> <p>She was a licensed therapist offering reiki and reflexology, when she noticed that clients were coming to her with emotional-based problems. She became fascinated with EFT and trained to be a practitioner, so she could use it with clients.</p> <p>Melanie adds that EFT is about getting to the root cause of the problem much quicker, and it often has longer last effects than other methods. It involves tapping with the fingers at certain points of the body, which relate to different emotions.</p> <p>Tapping can be a useful tool for entrepreneurs, as they often feel stuck or that they\u2019re not good enough.</p> <p>When not feeling good, it\u2019s key to be aware of this. When you are aware of your emotions, that is the first step and you are then able to do something about it. EFT can help you feel more calm, inspired and motivated, and with tapping you are able to choose your feelings.</p> <p>Melanie herself has gained awareness around the emotions surrounding money. When we\u2019re able to spend freely, it feels good, but when money is lacking that is when anxiety, worry and stress starts to creep in.</p> <p>Her recent course launch was a great success, with many participants having breakthrough moments, particularly when they realized the different money stories they had been carrying around with them all of their lives.</p> <p>She notes that when we take bold, inspired action without fear, like she did by releasing her course, that is when the rewards come.</p> <p>Melanie uses tapping with a vision board, as well as visualization, to help her clients get back into alignment with their visions.</p> <p>There are many common stories that people tell themselves that will keep them from abundance. Some examples are, \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t grow on trees,\u201d and \u201cYou have to work hard to make money or be successful.\u201d</p> <p>There can be an element of guilt felt when money comes too easily, and a tapping session can clear these beliefs and bring back the state of possibility!</p> <p>When using tapping, one first must acknowledge the problem or belief. This is similar to finding a weed that needs to be uprooted from a garden. Once they are cleared out, positive language or affirmations are incorporated into the session. It\u2019s helpful to determine on a scale of 1 to 10 how true the belief is to you, and to monitor your progress throughout the session.</p> <p>If something is upsetting you emotionally, you can try tapping. Give it a go, because you never know where this technique could lead you!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://melaniebundock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Melanie\u2019s Website</a></p> <p>Melanie\u2019s Online Program, <a href=\"http://melaniebundock.com/tia\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tapping Into Abundance</em></a></p>", "duration": "01:00:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode077TappingIntoAbundance_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1486546200, "title": "Episode 076: Breakthroughs with Surveys", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Are you marketing yourself online and feel like your message is falling flat? Maybe people aren\u2019t getting your offer and you\u2019re looking for a way to connect with your audience? On today\u2019s show, James looks at how using surveys (the right way!) can lead to more effective messaging and more sales. He shares the right questions to ask, how to ask them so you\u2019ll get people to actually fill out your survey, the software he recommends and most importantly, how to properly interpret the answers you receive.</p> <p>Your online niche is most likely always evolving, and surveys are a powerful way to stay in touch with your marketplace.</p> <p>When it comes to strategies to use with your surveys, Ryan Levesque has an excellent book, <em><a href=\"http://getaskbook.com/\">Ask.</a></em> In his book, he talks about the \u201cone question\u201d survey, which simply proposes the following question:</p> <p><em>When it comes to _________, what is the number one biggest struggle or frustration you have right now?</em></p> <p>Your job is to get really specific on the topic when you ask this question. The more specific the phrasing is, the more specific answers you will receive.</p> <p>When you give your audience specific instructions for completing the survey question, ask them to be as detailed as possible and try to deter one-word answers such as \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cmoney.\u201d</p> <p>By having this question by itself on a page, it\u2019ll have the full attention of the reader. There are follow-up questions that James notes can be used effectively as well. If you ask for the person\u2019s name, email and phone number, but make this optional. The people who do give you this information will be your more qualified prospects!</p> <p>\u00a0<strong>James\u2019 six-question survey:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.\u00a0Have you ever tried _________? If no, why not?</strong></p> <p>Asking this will qualify the prospect, and the \u201cwhy not\u201d part gives you a list of the person\u2019s objections.</p> <p><strong>2.\u00a0What is the biggest obstacle or struggle that you are currently facing?</strong></p> <p>Here you are looking for the problem, or source of pain for him or her.</p> <p><strong>3.\u00a0What are the negative consequences of this struggle?</strong></p> <p>By digging deeper, you will discover why it\u2019s such a problem for them and what they are afraid will happen.</p> <p><strong>4.\u00a0What is your ideal solution to this problem?</strong></p> <p>When this question is answered, they actually tell you what they\u2019re looking for which is extremely valuable information for you to have!</p> <p><strong>5.\u00a0What are the positive consequences and results of solving this problem?</strong></p> <p>This will tell you where they are heading, or what they are moving towards, in their own words.</p> <p><strong>6.\u00a0If you had the chance to ask me one question, what would it be?</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong>Towards the end of this podcast episode, James actually gives the one question that people ask him most often, as well as his answer\u2026</p> <p>You can use either the one-question survey, the six-question one or a combination of the both. It\u2019s important though to only send whatever you decide to use to your own list or community. Asking another group of people to complete your survey might not lead to answers from your ideal client.</p> <p>There are multiple software platforms you can use to create your surveys, including Google Forms, which is free. However, James\u2019 recommends looking at <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">Survey Monkey</a> or <a href=\"https://surveyfunnel.io/\">Survey Funnel</a>, which have more features and functions, as well as the ability to ask just one question per page.</p> <p>How do you interpret all of the survey results? First, read them all. It helps to print them out and read the question each time out loud, followed by the answer. Better yet, you can have someone else read them to you. The important thing is not to judge the responses, and to just be present with the words. Someone might not be able to fully communicate what he or she is trying to say with just words, but you can still feel the energy or emotion behind the response.</p> <p>It is helpful to tally the answers to see what\u2019s the most popular problem that others are facing. James created a big poster board and explains how he used it to analyze the problems and possible solutions. Interpreting this information could lead you to your next offer, course, podcast episode, blog or email to your list!</p> <p>Ultimately it\u2019s not about the quantity of completed surveys received, it\u2019s all about the quality of your interpretation and how you are able to use the information in your business.\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.JamesWedmore.com/iTunes\" target=\"_blank\">Share Your Review on iTunes!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jameswedmore.com/survey\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started With Surveys \u2013 James\u2019 Free PDF</a> or text \u201csurvey\u201d to 5202177548\u00a0</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://getaskbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ask.</a></em> by Ryan Levesque</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Survey Monkey</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://surveyfunnel.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Survey Funnel</a></p>", "duration": "33:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode076BreakthroughsWithSurveys_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1486373400, "title": "Episode 075: Launch Your Podcast", "author": "", "summary": "<p>To celebrate more than a full year of episodes for The Mind Your Business Podcast, James and Phoebe share what did, and didn\u2019t work for them. Launching your podcast is a big deal, and today they give you 8 simple (but effective) strategies to help you launch your very own show!</p> <p>A common mistake made by podcasters is not launching their show sooner. Both James and Phoebe admit this was the case for them, as they recorded the first episodes in September 2015, but waited until January of the following year to air them.</p> <p>For James, podcasting was a transition as he was used to filming YouTube videos, in a much different style than used in the podcast medium. Like anything, it takes a little bit to hit your stride and podcasting is no different. After 10 to 12 episodes the recording process becomes more natural, but the key is to just start and launch it!</p> <p><strong>8 Strategies For Launching Your Podcast:\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Strive to get into iTunes \u201cNew & Noteworthy\u201d</strong></p> <p>Higher exposure on iTunes will help get your name out to more people. Over the first 8 weeks, maximize both the amount of episodes you have as well as the downloads by listeners, many who will \u201cbinge listen\u201d to your new podcast content.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good idea to do your research to know what category to list your show in, as well as for what title, keywords and images you should use. Looking at what other podcasters are doing is one way to verify that you\u2019re on the right track when it comes to these details.</p> <p><strong>2.\u00a0Batch as many episodes as possible</strong></p> <p>Batching many episodes right from the start allows you to launch with a good amount of content for new listeners (minimum 5 to 10 episodes) and to have plenty to release over the following weeks. This will allow you to build a strong following going forward and it gives you a better chance of having the iTunes algorithm recognize your efforts over those first critical weeks and months.</p> <p><strong>3.\u00a0Have a pre-launch promotion</strong></p> <p>Like a product launch, with a new podcast you need to get the word out! Build anticipation for your upcoming launch and let future listeners know what they can expect.</p> <p>If you need to decide between multiple tag lines or images, you can put it out to your Facebook community and ask followers to vote for which ones they prefer. The pre-launch will not only get others excited, but it will get you excited and give you momentum for the launch. You can do many other things like emailing surveys to your list about what topics they would like to see covered, as well as investing in paid ads to promote your show. You can also retarget visitors to your website and even create a Facebook group specifically for listeners.</p> <p>You don\u2019t to have all of your promotion strategies planned out in the beginning, and just as your podcast will evolve, your strategies will too.</p> <p><strong>4.\u00a0Include a \u201ccall to action\u201d download in every episode</strong></p> <p>Having clickable links in the show notes to resources mentioned during the episode can be valuable for your listeners, and including opt-ins can build an email list for you to communicate with regarding the podcast.</p> <p>Listing past, and future episodes (once planned out), in the show notes can boost your downloads as well as the anticipation for upcoming content you\u2019ll be releasing.</p> <p><strong>5.\u00a0Hire a podcast editor</strong></p> <p>It can be a lot of work to do all the post-production tasks associated with your podcast, like editing, mixing, uploading and show notes. By outsourcing these tasks, you\u2019ll free up more time to devote to other things like the promotion of your podcast. Just make sure you have an upfront discussion with the person you hire about your expectations to ensure the show notes are written in the style you want, as every show can be different.</p> <p><strong>6.\u00a0Set a schedule and be consistent</strong></p> <p>To not get overwhelmed, releasing a new episode once a week is a good frequency to start with it. Focus on quality over quantity when it comes to your podcast!</p> <p><strong>7.\u00a0Repurpose your show on other platforms</strong></p> <p>With a podcast, you have a powerful opportunity to leverage your content using different channels, such as reposting audio to YouTube as video. Look at all of the various options you can use to promote and drive traffic to your podcast.</p> <p><strong>8.\u00a0Host a review contest</strong></p> <p>A contest can provide incentive to your listeners and give you a big boost right out of the gate! The right contest can get you well on the way to 50 to 100 reviews on iTunes, and there are many options out there to help you create an effective giveaway.</p> <p>If you\u2019re an online brand or influencer, you NEED some sort of way to put your content out to the world.

Well, there\u2019s no structure or 7-step checklists in this one, but James and Phoebe do have a candid and casual conversation on everything from fear, the problems with goal setting, what part passion plays in success and so much more!</p> <p>Do you have a fear getting in the way of launching your own podcast, product or business? Phoebe is working on this herself as she\u2019s changing directions in her own business. To get over it, she\u2019s learned to trust herself and realize that the fear is part of her entrepreneurial journey.</p> <p>James adds that if your product doesn\u2019t sell or \u201cflops,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean anything at all unless you let it. Consider what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen, and then come up with contingency plans based on this.</p> <p>Silicon Valley has a saying: fail fast, fail often and fail forward. You need to be the scientist in your business by always hypothesizing and testing things to see what works, and what doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>Goal setting can be a trap that we fall into in that a goal has nothing to do with who we are personally. It really just identifies what game we want to play, and when you\u2019re able to detach from the outcome of your goals, you will start to have more fun.</p> <p>If you do what you\u2019re passionate about, like helping others, then business growth is a natural by-product.</p> <p>You only learn by doing, and failing in the process. From a mindset perspective, there has to be a sense of \u201cknowing.\u201d You\u2019ve got to lead with this and let it guide you!</p> <p>According to James, self-doubt is the number one thing that\u2019s keeping you from getting what you want.</p> <p>Blend what you\u2019re passionate about with where you can provide value, and most importantly, where you can get paid (because it\u2019s a business after all)!</p> <p>Phoebe likes the idea of getting good at something and then it can become a passion, rather than pressuring yourself to determine what your passion is. James shares that action will help you get more specific on what your true passion is.</p> <p>James notes that an entrepreneur is the person who is always seeking the new opportunity, and he contrasts this with someone who is just a business owner.</p> <p>There is a direct correlation between being successful and the ability to reframe something that happens. There is always a positive in every circumstance.</p> <p>When the thought of sharing something online scares you, this is a good sign. When you start to reveal these things to others, you connect on a deeper level, but there is also a way of sharing too much online that can be counter-intuitive.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/how-to-set-goals-that-you-actually-accomplish/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Set Goals that you Actually Accomplish</a></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.deepspacesparkle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Patty Palmer, <em>Deep Space Sparkle</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://calnewport.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cal Newport</a></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280\" target=\"_blank\">The E-Myth Revisited</a></em> by Michael E.

In today\u2019s special bonus episode, James talks with Sage Lavine, CEO of Conscious Women Entrepreneurs and host of the International Women on Purpose summits. Sage shares her expertise on how you can crush it from stage, regardless if you are an introvert or an extrovert!</p> <p>For about the first 8 years, James\u2019 entire business had been made up of online courses and digital training. In the last year he\u2019s made an effort to make it more in-person with his community, and he and his team recently just hosted the largest live event that they have ever done.</p> <p>Sage notes that bringing yourself to the people that you serve is nourishing, and the attendees are really looking for a sense of belonging. Leaders are also being called into their truth or message and they need support from other people that are up to big things in the world today.</p> <p>Sage started her million-dollar business in her living room, with 12 other women sitting around on purple couches. She feels that it all comes down to desire, and if you want to be in front of your people she highly recommends doing it.</p> <p>There\u2019s feedback that you get from a live room that you\u2019re not going to get online, and \u201cconnection is currency.\u201d This feedback can include success stories from people that you have impacted.</p> <p>In a room there is more judgement than there would online. This can be scary, but Sage explains how judgment doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a bad thing.</p> <p>When hosting an event, having a partner to \u201chave your back\u201d is important.</p> <p>In order to drop the barrier when you get onstage, you need to be credible and then just be human and connect with the people that you\u2019re speaking to.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to be an extrovert to be on stage, and \u201chot seat\u201d sessions and lunches allow for others to interact and form relationships. Unlike a lot of times online, relationships formed in-person can be deep and last a lifetime.</p> <p>You have to flip the fear you feel when speaking and make it your friend. Sage says that when you feel the fear physically, such as in your throat or chest, it\u2019s actually a reminder for you to connect with those that you are serving.</p> <p>The fear that no one will show up to your live event is a common one, but live is a much different game than online. On a few occasions Sage had just one person show up for her speaking engagements, and in both cases she was hired by the person.\u00a0</p> <p>When you\u2019re live, you don\u2019t need many people to show up. Remember that leading events brings you credibility!</p> <p>Her favorite ways to fill a room include plugging into groups that are already meeting or contacting places like day spas that can help get the word out to people you want to reach.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to put together a full day of content when just getting started, and Sage recommends hosting two-hour events to start.</p> <p>She believes that the world is hungry for more introverted leaders, like James, because they tend to be more connected to themselves and a deeper truth.

Lana is a coach, author, mastermind facilitator and online program creator, and she shares the four modes of visioning that she uses to deliberately focus on what she wants in life, and how you can do the same!</p> <p>Lana came to the United States at the age of 12 after growing up in communist Russia, where she says she wasn\u2019t exposed to concepts like manifesting miracles and spirituality.</p> <p>She graduated with a degree in Political Economy from Berkeley, which led to a 6-figure salary in the financial services field. Despite this, Lana says that she was absolutely miserable.</p> <p>\u201cI worked so hard to get to this point, that it was always a carrot in front of me\u201d</p> <p>She left this job and moved to Southern California where she got a position as a success coach at a university, but made much less money doing this. This was her first taste of making an impact in the lives of others though, which she really enjoyed.</p> <p>Lana studied yoga and she taught it in Mexico, and then went to grad school to study psychology in order to find her own happiness and fill a void that she had felt ever since she was a child.</p> <p>After meeting her husband, with the assistance of a mid-wife she had twins that were born 33 hours apart. After living through miracles such as this, Lana wanted to teach clients how they too could create miracles in their own lives.</p> <p>\u201cIn the mind stuff, that\u2019s where the root of everything you want is\u201d</p> <p>To her, manifesting is actually being deliberate about what you create instead of doing it by default.</p> <p>Like the quote by Einstein, you have to decide whether nothing is a miracle, or everything is, according to Lana.</p> <p>\u201cMiracles are things that haven\u2019t happened yet; they are those sparks of inspiration\u201d</p> <p>She also says you need to understand the meaning of what\u2019s happened to you and why it did, and once you do this you can actually derive the benefit from your experiences.</p> <p>Lana believes you should celebrate things that seem small, like finding a penny, and the ways in which you attract elements of what you want.</p> <p>In her corporate role in the financial world, she shares that she was hard on herself and later realized that she was trying to hide a feeling of unworthiness. This led to her going from being a star analyst with the company to not being able to even function.</p> <p>Lana admits that she was suicidal at this point and that until you too hit rock bottom, it\u2019s hard to make those drastic changes in your life like she did.</p> <p>She wants people to not just take her world on what she teaches, but to try it out for themselves to see that it will work in their lives too.</p> <p>\u201cOnly experience teaches; words don\u2019t teach\u201d</p> <p>Once you realize that you are actually in charge of everything that happens in your life, you will see that we all have filters through which we perceive any circumstance.</p> <p>Lana adds that pain is an amazing teacher and it puts your back against the wall. Necessity is the mother of invention, but pain is the mother of transformation.</p> <p>She uses all of her experiences, even the painful ones, to create a life that is tailor-made for her, by her.</p> <p>Lana teachers other to slow down the momentum of undesirable things and add positive momentum. You can do this by meditating, going to the beach or doing something that you enjoy and just allow this to happen.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you do, as long as you step out of the patterns of thought that are keeping you stuck\u201d</p> <p>The more she allows herself to receive support from others and let them do what\u2019s in the zone of their genius, the easier her life and business has become.</p> <p><strong>Lana\u2019s Modes of Visioning:</strong></p> <p><strong>Guided Imagery (\"Visualization\")<br /> <br /></strong> Often referred to as visualization, you receive the idea and recognize when it\u2019s a great light or a red light. She creates a movie in her mind and focuses on the feeling more than anything.</p> <p><strong>Written Visioning (\u201cScripting\u201d)</strong></p> <p>This is where you put your intentions down on paper and describe how you want to feel. The act of writing it all down makes it more tangible!</p> <p><strong>Spoken Visioning</strong></p> <p>Again, how do you want to feel? Speak it out to yourself through affirmations, or to others in the form of a mastermind group.</p> <p><strong>Creative Expression</strong></p> <p>You can express your vision in a non-verbal way, or without written words. For her launch, Lana found a creative way to represent the participants on poster boards as an act of celebrating her accomplishments.</p> <p>Look for your own way of visioning and when you can deliberately focus on it, it will feel good and you\u2019ll be on your way to manifesting your own miracles!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:<br /></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jameswedmore2/\" target=\"_blank\">James' Facebook Page</a><strong><br /> <br /></strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/phoebemroczek1\" target=\"_blank\">Phoebe's Facebook Page\u00a0<br /></a><strong><br /></strong> <a href=\"http://www.lanashlafer.com/mindyourmiracles\" target=\"_blank\">Lana\u2019s Manifest Miracles Masterclass</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lanashlafer.com/visioning-series-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Lana\u2019s Visioning Series (Post #1 of 4)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/7/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 007: 5 Steps To Manifest Your Goals In Business</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/14/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 014: 5 Steps To Manifesting More Money</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/46/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 046: Ingredients for Manifesting</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/69/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 069: 13 Habits for Manifesting More Money</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/71/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 071: The Power Of Your Story</a></p>", "duration": "53:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode072ManifestingMiracles_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1484559000, "title": "Episode 071: The Power of Your Story", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Everybody has a story, and on today\u2019s episode, James and Phoebe explore why authentically sharing yours is so important to what you do!</p> <p>James admits that he has gotten by for 9 years without telling others much of his own story, but whenever and wherever you speak to others, the audience will be asking themselves why you do what you do. For this reason, your story becomes a powerful context that can entertain, educate and ultimately put all of their questions to rest.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you get clarity on (your) story, you get clarity on why you do what you do\u201d</p> <p>Although Phoebe hasn\u2019t been broke or homeless, she\u2019s suffered losses and personal heartbreak in a different way that allows her to connect with others.</p> <p>When selling, online especially, you need to share your truth so you can build that \u201cknow, like and trust\u201d factor that is needed with others.</p> <p>James realized that him minimizing his story is actually part of his story, and he figured out why he was doing that, which in turn has become a big part of his story as well.</p> <p>There are questions and prompts you can ask yourself, which will help you uncover your authentic story:</p> <ul> <li>How did I learn to survive?</li> <li>When did I actually start living?</li> <li>What was this defining moment?</li> </ul> <p>To answer these questions, you have to take a step back and look at the big picture that is your life, all of the events, and string them together to discover the meaning.</p> <p>James grew up with the belief that image and reputation was everything, as a result of his family being in real estate in a small community. He was giving other people\u2019s opinions so much power that in high school he made himself \u201cinvisible.\u201d</p> <p>In his 20\u2019s, he came to realize how small he was playing by having a personal brand, but still trying to be invisible at the same time. He found out though that everyone he was afraid was judging him was just as scared of the same thing happening to them.</p> <p>As a follow up question to \u201cHow did I learn to survive,\u201d you can ask yourself what has been the impact of that survival mechanism. What is the negative consequence and what does that keep you from?</p> <p>From a young age Phoebe was taught not to show emotions because they are a sign of weakness. Her defining moment was her dad passing away when she was 18 years old. The messages she told herself was that the people that you trust and love the most will always leave you. She survived by not trusting people, or letting them into her life, which eventually led to her appeasing and caring for people so much so they would love her and wouldn\u2019t end up leaving.</p> <p>James believes that we often don\u2019t tell our story, or minimize it, because we\u2019re trying to hide a piece of who we are. We\u2019re afraid that if we share that, something bad will happen. However, it\u2019s in the revealing of this that we can have the deepest connection with others.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in the personal brand space, your story is so essential.

We\u2019ve been raised to believe this, but for most people it just doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>When considering the concept of reality, there\u2019s a law of duality that states that the opposite exists for everything in this Universe, and one thing can\u2019t exist without its opposite. When he\u2019s sad or frustrated, James reminds himself that it\u2019s those times that will make him appreciate the good ones.</p> <p>As humans, we tend to put labels on everything and we can say that our physical reality actually requires our consciousness in order to make these differentiations and distinctions. Therefore, everything out there is only an interpretation that we have given it, but has no inherent meaning.</p> <p>He shares that when we experience an event, we then create an interpretation and from that interpretation we then create a belief, which really does lead to us creating our own realities.</p> <p>We all have beliefs, but the problem is that we don\u2019t see them as beliefs. When James attended a Tony Robbins event and was asked to write his down, he had trouble as he didn\u2019t walk around with a knowingness of what his beliefs were.</p> <p>A belief is simply a statement about reality that you think is <em>the</em> truth, versus just <em>a</em> truth. This literally colors how we see, experience and interpret the world outside of us. If we can stat looking at these beliefs, then we can have a real lasting change and impact in our lives.</p> <p>Our beliefs lead us to conclusions about our identity as a person, such as, \u201cI\u2019m not enough\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m not worthy.\u201d When people believe that they are not worthy until they are the best at something, their whole life will be run by that belief.</p> <p>You create the beliefs, and that means you are the creator of your life and your reality. This means that if you alter your beliefs, you begin to alter your reality and begin getting the results that you want!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/12/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 012: How To Get Motivated</a></p>", "duration": "34:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode070DoYouCreateYourOwnReality_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1483349400, "title": "Episode 069: 13 Habits for Manifesting More Money", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On today\u2019s show, James and Phoebe look at 13 habits that you can start using today to manifest more money, and more importantly more abundance, into your life.</p> <p>We all manifest what comes into our lives, but how can we hone and refine this? James manifested a Tesla car recently and shares a great story on how this came to be.</p> <p>The desire helps you identify what you truly want, but to truly get it, you have to act as though you already have it.</p> <p>Instead of trying to manifest more money, look at what you would do with the money. How would you spend it and what kind of experiences would you create for yourself and your family?</p> <p>James used to think that having more money would solve his problems. However, if we\u2019re thinking this way, we\u2019re actually doing things backwards and not manifesting abundance.</p> <p>For 2017, Phoebe is looking to create the experience at her home where she feels safe and secure, as well as being connected with friends. She\u2019s doing this instead of worrying and focusing on what products she\u2019ll be creating next year.</p> <p><strong>13 habits to manifest more money:<br /> <br /> 1) Practice gratitude<br /></strong><br /> Gratitude is what unlocks it all, as it is the attraction vibration. If we are talking about attracting more money, then we want to be grateful for the money that we do have. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur, try looking at the revenue you have generated and realize that the money you created can be huge.<br /> <br /> <strong>2) Identify all the negative beliefs you have around money</strong><br /> <br /> If you\u2019re not getting what you want, there\u2019s a belief getting in the way. The challenge is that these beliefs are subconscious, and they show up to you as truths.<br /> <br /> One common negative belief is that life is difficult. Thinking this way puts you in a lack mindset and if we hold on to this belief as being true, it doesn\u2019t allow for more money to come in easily. Another example of a negative belief is that you have to work hard for money, and in the past Phoebe thought that when she made money, someone else would suffer.<br /> <br /> <strong>3) Seek out abundance everywhere</strong><br /> <br /> You can find examples of abundance throughout nature: the grains of sand at the beach and the vast amounts of water in the ocean. Abundance is the anti-thesis of lack, which is the only thing keeping you from getting what you want.<br /> <br /> <strong>4) Use affirmations<br /></strong><br /> An example of an affirmation you can use is, \u201c All my money is working for me to increase my abundance and joy.\u201d Say it as if you are telling a friend, and make sure you really believe it. This will help you to start re-wiring your brain and changing your thought patterns.<br /> <br /> <strong>5) Clean out your wallet<br /></strong><br /> Invest in a nice wallet, or even just organize your current one in a way that makes you feel abundant! You can also try filling your wallet with as many hundred-dollar bills as possible and leave a note in it as a reminder that you are indeed abundant.<br /> <br /> <strong>6) Write out your financial goals</strong><br /> <br /> It\u2019s important to have your financial goals placed somewhere you\u2019ll see them every day. There are also exercises you can do with crystals, as well an incorporating Feng Shui into your lifestyle.<br /> <br /> <strong>7) Get complete with any outstanding debts</strong><br /> <br /> If you owe money, not paying back someone that put faith in you to do so won\u2019t help you attract abundance. Put a structure in place to tie up loose ends! If you are owed money, either be in communication with the person or drop the matter so it\u2019s not taking up your energy.<br /> <br /> <strong>8) Visualize \u201cgood\u201d sprinkling down on you</strong><br /> <br /> There are many similar mental exercises you can practice to help manifest abundance. Phoebe pictures the roof of her home opening up, with money filling her entire home!</p> <p><strong>9) Imagine your money flowing outwards</strong><br /> <br /> If you pay for something and it\u2019s an uncomfortable experience for you, you need to do some work around this. As you spend money, imagine where it is going and who it is helping. The more you do this, the more empowering relationship you\u2019ll have with spending money.<br /> <br /> <strong>10) Donate</strong><br /> <br /> You can donate time, money, or things that no longer serve you in your life to manifest abundance to you.<br /> <br /> <strong>11) Save your spare change<br /> <br /></strong> By doing this, you\u2019re telling The Universe that money is important to you, and money appearing to you is evidence that more will be coming to you in the future.<br /> <br /> <strong>12) Be open to different possibilities for how money will come to you<br /></strong><br /> Phoebe writes in a journal all the ways that money could come to her, and James looks at it as a radar screen that he can expand. This is where detachment comes in and things can come to you in ways that you never imagined.<br /> <br /> <strong>13) Practice manifesting something small<br /> <br /></strong> Try bringing in something that has nothing to do with money, such as a small toy or candy, which will help you build your \u201cmanifesting muscle.\u201d If you start too big, it\u2019ll lack believability and make it more difficult to do.<br /> <br /> Play around with two or three of these habits and see what happens! In the doing of these habits and exercises, there\u2019s an opportunity to have fun, to experiment and to discover the magic of possibility.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:<br /> <br /></strong> <a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/18/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 018: The Art of Feng Shui in Business with Karen Carter</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/66/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 066: Random Acts of Kindness</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/1/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 001: Why I Started This Podcast</a><br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Money-Abundance-Sanaya-Roman/dp/091581109X\" target=\"_blank\">Creating Money: Keys to Abundance by Sanaya Roman</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.daniellelaporte.com/thedesiremap/\" target=\"_blank\">The Desire Map by Danielle Laporte</a></em></p> <p><strong><br /> <br /></strong><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "54:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode069_13_Habits_for_Manifesting_More_Money_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1482139800, "title": "Episode 068: 12 Months From Now", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This is the time that our minds begin to wonder what is in store for us in the upcoming year, and we get to use our creative energy as a way to create our future. On today\u2019s show, James and Phoebe show how you can create an extraordinary year!</p> <p>For James, planning happens once you already know what the results are that you\u2019re after. You then need to figure out what the steps are to get it.</p> <p>As humans, we often allow the past to dictate and constrain what we create in the present, which ultimately affects our future.</p> <p>People tend to get stuck chasing \u201cmore\u201d of everything. This can be more work, more employees, more items on the to-do list, etc. The result of this is that you\u2019re still doing the same thing, just more of it. You can only play this game for so long, as you only have a finite amount of time and energy!</p> <p>He says that to get around this, ask yourself what your next 12 months will look like, but through the eyes of someone who has no prior beliefs, opinions or judgments about what is possible or realistic.</p> <p>As an exercise, take out a piece of paper and create three columns across the top: \u201cWins,\u201d \u201cWhy\u201d and \u201cLessons.\u201d Then mentally go through the past year and identify your wins, both big and small, why it was a win for you and what you have learned from each. With these lessons, consider how you can become a better person and grow because of them. Repeat the above process for your \u201closses.\u201d These will be the things that didn\u2019t quite go as planned during the previous year.</p> <p>Phoebe notes that with this exercise, you should examine all areas of your life, including spirituality, fun or adventure and health and fitness, and not just look at business activities.</p> <p>For her, her big win was her recent Sonoma event because it was something that she\u2019s wanted to do for a very long time. The lesson she learned was that imperfect action can create great momentum, and that she needs to trust her intuition more often. Finally, she learned that success comes when she remembers that it\u2019s not all about her, but it\u2019s about service to others.</p> <p>James shares that not hitting his downloads goal of 1 million in the first year of this podcast can be considered a loss for him. He looks at it like this because the results (about a half a million downloads this year) were pretty far off the goal, but the lesson that he took from this is that they\u2019ll be stepping up the promotional and marketing side of things in 2017.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to remember that this exercise shouldn\u2019t be used to judge yourself, keep score or compare yourself to others. It\u2019s really about the lessons; the more losses that you experience just means you\u2019ll learn more from each.</p> <p>The next step of the exercise is to (safely!) burn the paper, followed by saying this affirmation, or something similar to it:</p> <p><em>\u201cThank you for these experiences. I have learned all that I have needed to learn from this. This is it and it is perfect.

She found herself getting a block around hosting it this year, as she had planned, and the fear crept in.</p> <p>James says Phoebe had all the logical reasons as to why she should postpone it to next year, such has giving herself more time to plan if it was held in 2017, but what about all the people that were waiting for her to do this and would want to take part?</p> <p>Her turning point was when she started making it about other people and not herself. The more she let go of it and knew, trusted, and expected it to be the right event for the right people, that\u2019s when everything opened up for her. She took action despite her belief or story of it having to be perfect.</p> <p>James believes that people often wait for things to be perfect first to do it, and they really need to make it perfect in the doing of it, which is backwards to how most of us think.</p> <p><strong>Five things you can do now to take action:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Soften perfection</strong></p> <p>A lot of people have a great idea for a launch or product and want it to be an instant success. James let go of doing this a long time ago and attributes this for why their business has kept growing. He\u2019s never looking for the \u201chome run\u201d, but rather consistent base hits.</p> <p><strong>2) Create a deadline</strong></p> <p>We often throw deadlines out in life and don\u2019t follow them, but having a firm date is really key to following though on what you plan on doing.</p> <p><strong>3) Put some \u201cskin in the game\u201d!</strong></p> <p>In Phoebe\u2019s case, she had the platforms of a podcast and social media to declare her intentions of hosting the event by the end of 2016.</p> <p><strong>4) Remove all reasons or excuses</strong></p> <p>Start by at least identifying the reasons or excuses for not taking action, and remember that you can still produce the results you want despite of them.</p> <p><strong>5) Make it about the customer or end user</strong></p> <p>By making it about being of service to others and not just about yourself, you make it easier to take actions towards your goals.</p> <p>Throughout the two days of Phoebe\u2019s event, a common theme that kept coming up was that she was doing the best she could. She realized that she needed to appreciate the present moment and be proud of all that she had accomplished.</p> <p>To James, the most effective way to serve is to show up and be the person that your customers aspire to be.</p> <p>If we delay and try to take action that is \u201cperfect\u201d, we\u2019ll always be doing things that are safe and in our comfort zone so that we won\u2019t face potential rejection. However, the real magic happens just outside of our comfort zones.</p> <p>Scheduling the event and recording the podcast commercial announcing the event was really Phoebe\u2019s first steps outside of her comfort zone in this experience.</p> <p>For the launch of James\u2019 signature program, the message is similar to that of this podcast in that we always have to start with mindset first.</p> <p>Business by Design was an idea that he had since 2013, and he finally was able to get around a block he had around the name when he started creating the outline for the beta version. James feels the right name came to him at the right time because he took the inspired, or right action.</p> <p>Success doesn\u2019t have to do with a high level of energy expenditure, but rather a high level of courage and faith. Getting the right feedback was important for James and has helped his team almost beat the numbers of their last launch in less than two days of the cart being open.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a commitment to excellence and to your customers\u2019 success, then the rest will follow. Perfectionism is just another form of procrastination!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "42:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode067TakingImperfectionAction_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1480943695, "title": "Episode 066: Random Acts of Kindness", "author": "", "summary": "<p>It\u2019s been said that gratitude unlocks the fullness of life, and in this episode, James and Phoebe discuss how this has affected the both of them personally.

He shares that gratitude is an actual frequency you can resonate on.</p> <p>This frequency unlocks more in our lives, which is backwards to what we\u2019ve been taught.</p> <p>Many of us don\u2019t realize just how lucky we are, especially if we\u2019re online entrepreneurs, as the technology that is available now wasn\u2019t 10 or 15 years ago.</p> <p>Nothing motivates him more than the fact that he has the ability to help others.

With another new year almost here, she shares the things that we can do now in order to have an extraordinary tomorrow!</p> <p>Amber says that waiting until it\u2019s January is too late to start planning, and you need to take the time to plan well in advance. Having plans in place will set you up for better results throughout the upcoming year. James notes that doing this is the difference between being proactive, and being reactive.</p> <p><strong>6 strategies for an extraordinary new year:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Set effective goals</strong></p> <p>Amber recommends having a goal that you\u2019re working towards right now, as well as setting when you intend to meet it. What effort will you give to receive or attain this, and what financial target (or metric) will you use to gauge your success?</p> <p>Reflecting on prior years is a powerful tool, as well as assessing what is working, and what isn\u2019t working, throughout the current year. She adds that you can have one over-overarching goal, which then can be broken down into smaller ones.</p> <p>Almost anything can be turned into a tangible goal, but Amber notes that these goals have to align with your values, your beliefs and how you show up in the world. She feels that it\u2019s important to believe that the goal will happen, and if you don\u2019t believe, you\u2019ll end hustling and that\u2019s when the overwhelm occurs.</p> <p><strong>2. Manage your time</strong></p> <p>If you let yourself work 60 to 80 hours a week, the work you have to do will expand to fill the available time. Amber recommends creating a \u201ctime budget\u201d and make adjustments; she says that this will lead to the realization that you really don\u2019t need to work a lot of hours each week.</p> <p><strong>3. Focus on what matters</strong></p> <p>Consider if what you\u2019re doing is a revenue-generating activity, or just something that is draining energy. Bigger projects that lead to more revenue often take longer to complete than smaller items on your to-do list, but are necessary to grow your business. To determine if you should be doing a certain task, review your goals and see if completing it will get you closer to where you want to be.</p> <p>If something is able to be repeated, Amber recommends setting up a system so someone else will be able to do that activity. If you have your brand voice documented, another person can still write copy for you, even without a script.</p> <p><strong>4. Constantly check your energy</strong></p> <p>You should be checking on how you\u2019re feeling moment-to-moment and daily. Creating a time log that you can review can help determine why you\u2019re feeling a certain way. If something on your to-do list keeps getting pushed back, ask yourself why this is happening and clear some mental space by making a decision to delete, delegate or just do it.</p> <p><strong>5. Create a revenue plan</strong></p> <p>Small business owners that have a revenue plan in place grow 60% faster than those that don\u2019t. Amber says it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated, and can just be a simple calculation of how many products/services you intend to sell, to how many people. When we do this, we start to get intentional about where we spend our time and the revenue plan is a tangible way to see how our goals are going to be achieved.</p> <p>Look at your product suite holistically to see what worked last year and ask yourself what is happening in the marketplace. Consider who you want to serve, and if there are there gaps that you\u2019re noticing where you can introduce new offerings.</p> <p>Amber believes in a \u201cmargin for magic\u201d when building plans, and when she determines her own goals, she always looks at both the best-case and worst-case scenario.</p> <p><strong>6. Do the road map for the year</strong></p> <p>Amber writes out her road map for the year on an 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper, showing which activities to focus on and when. She adds that this road map is very high level, and she doesn\u2019t go into a lot of details; those will come when she does her 90-day, monthly, weekly and project plans.</p> <p>Finally, be flexible and don\u2019t take planning too seriously. Whatever planning you get done now is a perfect start and Amber says that you can always evolve as you go!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ThePlanathon.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.ThePlanathon.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/6/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 006: The 7 Steps To A Perfect Product Launch</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/17/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 017: The Margin for Magic with Kate Northrup</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.naphill.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d by Napoleon Hill</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FMindyourbusinesspodcast.com%2FSonoma&amp;h=DAQG7l_0Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/Sonoma</a></p>", "duration": "01:07:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode064_6StrategiesForAnExtraordinaryNewYear_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1477557000, "title": "Episode 063: What To Do With Negative Feedback", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this latest \u201cListener Question of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe explore the issue of negative feedback. When is it legitimate, and when is it just about someone else\u2019s \u201cstuff\u201d? They share tips of how to handle criticism, specifically if you\u2019re a creator in the online space.</p> <p>James shares that it\u2019s a fallacy that we need to be all things to everyone, and he\u2019s spent a lot of time over the years determining who his ideal customer is. As the saying goes, if you try to be everything to everyone, you really end up being nothing.</p> <p>Dealing with criticism is a skill that takes time to develop, and when you\u2019re a creator putting your work out to the world, it can leave you very vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re literally birthing something that is symbolic to who you are\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s only human nature that you\u2019re going to take things personally, and Phoebe adds that the Internet has created a layer where people can get a sense of entitlement to say whatever they want to, even if it would never happen in person.</p> <p><strong>Tips to deal with negative feedback:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Understand everyone has their own \u201cstuff\u201d</strong></p> <p>Everyone has a perception, or a lens of reality. Is it an interpretation, is it a story or is it real though? You could be doing or saying something that is causing people to push against change, or step out of their comfort zone, and their egos are just trying to keep them safe.</p> <p><strong>2. Look for <em>real</em> feedback</strong></p> <p>Realize again that if it feels personal to you, it really has nothing to do with you. To determine if the feedback is real or not, get rid of the adjectives, assumptions and interpretations that the person is using. Is there something that you can do better? For example, if someone wasn\u2019t able to attend your webinars, could you have done a better job of reminding them by sending more notifications? If this is the case, their feedback could be legitimate and there may be room for improvement in your product or service.</p> <p><strong>3. Find the consensus of the group</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong>You should be looking for trends in the feedback received. You may find something easy to add or amend, like a table of contents or more examples within your course if this is a common theme coming from participants.</p> <p><strong>4. Have a \u201cbuffer\u201d</strong></p> <p>If you have a team member that can give you his or her interpretation of the feedback, it can be helpful. This third-party person will not be as vulnerable as you are as the creator or personal brand.</p> <p>We tend to let the negative things said control us with fear. We may fear rejection, humiliation and the hatred of others, but in reality, these things really can\u2019t hurt us. If you care, it really shows that you\u2019re after continual improvement and quality in what you do and that you care about your customers.</p> <p>\u201cEven the best stuff is getting criticized; we can\u2019t let it stop us from doing what we\u2019ve been doing\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s such a huge opportunity when we receive any type of feedback, and staying open to it really is a choice that we can make. If your commitment and intention is pure and is designed to help people and provide value, you\u2019re heading in the right direction!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FMindyourbusinesspodcast.com%2FSonoma&amp;h=DAQG7l_0Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/Sonoma</a>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>", "duration": "40:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode063WhatToDoWithNegativeFeedback_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1477297800, "title": "Episode 062: How Thoughts Can Heal", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode, James and Phoebe discuss the power of the mind-body connection, and explore how our emotions truly can manifest themselves in physical ways.</p> <p>In this episode, James and Phoebe discuss the power of the mind-body connection, and explore how our emotions truly can manifest themselves in physical ways.</p> <p>James recently experienced what he considers his greatest miracle, when he was able to cure a severe back pain that occurred while he was on his honeymoon. He says that nothing has given him more tangible proof of the effect you can have on your own body.</p> <p>In Steven Ozanich\u2019s book, \u201cThe Great Pain Deception\u201d, he talks about \u201cTMS\u201d, or the \u201cMind Body Syndrome\u201d, which can show up in many ways but often as lower back pain in men.</p> <p>His healing work is based on the studies of John E. Sarno, MD, and he doesn\u2019t say that pain is imagined or doesn\u2019t exist, but it\u2019s just that we may have diagnosed the source or the cause of it. A person often goes to a doctor, who reinforces the belief of where the pain originates. However, is the source of the pain that structural damage, or is it something else? His book proposes that the source of the physical pain is simply repressed emotional pain, and to link it to the emotional state is the opportunity for you to heal yourself.</p> <p>Ozanich also talks about the Freudian concept of the id, superego and the ego. He likens the id to the \u201ckid\u201d or selfish child within yourself, as well as the part that has primitive urges and desires. The superego is the part of you that is a perfectionist, and wants to conform to society. It is referred to as the \u201cfalse self\u201d and seen as the \u201crespectable parent\u201d, or the antithesis to the id. Naturally, when put together, there is conflict. The ego becomes the \u201creferee\u201d in a sense, or a buffer to balance out the id and superego. This is the face that the individual shows to the world.</p> <p>Based on these concepts, the sources of TMS, or chronic pain, is this conflict within ourselves, when the ego pushes the id\u2019s needs and desires into the background.</p> <p>Perfectionists tend to suffer, such as in the case with personal brands, as they want everything they put out to be better than everyone else\u2019s.</p> <p>Even something that happens years ago can stay repressed and hidden for our entire life, and the ego will place the pain for you in your body. The thought is if you won\u2019t feel this pain emotionally, then it will manifest in the physical form.</p> <p>For James, this is all about creating or fostering that deeper level of awareness for what\u2019s going on in your body, as well as what\u2019s happening emotionally. When he experiences a pain now, he takes a step back and reviews his past week to see if he\u2019s stressed or not dealing with something.</p> <p>The Chakras are various points that are connected to our internal and external organs. If there is a blockage of energy at any of these points, it tends to get manifested physically.</p> <p>Ozanich\u2019s book has examples of pain appearing to stop someone from doing something that they didn\u2019t want to do, acting as a sort of protection mechanism.</p> <p>If you\u2019re rejecting this information, this is simply the ego and what is really needed is a discipline of mindfulness in your life!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong> \u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://steveozanich.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Great Pain Deception\u201d by Steven Ozanich</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "01:05:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode062HowThoughtsCanHeal_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1476952200, "title": "Episode 061: Harnessing The Power of Podcasting", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this latest \u201cListener Question of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe share 21 tips for successful podcasting that they\u2019ve learned in the first year of The Mind Your Business Podcast. If you have a show, or you are thinking of starting one, this is one episode not to miss!</p> <p>James has made a transition from content distribution with video on YouTube to primarily podcasting. He says that this decision had nothing to do with the platform, but everything to do with the type of content he was producing, which is now mainly his thoughts on mindset. He still uses YouTube, but more so for anything technical or \u201cleft-brained.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Pros of podcasting:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.\u00a0</strong><strong>Content is quick to create</strong></p> <p>James and Phoebe have an outline, go over it quickly and record over Skype. Both of them want the podcast to be conversational, and as content creators, sometimes we just want to get that info out of our heads and into the hands of others as quickly as possible.</p> <p><strong>2. It provides a higher \u201clog time\u201d with potential clients</strong></p> <p>If making more sales is your goal, you increase your chances of attracting customers in direct proportion to the amount of time logged with them. Where podcasts only require listening, people consuming them can be doing other things like cleaning or walking while consuming the content.</p> <p><strong>3. There\u2019s been a higher demand for podcasting in recent years</strong></p> <p>People enjoy podcasts and identify with their favorite shows and hosts. There\u2019s a lower barrier of entry, or lower cost to consume for the listener, again, as less attention is needed compared to when watching a video.</p> <p><strong>Cons of Podcasting</strong></p> <p><strong>1. It can be harder to get discovered only using podcasts</strong></p> <p>Podcasts aren\u2019t indexed in the traditional online searches, and as a result, it can be harder for new people to find your show. Often it takes multiple steps to search for a show, and the benefits of SEO aren\u2019t the same with podcasts as they are with something like a video or blog.</p> <p><strong>2. Driving traffic from a podcast isn\u2019t extremely effective</strong></p> <p>A video allows for at least four different ways to link directly to content (pop ups, link in description, etc.). On a podcast, if a link is mentioned, it\u2019s easy for the listener to not write it down as the person is often doing something else while listening.</p> <p><strong>3. Time required</strong></p> <p>The scheduling of guests, preparation for the interview and other podcast related tasks can take a lot of time, if you don\u2019t have somebody helping you.</p> <p><strong>4. Cost of equipment</strong></p> <p>Cheap equipment can lead to poor sounding audio and is often distracting to the listener. James and Phoebe spent about $1,600 total for both of them, on microphones, headphones and mixers. A host site, like Libsyn, is required for your show, and is ongoing cost (Libsyn packages start at $5/month and depending on storage size, go up accordingly). Recording software, like Adobe Premiere, will require a monthly subscription. There can also be a learning curve for using the equipment and software.</p> <p>Before deciding on whether or not to do a podcast, you need to understand who your audience is and how people are going to be consuming your content<strong>.</strong> Entrepreneurs love personal development and podcasts can be used to inspire them and raise their vibrations.</p> <p><strong>21 podcasting tips to take your show to the next level:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Create a core premise</strong></p> <p>This is the big idea and theme for your show, which is important. James and Phoebe started this podcast with a bold claim: hustle and hard work are not essential ingredients for success. Your core premise should attract or repel people, and get them curious. You don\u2019t want to be boring, or \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. Have a solid intro and outro</strong></p> <p>Your intro and outro should communicate that core premise that you\u2019re trying to prove, or re-iterate the key message of your show.</p> <p><strong>3. Hire someone to manage/edit your podcast</strong></p> <p>You can\u2019t make it your full-time job to be doing everything with the show. Make sure things like show notes, if done by a third-party, flow well and are written in your style.</p> <p><strong>4. Batch your episodes</strong></p> <p>Set aside time to record multiple episodes at once, which allows you to get into a rhythm and stay on schedule for release dates.</p> <p><strong>5. Keep it conversational</strong></p> <p>There needs to be a blend between the content or value you\u2019re creating and the natural, everyday chatter of life; people want something they can relate to!</p> <p><strong>6. Record 10 episodes before publishing</strong></p> <p>This will help you get into the flow of recording, and also helps as iTunes requires a certain amount of content to allow subscriptions, rating and reviews, and to qualify your show for its \u201cNew and Noteworthy\u201d rankings.</p> <p><strong>7. Get in iTunes New & Noteworthy</strong></p> <p>See above; by launching with a good number of episodes, listeners will be given the opportunity to \u201cbinge listen\u201d to your show.</p> <p><strong>8. Ask people to subscribe, rate and review</strong></p> <p>By subscribing, listeners will automatically receive each new episode that is released. For ratings and reviews, 5 stars are ideal and will help with iTunes New & Noteworthy rankings. As well, the comments you receive will give you valuable feedback about your show.</p> <p><strong>9. Use numbers in your episodes</strong></p> <p>By having their own numbers, each episode will be easy for people to find and share. When possible, numbers should also be used in the episode title, such as in this episode with \u201c21 Tips.\u201d By doing so, you create structure for the listener.</p> <p><strong>10. Place and advertisement at the start, middle and/or end of each episode</strong></p> <p>This is especially important when going into a launch. You can drive people to a landing page or promotion. Although a lot of talk in the podcasting world today is about getting sponsorships from companies, if you\u2019re a business owner, you should be sponsoring your own show and promoting your own products and services.</p> <p><strong>11. Don\u2019t make the episodes too long, or too short</strong></p> <p>A longer episode will allow you to go deeper on specific topic. If it\u2019s too long though, listeners won\u2019t finish it, or won\u2019t listen at all. A good length to aim for is 35 to 45 minutes.</p> <p><strong>12. Track your stats</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s standard for business owners to watch their numbers, and it\u2019s helpful to do the same with your podcast. Monitor, but don\u2019t obsess over these stats!</p> <p><strong>13. Quality over quantity</strong></p> <p>Although it can be tempting to release more episodes to get more downloads and exposure, this can be a mistake. Look at your stats to see which episodes are getting the most downloads and to get a feel for which topics are working. As well, be careful about what you name the episode, as the title can make a big difference.</p> <p><strong>14. Ask and listen to what your audience wants</strong></p> <p>Listeners can give valuable feedback for what topics to discuss, but also for how often to release your episode. James and Phoebe saw a demand for more than one show a week. You can ask for feedback during the show, and also include a link for listeners to submit their questions in the show notes, as they do each episode.</p> <p><strong>15. Create custom url links with episode numbers\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong>Doing this will make each episode easier for you to share, and your listeners to find.</p> <p><strong>16. Use Libsyn to host your podcast</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s user friendly, affordable and provides stats that can help you make valuable decisions regarding your show. Other podcast platforms (iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, etc.) can pick up your RSS feed directly from Libsyn, which makes having your show in multiple places automatic. When you find something that works, just go with it!</p> <p><strong>17. Have a strategy in place to promote each episode</strong></p> <p>Make sure each episode is easily sharable, and don\u2019t just publish it and hope you get downloads. If you\u2019re going to put in the work to record each episode, you might as well get it to as many people as possible. You can add your podcast to many places, including your email auto responder.</p> <p><strong>18. Consistency is key</strong></p> <p>Consistency breeds momentum. If you\u2019re going to create a schedule for releasing shows, stick to it. Start with one episode per week, and don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew. Have the patience to see where you show can go over a full year.</p> <p><strong>19. Have show notes and mention all links and resources from the episode in them</strong></p> <p>You will create value by offering listeners one place where they can find everything that was discussed in the episode.</p> <p><strong>20. Go easy on yourself</strong></p> <p>It could take the first 20 to 35 episodes for you to really find your footing and voice as a podcaster! It is recommended that you go back and listen to your first set of episodes, and you can even edit those few yourself in order to become more aware of the filler words you are using.</p> <p><strong>21. Have great equipment</strong></p> <p>Audio quality is so important, and poor sound is often the top complaint from listeners.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://katenorthrup.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">The Kate & Mike Show</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/17/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 017: The Margin for Magic with Kate Northrup</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/20/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 020: Know Thyself, Know Thy Business</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/22/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 022: How Walking Can Change Your Life with Derek Halpern</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://rickmulready.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rick Mulready</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mind-Your-Business-Podcasting-Equipment.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Mind-Your-Business-Podcasting-Equipment</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "41:32", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode061HarnessingThePowerofPodcasting_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1476693000, "title": "Episode 060: Lessons from 7-Figure Business Owners", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode, James gives the five key lessons that he has learned from 7-figure business owners, starting with a high level of belief in yourself, your product and your plan.</p> <p>In one year alone, James shares that he went to 15 live events and credits them for helping him never give up and to help him get to where he\u2019s at today. Here are the lessons:</p> <p><strong>1. Belief</strong></p> <p>You must have that \u201cknowingness\u201d level of belief, which will carry you further than anything else. Once you know what you want, do a gut check to assess whether you truly have this belief in you.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sell something you don\u2019t believe in!\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, the level of belief in the online marketing industry has shifted considerably, with there being so many examples of people who have achieved success.</p> <p><strong>2. Power of relationships</strong></p> <p>Joint venture and affiliate relationships give you the potential to dramatically increase your revenue and impact.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you can align yourself with the right people, it can make a world of difference\u201d</p> <p>It works both ways, in that you should also be looking for ways to align yourself with people that you can promote.</p> <p><strong>3. An invitation to play bigger</strong></p> <p>The events you attend will bring you around the right people, ones who are at a whole other level. When you do this, you will be naturally pulled to that level as well.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does playing bigger look like to you? Are you playing small?\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t know the audience on your list, and when you want to play big, you invite them to play big as well. There\u2019s a massive shift that happens when you\u2019re able to make any offer to them and feel good about it.</p> <p>Phoebe adds that partnering with a charity can really let people know that they are making a difference, and that business and charity can go together.</p> <p><strong>4. Community and support</strong></p> <p>Support from others will give you an awareness of what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, so much faster than if you were just doing things on your own. By seeing other peoples\u2019 success, you\u2019ll continue to stretch yourself towards what\u2019s possible.</p> <p><strong>5. Have empathy</strong></p> <p>As an entrepreneur, you need to know your audience better than they know themselves. This includes knowing their internal and external pains and problems they want solved. It\u2019s about making an attempt to understand the situation they are in, and truly, genuinely caring about them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://riseofsuperman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Rise of Superman\u201d by Steven Kotler</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/26/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 026: The Best Way to Find a Successful Mastermind \u00a0\u00a0</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://jeffwalker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Walker</a> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stu.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Stu McLaren</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://getaskbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cAsk\u201d by Ryan Levesque</a></p>", "duration": "43:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode060LessonsFrom7Figure_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1476347400, "title": "Episode 059: How to Say NO", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In today\u2019s \u201cListener Question of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe discuss how you can filter through the opportunities that present themselves to decide which ones you\u2019ll go after, and which ones you\u2019ll let go.</p> <p>To James, \u201copportunity\u201d is a dangerous word because when you hear it, you only think of positive outcomes. However, no two opportunities are created equal.</p> <p>It\u2019s so easy for us to default to \u201cYes\u201d when asked to do something, for fear of what might happen if we were to say \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour time and energy is precious, and so valuable\u201d</p> <p>Opportunities are dangerous if you\u2019re a personal brand, considering you are your product and also your most valuable asset.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not guarding yourself, then you\u2019re not growing because you\u2019re not leveraging your product effectively\u201d</p> <p>James declines 90-95% of the requests he receives, but very rarely is it personal for him. He notes that when you put everyone else first, you\u2019re putting yourself last.</p> <p>People approaching you are trying to leverage your content and knowledge for their own use, or for their audience\u2019s use.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to be really mindful that what you are doing in your life and what you\u2019ve created needs to be protected\u201d</p> <p><strong>Three questions to ask when considering an opportunity:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Does it align with my vision and goals?</strong></p> <p>You need to not only consider if it\u2019s worth your time, but also trust your instincts to decide if it\u2019s something that\u2019s in line with what your brand and what you\u2019re doing.</p> <p><strong>2. If this were a wild success, what results would it have for me?</strong></p> <p>To do this, play it out with actual numbers when deciding if the opportunity is a good one that you can leverage for yourself.</p> <p><strong>3. What is the opportunity cost?</strong></p> <p>When considering what it would actually cost you to say \u201cYes\u201d, don\u2019t just look at financial cost; consider how much time, effort and energy it would take as well.</p> <p>Introverts like James have limited energy and things will drain them easier. He shares his thoughts on how he handles podcasts, summits and speaking requests, as well as the way he has conditioned his team to act as a filter when they are approached with opportunities for him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theentrepreneurssolution.com/step-1?autoplay=1\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Entrepreneur\u2019s Solution\u201d by Mel Abraham</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/58/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 058: 18 Simple Productivity Hacks</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "29:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode059HowToSayNo_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1476088200, "title": "Episode 058: 18 Simple Productivity Hacks", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In today\u2019s episode, James and Phoebe share easy to implement tips that can be used to become more productive on a daily basis!</p> <p>It\u2019s important to create a distinction between just being busy, versus actually being productive.</p> <p>To James, the word \u201csuccess\u201d means understanding that you can get what you want, easily with as little effort as possible.</p> <p>You must be crystal clear on the vision for what you want. People are often overwhelmed because they don\u2019t focus their time and energy on what is relevant. To help her decide what to do, Phoebe looks at if the task is \u201con target\u201d or \u201coff target\u201d with the goals that she wants to accomplish.</p> <p>James says that there are two ways to get clarity about what you want. First, decide what is the essence of what you want and remember that you can change this at anytime. Second, you can look at what you don\u2019t want to get more clarity.</p> <p><strong>18 hacks for getting to your results with less effort and energy</strong></p> <p><strong>1.\u00a0Identify that MVP (Most Viable Project, or Promotion)</strong></p> <p>Perfectionism often gets in the way of our productivity and effectiveness. This is really just a fear of not being good enough, and if we come from this belief, we\u2019ll never get things done. You should be asking what is the least amount of work that needs to be done to get your message out to the world.</p> <p><strong>2. Work less</strong></p> <p>Try giving yourself the gift of a 3-day vacation and on the first day back, document everything you do. Odds are, it is going to be the most productive day that you\u2019ve had in weeks, or even months.</p> <p><strong>3. Leverage activity</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s all about spending your time on action items that be used in multiple ways!</p> <p><strong>4. Write out the top five activities for the week</strong></p> <p>James and his team calls it a \u201cwill do\u201d list, not a \u201cto do\u201d list. This list contains action items that must completed before the end of day Friday each week.</p> <p><strong>5. Identify the one or two most important things to do daily</strong></p> <p>Phoebe does her list the night before, so she knows what to do when she wakes up the next morning.</p> <p><strong>6. Don\u2019t work when you don\u2019t feel like it</strong></p> <p>If you\u2019re not in a flow state, don\u2019t try to power through it as this isn\u2019t going to produce your best work, and you won\u2019t be as efficient as you can be. Stop and rest so you\u2019re fully charged to pick back up when you start again.</p> <p><strong>7. Automate as much as possible</strong></p> <p>Productivity and effectiveness decrease when our brains have to dwell on things. James automates as much as he can in his life, including shopping and recurring payments he has to make.</p> <p><strong>8. Document and delegate</strong></p> <p>You should always be aware of what can be outsourced, and by documenting the process, you will have instructions to provide to others that will be doing the work.</p> <p><strong>9. Remove social media notifications</strong></p> <p>By having notifications pop up on your phone and computer, it\u2019s easy to get distracted from the tasks that you should be completing.</p> <p><strong>10. Leverage Parkinson\u2019s Law</strong></p> <p>This law states, \u201cWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\u201d James schedules time to complete activities, such as to spend 30 minutes in a Facebook group supporting others. You can also book times in your calendar to meditate and work out, just like Phoebe does.</p> <p><strong>11. Say \u201cNo\u201d more often</strong></p> <p>Remember that even 30 minutes of your time is valuable when being approached by others presenting opportunities. Set up better boundaries to protect your time, and feel confident when doing so.</p> <p><strong>12. Integrate a mindfulness or spirituality process</strong></p> <p>You should incorporate things like mediation and visualization into your daily routine, which will help you stay aware. Ultimately, you will be more productive.</p> <p><strong>13. Don\u2019t let your email list be your \u201cto do\u201d list</strong></p> <p>Your email is something that you should schedule time for, but only after your essential one to two items for the day are complete.</p> <p><strong>14.Context switching</strong></p> <p>When multi-tasking, you can\u2019t be productivity. Focus on one thing at a time, and when finished that item, you can then move on to the next.</p> <p><strong>15. Get more sleep</strong></p> <p>By doing so, you will feel more rested and have more energy. As well, you will be able to wake up earlier and your morning won\u2019t feel as rushed.</p> <p><strong>16. Have 15-minute daily meetings, or \u201csprints\u201d</strong></p> <p>In these short meetings, ask yourself three things: What did I do yesterday? What am I doing today?

This isn\u2019t how it works as an entrepreneur, which is why a different mindset is required.</p> <p>Abraham-Hicks has a quote that states, \u201cReduce your workload by 30% and increase your fun load by 30%, and you can increase your revenue by 100%.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Ferriss says, \u201cBeing busy is a form of laziness; lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.\u201d</p> <p>James adds that we find ways to just be busy, thinking this is a way to guarantee our success.</p> <p>Phoebe believes people almost get a sense in pride when telling others how busy they are.

Sometimes the simplest advice is the hardest to take, and often the issue of guilt will come up when you\u2019re not working.</p> <p>\u201cFor a lot of people, being still and resting is not an easy thing\u201d</p> <p>He notes that the feeling of guilt is an indicator that we do not believe that we are enough.</p> <p>We need to realize that the very act of not working is actually a part of working, as during this time, your next big idea could come to you.</p> <p>Phoebe shares that so much inspiration can occur when your environment has changed, like when travelling.</p> <p>Parkinson\u2019s Law talks about how work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something else that has to be done; it never gets 100% completed\u201d</p> <p>James says that when you start basing your satisfaction on how many items you can check off your to-do list, it creates a vicious cycle.

After making a major shift, which he refers to as \u201cBending Reality\u201d, the company grew revenue over 400% in just 8 months and started attracting their dream clients along with an amazing team.</p> <p>He did this by bringing the powerful presence of gratitude and happiness into the present moment, and in the book he says:</p> <p>\u201cBe happy now. Your thoughts and beliefs do create your reality, but only when your present state is joyful.\u201d</p> <p>The second step was creating an excited anticipation for the future. James notes that as entrepreneurs, we already have goals, but often run into frustration, become impatient and burn out. He says there is a huge difference between going through the motions of gratitude and having an experience of truly feeling it.</p> <p>\u201cGratitude is the vibration of receiving, and if you\u2019re grateful for what you already have, it only invites more to come your way\u201d</p> <p>Lakhiani refers to Dan Sullivan\u2019s theory of appreciating the \u201creverse gap.\u201d We often beat ourselves up when we\u2019re not where we want to be in life, but we can take a moment to reflect and look back at how far we\u2019ve come. To do this, make a list of the results that you\u2019ve created in your personal and work life. This can be one of the best things you can do to move forward when feeling overwhelmed.</p> <p>Every day, as part of your routine, Lakhiani says to identify three to five things that you\u2019re grateful for. You can start with the small things that make you happy and you smile about.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do things so we can be happy, we should be happy so we can do things\u201d</p> <p>To shed our past, one of the most powerful things we can do is to practice the act of forgiveness. First, make a list of people that you don\u2019t feel 100% complete with in your life. Then, follow the next steps:</p> <p><strong>1) Set the scene</strong></p> <p>Close your eyes, get present and imaging the person standing before you. Then recreate the scene that has triggered your emotions.</p> <p><strong>2) Step into the anger and pain</strong></p> <p>Relive the situation while bringing up the emotions as much as you can.</p> <p><strong>3) Forgive and love</strong></p> <p>Take a moment to actually step into the other person\u2019s shoes and imagine what life might be life for them. Then, intentionally forgive them and imagine them doing the same for you.</p> <p>James adds that carrying around frustrations of the past will affect your productivity, intuition and creativity, and these steps will act as \u201cdetox\u201d for your soul.</p> <p>\u201cTake a moment to forgive and move on; the past is done and this is about now\u201d</p> <p><strong>The book also asks readers three important questions to consider:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) If time and money were no object and I did not have to seek anyone\u2019s permission, what kind of experiences would my soul crave?</strong></p> <p><strong>2) In order to have these experiences, how do I have to grow? What sort of man or woman do I need to evolve into?</strong></p> <p><strong>3) If I have the experience that I have listed above and I\u2019ve grown in these remarkable ways, then how can I give back to the world?</strong></p> <p>Make sure that you don\u2019t have an attachment to your big goals, and remember that the future doesn\u2019t define you if things don\u2019t happen to go your way.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thecodexmind.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Code of the Extraordinary Mind\u201d by Vishen Lakhiani</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8ZFU4FoNvY\" target=\"_blank\">Why Happiness is the New Productivity (Video)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mindvalley.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mindvalley</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://steveozanich.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Great Pain Deception\u201d by Steve Ozanich</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.samharris.org/waking-up\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cWaking Up\u201d by Sam Harris</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://40yearsofzen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Forty Years of Zen</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.strategiccoach.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Sullivan\u2019s Website</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "29:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode056HowtoBeExtraordinary_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1473928200, "title": "Episode 055: Replacing Our Limiting Beliefs About Money", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this latest \u201cListener Question of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe talk about how to enjoy success without feeling guilty. They present three common limiting beliefs, and how you can reprogram your thinking around them, along with providing the affirmations that they each use on a regular basis.</p> <p>Limiting beliefs around money will dictate our actions, and how we show up in the world. Do we enjoy the success and abundance without feeling guilty or undeserving of it?</p> <p>James say that a dichotomy exists where people either have a fear of failure, or even a fear of success. Often, they fear that if they become successful, they won\u2019t be able to control it and somehow won\u2019t deserve it.</p> <p>He\u2019s had these issues in the past, but he got by them by remembering that the way he lives his life and runs his business is to inspire others through his actions.</p> <p>He realized that in order to be a source of inspiration for others, he would have to charge higher prices and build a team to truly make an impact. Ultimately, these are the things that his ideal clients want for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cWe tend to listen to, respect and look up to authorities that have the elements of the things we want\u201d</p> <p><strong>Three common limiting beliefs (with ways that you can delete this programming and replace it).</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Money is evil</strong></p> <p>You can let this one go and instead use \u201cthe more money I have, the more I can help.\u201d By making more money, you\u2019ll be able to donate more finances, and time, as well as having a bigger platform for which to give your message to others.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>\u00a0<strong>You have to work hard to make money and to deserve it</strong></p> <p>There is no direct correlation between hard work and more money; it\u2019s simply about providing more value and solving bigger problems for people.</p> <p>For this one, Phoebe shares a few affirmations that she uses:</p> <p>\u201cThe less I do, the more I make\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe more value I provide, the more money I make\u201d</p> <p><strong>3.\u00a0Making money is taking it away from somebody else</strong></p> <p>This belief comes from a place of lack. To switch to an abundance mindset, replace this belief with one that shows there is no limitation to money or abundance in this world.</p> <p>James uses the affirmation, \u201cThe transformation is in the transaction\u201d, and he notes that no one values what they get for free.</p> <p>We should look for evidence and proof with each of these examples. Consider how many people today are making their living online; there is no limit to how many people can do this.</p> <p>You can also look for clues in the way that you feel. If there is an internal conflict or struggle when you have achieved something, look for the source of the limiting belief. The more you do this, the more opportunity you\u2019ll have to discover what is ruling your reality.</p> <p>Phoebe adds that as you achieve more success, you can make small upgrades, like experiencing more expensive restaurants. This will help you reduce the effect of, or eliminate, any limiting beliefs around money that you might have.</p> <p>Go easy on yourself if you have a certain way of thinking about money.

To do this, know that people are craving two things: more time, and more connection with others. When you start with these two things, you can begin to deliver value in a unique and different way.</p> <p>Being a great listener is an important part of marketing. What are people complaining about, and how can you help? It will take a healthy obsession on your part to find out who your customer really is.</p> <p>Phoebe recommends that you look at Facebook groups to see what people are asking for and what they need.

Here, we have the chance for infinite possibility, and our reality is based off of the actions that we take now.</p> <p>\u201cTo get unstuck, we must be willing to create actions in this present moment that are not contingent upon or determined by the results of our past\u201d</p> <p>Tom Watson, founder of IBM, made this statement when asked what made them successful:</p> <p>\u201cFor IBM to become a great company, I (realized) I would have to act like a great company long before it ever became one\u201d</p> <p>James shares that when you\u2019re clear on the business you\u2019re creating and the vision you have for it, use that as the \u201clitmus test\u201d for the decisions that you\u2019re going to make.</p> <p>\u201cWhat got you here, won\u2019t get you there\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe adds that when you\u2019re vision is big enough, you\u2019ll believe in yourself and your commitment to your customers.</p> <p>When you use statements such as \u201cthat\u2019s easy for you to say,\u201d then you\u2019re letting yourself off of hook and making excuses for why you\u2019re not achieving results.</p> <p><strong>Three steps to get unstuck:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Identify your vision for the future</strong></p> <p>What is your vision; one that gets you \u201clit up\u201d and excited?

The real answer is to only do one at first, in order to later expand to others.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a personal brand, James stresses that you need a platform. This will be a place where you can share your content for free and create a two-way conversation with your audience, or your tribe.</p> <p>However, you also have to determine what is the modality of the context. Is it text (articles and blog posts), audio (podcasts) or video (which can combine the other things)?</p> <p>Pick one; you do not want to be doing all three! James main focus before was YouTube, as he was teaching visual things that the platform was able to present effectively. He now uses podcasts to talk to listeners about deeper topics, and this gives people the ability to listen while they\u2019re doing something else, like driving or doing the dishes.</p> <p>Things like DYI tutorials, fitness and photography lend themselves well to YouTube or Facebook video. Interviews and entrepreneurial mindset topics will be better served by using a podcast.</p> <p>Phoebe adds that you can choose one platform, but still incorporate different elements, like text into your videos.</p> <p>James notes that can share quotes from your podcast, updates on upcoming guests and more on other platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Facebook groups, inviting the people to your main platform.</p> <p>\u201cReally the platform is about the message (or) content you\u2019re creating and how you can promote it and create conversation around it\u201d</p> <p>One strategy you can use to determine which platform to use is to come up with a list of 10 to 30 content ideas and then see which modality would work best.</p> <p>There are three questions to ask yourself when considering platforms: Where is your audience already hanging out? What\u2019s a platform where you can listen, and not just talk? Do you really need video to release this content?</p> <p>Phoebe feels that asking yourself what you enjoy doing can also help with your decision. By doing what you enjoy, you will stay consistent with your content creation and your audience will feel this energy and be more engaged.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a delicate balance between what you love to do and where is your audience?\u201d</p> <p>Whatever platform you choose, it should be a great list (and community) builder!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "24:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Ep_051_Choosing_The_Best_Platform_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1472459400, "title": "Episode 050: Three Mindset Hacks for Success with Rick Mulready", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode, James is joined by a special guest, Rick Mulready, to discuss how to overcome the mindset hurdles that all entrepreneurs face.</p> <p>Rick shares that he himself, despite the success he has achieved, is still working on figuring out entrepreneurship. He says that mindset is the foundation, and it drives success in both business and life.</p> <p>He used to have a scarcity and fear-based mindset of not know how to do what he wanted to do with his own business. Rick also wasn\u2019t even sure if he could do what he wanted to do, and he says he \u201cfloundered\u201d for 14 months. At one point, he even thought he might have to go back to the corporate world.</p> <p>His mindset is now a lot different than it use to be, and he\u2019s proved that he can help others in their businesses while also supporting his own family.</p> <p>Along the journey, you\u2019re always going to have setbacks and you\u2019re going to hit plateaus. Your mindset will help you think in different ways and allow you to know you can get through the hard times.</p> <p>James adds that you may need to rebuild your mindset to get to the next level you\u2019re aiming for.</p> <p><strong>Rick\u2019s three mindset hacks:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Success is actually in the process of getting to the end goal</strong></p> <p>Rick believes what\u2019s important is what you learn along the way, although he admits that he use to get caught up in the end goal and would get upset if he didn\u2019t hit it.</p> <p>Focusing on the process, instead of the end goal, allows for more fun along the way and also helps you to realize that you\u2019re choosing the things you want to do.</p> <p>We hear that it\u2019s the struggle that makes it all worthwhile when we reach our goal, but it really comes down to being grateful for achieving success with ease.</p> <p>James says to look for the path of least resistance, or the one that offers ease and flow. Abraham-Hicks\u2019 definition of success is how much just you can have in a day, and if you want to increase your revenue, you should work less and play more.</p> <p><strong>2) Watch your \u201cbut\u201d</strong></p> <p>When we think of an idea, there\u2019s often a \u201cbut\u201d that comes up. Rick shares that the first idea you had before this is the real winner, and when you permit your doubts to become the story and gain momentum is when you get into trouble.</p> <p>James notes that people will look to justify why they shouldn\u2019t do something, but a lot of the things we\u2019re creating nee to be crazy, not logical. He recommends replacing \u201cbut\u201d with \u201cand.\u201d When you\u2019re using \u201cbut,\u201d you\u2019re literally cancelling out the thing that you want.</p> <p><strong>3) Just do it and stop the worrying</strong></p> <p>The only control we have is over what we can do now, in this moment. You can\u2019t worry about a future that hasn\u2019t happened yet. James says that during launches is a common time for entrepreneurs to worry as they often attach their own identity to the results.</p> <p>Remember, the goal set is only used to determine the process that you are going to use. Determine how you can change the meaning, or the goal, so you\u2019re not worrying, because when you\u2019re worrying, you can\u2019t be empowered to take the proper actions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong> \u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.RickMulready.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.RickMulready.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-God-Uncommon-Dialogue-Book-ebook/dp/B00AYJIJ2S#nav-subnav\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cConversations with God\u201d by Neale Donald Walsch</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "35:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_050_Three_Mindset_Hacks_for_Success_with_Rick_Mulready_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1472113800, "title": "Episode 049: How to Lift Your Business to the Next Level", "author": "", "summary": "<p>As an entrepreneur, there are many considerations to make when looking to expand your business, as well as major mindset shifts that need to occur.

Kimra shares that her first website was far from perfect, and she did it herself for about $100.</p> <p>Perfectionism is the biggest mistake that she sees entrepreneurs making today. They often think everything has to be just right before releasing a course or product. Kimra created her first course in a weekend.</p> <p>She was hesitant at first when starting her business, partly because of the way she looks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the chick with piercings in the middle of her face and tattoos all over her. That wasn\u2019t what I was seeing (in the industry).\u201d</p> <p>To let go of this, she just went back to why she was in business, which was to help people. She adds that not thinking about the money aspect made it easy for her to do what she does.</p> <p>\u201cI think sometimes you just need to take that little jump and get in front of people. They will respond based on what you give.\u201d</p> <p>The people who spend the money on their own personal development are the ones who get the best results.</p> <p>Kimra created her signature program after being in business for only three months. The price was $1,200 when she first launched it, and it is now more than double that amount to purchase it.</p> <p>Developing her own mindset, specifically when it comes to not complaining and changing her own thoughts, has been key. Learning to be grateful has helped her heal her life as well.</p> <p>\u201cLearn to appreciate the things around you; even if it\u2019s just the breath you have.\u201d</p> <p>Kimra and her husband were on welfare for a number of years, but were able to manifest things such as a job for him, and a vehicle, by doing this practice daily for months.</p> <p>She had been running Facebook groups for mothers when she decided to start a blog, which focused on things she was passionate about such as health and wellness. Kimra\u2019s YouTube channel grew to 25,000 subscribers, and she developed a following on Pinterest.</p> <p>Seeing her success on Pinterest, a mentor asked Kimra to teach his audience how to use it, which lead to webinars and he getting paid for one-on-one consulting. Doing this, she started to notice issues with her clients\u2019 entire brands.</p> <p>\u201cI ended up becoming about branding. People paid me for the knowledge I had in my head.\u201d</p> <p>Kimra feels that people need to reach out to others more often. Her first launch generated $65,000 in revenue, and after that she reached out to James to thank him for how much his content had helped her.</p> <p>\u201cWe forget to reach out and connect to the people that are inspiring us\u201d</p> <p>She believes that sometimes things happen that are supposed to in order for us to move forward in our journey.</p> <p>James adds that amazing things can happen when the feedback loop is completed.</p> <p>Kimra appeared on 60 podcasts in her first year of business, but was also declined often by hosts.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get a yes if you never ask\u201d</p> <p>She only does something if it is going to feel good, and a lot of times we have to know what we don\u2019t want to discover what we do want. When she first started, Kimra did webinars almost every week because she liked doing them and wanted to master the craft.</p> <p>Kimra uses crystals as a way to help her stay grounded and connected with the Earth, and she\u2019s also a reiki master. Over the years, she\u2019s developed an awareness in things that she wishes she could infuse in other people.</p> <p>She believes people should explore things like manifesting, crystals and energy as a way to make them happier, not just from a monetary standpoint.</p> <p>\u201cI utilize The Law of Attraction, spirituality and my intuition to guide me every day\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://FreedomHackers.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://FreedomHackers.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.KimraLuna.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.KimraLuna.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/36/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 036: Gain Clarity by Asking the Right Questions</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735204314/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687502&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=1614270198&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=Z7MPXFJ8TPSBCX1A177Z\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Power of Your Subconscious Mind\u201d by Dr. Joseph Murphy</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Heal-Your-Life/dp/B005IT6TKI\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cYou Can Heal Your Life\u201d by Louise L.

As a second part to this question, ask yourself if you are deserving of it.</p> <p>\u201cYou are deserving; you are put here on this planet to have whatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>Expectation is about living life as if \u201cthe ball is already in the cup.\u201d This golf analogy implies that you have a knowing that everything will work out for you.</p> <p><strong>2) Detachment</strong></p> <p>Detachment is not letting the outcome affect you one way or another. How you see yourself, or who you are as a person, isn\u2019t altered. Try detaching yourself from how it\u2019s suppose to look or happen.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you want can come in, and probably will, from the most unlikely of places\u201d</p> <p><strong>3) Action</strong></p> <p>Action is meant to be inspired and prioritized, not necessarily \u201cmassive.\u201d You should be focusing on that one thing that will push you and your business further.</p> <p>You still have to be willing to take that action, which will lead to the advice, lesson, motivation or inspiration that you need.</p> <p>\u201cManifesting comes into play when you\u2019re doing the things that you never thought were possible\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/6/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 006: The 7 Steps To A Perfect Product Launch</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/17/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 017: The Margin for Magic with Kate Northrup</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.the1thing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe ONE Thing\u201d by Gary Keller</a></p>", "duration": "39:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_046_Manifesting_Ingredients_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1470299400, "title": "Episode 045: Managing Your Energy", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this \u201cListener Question of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe explore ways you can manage your energy, and why it\u2019s so important to do this!</p> <p>Everyone, at some level, is asking how to manage his or her energy. \u201cEnergy Vampires\u201d can often throw off your whole day, or perhaps your whole week.</p> <p>James explains that social media has made it easier for people to find you in multiple ways.</p> <p>\u201cIn a world of instant gratification, we want to be served immediately\u201d</p> <p>Introverts and extroverts are very different in the way that they get their energy. Phoebe is an extrovert, and when she moved to her new hometown of San Francisco, she joined a soccer team and hosted social events to help her feel at home. James is an introvert; this doesn\u2019t mean he is shy, but his focus is not on getting his energy from other people.</p> <p>\u201cExtroverts have a lot of friends, introverts have a lot of ideas\u201d</p> <p>There are a few powerful energetic exercises that he does to protect himself from other people\u2019s energy. In the \u201ccord-cutting exercise\u201d, he closes his eyes while visualizing the person and a cord attaching himself to him or her. He physically moves his arm, while making a noise, to \u201ccut\u201d the cord. In another exercise, he imagines himself in a protective gold egg, or sphere, which deflects anything coming to him.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to protect your energy\u201d</p> <p><strong>3 things we can do to effectively manage our energy</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Create a commitment with boundaries</strong></p> <p>When James coaches a person one-on-one, he sets the boundaries first and is clear that he isn\u2019t doing the graphics, webinars or similar tasks for the person.</p> <p>\u201cYou are robbing them of the experience of them getting to discover what it really takes to do it themselves. It really is all them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2) Find those people who do light you up</strong></p> <p>These people should be coachable, big action takers and full of gratitude and acknowledgment. They will provide you with the motivation to keep going.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they do the work, you realize you had an impact in someone else\u2019s life\u201d</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have a feedback mechanism in place, you don\u2019t have an essential element of any offer.</p> <p><strong>3) Do something to recharge your energy</strong></p> <p>Creators naturally put out a lot of energy with their content, systems and strategies. You should celebrate your accomplishments, and take a few days off. James tries to stay under 36 hours of work in any week.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about working longer. This is why the whole hustle thing is B.S.\u201d</p> <p>Morning routines are absolutely critical for your personal energy. If you don\u2019t have the time for a morning routine, that\u2019s why you need one.</p> <p>Some examples of activities that could recharge your energy are napping, reading books, listening to podcasts or going to the beach. Everyone is different, and the important thing is that you find out what inspires you.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/20/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 020: Know Thyself, Know Thy Business</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/21/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 021: Know Thyself (Part 2)</a></p>", "duration": "40:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Ep045_Managing_Energy_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1470040200, "title": "Episode 044: Creating Your Reality", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In today\u2019s episode, Phoebe shares what she learned at a recent event, including all the breakthroughs and key takeaways that showed her it is possible to create your own reality.</p> <p>She says it was literally a last minute decision that she made to attend an Abraham-Hicks live event. James notes that part of his morning routine is to listen to Abraham-Hicks\u2019 content on YouTube.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, they are responsible for where I am in my life\u201d</p> <p>His sister and mother gave him one of their books, but it took him awhile to be in the place to read and accept what was being said.</p> <p>\u201cI played the sceptic; I played the scientist.

Be open to receiving ideas and having a prosperous mindset.</p> <p>James adds that the word \u201cstruggle\u201d has been made synonymous with \u201chustle.\u201d You create a goal, and subconsciously believe that you\u2019re not worthy of achieving that goal without extreme sacrifice.</p> <p><strong>2) Understand, but you don\u2019t need to prove or explain</strong></p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter if people aren\u2019t in agreement with your spiritual journey or are on a different one than you are. Other people\u2019s journeys are their own.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstanding has to come from within you, as opposed to forcing it on other people\u201d</p> <p>James says that by creating your own platform, such as a podcast or webinar, you will actually attract the people that are ready.</p> <p><strong>3) The Universe will gift you things when, and in the way, you\u2019re ready to receive them</strong></p> <p>Phoebe now has the faith and confidence that she\u2019ll get what she needs from The Universe. James shares that it took him three years to be ready to receive the teachings of Abraham-Hicks.</p> <p><strong>4) Don\u2019t try to accomplish your vortex, let your vortex accomplish</strong></p> <p>She\u00a0learned that you need to send out all of your hopes, dreams and wishes, and then detach from the outcome. Focus on that feeling, essence, or desire, as opposed to the concrete items that will get you to where you are going.</p> <p><strong>5) Resistance slows momentum</strong></p> <p>James says that the single most effective word to get The Law of Attraction to work effectively is \u201cmomentum.\u201d If you set the intention to do something and do it, you\u2019ll gain momentum.</p> <p>Phoebe left the event knowing that she could create anything in life that she wants!</p> <p>\u201cKeeping that momentum going forward is really important in my life\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/askitisgiven.php\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cAsk and It Is Given\u201d by Abraham-Hicks</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AbrahamHicks\" target=\"_blank\">Abraham-Hicks YouTube Channel</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "35:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_044_Creating_Your_Reality_REV.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1469694600, "title": "Episode 043: Too Many Good Ideas", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this latest \u201cListener Question of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe look at what you do when you have too many good ideas.

They discuss how to develop a customer-centric mindset, while touching on the topics of emotions, confidence and much more.</p> <p>Jason started his career in theatre, as a lighting designer and technician for such groups as Rush and Fleetwood Mac, as well as touring with Broadway.</p> <p>\u201cI spent a lot of those years really understanding audience on a whole different level. Everything we did was to add value to the customers.\u201d</p> <p>He cites a study where 80% of CEOs believed that they were creating amazing experiences for their customers, where only 8% of the same customers surveyed agreed. He calls this divide the \u201cExperience Gap,\u201d and the result of organizations not having a customer-centric mindset is a common problem today.</p> <p>Jason tells entrepreneurs to literally step into the shoes of their customers in order to see situations through their lens, and from their perspective.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to understand what it\u2019s like for that customer. What are they feeling?\u201d</p> <p>He believes that the customer isn\u2019t always right, but there has to be an alignment between the business and customer, with clear expectations in place. When this occurs, businesses are able to really create value for the customer.</p> <p>Most businesses create customer experiences by default, whereas Jason\u2019s methods reverse engineer the process and design the desired experience.</p> <p>In order to really understand what the customer wants, we need to understand what is going on in his or her world, as well as what they\u2019re looking for when interacting with your brand.

If you had to start all over again, what would you do first?</p> <p>James notes that when you\u2019re just starting out and having a smaller business, you can make adjustments much quicker and easier than when you are larger. When you\u2019re lean, you have the advantage of your time, along with possibilities that come with it.</p> <p>You need to start first with your goals and intentions. Think about what you want for yourself 5 to 10 years in the future.</p> <p>\u201cStart to form the vision of the company and the lifestyle that you want\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s important to remember that you don\u2019t need to do everything all at once, and you can take \u201cbaby steps\u201d to get to where you\u2019re going.</p> <p>\u201cI always look back on all these experiences I\u2019ve had in my life that led me to this point\u201d</p> <p>Next, you need to know who your customer is and what problem he or she is facing.

This could be through coaching or consulting, or some other service.</p> <p>Phoebe shares that once you learn how to do a service, you can offer your service for free to them.

He would then market them and manage their YouTube channels. He would invest the money he made from this venture into a studio that local businesses could use, and start hosting workshops, offer online courses and boot camps. By doing all of these steps, without having the advantage of his previous name or brand, he feels he could generate $100,000 in revenue in only 6 to 8 months.</p> <p>Phoebe sees many people not planning for the long-term and are skipping steps to try to get to 6-figures in their business as soon as possible.</p> <p>James believes people replace passion with fear, and often get distracted when comparing themselves with others.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"140\" src=\"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/76378/Screen_Shot_2016-07-20_at_9.13.41_PM_1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"110\" /></p> <p>Phoebe wishes she had her mindset straight when she started her latest business.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I had that confidence to just go for everything\u201d</p> <p>James masked his fear with logic, and if he could go back in time, he would embrace that fear and realize that everything we do is going to come with that feeling of uncertainty.</p> <p>He would raise his prices in order to work with more extraordinary people, and to solve bigger problems.

An outsider can see things more clearly, as he or she is detached from the situation.</p> <p>We all have blind spots, which shows a lack of awareness and uncertainty as to why we haven\u2019t gotten what we\u2019ve wanted in life.

This exercise will train you to listen to what you are saying as well.</p> <p><strong>2) Identify what you really want and write down all the reasons you haven\u2019t done it</strong></p> <p>Look at the words you use, because the language will give you clues. That thing, or things, that\u2019s keeping you from what you want will most likely be showing up in other areas of your life.</p> <p><strong>3) Start to notice your complaints</strong></p> <p>Your complaints will be a huge indicator of your beliefs and what\u2019s holding you back.</p> <p><strong>4) Go to the people closest to you and see how they would describe you if you weren\u2019t in the room</strong></p> <p>This can be a difficult exercise, but it will get you to understand how people see you and how important we make those perspectives.

Not only is the vision crucial, but also it has to be measurable.</p> <p>The CEO\u2019s number one job becomes protecting the vision.

He gives an example of doing a business profile on Walmart for a business course, and reusing most of the content for papers in courses the following year.</p> <p>\u201cI just started realizing over time that most people don\u2019t do things like that\u201d</p> <p><strong>Three examples of how James uses leverage in his business:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) \u201cThe Outsourcing Mini-Course\u201d</strong></p> <p>James needed a video edited and hired a video editor overseas to complete the job, adding music and animation. In order to make it a leveraged activity, he recorded the entire process, including the Skype call with the editor.</p> <p>The recordings became a course on its own, as well as becoming content within his membership community. He also started offering the mini-course as a bonus to any launch he and his team did, giving the original activity multiple uses and providing many benefits to him and his clients.</p> <p><strong>2) \u201cThe Launch Lab\u201d</strong></p> <p>James was doing a promotion as an affiliate for Marie Forleo\u2019s B-School, and decided to offer a live, 3-day workshop, as a bonus.</p> <p>This generated extra revenue, as the bonus for someone else\u2019s program, and resulted in him getting new coaching clients from the people that attended the event. He then recorded the event and turned it into an online course, \u201cThe Launch Lab.\u201d The course then became another bonus that he has used, as well as becoming the framework for his newest program.</p> <p><strong>3) Video case studies</strong></p> <p>Video case studies of Inner Circle Mastermind members highlighted their success stories, and became content for other members of the group. These videos will remain in the vault for use by future members, and were used to create PDF content for James\u2019 membership site, Reel Marketing Insider. By adding the videos to the membership site, the Inner Circle Mastermind is indirectly being promoted as it\u2019s introducing more people to it, and the case studies give others something to aspire towards.</p> <p><strong>Four ways to have leveraged thinking:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Leveraged content</strong> \u2013 Podcasts, videos, screen captures and more can be reused or repackaged. As an example, James is turning a powerful excerpt from a previous podcast into a video, with animation, and pushing it out on Facebook and other platforms in order to promote the podcast. He and Phoebe also created a podcast equipment guide and provided it to members of the membership community who would be interested in started their own show.</p> <p><strong>2) Leveraged training</strong> \u2013 You can use process maps, standard operating procedures and instruction manuals to train new team members, both locally and virtually. It takes time upfront to do this, but saves you in the long run by making the onboarding process for new employees much easier.</p> <p><strong>3) Leveraged promotions</strong> \u2013 If a previous promotion already worked once, you don\u2019t need to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d and create something that is brand new. James\u2019 program \u201c48 Hour Film School\u201d used much of the same content for both launches, but generated about $600,000 in sales.</p> <p><strong>4) Leveraged assets</strong> \u2013 What are the things that you own or rent that could be used in multiple ways? James\u2019 office is one example and is used for work by the team, as well as meetings with clients and as an event space. It also houses their film studio, and can be rented out and used by other entrepreneurs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "53:28", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Ep_34_Leverage__mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1466670600, "title": "Episode 033: Finding Your Sweet Spot (Money, Love & Business)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this latest \u201cQuestion of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe show you how you can find the sweet spot between doing what you love, doing what you\u2019re good at, and doing what makes you money.

It\u2019s all here!</p> <p><strong>Doing what you love</strong></p> <p>To James, doing something that you love, for money, is an affirmation that you\u2019re doing something right. As Phoebe notes, you can have different loves at different times in your life though.</p> <p>James got his start online selling a \u201cHow to Bartend\u201d course.

That\u2019s an ideal situation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Doing what you\u2019re good at</strong></p> <p>There are a lot of things that you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re good at, because you\u2019ve never done them before.

Once she figured this out, she immediately changed her major to business and marketing.</p> <p>James adds that if you\u2019re good at sales, you\u2019re going to make money.</p> <p>Phoebe polled her friends in business and asked them what they thought were the five things she\u2019s good at.</p> <p>Starting out, James helped someone at a conference with uploading a video to YouTube. Her positive reaction and gratitude allowed him to learn what he is good at.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, it was the opportunity to discover how much I take for granted what I know\u201d</p> <p><strong>Doing what makes you money</strong></p> <p>A business exists to make money and to generate a profit. This happens when the business solves a problem. For this reason, you need to figure out where the problem is and if you\u2019re good at solving it, someone will pay for the product or service.</p> <p>The biggest problems to solve right now for people are related to time and money.</p> <p>People will try to overcomplicate things, but it really just takes modifying what\u2019s already working. While in college, James paid $800 for a two-week bartending course. This gave him the idea to make a cheaper, digital version.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t validate an idea and then try to make it profitable. I try to make the idea profitable, which inherently validates it.\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe did something similar with a course on Canva, building it as she went along. She says this was a stress-free way to launch a product and validate an idea.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://pitchanything.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cPitch Anything\u201d by Oren Klaff</a></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>", "duration": "41:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_033_Love_Good_and_Money_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1466411400, "title": "Episode 032: How to Get Your Time Back (Time Chronicles Part 3/4)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In the third installment of \u201cThe Time Chronicles\u201d series, James and Phoebe give 11 strategies that you can implement in your business in order to be more effective, and get your time back.</p> <p>James believes that often, doing work creates more work, and people will try to combat busyness by doing more. The goal of this series isn\u2019t to give you more time so that you can get more done.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just focus on results. It should be results-oriented work.\u201d</p> <p>You need to define what results you are looking for, and achieve them with the least amount of effort or output possible.</p> <p><strong>11 strategies to help get your time back</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Spend more time playing, planning and daydreaming</strong></p> <p>Abraham-Hicks has a quote that says, \u201cLeverage your time by spending a little more time every day imagining and a lot less time every day doing; just imagine yourself into the success and watch what happens. Imagine a little more, and act a little less\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe says you need to ask yourself, \u201cHow do I want to feel?\u201d and James reminds people that leaders need to take more time to do what they enjoy, guilt-free, to recharge themselves and inspire creativity.</p> <p><strong>2) Get really clear on your \u201cone thing\u201d and do that first</strong></p> <p>In Gary Keller\u2019s book, \u201cThe ONE Thing\u201d (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d) he asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the one thing you can do to make everything else easier or unnecessary? Do that thing first in your day.</p> <p>Trying this strategy for even just one week, and you\u2019ll see positive results. Practicing doing this will help you develop your priorities, until you\u2019re really clear on what you want.</p> <p><strong>3) Get your team clear on their \u201cone thing.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s important to get everyone approaching business from the same vantage point!</p> <p><strong>4) Drop everything that isn\u2019t important</strong></p> <p>James notes that saying \u201cNo\u201d to things is really one of the secrets to getting more time.</p> <p><strong>5) Let go by outsourcing and delegating</strong></p> <p>A previous episode of the podcast focused on how to (and not to) outsource (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d). For an entrepreneur, it\u2019s important to remember that almost everything in your business can be done by someone else, and there\u2019s no need for the business owner to be doing task that could be outsourced for $10/hour (or less).</p> <p><strong>6) Remember \u201cParkinson\u2019s Law\u201d</strong></p> <p>Parkinson\u2019s Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion.</p> <p>Phoebe allows herself time off to do the things that she enjoys, and that aren\u2019t business-related. She even blocks off this time in her calendar to do this each week.</p> <p><strong>7) Master communication</strong></p> <p>James shares a quote he heard to summarize communication, or lack of, between leaders and their teams:</p> <p>\u201cWhen a flower doesn\u2019t bloom, you don\u2019t blame the flower, you blame the environment in which it grows\u201d</p> <p>The environment plays a vital role in the behavior and performance of your team, and as the business owner, you alone are responsible for creating the environment.</p> <p>Using a customized version of the \u201cScrum Method\u201d by Jeff Sutherland (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d), James has created an environment whereby communication is paramount.</p> <p><strong>8) Create better systems</strong></p> <p>The last episode of the podcast discussed systems, and James has implemented project management software, password protection/sharing tools and file sharing programs to make day-to-day operations as efficient as possible for all team members (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p><strong>9) Set clear deadlines</strong></p> <p>To realize what you are working towards, you need to ask \u201cWho, What, Where and When\u201d in relation to the project.</p> <p>Phoebe adds that so many deadlines get missed because no one is taking responsibility for certain tasks getting done.</p> <p><strong>10) Prioritize and create a \u201cminimum viable project\u201d</strong></p> <p>To do this, you need to look at every single thing on your to-do list and ask yourself if you really need to do it. You then can get clear on the things that are the very minimum needed to get the results that you\u2019re after.</p> <p>In a recent promotion, James\u2019 team directed potential customers direct to a sales cart, without setting up a sales page, and achieved strong results.</p> <p><strong>11) Use leverage</strong></p> <p>Leverage is about doing one thing, and figuring out how that one thing can be used in multiple ways. For example, you could record a podcast and then use it in a future blog post, or as a bonus for a course.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s all these different ways that you can leverage one piece of content\u201d</p> <p>In the near future, there will be an episode dedicated specifically to the topic of leverage!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.the1thing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe ONE Thing\u201d by Gary Keller</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/3/\" target=\"_blank\">7 Tips for Failing Miserably at Outsourcing</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cScrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\u201d by Jeff Sutherland</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/31/\" target=\"_blank\">Improving the Systems in Your Business</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "41:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_032_Get_Your_Time_Back_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1466065800, "title": "Episode 031: Improving the Systems in Your Business", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this latest \u201cQuestion of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe address the topic of systems in your business. Want to learn how to manage your time and your team? If so, this is an episode you\u2019re not going to want to miss!</p> <p>If your tendency is to improvise in your business, no amount of systems will really help, as there is a bigger problem. Phoebe notes that you can improvise a little within the system though, and the system is just giving you the direction.</p> <p>James adds that running a business takes some discipline, and the larger your team gets, the more that discipline becomes a necessity.</p> <p>In Gary Keller\u2019s \u201cThe One Thing\u201d (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d), he advises that you start asking the little questions that put structure in your day. James likes to identify one to three things for the upcoming week that he needs to accomplish in order to get him and the team closer to the results that they\u2019re looking for.</p> <p>People can\u2019t read your mind, which can set your employees up for failure.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game of how we become more efficient and how we become a more well-oiled team\u201d</p> <p>James\u2019 team uses dapulse (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d), a tool for managing projects. Within this tool, there is a color-coded weekly task board where the tasks are identified, assigned with a due date and given a status. Using this, by the end of day Sunday, he is clear on what the upcoming workweek is suppose to look like to advance the business.</p> <p>They have a team meeting every second week, which is important since James can explain why he\u2019s making the decisions he\u2019s making.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the vision, where are we headed and what are we up to?\u201d</p> <p>The team exchanges emails every Friday, in which each member tells the others about his or her biggest wins, high and low points, and more, along with a random question to help with team building.</p> <p>There is a distinct difference between running the day-to-day operations of a business versus creating something new, like a launch or promotion. When creating something new, the team uses Jeff Sutherland\u2019s \u201cScrum Method\u201d (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p>James has the team run in \u201csprints\u201d and focus 100% on a project, with a specific start and end date. During this time, they get on a call at the same time every day to have a meeting, and each team member answers what they did yesterday, what\u2019s getting in their way and what they are doing that day. Knowing what is getting in the way for each person is the most important question, as it will give an indication of how communication and efficiency can be improved.</p> <p>James always looks to see if a process can be automated, as the more you can remove the human element, the less likely there will be errors. For example, they use SamCart, which links to InfusionSoft and automatically applies a tag if a payment is rejected. With this tag, Infusionsoft then automatically removes the customer from the members\u2019 area, until payment is received. Automatic emails from both programs also save the team time and energy in the process.</p> <p>Using a plugin that integrates with Infusionsoft, SendOutCards is another tool that provides automation. When a sale is made, the customer can automatically be sent a \u201cthank you\u201d card. Phoebe believes that extra touches like this are often missing, especially in online business (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p>There are a number of screen capture tutorials that can take the guesswork, and skill required, out of the equation of training new employees (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.the1thing.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The One Thing</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://dapulse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dapulse</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://samcart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SamCart</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.infusionsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Infusionsoft</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sendoutcards.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SendOutCards</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sweetprocess.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SweetProcess</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jing</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>", "duration": "39:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode031_Improving_the_Systems_In_Your_Business__mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1465806600, "title": "Episode 030: How to Stop Time (Time Chronicles Part 2/4)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In the second part of \u201cThe Time Chronicles\u201d, James and Phoebe discuss the limiting beliefs that are eating away at your time and give you practical advice while showing how you can stop time!</p> <p>James says we have more power and control over time than we might think. He talks about an experience he had in which he was able to catch a flight he was going to be late for, and the circumstances that led to this happening.</p> <p>When we approach issues such as being late using The Law of Attraction, you will get what you expect.</p> <p>Gay Hendricks says when we switch from \u201cNewtonian Time\u201d to \u201cEinstein Time\u201d (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d), you can realize the power and ability to create what you need to and stop becoming a victim to time.</p> <p>James notes that to do this, you need to consider that you are the actual source of time.</p> <p>\u201cRealize we are the source of all those stories (about time). We\u2019re the ones creating that relationship with time.\u201d</p> <p>When you resist a moment, such as being stuck in traffic, it actually will seem to go much slower.</p> <p>\u201cThe best way to accept it is to acknowledge that you choose that moment in time. Really get present to where you\u2019re at.\u201d</p> <p>We can affect our experience on time, based on our ability to accept or resist our current situation, and time doesn\u2019t have to be a barrier we face.</p> <p><strong>Limiting beliefs that are eating away at your time</strong></p> <p><strong>1) More time equals more money</strong></p> <p>Working more to make more money can be a very dangerous concept for an entrepreneur or business owner, as there are only so many hours in a day. When this is someone\u2019s way of thinking, his or her default action becomes to work longer.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to make more money, it\u2019s not about time. It\u2019s about solving bigger problems and reaching more people.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2) You have to be doing it all</strong></p> <p>A lot of people online have a guilty need to be on every social media platform, all day long. They have a fear that they will be missing out if they\u2019re not somewhere, and their business will die.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to do it all, you\u2019re probably not doing any of them very well\u201d</p> <p>James focused on YouTube first, which he spent years mastering, and he used other platforms to promote his channel.</p> <p><strong>3) I can\u2019t afford to outsource/No one can do it all well as I can/It\u2019s quicker if I just do it myself</strong></p> <p>Phoebe reminds people that you can\u2019t afford not to outsource, and if you give others the opportunity to do the work they might actually do it better than you would have.</p> <p>James adds that in a true business, everything is able to be replicated using systems, and can be done by others.</p> <p>It may take a bit of time to train someone else in the beginning, but by looking long-term you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re building something bigger, and not just focusing on the assignment in front of you.</p> <p><strong>4) It has to be perfect the first time</strong></p> <p>Trying to be a perfectionist will really eat at your time and you\u2019ll delay launching your course, program etc. James adds that the actual feedback and experiences your customers and users will have will allow you make improvements.</p> <p>\u201cGet really good at prioritizing and not trying to be perfect\u201d</p> <p><strong>5) My email is my \u201cto-do\u201d list</strong></p> <p>This way of thinking causes you to be reactive in your business as it lets your email dictate your day. Phoebe uses Boomerang to help her prioritize her emails (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p>James says that you can\u2019t develop good habits if you still have a poor relationship with time. We can\u2019t do everything, and we\u2019ve got to choose to do the things that we really want to do. It\u2019s a continual practice, and in the next episode, you\u2019ll learn how to get your time back with specific strategies, tactics and practices.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hendricks.com/newwp/wp-content/uploads/Einstein_Time_EFP_Intro.pdf\"> Gay Hendricks' <em>Intro to Einstein Time</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mindyourbusinesspodcast.com/podcast/23\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 023: Zero to Zen: How to Meditate the Easy Way</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.boomeranggmail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boomerang</a></p>", "duration": "42:49", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode030_Time_Chronicles_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1465461000, "title": "Episode 029: When to Quit & When to Keep Going", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this \u201cQuestion of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe explain how you will know when your idea, project or business has wings to fly, or it\u2019s time to call it quits.</p> <p>James reminds people that you don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to do anything, and the beauty of the Universe is that it\u2019s there to help and guide you. The Universe is never going to tell you to stop chasing what you desire.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have a desire that comes from within, I believe it is a possible reality in your future\u201d</p> <p>The key is not to approach it from a place of uncertainty or worry. Step back and get really clear on what you want.</p> <p>Many people will say that they don\u2019t know what they want. The easiest way to determine this is to ask, \u201cWhat is the essence of what I want?\u201d</p> <p>The Universe will give you the most direct path to getting what you want, and it\u2019s actually you doing the stopping.</p> <p>\u201cWhat it takes from you is an absolute feeling, knowing, being and resonating of trust; of knowing and expecting beyond believing.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s important not to wait until everything is perfect. If you\u2019re denying yourself that feeling and experience now, you\u2019re also denying that thing you believe is going to be given to you.</p> <p>People tend to get too attached to how something is supposed to show up. Phoebe had a breakdown around a move to San Diego, when it didn\u2019t turn out the way she thought that it would. When she decided to move to San Francisco, she immediately knew that was where she was really supposed to be.</p> <p>You need to ask yourself if you truly feel that you\u2019re worthy of receiving what you desire.</p> <p>\u201cThe Universe is saying if you ask, it is given\u201d</p> <p>James notes that we\u2019re taught all of our lives to be employees and to \u201cfall in line\u201d while following directions from others. He says that we need to unlearn 90% of what we were taught in the public education system.</p> <p>In 2007, he realized he could create an online business and launched his first course.

The average interruption can take up to 5 minutes, which totals four hours, or 50% of the average workday. Most of these interruptions are typically labelled as \u201clittle to no value.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil we address the actual problem, we\u2019re just left with a lot of really cool tips and tricks, but never get to the source of it\u201d</p> <p>James says that it\u2019s possible for us to change our relationship with time, and he believes that we\u2019re all meant to live a happy and extraordinary life.</p> <p>\u201cYou are worth of that, you are deserving of that, and you can have that\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not time, or lack of it, that\u2019s keeping us from getting the things that you want. It\u2019s your relationship, or story with time, that\u2019s doing this.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever is going on outside could be an indicator for whatever is going on inside\u201d</p> <p>The stories we have around time show a lack of power, personal responsibility and ownership.</p> <p>\u201cI believe what this comes down to is a lack of self-worth and value\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that when time and energy is used up, you don\u2019t get it back. Money can be spent, but made back again. However, most people link time to money.</p> <p>Phoebe adds that many entrepreneurs starting out in business think that the only two things they have control over are their time and money.</p> <p>James thinks this is ingrained in our thinking at a very early age. There\u2019s a pull for entrepreneurs to add more time, to justify the money they receive.</p> <p>Usually when you feel frustrated, overwhelmed, rushed or anxious, your relationship with time isn\u2019t serving you you\u2019re thinking with a scarcity mindset, or not having enough time. This is because we tend to experience time as absolute and linear.</p> <p>However, time is relative and James feels that there is a way to experience time differently.</p> <p>\u201cIs time this thing you have no control over, or is it just a big excuse that keeps you from actually reaching your goals?\u201d</p> <p>If you feel a sense of guilt when receiving money, one of two things is happening: you\u2019re feeling that you\u2019re not worth the money, or you\u2019re perceiving a lack of abundance on the part of the other person that\u2019s giving you the money.</p> <p>Many people feel like the have to take on more clients, work harder, or put in more time in order to make more money. The key is to separate time and money.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can start to separate these, then we may be able to take back and have a little more power with our relationship with time\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re burnt out and exhausted, it\u2019s more difficult to provide value to others.</p> <p>If you want to make more money, you need to either solve bigger problems or reach more people, or both. The answer doesn\u2019t involve spending more time. James notes that with the Internet, you can do both of these things with time being irrelevant.</p> <p>Craig Ballantyne\u2019s 5% rule says, \u201c5% of your activities are the ones that yield 95% of your revenue and results\u201d, and James reminds others:</p> <p>\u201cYour passion is fuelled with profit\u201d</p> <p><strong>In the next instalments of \u201cThe Time Chronicles\u201d, we explore:</strong></p> <ul> <li>A concept from Gay Hendricks\u2019 \u201cThe Big Leap\u201d called \u201cEinstein Time\u201d (this will show you how to create a new relationship with time so you can literally stop it)</li> <li>The limiting beliefs that are affecting your time and how to create more empowering ones</li> <li>11 specific things you can do to start getting your time back</li> <li>The concept of \u201cleverage\u201d, and how it can be put to work for you</li> </ul> <p><strong><br /></strong><strong><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a><br /> <br /> INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.earlytorise.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Ballantyne\u2019s Website</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Big-Leap-Conquer-Hidden-Level/dp/0061735361/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465170521&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+big+leap\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Big Leap\u201d by Gay Hendricks</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465170375&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=essentialism\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cEssentialism\u201d by Greg McKeown</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465170421&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+one+thing+gary+keller\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe One Thing\u201d by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan</a></p>", "duration": "52:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_028_Master_Your_Relationship_With_Time_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1464856200, "title": "Episode 027: Who Should You Trust?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this \u201cQuestion of the Week\u201d episode, James and Phoebe discuss how you can determine if people are trustworthy in today\u2019s information age where everyone is the \u201cguru.\u201d</p> <p>First of all, you need to always trust yourself and your intuition, which was explained in a previous episode of the podcast (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p>Entrepreneurs that are growing and looking to become high-performers have to be coachable and open, as a lot are trapped and don\u2019t see their \u201cblind spots.\u201d In order to get beyond them and have a breakthrough, a lot of trust is required when seeking help.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to be willing to do what you\u2019ve never done before\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, who you trust is just a matter of trial and error.

In this episode, James and Phoebe share their experiences with the current high-level mastermind group that they are running. Learn the reasons behind why masterminds work, the benefits you can get from joining one, and how you can go about forming your own (or joining the ideal one for you).</p> <p>James joined his first mastermind in 2008, paying $18,000 a year to take part, even though he really couldn\u2019t afford it. This is where het met Lewis Howes, and they started a business together, putting James \u201con the map\u201d for YouTube and video marketing.</p> <p>\u201cThat all came from a relationship in a mastermind group\u201d</p> <p>Since then, with the exception of one year, he\u2019s been in a mastermind. He felt and noticed a significant difference in his business for that time he wasn\u2019t in a mastermind. He strongly considers a mastermind a requirement in business, not just an option.</p> <p>The term \u201cmastermind\u201d was coined by Napoleon Hill, who stated:</p> <p>\u201cThe mastermind principle consists of an alliance of two or more minds working in perfect harmony for the attainment of a common, definite objective. No two minds ever come together without a third invisible force, which may be likened to a third mind. When a group of individual minds are co-ordinated and function in harmony, the increased energy created through that alliance becomes available to every individual in that group.\u201d</p> <p>James explains that the moment you combine two or more people together, you have something infinitely more powerful that in those people were to do it alone, on their own.</p> <p><strong>Why do masterminds work?</strong></p> <p><strong>1) They raise the vibration</strong></p> <p>When you\u2019re in a room of people that have the same intention, the energy of the room takes on its own vibration.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the right group of people, I mean it could literally re-ignite your life\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re creating your own mastermind group, determine what vibration you want, and what your group stands for.</p> <p><strong>2) They make you aware of blind spots</strong></p> <p>A mastermind mind group can look objectively at what you\u2019re dealing with, and identify those things you might not be able to see.</p> <p>\u201cIf you feel like you\u2019re getting in your own way, that\u2019s an indicator that you have blind spots\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe shares that there are some things that she can tell her mastermind that she couldn\u2019t tell peers in her industry that aren\u2019t part of the group.</p> <p>James adds that since online entrepreneurs with personal brands often face issues such as refunds, complaints and personal attacks, the support received from a mastermind is important.</p> <p><strong>3) They give you accountability</strong></p> <p>In the mastermind they run, members are required to set goals that they want to achieve before the next quarter, when they all meet again in-person. To Phoebe, not only does this mean you\u2019re stepping up your own game, but you don\u2019t want to be the only person in the room who doesn\u2019t deliver what he or she were supposed to.</p> <p><strong>4) They provide new ideas, contents and strategies</strong></p> <p>Using the new ideas gained from masterminds can be looked at as \u201cfine tuning\u201d your business, and can help you avoid potential pitfalls. You can infuse the strategies into what\u2019s already working for you and your business.</p> <p>Phoebe was intimidated when looking for a mastermind group to join a few years ago. She asked someone in her Facebook group, who happened to be in a mastermind with an opening.</p> <p>James notes that it\u2019s been said that, \u201ca mastermind finds you.\u201d</p> <p>If you don\u2019t join a paid one, you can start you own.</p> <p><strong>7 tips to forming a true, successful mastermind:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Qualify your mastermind members</strong></p> <p>This tip accounts for up to 90% of the success of your group, as the group is only as strong as the weakest member.</p> <p>There are certain qualities that you should look for:</p> <ul> <li>The members should really want to be in a mastermind</li> <li>Look at what level they are at; get a good mix of people and make sure each member can bring something to the table for the rest of the group</li> <li>The participants should be people that you enjoy hanging out with and being around, as it is much more than just a \u201cbusiness group\u201d</li> <li>Everyone should be willing to give and share with the other member</li> <li>Each person needs to be coachable</li> </ul> <p>To vet members for their group, James sent an email out to his list and was specific about what they were looking for. An overwhelming amount of applications were received, and each person had to complete and in-depth survey. He and Phoebe narrowed it down and got on the phone with people to go deeper. They looked at how each individual, and group as a whole, would mix and interact together.</p> <p><strong>2) Identify a common thread that ties the group together</strong></p> <p>For James and Phoebe\u2019s mastermind, every member is an online course creator, online influence, author or online coach. Some other groups are based off of gender, occupation, etc.</p> <p><strong>3) Make sure there is a clear intention and benefit for the group</strong></p> <p>For them, it\u2019s that each member is committed to having a breakthrough year in his or her member, and the mastermind group is the catalyst for this.</p> <p><strong>4) Have a clear structure</strong></p> <p>Their group meets in person four times a year, once each quarter. During these meetings, members do a five-minute presentation asking their \u201cbig question\u201d to the group. With this exercise, the result they want is identified, as well as where they are currently. The other members give 25 minutes of feedback. In each meeting, two members also do a presentation on a specific topic such as leveraging Facebook groups in business, finding your ideal client avatar, and more.</p> <p><strong>5) Lay out the deliverables of what they\u2019ll get</strong></p> <p>In addition to the benefits mentioned, in James and Phoebe\u2019s group the members also get access to an online members\u2019 portal, and a \u201cmembers\u2019 rolodex\u201d, where everyone can share resources like service providers and freelancers.</p> <p><strong>6) Be consistent</strong></p> <p>Masterminds only work when they are consistent, and the creators are held responsible for maintaining the consistency of the group and setting the town. At the end of each meeting, confirm when the next one will be and get a verbal commitment from each member to be there.</p> <p>However, be careful with the frequency, as weekly meetings may be too often. For this reason, James and Phoebe keep to one in-person meeting per quarter.</p> <p><strong>7) Foster a sense of community</strong></p> <p>James and Phoebe incorporate a fun activity into each event, such as hosting a bonfire on the beach. It should be something outside of the work setting, where the members can get to know each other and be themselves.</p> <p>They have a small Facebook group for the members, which further builds the sense of community. In addition, several members have co-ordinate calls with each other outside of the actual group calls and meetings.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>At the second mastermind in-person event of the year, both James and Phoebe noticed a massive difference in the members, with them having a big shift in energy and mentality.</p> <p>The group members each came into their own power, with much more power and conviction. However, the new theme seemed to be that they didn\u2019t have the time to learn any more content.</p> <p>James felt they need to now be in creation, and launch mode and told them:</p> <p>\u201cEverything that you need, in your business and in your life, is available within these four wall\u201d</p> <p>The true value of their mastermind is that they are able to get the support from the entire group, and not just him or Phoebe. He says that it\u2019s their role to set the tone, facilitate the experience and hold that space for the breakthroughs to occur.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "54:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Ep026Mastermind_mixdown.liteREVISED.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1464251400, "title": "Episode 025: How to Deal with Negative Environments and People", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In the first episode of the new segment, \u201cQuestion of the Week\u201d, Coral Chipoendsle asks James and Phoebe, \u201cHow do you deal with negative environments and people\u201d?</p> <p>This topic is relevant for online entrepreneurs especially, as they are their own brands.

James use to be a very left-brained and logical person but now opens himself up to trusting his intuition.</p> <p>When he was child, he was doing entrepreneurial things and he feels we all have an innate calling to do what makes us happy.</p> <p>\u201cIt gets trained out of us and then we spend the rest of our life trying to trust it again\u201d</p> <p>He says it\u2019s our natural tendency to be full of joy, passion and gratitude.</p> <p>\u201cIf we simply let go of focusing on all that negative stuff, we can begin to raise our vibrations and go more into a place of inspired action\u201d</p> <p>Intuition is about being able to see ahead.</p> <p>\u201cTo be able to see the unseen, that\u2019s really what entrepreneurship is\u201d</p> <p><strong>There are four ways that people receive intuitive messages:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Clairsentience \u2013 the ability to feel and experience different energy</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Clairvoyance - the ability to receive a picture in the mind</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Claircognizance \u2013 the ability to hear something, such as a voice</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Clairaudience \u2013 a \u201cknowing\u201d, without knowing how it got there</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe more we can recognize (intuition), the more we can listen for it\u201d</p> <p>An exercise you can do is to write down a simple list of five action items or decisions you\u2019ve made recently that worked out for you, and five that did not. Try to identify if your intuition played a role in these decisions at all.</p> <p>Was there a feeling or sign that guided you towards the right decision, or encourage you away from the wrong ones?</p> <p><strong>A 6-step process for strengthening your intuition muscle is:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Get clear on what you want. This is what should be guiding you.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Get present, as \u201cin the moment\u201d as possible</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Ask the right questions</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Trust</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Take action on the intuition\u00a0</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Acknowledge your intuition and thank it</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0<a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>", "duration": "01:06:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/UsingYourIntuitionInBusiness_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1463473800, "title": "Episode 023: Zero to Zen: How to Meditate the Easy Way", "author": "", "summary": "<p>What exactly is meditation, and what are its benefits? In this episode, James and Phoebe are joined by Chris von der Mehden to discuss how meditation can not only improve a person\u2019s health, but also have a significant impact on one\u2019s business.</p> <p><strong>There are many studies that prove the benefits of practicing meditation, including ones that show:</strong></p> <ul> <li>People that meditate have better preserved brains than non-meditators<br /> <br /></li> <li>Reduced activity of the \u201cmonkey mind\u201d, or little voice(s) in our head<br /> <br /></li> <li>Positive effects for people with depression<br /> <br /></li> <li>Meditation actually changes the structure of the brain, which can improve learning and memory<br /> <br /></li> <li>Increased concentration and attention span<br /> <br /></li> <li>A reduction in anxiety, specifically social anxiety<br /> <br /></li> <li>Improved sleep<br /> <br /></li> <li>Reduced blood pressure</li> </ul> <p>To Chris von der Mehden, meditation in its simplest form is about becoming present.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the real benefit and the reason why I meditate is to really just become who deep down I want to be\u201d</p> <p>dPreviously, Chris found himself in a place of emotional turmoil and didn\u2019t know his purpose in life. He started to explore spirituality, and he says that meditation automatically showed up.</p> <p>The first time he meditated, he says he just let his \u201cemotional garbage\u201d out and for the first time in his life, his brain was quiet. He believes that the ability to meditate and connect with something higher is already built into all of us.</p> <p>\u201cI realized there was a much more real experience of a spiritual life\u201d</p> <p>He believes the first step in starting to meditate is to find your \u201cWhy\u201d, then go deeper and ask yourself more questions as to why you want to meditate.</p> <p>For Chris, the reason to meditate was to help people.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you have that clarity, that becomes your highest vision of yourself in that moment\u201d</p> <p>He adds that by determining your reason for practicing meditation, it will give you a destination, and the intention to get to that place.</p> <p>The next step that Chris recommends is once you get through a meditation session, spend the next hour or two living from that space you achieved by meditating. For him, he writes or works on a course.</p> <p>\u201cThe real goal of meditating is to live life from that place of being\u201d</p> <p>For James, meditation is the \u201cwork before the work\u201d of creation as an entrepreneur.</p> <p>Chris says that in some ways, meditation is a way of returning to your childhood and a place of freedom.</p> <p>The \u201cmonkey mind\u201d is a little voice that appears to distract you and tell you little stories. When you meditate, the mind gets quiet and you get to feel emotions.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time (an emotion) comes up and you feel it and let it go, those are just the golden moments\u201d</p> <p>He says you need to give yourself permission to feel emotions such as nervousness, as a resisting them can actually make them worse.</p> <p>Chris recommends that you have a thought, observe that you have it, and enjoy yourself having the thought. When you enjoy something, the mind automatically goes away.</p> <p>A half an hour is a great time to start with during a sitting meditation, but if you\u2019re not able to do this, even going for a short walk, to enjoy everything you see, is a good start. Chris does one seated meditation a day, but goes to a state of enjoyment as much as he can throughout the day.</p> <p>\u201cPracticing enjoyment; that\u2019s where you get all the benefits of meditation and the problems disappear\u201d</p> <p>He notes that the more present you become, the more powerful you become.</p> <p>James\u2019 routine is 10 to 15 minutes of meditating as soon as he gets up, and then once or twice more during the day. This helps him not be as reactive to things that happen and allows him to look at issues instead as creative opportunities.</p> <p>He says that business is all about solving problems, and that staying open to a solution and looking for the opportunity in it will allow us to be more effective.</p> <p>When you learn how to meditate and be in the state of enjoyment, it is possible to bring that to another person. In fact, meditation can be more effective in a group setting.</p> <p>\u201cIt becomes this feedback effect where you\u2019re basically just enlightening each other\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ZeroToZenMeditation.com\">Chris\u2019 Zero to Zen Course</a></p>", "duration": "01:00:33", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_023_Zero_to_Zen_How_to_Meditate_the_Easy_Way__mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1463017826, "title": "Episode 022: How Walking Can Change Your Life with Derek Halpern", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Derek Halpern is the founder of SocialTriggers.com, a thriving business that sells software, online courses and digital training. In this episode, he talks with James and Phoebe about the seemingly unremarkable daily habits that help people become extraordinary in business. More specifically, how walking can change your life!</p> <p>Derek says that there\u2019s a myth that people who succeed often do it at the expense of something else in their lives. He believes this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.</p> <p>He started to notice that successful people had the full package: a beautiful family, a remarkable business, and their health.</p> <p>\u201cSeeing their success proves on thing. It\u2019s possible to have it all.\u201d</p> <p>Fitness and being healthy is one area of importance for successful people, and walking is one way that people can achieve this. For this reason, Derek started his own walking challenge (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p>For the last 16 months, Derek has been walking about 10,000 steps each day. He started because his doctor gave him the news that he had a heart condition.</p> <p>In his research, Derek discovered amazing side effects of walking.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are more focused. They\u2019ve got more energy. They feel better about themselves.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that as an entrepreneur, you can come up with the best ideas when you\u2019re walking. Recently, Derek was having a bad day and chose to go for a walk through Central Park in New York City. He says that noticing people having a good time gave him a different type of perspective.</p> <p>\u201cAt that moment, I felt better about what was happening\u201d</p> <p>Derek has also used walking as a way to improve his creativity when trying to come up with sales copy.</p> <p>\u201cYou take your mind off of the thing that you\u2019re trying to solve and all these things happen in the background that can make you come up with that new idea\u201d</p> <p>Walking specifically in new surroundings can \u201cassault\u201d your senses with new information. Derek prefers walking outdoors, as opposed to on treadmills or treadmill desks inside.</p> <p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s (the) walking, or the outside, I\u2019m happy about it\u201d</p> <p>To make walking a daily habit, Derek believes that you need to find something you\u2019re already doing, and change it slightly. He use to go to a coffee shop across the street every morning, but now chooses one that\u2019s 6 or 7 blocks away.</p> <p>He also reminds people to stand up throughout the day. Setting an alarm on your phone to move every 45 minutes is one way to do this.</p> <p>Phoebe quotes a study by The University of Utah whereby walking for only two minutes per hour every day can reduce your premature death rate by 33%.</p> <p>Derek says the challenge he set up is designed to help people walk more, by setting small goals, without overwhelming them.</p> <p>Tools like Fitbit and the iPhone Health App can help you track your daily steps.</p> <p>As Derek has gotten more successful in business, he realizes it\u2019s the seemingly insignificant things that set people apart. He notes that Beethoven, Tim Ferriss and LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner have all credited taking walks as helping them achieve success.</p> <p>\u201cIf something as small as going for a walk can help so many different successful people, why aren\u2019t you doing it?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!<br /> <br /></a> <strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jameswedmore.com/walking\" target=\"_blank\">Derek\u2019s Walking Challenge</a></p>", "duration": "31:38", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/DerekHalpern_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1462869000, "title": "Episode 021: Know Thyself (Part 2)", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In today\u2019s episode, James and Phoebe continue the conversation on the topic of the Myers Briggs Personality Test, and how it relates to building your business. This tool can allow you to become more comfortable with who you really are, help you ensure you are aligned with your true passions, and help you see that what you have considered weaknesses, could be your greatest strengths.</p> <p>Here are some traits of the different personality types that you should be aware of:</p> <p><strong>Introvert (I):</strong></p> <p>The Introverts are inwardly focused and don\u2019t inherently grasp the value of networking and relationships as much as extroverted people. James has increasingly come to realize the power of having a team involved in his business.</p> <p>\u201cThe more I\u2019ve discovered the power of a team, the power of having others support you and help you, it\u2019s changed my whole belief\u201d</p> <p>Being this type of person doesn\u2019t mean you should limit yourself and not speak on stage, do webinars or other actions that may be out of your comfort zone.</p> <p>Introverts are detailed-oriented, figure things out and have the patience to dive deep.</p> <p><strong>Extrovert (E):</strong></p> <p>Extroverts form connections and relationships with others more quickly than introverts, which can be a strength that they have in business. They are faster with taking action and putting themselves out there.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at where your strengths are and where your potential pitfalls, blind spots and weaknesses are\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sensor (S):</strong></p> <p>Sensors make sure everything is working and they are detailed-oriented. They believe in structure, stability, processes and systems, which are all vital to the success of a business.</p> <p>They have to be careful, as they often can\u2019t connect all the pieces, which is also necessary. They also need to consider if they really have a vision for where they are heading.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing usually takes a bigger vision\u201d</p> <p><strong>Intuitive (N):</strong></p> <p>Intuitives are visionaries that can see the \u201cforest through the trees.\u201d They also can sometimes get into trouble, as they tend to look too far into the future. Intuitives don\u2019t like details, which is why they work well together with sensing types.</p> <p>\u201c(Sensors) are going to be able to ground your vision and help you with getting it done\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe notes that in tech startups, the marketing person typically has the vision, and the tech co-founder is the person who looks after all the steps to execute.</p> <p><strong>Thinker (T):</strong></p> <p>Thinkers are left-brained and logical people, like Tim Ferriss, who enjoy hacking things and figuring out how to do more with less. They discover efficiencies in processes, and are always looking for a new way to do something.</p> <p>Their downfall involves marketing and selling, in most cases.</p> <p><strong>Feeler (F):</strong></p> <p>Feelers are right-brained and emotional, with Gary Vaynerchuk being one example of this personality type. They are able to use emotion to bring people on a journey.</p> <p>Feelers don\u2019t enjoy anything that has to do with numbers or technology and aligning themselves with people who enjoy doing these things is a great business strategy.</p> <p><strong>Perceiver (P):</strong></p> <p>Perceivers aren\u2019t structured in how they plan out their day. In entrepreneurship, this can be considered a disadvantage as results are based off of actions. They also can struggle with following through on things.</p> <p>However, they are project starters and creative, which is important for business success.</p> <p><strong>Judger (J)</strong></p> <p>Judgers are in high demand in the business world, as James notes.</p> <p>\u201cI know so many people, their business is successful, simply because they know how to follow through\u201d</p> <p>Their downfall can be a lack of flexibility, which is needed to allow creativity. They also can be overly stressed when they have deadlines approaching.</p> <p>Myers Briggs Personality Types can be used to determine the best employee for a particular position. For example, an ESTJ can make an excellent project manager as they are extroverted (E), detail-oriented (S) and structured (J). As Thinkers (T), they are also able to make the tough decisions needed to be made in the best interest of the project.</p> <p>You are still able to understand others, even if you only know a few of their letters.</p> <p>NTs are \u201cscientists\u201d able to solve problems, NFs are \u201cworld huggers\u201d that put humanity first, SJs are \u201ctraditionalists\u201d who work well with routine and structure and SPs are performers who want to feel the rush of being alive and present, always knowing how to present themselves.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that you\u2019ll never get where you want to go following the instruction manual of someone who has a different personality type than you do.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to look at who you really are. (Myers Briggs) is just one tool for discovering it.\u201d</p> <p>For James, Myers Briggs was a gift, and he credits it for allowing him to accept who he was, and still is. It can help you be comfortable with yourself, in the process learning to see what you thought were your weaknesses are really your true strengths, and \u201csecret weapons.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "50:15", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/MyersBriggsPart2_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1462264200, "title": "Episode 020: Know Thyself, Know Thy Business", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Knowing yourself will allow you to understand more how you can show up and operate as an entrepreneur. In this episode, James and Phoebe explain what the Myers Briggs Personality Test is all about, while allowing the listener to answer the question \u201cwhat type am I?\u201d</p> <p>Personality types aren\u2019t meant to limit you. You can learn much about yourself, and along the way, discover a lot about the people around you.</p> <p>At a business function in 2008, someone \u201cread\u201d James, based on his personality type, which fascinated him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat it did for me was open a door to discover this on my own\u201d</p> <p>He says he was an introvert growing up, referring to himself as shy and not knowing how to relate to others.</p> <p>\u201cI lived the first 25 years of my life thinking there was something drastically wrong with me because everywhere I looked, I found evidence that people were the exact opposite\u201d</p> <p>James discovered his Myers Briggs Personality Type is \u201cINTJ\u201d, which is one of the rarest of the 16 personality types in the framework. Myers Briggs allowed him to look at what he had as strengths, as opposed to weaknesses.</p> <p>\u201cI accepted who I was and really fell in love with that\u201d</p> <p>He created a journal that he kept for about 18 months, tracking and analyzing the personality types of people that he knew. He discovered a lot of similarities between them in terms of behaviors, mannerisms and even physical attributes. This has resulted in him being able to read people with great accuracy.</p> <p>\u201cIt has allowed me to be more effective in communication. The moment you work with one more person in your life, communication becomes the number one most important thing\u201d</p> <p>He believes that the one breakdown we have in communication is not being able to understand where the other person is coming from and what\u2019s going on with them.</p> <p>Knowing people\u2019s personality types can help in terms of hiring for new positions, as well as determining who the ideal client is for your business. The Myers Briggs system can even point you in the right direction for finding your purpose, or reaffirming the path that you are on.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that everyone has a purpose, and your purpose needsto be aligned with the things that come natural to you\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that no personality type is right or wrong, or better or worse, than another.</p> <p><strong>Myers Briggs is based on asking yourself a number of questions:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Are you an Extrovert (E) or Introvert(I)?</strong></p> <p>This question examines where you get your energy. If it\u2019s from internal sources, such as thoughts, ideas and imagination, those are introvert qualities. Extroverts tend to get their energy from being around people.</p> <p>Extroverts outnumber introverts about three to one, and it\u2019s common for introverts to live their life feeling pressured to feel they need more friends and have to go out more often in groups.</p> <p>Introverts often think first and speak second, enjoy peace and quiet and are great listeners. They love small gatherings and they believe that \u201ctalk is cheap.\u201d</p> <p>Extroverts talk first and think later, often have more friends and value that as something that\u2019s important to them. They are not as affected by external stimuli and find listening more difficult than talking. Often, they require more affirmation from others.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>\u00a0<strong>Are you a Sensor (S) orIntuitive (N)?</strong></p> <p>This question revolves around how we see the world and take in information, which can be challenging to describe but can have the biggest impact on who we are and how we communicate.</p> <p>About 60 to 70% of the population are sensors. Sensors prefer specific answers to specific questions, and are very detail oriented. They prefer jobs and tasks that yield a tangible result.</p> <p>Sensors want to master things, and identify with being \u201cthe best\u201d at something. These types of people would rather work with facts and figures than ideas and theories. They are very literally and tend to be more athletic than Intuitives.</p> <p>Intuitives can be seen as being absent-minded and can get frustrated with details. They are future-oriented, looking at the\u201cbig picture.\u201d They are able to draw a connection between people,things or ideas, and often are the type that will question authority.</p> <p>\u00a0<strong>3.\u00a0Are you a Thinker (T) or Feeler(F)?</strong></p> <p>This question looks at how we make decisions, whether in a logical way or from the heart.</p> <p>Thinkers are calm and collected, looking for what is fair and truthful rather than what will make people happy. To be a good manager of people, you most likely need to be a Thinker to make the tough decisions that are necessary. They are mathematical, scientific and left-brained in general.</p> <p>Feelers take other peoples\u2019 feelings in to account, and are more empathetic.</p> <p><strong>4.\u00a0Are you a Perceiver (P) or a Judger(J)?</strong></p> <p>This question looks at how you structure your day and life.</p> <p>Perceivers are creative and spontaneous,as well as good at starting projects. However, they can be easily distracted and are not big planners. They can be slightly disheveled in their appearance (males with longer hair and females wearing clothes that flow).</p> <p>Perceivers experience time in abundance, which is why they\u2019re always late.</p> <p>Judgers are very linear with their time, and structured in that they are probably the type that has to have \u201cto-do\u201d lists. As well, they are tasks finishers, taking a project from start to finish.</p> <p>Which type are you? Next week, in Part 2, we\u2019ll take a deeper look at the Myers Briggs Personality Types and how you can relate that to your business. Are you working on the things that you\u2019re naturally inclined to be working on?

This can open your channels for other possibilities, as sometimes your brain just needs a break to come up with a creative solution.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Visualization</strong> \u2013 Just before, or when their cart opens for a launch, Kate and Mike will light candles and focus on the value that they\u2019re bringing to others. She says the reason she does what she does is because she has so much fun helping people.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Repeat a Mantra</strong> \u2013 For one launch with a price point of $197, Mike repeated the \u201c197\u201d with each step he took during his walk to and from work, to help attract the desired results.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Getting Physical</strong> \u2013 Kate says sex is a powerful energy, and having it with the intention of spreading that energy into the cosmos will assist with a product launch. Doing things that are physical, including sex and dancing, will help get you in touch with your body. She says this is important, as often the mind can be limiting and the best solutions can often be found by feeling.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Be Aware of Astrology</strong> \u2013 Planning the launch around the appropriate time in terms of astrology can be helpful. Certain times are known for having issues, such as with technology and communication.</p>\n<p>Kate reminds us that tools such as Feng Shui, meditation, visualization and vision boards are simply accessories to keep our vibrations where we want them to be.</p>\n<p>She is excited to share the wisdom she has learned with her own daughter.

Despite the results, both James and Phoebe had big fears around launching the podcast.</p>\n<p>James says it was easy to record the episodes, but it was hard to promote it. He says the most uncomfortable point came when he sent the first email to his mailing list to let subscribers know that it had launched. Phoebe had fears around how she would sound behind the microphone.</p>\n<p>In addition to the podcast, Phoebe recently moved back to the United States and got a new place in San Francisco. She didn\u2019t know anyone in the city, as well as the housing costs being amongst the highest in the country.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For years, James has wanted to host a mastermind group for high-level, highly paid extraordinary entrepreneurs.

For this reason, she had four jobs at once when she was in university.</p>\n<p>This thought has hit her at every stage of her business, and it even comes up now from time-to-time.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quicker to get out of this when you have the tools\u201d</p>\n<p>James told her years ago that you can\u2019t reach 6-figures in your business without outsourcing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHard-earned money is harder to let go of\u201d</p>\n<p>Denise says that the money block itself is usually a symptom of something else which has typically been ingrained in the mind for a long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike anything, it comes down to our stories\u201d</p>\n<p>Not only are our money blocks a result of what happened to us, but also it\u2019s also what we have made it all mean.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change the past, but only what you\u2019ve created and the beliefs around it\u201d</p>\n<p>Denise shares that if you can unravel your money story, it\u2019s a powerful lesson and it really does free you to choose something else. She says a valuable exercise you can do is to make a list of everything you remember believing about money. Look for patterns and common denominators, and the more often you do this, the shorter the list will get.</p>\n<p>She believes strongly that money blocks will affect your use of The Law of Attraction, as you need a strong \u201cfoundation\u201d of thoughts.</p>\n<p>De-cluttering everything (physically, emotionally, spiritually and energetically) will help you manifest more money. Find the \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d and start there, as the action of de-cluttering will create momentum.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u201d by Marie Kondo is a great resource that can help you de-clutter (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p>\n<p>By changing your language and thinking of manifesting as more of \u201ctraining for your brain\u201d, it will be more effective.</p>\n<p>\u201cFind a way that resonates with you. You\u2019ve got to do something, otherwise you\u2019re just going to stay the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>In her first book, she tells the story of how she manifested a 6-month all-expense-paid trip around the world. To do this, she used the power of intention to win a trip as part of a promotion for a honeymoon company. To do so, she and her husband beat 10 other couples.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was never a doubt in my mind that we were going to win it\u201d</p>\n<p>She says that part of de-cluttering is just to be ready for the outcome, and to detach from it. A big part of this is being really clear and honest about what you want, and to not care exactly how you get there.</p>\n<p>When you de-clutter, things will come to light and help you determine what you want. Denise says that some people are afraid to ask for what they want.</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk about your dreams. Talk them into reality.\u201d</p>\n<p>Denise explains that a lot of the stuff people struggle with in terms of money comes from a feeling of not being enough, which leads to thoughts of not deserving a great business or life.</p>\n<p>Her best advice for dealing with people who judge us for stepping into the next level of abundance is to just work on yourself, and not worrying about scenarios that often aren\u2019t even true. When we step into our power, it can often make others feel unsettled, but you can\u2019t get business advice from what she calls, \u201cinappropriate sources.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK not to share everything that happens in your life and business\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Denise\u2019s 5 Steps To Manifesting More Money (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS for her downloadable \u201ccheat sheet\u201d)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

She often reviews her own cheat sheet and goes back through the 5 steps listed here.</p>\n<p>She admits that she\u2019s been scared herself when moving into a more expensive home and considering new business opportunities.</p>\n<p>\u201cBusiness is scary.

James and Phoebe explain more in this episode, as well as providing 6 ways to invite more inspiration into your life!</p>\n<p>James explains that when the motivation you receive is external, it is short-lived.</p>\n<p>For this reason, he helps the clients and students he coaches get inspired, rather than motivated.</p>\n<p>Being motivated won\u2019t necessarily get you to your goals, but it does allow for an opportunity to open the space for inspiration.</p>\n<p>Inspiration is intrinsic, or internal, and is defined as \u201cthe process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something.\u201d</p>\n<p>James looks for ways to be inspired in his business. Rather than taking \u201cmassive action\u201d, take \u201cinspired action\u201d where you create from the inside out. This is a natural tendency that feels effortless.</p>\n<p>James shares how he was inspired to get his own office in Laguna Beach after seeing his friend\u2019s office space in Portland, Maine.</p>\n<p>Phoebe was working at an uninspired job in Beijing when she noticed a lot of her friends were single. This inspired her to start hosting singles events to bring people together, and the venture eventually replaced the income from her full-time job.</p>\n<p><strong>6 Ways To Invite More Inspiration Into Your Life</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) Set intentions for what you want, and ask the right questions</strong></p>\n<p>When James\u2019 coaching clients are stuck and not knowing what to do next, he always has them ask themselves, \u201cWhat do I want?\u201d Even though you might yet know the specific details on how it might show up, just being clear ask asking these questions will help inspire you. James used this process himself when planning a launch, knowing he wanted a new way to promote his offer, and the answer came to him after speaking with a friend.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Create space to do things that have zero resistance</strong></p>\n<p>To get more inspiration, do the little things that you enjoy doing, that have no resistance. This can be as simple as going for a walk, calling up a friend or seeing a movie. James has a go-to list of 5-6 activities that he can go to when feeling burnt out and not in flow.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>3) Meditate</strong></p>\n<p>James and Phoebe will be dedicating a future episode to this topic, as it is so important. There is scientific proof of the positive effects meditating has on happiness, productivity, teamwork and more. Successful people like Jeff Walker and Arianna Huffington are known to meditate, and Tony Robins has a great YouTube video on his \u201cHour of Power\u201d (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p>\n<p><strong>4) Attend live events to hear inspirational speakers and influencers</strong></p>\n<p>Phoebe attends meet up events in her local area to meet influential leaders, and James credits his attending of live events as a major reason for his success. Hearing successful people who are in the flow state share their experiences about life can be very inspiring. Doing this will force you to rewire the way you think, behave, act and feel.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Read and listen to inspirational content</strong></p>\n<p>Resources such as books and podcasts can create a space that will allow you to be intentional in your life, and help you get in the right mindset to succeed. When you see or hear the passion someone has, it can be inspiring. Phoebe also listens to audio books, which be done while sitting down in one place.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Surround yourself with people that can inspire you</strong></p>\n<p>James is in a mastermind group that consists of only 7-figure business owners, and he says just being in the same room as everyone else is inspiring.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to be present, conscious and aware of whom you\u2019re surrounding yourself with. If a mastermind or group you\u2019re a part of isn\u2019t serving and inspiring you, you should get out of it, as you can\u2019t be an inspiring person when you\u2019re not inspired yourself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>\n<p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3bvYhm7qcg\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Robbin's \"Hour of Power\"\u00a0</a></p>", "duration": "32:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_012_How_To_Get_Motivated__mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1456824600, "title": "Episode 011: Your Relationship With Money", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode, James and Phoebe explore a sometimes awkward and uncomfortable topic: relationships with money. They talk about their own experiences, as well as sharing a simple exercise on how you can improve your own relationship with money!</p>\n<p>Everyone has a relationship with money. There are people that are really good at saving money, as well as others who are good at making money. James feels that successful entrepreneurs fall into the second category.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your relationship with money is indicated by your actions, and your habits, such as how you feel when you spend your money.</p>\n<p>We all have \u201cstories\u201d about money, which is where your relationship with money originates from. In most cases, our stories come from a young age as a result of the influence of our parents or environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>James grew up with a scarcity story related to money, and he recalls his parents always turning lights off and closing doors to conserve heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf money comes easy to you, it\u2019s ok if a little bit slips through your fingers. If it\u2019s really hard to get, you hold onto it with a death grip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phoebe recalls her dad leaving printed credit card statements on her bed, with the unknown charges highlighted.

James feels strongly that raising the price of his latest product would have resulted in higher revenue numbers of his launch, even if the total number of customers were lower.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour product still needs to over deliver, and be at a premium level\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>2) The transformation is in the transaction</strong></p>\n<p>James offers a lot of free content through his YouTube channel and blog. However, he says that almost all of the testimonials, results, feedback an life changing stories have come from paying customers, not people that accessed the free content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt came from the people that put the skin in the game\u201d</p>\n<p>A lot of entrepreneurs want to help people, and think that the only way to do this is to not charge for their products and services. However, commitment is created when money is exchanged, and there is a direct correlation between the size of the transformation and the size of the transaction (higher fee, more results).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one values free; they just don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>3) Making the assumption that they can\u2019t afford it</strong></p>\n<p>This is usually the #1 reason entrepreneurs hesitate at raising their prices. By making assumptions like this, you\u2019re forcing people to play small and not letting the prospects decide for themselves.</p>\n<p>James recommends business owners not be afraid of people saying \u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s all about the meaning you give to the word.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>4) Pricing is marketing and branding</strong></p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs usually look at what competitors are charging and charge a little less, or a little more.</p>\n<p>Do you want to be known as being the cheapest? James and Phoebe discuss why being the \u201cWalmart type business\u201d might not be the best thing for you.</p>\n<p><strong>5) The \u201cNo\u201d from a cheap sale is worse than the \u201cNo\u2019\u201d from a \u201cI don\u2019t have the money\u201d sale</strong></p>\n<p>Having a higher price gives the perception that you\u2019re worth it, and other customers are paying that much for your services.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Higher prices attract higher quality people</strong></p>\n<p>These are the people that are actually showing up and putting the work in to get the good results. This lets you, as a coach, teacher or facilitator, be more effective.</p>\n<p>A higher quality customer already has a busy life, and the person already takes responsibility, which is why things are working for him or her.</p>\n<p><strong>Exercise to work on raising your prices: </strong></p>\n<p>1) Identify your offer and price point</p>\n<p>2) Assess how you feel about your current price and promise that you offer clients right now.</p>\n<p>3) Determine how it would feel to change the price, to both a lower and higher level. Once you find the \u201csweet spot\u201d, push the limits and go higher than this number.</p>\n<p>4) Once your new price is set, be very present to the reaction of the prospect. If it\u2019s a quick \u201cYes\u201d, you prices aren\u2019t high enough and have been set to low.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "37:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_010_How_to_Raise_Your_Prices__mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1455615000, "title": "Episode 009: Secrets from a Multiple 6-Figure Product Launch", "author": "", "summary": "<p>This episode includes all the wins, losses, breakthroughs and breakdowns of the latest product launch by James. Listen in on what he and his team learned, and how they can take that information to apply it to their next one!</p> <p>James shares that the best thing you can do after a launch or promotion is to take the time to assess the numbers and see what worked (and what didn\u2019t). This is where you\u2019ll find the space to grow and prepare for your next launch, and his team calls it \u201cunpacking.\u201d Phoebe adds that this should be done immediately after the launch is complete, and that the results should be shared with everyone on the team.</p> <p>They consider this the best launch they\u2019ve ever done. It didn\u2019t have the biggest financial result (with $333,000 in total revenue generated), but they did hit their lowest goal and streamlined their processes, learning many lessons.</p> <p>James quotes Brene Brown, when she talks about entrepreneurs being \u201cin the arena\u201d and being \u201cbeat up and bloodied.\u201d He says:</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only way you really experience or created knowledge, wisdom and discover those lessons\u201d</p> <p>Although the launch wasn\u2019t effortless, it was painless and fun, with his team really stepping up. He wasn\u2019t the bottleneck, as not everything had to go through him to get done.</p> <p>Phoebe wanted two things from the launch. First, she wanted it to be as stress-free as possible, and she also wanted to develop her leadership skills. She says she achieved both personal objectives in this launch.</p> <p>\u201cIt was such as positive, exciting experience the whole way through\u201d</p> <p>Facebook ads were used very strategically, and they say it was the most dynamic use of this marketing tool that they have ever experienced. It created about 20,100 new subscribers into the launch and onto James\u2019 email list in only 2 to 3 weeks of promotion.</p> <p>James talks about Dan Ariely\u2019s book \u201cPredictably Irrational\u201d (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d), and the concept of price relativity. He compares this idea to their launch and \u201cgoal relativity.\u201d For some of James\u2019 coaching clients, a $100,000 launch would result in a total breakdown, whereas for others, it would change their lives.</p> <p>James shares the launch\u2019s \u201cEarning Per Lead\u201d (EPL) calculation, which determines how much each subscriber was worth. This number is what is really crucial, as opposed to total revenue, as you can always scale and get more people in your next launch.</p> <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p> <p><strong>1)</strong> James feels that the offer for the product they were selling needed some work.</p> <p>\u201cThe offer, at the core level, is what the promise is and how much it\u2019s going to cost to fulfil that promise. What is the outcome, or what are you clients really paying for?</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> The price was too low (an upcoming episode will be focused on the topic of raising prices). The product was actually created two years ago, and based on pricing at the time, was listed at $297. With the amount of content, value and support included, this number could have been higher and the product would have still sold.</p> <p><strong>Wins:</strong></p> <p><strong>1)</strong> Responsibilities were clear for the core group of four team members, and the team was easily accessible by person (or Skype) to support the others.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Communication was key and led to the stress-free launch. Along with regular meetings and the use of visual aids (calendar), everyone knew who was working on what and the status of the task. James used the methods of Jeff Sutherland\u2019s, \u201cScrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\u201d (SEE \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> The process templates available to the team, as well as the software used, simplified the process and resulting in more upsells and a success with affiliates.</p> <p>The team kept info in one place, on a \u201cmagic page\u201d, with resources that will make the next launch turnkey. They effectively used Sweet Process that Michael Hyatt recommends, as well as The New Kajabi (SEE \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d). On The New Kajabi, James says that for the first time, he got to experience everything working together (course hosting, upsells, checkout pages, sales pages and an affiliate center).</p> <p>The participation of over 50 affiliates resulted in thousands of clicks, and their upsell conversion rates were very good, at 20 to 26% for existing courses that they already offer).</p> <p>A backend offer of a $1,000 one-day live event was added and sold out immediately to 10 customers.</p> <p>James concludes this episode with the big lessons he took from the latest launch. Online entrepreneurs need to get really good with their offer, as well as being open and willing to increase their prices. Knowing the true value of your offer is key, as well as operating effectively as a team and letting go to trust others more.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Edition/dp/0061353248\" target=\"_blank\">\"Predictably Irrational\" by Dan Ariely</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453912497&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+doing+twice+the+work+in+half+the+time\" target=\"_blank\">\"Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\" by Jeff Sutherland</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sweetprocess.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.SweetProcess.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://the.new.kajabi.com\" target=\"_blank\">The.New.Kajabi.com\u00a0</a></p>", "duration": "44:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_009_The_Launch_Aftermath_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1455010200, "title": "Episode 008: What to do When You Compare Yourself to Others", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Comparing yourself to others is unavoidable. James and Phoebe give four practical steps on how to compare yourself to others, but in a more powerful way.</p> <p>James starts the episode by providing two quotes on the act of comparing ourselves to other people, the first by Theodore Roosevelt and the second from James himself.</p> <p>\u201cComparison is the thief of joy\u201d</p> <p>\u201cContrast is the seed of desire; desire is the foundation for results\u201d</p> <p><strong>Four steps you can take to compare yourself to others, and to feel more empowered<br /></strong><br /> <strong>Step 1: Acknowledge it<br /></strong><br /> By acknowledging it when it is happening, comparing yourself to others won\u2019t persist anymore.</p> <p>The action of comparing yourself to others isn\u2019t necessarily good or bad, as it depends on the meaning that we put on it when we focus on the other person. By have a negative reaction to it, we\u2019re really saying is \u201cI can\u2019t have (what that other person has).\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery time you feel negative, it is because you are experiencing something negative in your life\u201d</p> <p><strong>Step 2: Determine the context and perspective<br /></strong><br /> According to James, this step is necessary because we have so much \u201cstuff\u201d in our heads.</p> <p>When people put their best foot forward on social media, we\u2019re not seeing their \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>Some pieces of context to consider are time, goals and personality types of the person you are comparing yourself to.</p> <p>The person may have been in business for many more years that you have. It\u2019s important to look at the person and try to figure where they were at at the same point you are at now.</p> <p>When you\u2019re struggling and doing comparisons, look at the other person(s) goals. Consider that someone else may just be on a different path than you, and you don\u2019t want the same things in business and life.</p> <p>As well, personality types should be considered when comparing yourself to others. Myers Briggs defines 16 basic personality types, and there are free tests online to help you determine yours (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p>When you identify your personality type, you identify your strengths. James considers himself an introvert, and his strengths are details, systems, thinking and intuition. Someone like Gary Vaynerchuk is an extrovert, with a different set of strengths, which makes it difficult to accurately compare himself to.</p> <p>Phoebe reminds listeners to be confident in their strengths, and who they are.\u201d If you try to be somebody you\u2019re not, it\u2019s never going to come out in an authentic way.</p> <p><strong>Step 3: Identify your goals<br /></strong><br /> When you see someone that has something that you want, or don\u2019t currently have, you can add some of his or her goals to your list. This can either inspire, or upset you. Either way, you want it and if you do experience the negative emotion, it\u2019s important to stop and consider why this is happening.</p> <p>You should work towards your goals, and place them on your vision board or on your \u201cto-do list.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Step 4: Have gratitude<br /></strong><br /> Gratitude is the vibration, or emotion, that is the most attractive. It will bring you what you want, the most.</p> <p>\u201c(Being grateful) is like opening your arms for more\u201d (James)</p> <p>Make a list of what you are proud of and grateful for, as well as the things that you\u2019ve accomplished to date. Phoebe calls this her \u201caccomplishment inventory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive a blessing to the person you\u2019ve just compared yourself to. It\u2019s only through your comparison to them that a desire was born within you.\u201d (James)</p> <p>James concludes the episode by observing that when we see other people\u2019s success, this is proof that we are on the right path to achieving our goals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.MyersBriggs.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.MyersBriggs.org</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test\" target=\"_blank\">Free Personality Test</a></p>", "duration": "43:07", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_008_How_to_Compare_Yourself_to_Others__mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1454405400, "title": "Episode 007: 5 Steps To Manifest Your Goals In Business", "author": "", "summary": "<p>We are all spiritual beings, but we live in a mechanical world with laws that need to be taken into consideration. In this episode, James and Phoebe share practical steps that can be taken today to manifest your goals in business!</p>\n<p>In October 2014, Phoebe had her first product launch, and made about $3,300 in sales. For her second launch, her original goal was just to exceed this number, but her project management encouraged her to reach hire. She set $10,000 as her target, and was able to manifest a total of $10,250 in sales from the launch.</p>\n<p>James has multiple examples of manifesting results in his life and businesses. He recalls one instance when he was told in a dream of a particular amount of money he was going to make the next day, and it happened.</p>\n<p><strong>Step #1: Clearly define your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Your goals should be both monetary, and time-driven. Phoebe explains that the \u201cwhen date\u201d makes it more concrete and defined.</p>\n<p>James has a technique whereby he creates three goals: \u201cMiddle-of-the-Road\u201d, \u201cWimpy\u201d and \u201cHairy Scary\u201d (or \u201cstretch\u201d goal, which you always want to have).</p>\n<p>He reminds listeners that with goals, you get what you expect.</p>\n<p>When you remove the just the money, more magic is possible. He recommends that you break down the goal, into more than just money (it could be # of units that need to be sold, how many leads it will take to generate the required number of customers, etc.). This will make it more real and tangible. Phoebe calls this taking \u201cone small bite\u201d at a time.</p>\n<p>They recommend putting your goals everywhere they can be seen. Phoebe used \u201c10K\u201d as her phone background and set reminders of her goal. As well, she would write it out 2-3 times a day.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like having a relationship with the number; you get to know it. It inspires, excites and reminds you.\u201d (James)</p>\n<p>You can also take the goal and create affirmations around it. This should be something that makes you feel good and resonates with you. Phoebe\u2019s was \u201cI am a ten thousand dollar launcher\u201d and \u201cmy live events sell out in minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>When you say it, it should spark something inside of you. James says you can use \u201cI always accomplish my goals\u201d, or one of his personal phrases is \u201cI am a powerful manifestor.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Know what emotion this money or experience is going to bring you</strong></p>\n<p>James states that when you realize that you can create that feeling right now, you get access to so much more power and magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Feel those emotions \u2013 now</strong></p>\n<p>This can be compared to a radio dial. You just identify the \u201cstation\u201d that you want to be at (joy, confidence, love, etc.). In order to access it, you need to tune in, now.</p>\n<p>Both James and Phoebe actively practice visualization, using all of their senses, to imagine how it will feel when they achieve their goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Get into action</strong></p>\n<p>Change happens when we take inspired action. If you\u2019re stuck, ask the right questions and the answers will come. There are signs everywhere, and James says that the universe is there to guide you every step of the way. The book, The Alchemist, is a great example of this concept (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p>\n<p>Phoebe mentions that you need to celebrate the small victories during your journey, and not just wait until the end. To do this, you have to be tracking your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Let go and trust<br /></strong><br />You\u2019ve got to have faith that you\u2019ll achieve your goals. If you waver, you\u2019re going to struggle. Manifesting is about the power of universal law. You\u2019ve got to trust the process, even if you don\u2019t know exactly how it will happen for you.</p>\n<p>James concludes with:</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is done.

James quotes Brian Tracy:</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery minute you spend in planning saves 10 minutes in execution\u201d</p>\n<p>Phoebe\u2019s former basketball coach has a saying:</p>\n<p>\u201cProper planning prevents p*ss poor performance\u201d</p>\n<p>The bigger your team gets, the more essential proper planning becomes. For James, planning was the opportunity to enrol everybody else in the goals and intentions for the launch.</p>\n<p><strong>Step #1: Set the intentions for the first meeting</strong></p>\n<p>Identify the strategy beforehand, so everybody knows what their roles will be. This way, they can be responsible, held accountable and have clarity. This will get them onboard with the \u201cbig picture.\u201d To Phoebe, the intention was the most important thing as it showed her that everybody was heading in the same direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Step #2: Ask everyone on the team what they want to get out of the launch</strong></p>\n<p>Not everybody is motivated by money; it\u2019s a job, but sometimes people want prestige or acknowledgment. By involving the entire team in the planning process, James gives people the opportunity to choose for themselves what type of outcome or benefit they will get for themselves. He finds that team members want to grow, or be a better person by the end of the launch. For Phoebe, she wanted to be a confident leader who is delegating effectively, as well as having it be a stress-free process. James himself wanted to be a more effective leader.</p>\n<p><strong>Step #3: Determine what is the intention, or commitment, to the audience</strong></p>\n<p>James asked everybody in the launch committee this question, individually, and blended together the results to come up with the following:</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are committed to changing lives by inspiring entrepreneurs to what\u2019s possible through easy and effective strategies\u201d</p>\n<p>Phoebe adds that when you come up with something together, it\u2019s so much more powerful. Everyone feels like a bigger part of things.</p>\n<p><strong>Step #4: Set your goals</strong></p>\n<p>James shares his goals with the entire team, and believes it is important that they know \u201cthe game you\u2019re playing.\u201d In order to perform better, your people have to be informed. He sets three goals: \u201cMiddle-Of-The Road\u201d, \u201cHairy-Scary\u201d and \u201cWimpy-Wimpy.\u201d This is meant to stretch you, without making you feel like a failure if you don\u2019t hit the goal.</p>\n<p>He comes at the goal from a place of confidence, knowing he\u2019s done it before.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you go into something with zero confidence \u2013 good luck\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Step #5: Share and create the launch plan</strong></p>\n<p>Show the team what the entire process is going to look like when it\u2019s actually in the launch period. James\u2019 team intentionally left holes so that the entire team could come together to fill in the gaps. He considers this step as the \u201cmeat\u201d of your plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Step #6: Identify the roles and responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone has different talents but look at it from a project standpoint, rather than a skills standpoint. The meeting determined the responsibilities for every task of the launch: the videos series, emails, Facebook ads, etc. James\u2019 responsibility was affiliates, while Phoebe was assigned the marketing funnel.</p>\n<p>They share with listeners the concept of the RACI chart (responsible, accountable, consult & inform).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 7: Ask the team what it is going to take to achieve the goals</strong></p>\n<p>This could be getting enough people on the webinars, or watching the video series. It could be related to the organization; having more structure as a team.</p>\n<p>James creates a follow up question, \u201cwhat is that going to look like?\u201d They created two types of calendars, one visual and one in list form, for example.</p>\n<p>Daily \u201cscrums\u201d, or short meetings virtually, was part of the team\u2019s launch (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d for book referenced in episode). They note that the scrums were only done during the launch period, when everyone was focused on the exact same thing.</p>\n<p>James concludes the show with:</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to make an impact on the world, and grow as an entrepreneur, you can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>James and Phoebe will be recording a follow-up to this podcast, with specific results from the launch that was discussed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>\n<p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453912497&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+doing+twice+the+work+in+half+the+timehttp://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453912497&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+doing+twice+the+work+in+half+the+time\" target=\"_blank\">\"Scrum: Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\" by Jeff Sutherland</a></p>", "duration": "42:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_006_The_7_Steps_To_A_Perfect_Product_Launch_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1453800600, "title": "Episode 005: The Law of Attraction and Your Business", "author": "", "summary": "<p>James and Phoebe discuss the Law of Attraction in this episode, and include helpful resources and simple steps on how to manifest things you desire into your life and business!</p>\n<p>James recommends two great books that look at The Law of Attraction, \u201cE-Squared: 9 Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality\u201d by Pam Grout and \u201cThe Vortex\u201d by Abraham Hicks (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p>\n<p>James defines The Law of Attraction in the following ways:</p>\n<p>1) Like attracts like</p>\n<p>2) You bring close to you what you focus your attention on (not necessarily<br />what you focus on, but what you make it mean)</p>\n<p>2) Thoughts create things</p>\n<p>Manifesting is simply physical evidence of an existing vibration that you have. Everything is the vibrating energy, and that vibration is indicated by our emotions.</p>\n<p>James talks about a great video on YouTube called \u201cHappiness Is The New Productivity\u201d, by the CEO of MindValley (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d). It shows how business isn\u2019t about strategy; it\u2019s about mindset first. The concept of a \u201cflow state\u201d is important, and you need to be happy in the now, but have a grand vision for the future.</p>\n<p>James shares his story about starting a successful business with a partner, and having the partner end the relationship. It put James in a state of \u201cfree fall\u201d, but the events opened up the space for him to create his next steps. He now considers it a chapter of his life that he learned so much from.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would never trade that experience in a million years\u201d</p>\n<p>It also made him realize that he didn\u2019t want to be building a business for someone else. He wanted to build his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour success as an entrepreneur is contingent on your ability to reframe the problems, or the unwanted, that occur in your life or your business\u201d</p>\n<p>Phoebe always looks for the lessons in the things that happen in her life.</p>\n<p>James adds that what is happening right now, is a direct result of what you\u2019ve been attracting in the past.</p>\n<p>When you aren\u2019t attracting the right things in your life, there is always tomorrow and you can start again. You need to take responsibility for everything you attract into your life, which can be hard at first but you become more mindful of it as you practice awareness.</p>\n<p>A criticism of The Law of Attraction is that you can\u2019t just close your eyes, visualize and have something appear. James says that you need to hustle, or take action, but you can\u2019t do this from a place of fear. Dial up to that positive vibration first, then take inspired action from there.</p>\n<p>One example of taking inspired action is this podcast. James had been thinking of starting one and just reached out to Phoebe to begin the process.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has come together so quickly and so easily\u201d</p>\n<p>Phoebe adds her example of wanting to move to California. After living in Germany for 7 years, with intention, the move was easy and happened quickly.</p>\n<p>James manifested his new office when visiting a friend in Maine. After seeing his friend\u2019s office, he looked online and found his current office right away.</p>\n<p><strong>3 Simple Steps On How to Manifest Magic Into Your Business<br /></strong><br />1) Identify what you want</p>\n<p>2) Get to the core feeling; why is it important to you?</p>\n<p>3) Feel the emotion (it\u2019s all about your decision to feel a certain way)</p>\n<p>When people get discouraged, they have to remember to start with the small things. James attracted foreign money into his life, and advises to \u201cbuild the muscle\u201d when it comes to The Law of Attraction. He also reminds listeners that beating yourself up is a negative emotion, and a vicious cycle that gets you nowhere.</p>\n<p>Feeling gratitude is the way to manifesting and attracting. James and Phoebe\u2019s homework to listeners is to write a list of 20 things every morning that you are grateful for. Do this, until you feel it, and notice the things that will come into your life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>\n<p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:<br /></strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/E-Squared-Do-It-Yourself-Experiments-Thoughts-Reality/dp/1401938906\" target=\"_blank\">E-Squared: 9 Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality\u201d by Pam Grout</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Vortex-Attraction-Cooperative-Relationships/dp/1401918824\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Vortex\u201d by Abraham Hicks</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8ZFU4FoNvY\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cHappiness Is The New Productivity\u201d YouTube video</a></p>", "duration": "01:06:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_005_The_Law_of_Attraction_and_Your_Business__mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1452629040, "title": "Episode 004: 7 Qualities of Confident Experts", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode of the podcast, James and Phoebe discuss the 7 tips for overcoming self-doubt and owning it, so you can become the authority in your industry!</p> <p>James feels that everyone goes through this process at some people; some people just don\u2019t vocalize it.

He says you can\u2019t have a story without a hero, and a conflict.</p> <p><strong>Tip #3: Declare it - no one will do this for you</strong><br /> Growing up, it\u2019s been engrained in us that someone else has to declare you as an authority (such as in school).</p> <p><strong>Tip #4: Make your goals and mission bigger than yourself</strong><br /> Determine what your mission is, and help other people.</p> <p><strong>Tip #5: Replicate your system to give others results, and then highlight them</strong><br /> You\u2019re not an authority until you can get someone else to do what you can do. James feels that more people should be offering their services to others in exchange for them being a case study, as you measure their results along the way.</p> <p><strong>Tip #6: Teach and share freely on what you already know</strong></p> <p>Being an authority is a perception, and part of a brand. Don\u2019t \u201choard\u201d your expertise.</p> <p>James says, \u201cthe more I give away for free, the more people will buy from me.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tip #7: You don\u2019t have to be the best to be the authority</strong><br /> It\u2019s a misconception that being an authority means that you are better than everyone else. Be yourself, because you\u2019ll know yourself if you\u2019re not being authentic. It all starts with how you see yourself first.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>", "duration": "42:46", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_004_Who_Are_You_To_Be_The_Expert_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1452628558, "title": "Episode 003: 7 Tips for EFFORTLESS Outsourcing", "author": "", "summary": "<p>James has built his business on outsourcing. In this episode, he and Phoebe share the 7 mistakes that entrepreneurs commonly make when outsourcing, and what you should do to maximize your results!<br /> Both he and Phoebe considering outsourcing to be \u201cabsolutely essential.\u201d They advise other entrepreneurs to stop trying to do everything themselves.</p> <p><strong>Tip #1: Assume that no one will ever do it as good as you</strong></p> <p>Ask yourself \u2013 is this a thousand dollar an hour activity, or a $10 dollar an hour activity?</p> <p>Not only do the small tasks time up time, but Phoebe also adds that they take up mental space.</p> <p>James believes that your energy is even more valuable than your time.</p> <p><strong>Tip #2: Give up if you\u2019ve had, or know someone that\u2019s had, a bad experience with outsourcing</strong></p> <p>Any business that is successful doesn\u2019t have just one person doing everything. James gives the example of a restaurant, with its servers, bus boys, kitchen staff and management.</p> <p>Don\u2019t make the assumption that outsourcing doesn\u2019t work, or that all the \u201cgood people\u201d are already taken.</p> <p><strong>Tip #3: Hire fast!</strong></p> <p>Hire slow and fire fast is the mantra that you should use.</p> <p>James and Phoebe recommend OnlineJobs.ph (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d) for virtual assistances in the Philippines (general task management, data entry, etc.)</p> <p>Recommended Steps When Hiring:</p> <p>- Improve the screening process. Be clear about what you\u2019re looking for in the job post, and give a \u201ccall to action\u201d (a specific instruction) to ensure that the applicants are paying attention to detail and can follow directions.</p> <p>- Set up a Skype call and ask specific questions.</p> <p>- Don\u2019t just hire them; use a 7-day probationary period.</p> <p>- Interview at least three people before selecting.</p> <p><strong>Tip #4: Get one person to do it all</strong></p> <p>Find someone that has strength, or a \u201csweet spot\u201d and put them in that specific area. Have different people do activities such as data entry, editing, content creation, SEO and graphic design). Have each person focus, that way they\u2019ll be really good at something as opposed to average at everything.</p> <p><strong>Tip #5: Don\u2019t bother training them and don\u2019t use processes</strong></p> <p>You MUST provide training. Blame the process, not the employee.</p> <p>James recommends people read \u201cScrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\u201d by Jeff Sutherland (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d)</p> <p>You need to create an environment that sets people up for success.</p> <p>James recommends using SweetProcess (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d)</p> <p>Phoebe films videos for her virtual assistant, to show her the exact process she uses for specific tasks. Using process maps and screenshots can be helpful.</p> <p><strong>Tip #6: Don\u2019t trust them</strong></p> <p>Show the people that you hire that you trust them. Remember, \u201cInnocent until proven guilty.\u201d James advises that employers don\u2019t go into an arrangement with scepticism, as that just doesn\u2019t help.</p> <p><strong>Tip #7: Don\u2019t pay them</strong></p> <p>Pay weekly, and have them send you a reminder. Remitly is a great resource for paying assistants in the Philippines. Toggl and Time Doctor will help them measure and keep track of their own time (see \u201cINTERVIEW LINKS\u201d).</p> <p>For project work, if using Upwork, you can set up a contract with milestones. There is also an option to pay a bonus to the person if the job is completed ahead of schedule.</p> <p><strong>RECAP (What You Should Actually Do):</strong></p> <p>Know that other people can do it as well as you can.</p> <p>Even if you\u2019ve had a bad outsourcing experience, or know someone that has, give it another go.</p> <p>Take your time when hiring and have a process set up to choose the right person.</p> <p>Make sure you have a few people that can do a specific task each, as opposed to getting one person to do it all.</p> <p>Train your people, and provide good processes.</p> <p>Trust them</p> <p>Pay your people!</p> <p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p> <p><strong>INTERVIEW LINKS:</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X\" target=\"_blank\">\"Scrum: Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\" by Jeff Sutherland</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.SweetProcess.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sweet Process</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.Remitly.com\" target=\"_blank\">Remitly</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.Toggl.com\" target=\"_blank\">Toggl</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.TimeDoctor.com\" target=\"_blank\">Time Doctor</a></strong></p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "37:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_003_7_Tips_For_Failing_Miserably_At_Outsourcing_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1452627446, "title": "Episode 002: What Had To Shift to Hit $1 Million", "author": "", "summary": "<p>In this episode, James shares with Phoebe and listeners how he shifted his mindset to generate over $1 million in annual sales! The massive breakthroughs he discusses include creating the capacity to think bigger, learning to redefine your relationship with criticism, and the importance of working smarter - not harder, or longer!</p>\n<p>2014 was the first year that James generated 7-figures in total annual sales. He had a goal to do this by the age of 30, and achieved the goal 4 days after this birthday.</p>\n<p>He started his business 6 years prior, and his revenue was doubling every year up until that point (starting at about $20,000 per year).</p>\n<p>In September 2013, he achieved $50,000 that month, for the first time, and says he literally felt \u201cunstoppable\u201d. His goal for 2015 is $2.5 million.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s baby steps; you\u2019ve got to get here before you can get there. What got you here, won\u2019t get you there.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Three Massive Breakthroughs To Get To The Next Level</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) Creating The Capacity To Think Bigger<br /></strong><br />It\u2019s not just about thinking bigger; it\u2019s about creating the space to think bigger.</p>\n<p>James gives the analogy of a potted plant. The very thing that helped it grow, the pot that holds the soil, will eventually be the thing that limit\u2019s its growth. With this analogy, the pot is your brain, and way of thinking. If you want the \u201ctree\u201d to grow, it\u2019s not about watering it more or putting it in the sun more. It\u2019s about getting a big pot, giving it the room to expand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have fear of complacency. I\u2019ve always had that\u201d</p>\n<p>He recommends listeners read the book \u201cThe Magic of Thinking Big\u201d by David Schwartz.</p>\n<p>James explains that people have limiting beliefs, and often don\u2019t know that they are there.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe same thing that got you to where you are could be the very thing that\u2019s limiting you from that next step.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>2) Redefining Your Relationship With Criticism</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to spend time with friends that support you, and get rid of those that don\u2019t support you.</p>\n<p>Criticism from random strangers can sting, but James realized if he wanted to think bigger and expand, he couldn\u2019t allow the fear of criticism and judgment from others to stop him.</p>\n<p>Identifying the fear is the first step to stopping it. Realize that if you\u2019re putting yourself out there, it\u2019s inevitable that people will try to put you down. However, it\u2019s also a great signal that you\u2019re on the right track.</p>\n<p>Anybody that criticizes others, it\u2019s about their own \u201cstuff\u201d that they have going on. People that are happy, successful and fulfilled aren\u2019t criticizing others and wasting their time.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a skill to be able to tell the difference between hate and constructive feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>3) To Increase Revenue, It\u2019s Not About Working Harder, Longer or Faster</strong></p>\n<p>James recommends entrepreneurs outsource, to the right people. To do so, stop focusing on the $10 -$100 per hour tasks and focus on the $1,000 - $10,000 per hour ones. In his case, he switched his focus to strategy, being on camera, being the brand and anything to do with selling.</p>\n<p>An exercise that he challenges listeners to do is to write down your goals (for example, revenue), then ask yourself what number it would be for your friends and family, to think you\u2019re \u201cabsolutely crazy.\u201d This exercise will help expand your limits and help identify your own limiting beliefs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>", "duration": "39:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode002_mixdown.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 1074394632, "seriesTitle": "The Mind Your Business Podcast", "pubDate": 1452626021, "title": "Episode 001: Why I Started This Podcast", "author": "", "summary": "<p>James has wanted to start a podcast for years now, but didn\u2019t do it because he thought he needed to reach a certain level of success in his business first. He sees the podcast as a milestone in his journey.</p>\n<p>For the past 7 years, his business has primarily focused on teaching others about his one of his biggest passions, online video. This podcast won\u2019t be talking about that subject, which he reserves for YouTube.</p>\n<p>2014 was the first year that his business hit 7-figures, in the process tripling his revenue from 2013.</p>\n<p>James was beginning to question the way we glorify hard work. He wondered how trying to work harder than you did the previous day was sustainable, especially if you are a lifestyle entrepreneur working online.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis whole thing on hard work, I think people like hearing it. It justifies what they are already doing, which is working harder and working longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never done something before, like build a 6 or 7-figure business, how are you suppose to know how to do it? It takes stepping into a whole new way of being, thinking and behaving to get what you want.</p>\n<p>James shares that if you want to make a million dollars, you act like a millionaire that already has the mindset of what it takes.</p>\n<p>He says he is coming out of what he calls \u201cthe spiritual closet\u201d for the first time ever. He typically talks about \u201cleft brain stuff\u201d, such as what cameras to use when filming, how to do conversion rates and opt-ins, sales funnels, etc.</p>\n<p>James meditates daily and visualizes everything in his life and business. He is a strong believer of using The Law of Attraction to manifest things, and he uses his intuition for practically every decision he makes.</p>\n<p>Phoebe started studying and applying The Law of Attraction in the last year and she used visualization during her latest product launch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re on track to do the things that you\u2019re meant to do, it should be easy, it should be light and it should be effortless\u201d (James)</p>\n<p>He stresses that spirituality doesn\u2019t replace religion. It\u2019s about having understanding, and applying, what people consider \u201cuniversal laws.\u201d</p>\n<p>The first few years of his business were filled with frustration, anger and impatience.</p>\n<p>\u201cStress is the entrepreneur\u2019s word for fear\u201d</p>\n<p>Through his inner work, and by working with a healer, he achieved a feeling of confidence and trust, while learning to use his intuition. James shares his story about how he was able to attend a Tony Robbins event years ago using these principles, when he couldn\u2019t afford to buy the ticket.</p>\n<p>The goal of the podcast is to share the application of a blend of spirituality, or manifesting, with effective business principles and strategies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://snip.ly/j9s8l\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Your Question!</a></p>", "duration": "26:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/01/fe/11/01fe11c1-59b3-750a-3684-2eac233d216c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/mindyourbusiness/Episode_001_Why_I_Started_This_Podcast_EDITED.lite.mp3?dest-id=340829", "type": "episode", "tags": []}]}
