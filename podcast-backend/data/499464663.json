If you\u2019re a fan of The Walking Dead, or Evil Dead 2 or Day Of The Dead or Kill Bill or Django Unchained or any of the seven million movies and television shows this gentleman has worked on, Greg Nicotero is here today. Greg has gone from being one of the leading special effects make-up wizards in in Hollywood to one of the hottest directors in television.<br /> <br /> Also joining us, Kevin Fitzgerald, a man I can only describe as a real life Forrest Gump. Kevin Fitzgerald. Kevin is a very funny and talented comedian, based in Denver, who I\u2019ve known for, probably, twenty-five years. Kevin is also, a very brilliant veterinary surgeon, and is the star of Animal Planets\u2019 Emergency Vets. So, I was recently in Denver, and I was talking to Kevin, and I happened to ask how he got into being a veterinarian and he said, \u201cKeith Richard\u2019s made me do it.\u201d<br /> <br /> And I said, as you would have said, \u201cKeith Richards, Keith Richards?\u201d and he said, \u201cYeah.\u201d And what I learned was, from this guy I\u2019ve known forever, that starting in 1969, Kevin was a bodyguard for the Rolling Stones, among many other bands. Kevin has worked with the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, the list goes on and on and on and he\u2019s here today to tell us all about it.<br /> <br /> Me? I\u2019ve been busier than a one-armed traffic cop with a skin rash. We\u2019re currently in pre-production on season 2 of Stan Against Evil, which means we\u2019re breaking stories for the season and writing scripts, the special effects shop is already designing a new season\u2019s worth of demons and creatures, I\u2019m back at work on this little baby, and, as you may guess, that takes a little time, and I\u2019m still touring.

Pete is the head of programming and development at the Independent Film Channel, not only is the executive who shepherded my show Stan Against Evil through development and production, he is also is an old friend of mine, who I met first as a writer, and I thought, as we wrap up the year, who better to give you an executive's perspective on the TV business, but in the way regular people can understand and relate to.

The internet, which was supposed to unite us, has divided us further, and I am of the belief that the election of a election of someone like Donald trump is in part a direct result of an electorate too far ensconced in their own idealogical redoubts to communitate even the simplest disagreements constructively, and that must stop.<br /> <br /> Also, since the election, a lot of people, including myself, are full of fear, loathing and anxiety, and maybe that\u2019s something we can work on as well.<br /> <br /> To that end, we have the hilarious and excellent Eddie Pepitone. Eddie was for Bernie when I was for Hillary, and, in retrospect, I think Eddie supported Bernie for the right reasons, he believed in his message, and I voted for Hillary for the wrong ones. I mistakenly felt she had the best chance of beating Trump. Point, Pepitone.<br /> <br /> Also, from NBC\u2019s Meet The Press and his own podcast, Radio Free GOP, Mike Murphy is here.

My favorite time of year, my favorite month, my favorite holiday and my favorite episode of the podcast. This year is no exception. I can't summon the Great Pumpkin but I can squash any fears that this episode is anything less than awesome. <br /><br />Get it? Pumpkin and squash, because they're vaguely similar. Okay.<br /><br />Big Guns! Patton Oswalt is my guest. We're gonna talk the horror movies that made us who we are. Showing them to your kids. Make them one of us. One of us. <br /><br />Laurie Jacobsen is here. Laurie wrote the best book I have ever read about supernatural doings in the heart of Tinseltown, Hollywood Haunted. Find out who couldn't take the hint and stuck around after they died. <br /><br />And actor, writer and cinema collector extraordinaire, Bob Burns. You may not know Bob by name, but he has had a documentary and two books written about him. He is one of the most fascinating people I have ever known, and if you are a fan of all things Halloween, then you, like me, will soon be looking up to Bob as the mentor that I do. A truly extraordinary guy with an extraordinary story. Also joining us is filmmaker Frank Dietz, maker of said documentary, entitled Beast Wishes.<br /><br />Last, but not least, on October 16th in theaters and Video On Demand, the film Tales Of Halloween. A horror anthology featuring the top tier fright filmmakers at work today, I am joined in the cast of that movie by Greg Grunberg - he's in Star Wars - Cerina Vincent, James Duval, Lisa Marie, John Savage, John Landis, Joe Dante, Adrienne Barbeau, Pat Healey, Mick Garris. I will not tell you what happens to me in the movie but I will tell you what I learned on the set. If it's five o-'clock in the morning and you have got a bucket of fake blood that's been sitting out all night, when that stuff finally comes out of the pump, it's COLD. <br /><br />Tales Of Halloween, I am so happy to be in that movie and on your October podcast queue. <br /><br />There they are.
