Understand what you owe and where you owe it.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Revisit your budget</span>. Sit down and determine exactly where your money goes each month.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Review your retirement accounts</span>. Do you have any 401(k) accounts from a former employer that need to be rolled over into an IRA? If so, make sure the money transfers directly between accounts.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Check your insurance policies</span>. Review your current life insurance policy to make sure you have the coverage your family needs. If you have questions or need help, go to chrishogan360.com and click \u201cDream Team\u201d to connect with one of our insurance ELPs. These are people Hogan trusts.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Update beneficiaries</span>. Now is the time to make changes to the designated beneficiaries you\u2019ve named in your will and other legal documents, including your investment accounts. You can update these by filling out a form for 401(k)s, IRAs, life insurance policies, and other plans. Check with the providers of these accounts for the correct paperwork.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Look at income tax withholdings</span>. Each year, you want to know exactly where you stand on your income taxes. Don\u2019t let this to sneak up on you in March. Go to chrishogan360.com and click \u201cDream Team\u201d to get connected with one of our tax ELPs. They have the heart of a teacher and want you to avoid any hassles from the IRS.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Review your portfolio</span>. Set up an appointment with a financial professional to review your investment portfolio. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand\u2014from the fees you pay to the types of funds you\u2019re building\u2014ask questions. You are in charge of your financial future, so you\u2019re responsible for understanding your investments.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Here are three bonus actions:</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Do medical check-ups</span>. This is an area many people forget. Before the end of the year, take advantage of all yearly check-ups that you have paid for throughout the year through your insurance premiums. Do you need an eye exam, a physical, or other medical exams? If so, get an appointment and go before December 31. Also, be aware of your healthcare costs and expenses. Does your current policy meet your needs? Is there a way to get the same or better coverage at a lower cost?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Update wills and trusts</span>. A common misconception is that you only create and talk about a will one time. People are not aware that you can update your will as many times as you want, as long as the updates are properly witnessed and notarized according to your state law. Also, you may want to talk with an estate planning attorney to see if a trust makes sense for your situation.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Set new goals</span>. The new year brings new opportunities for everyone. Be clear on what you want to achieve financially, physically, spiritually, and as a family. The only way to be proactive is to put the goals in writing and take steps to reach them.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>16:11 \u2013 VIP ANNOUNCEMENTS</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget about Hogan\u2019s Christmas Bundle.

TAKE A DEEP BREATH. Activating relaxation is important.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>2. ACKNOWLEDGE HOW YOU FEEL. Identify the feeling you\u2019re dealing with.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>3. ACCEPT THE FEELING. Realize it is what it is. Don\u2019t deny or ignore it.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>4. QUESTION YOUR THOUGHTS. Ask yourself the following: A. Is this likely to happen? B. What can I do to relieve the anxiety? C. How can I prepare for what may happen?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>12:00 \u2013 VIP ANNOUNCEMENTS</p> <p>The third winner is announced in the Retire Inspired Podcast Giveaway.

USE POSITIVE SELF-TALK. Think of reassuring statements you can make to avoid anxiety.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>2. FOCUS ON THE NOW. So much anxiety is connected to what \u201ccould\u201d happen.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>3. FOCUS ON MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES. The worst thing you can do when you\u2019re anxious is obsess over the negative feeling. Remember your retirement dreams, know your R:IQ (see chrishogan360.com if you don\u2019t know your number), and pay attention to your budget (see <a href=\"http://www.everydollar.com\">EveryDollar.com</a>).</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>42:27 \u2013 RALLY CRY WRAP-UP</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>43:55 \u2013 CALL TO ACTION</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget to enter the Retire Inspired Podcast Giveaway!

BE A MONEY BOSS. Start each month with a budget, listing income and expenses.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>2. HAVE A DEBT REDUCTION PLAN. Use the debt snowball approach: List all your debts then attack them from smallest to largest.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>3. ESTABLISH AN EMERGENCY FUND. Be prepared for unexpected events (a car problem, home repair, hospital visit, etc.) by keeping an emergency fund on hand.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>4. TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR SPENDING. Understand the difference between a want and a need. Set limits on spending, even if it means sacrificing your wants.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>5. PLAN AHEAD. Look at the calendar and save money for upcoming expenses (holidays, travel, birthdays, etc.).</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>6. BOOST YOUR INCOME. Brainstorm ways you could earn extra money over the next three to six months (sell stuff you don\u2019t need, have a garage sale, offer to tutor, etc).</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>7. GET A HEAD START ON COLLEGE. If you have children, start saving for college as soon as possible. You want to help them get an education without student loans. But don\u2019t sacrifice your retirement fund in the process! Remember, kids can work their way through college.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>8. PLUG IN TO THE COMMUNITY. Volunteer for events in your area or help out at your church. Make a list of 10 friends and tell them about <a href=\"https://www.chrishogan360.com/riq/\">R:IQ</a> and <a href=\"http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu\">Financial Peace University</a> as financial discussions come up. When people change, their community does too!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>9. KNOW YOUR PLAN. Retirement is not an age; it\u2019s a financial number! Decide on your retirement dream, discover your R:IQ, and determine a plan to get to that retirement number.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>10. KEEP THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. Progress is taking one step forward, one day at a time. Where you are now is the new starting point, so forget the past and start moving ahead.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>26:25 \u2013 VIP ANNOUNCEMENTS</p> <p>The second winner in the Retire Inspired Podcast Giveaway is announced.
