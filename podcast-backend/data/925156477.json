In today\u2019s episode I chat with Sandy Waddell, a Broadway actress known for her cheese dots during the holiday season (similar to cheese straws). She gives me the inside scoop for her special recipe, including the best cheese to use and where to find it. I also get the chance to take some questions from you guys.
