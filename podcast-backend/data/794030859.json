He knew every plant, mushroom, animal, predator, prey in a several mile radius. He knew how to make weapons. He knew how to capture something, make it edible. I can barely order delivery. And as far as weapons, they say \u201cthe pen is mightier than the sword\u201d but I don\u2019t think a tweet is. My ancestor also knew how to adapt to new terrains, how to handle strangers who could be threats, how to learn who to trust and who not to trust. I wish I had his skills. Not only that. Archaeological evidence says his brain was bigger than mine. And bigger is better. To make things worse, another animal made the entire human race its slave. Wheat domesticated us. It forced us to stick around for the harvest, horde up for years when the harvest might be bad, go from a life of a diverse diet to basically all carbs all the time. And it turned us from hunters to farmers. But it\u2019s not all bad. And the news is actually very good. Probably the books I\u2019ve recommended most in the past five years was \u201cSapiens\u201d by Yuval Harari. And not only me: it\u2019s Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s top recommendation. And now Yuval has a new book, \u201cHomo Deus\u201d \u2013 i.e. where are humans heading? If Sapiens explored the last 70,000 years of human history, \u201cHomo Deus\u201d takes the trends into the future. What will happen next? The answers are fascinating. And I had even more questions. I couldn\u2019t believe I was finally talking to Yuval after reading \u201cSapiens\u201d so many times and recommending it on every list and giving the book to all of my friends. And then finally reading \u201cHomo Deus\u201c. What made humans the only animal to spread across the entire globe? What was special about us? How did we go hundreds of miles into empty water to find Australia for instance? I would never take that risk! And then survive and flourish in a completely new ecosystem, just like we did in North America. \u201cFiction,\u201d Yuval told me, and describes in his book. \u201cWe created elaborate fictions for ourselves: \u2018nations\u2019, \u2018corporations\u2019, \u2018religion\u2019, \u2018crusades\u2019, and perhaps the most successful fiction: \u2018money\u2019. So I could use a dollar and some stranger in China can use a dollar and we can trust each other enough to do a transaction.\u201d So what\u2019s next? \u201cHomo sapiens are going to evolve again.\u201d Yuval said, \u201cTechnology is taking us there and technology is evolving much faster than we are.\u201d I still can\u2019t believe I spoke to him. Five years ago I took his course on Coursera. I was thinking, \u201chow did this guy get so smart?\u201d And now I was talking to him. And, like I said, the news was not bad. Here\u2019s what I learned: 1. The economy needs you to invest in yourself \u201cThere\u2019s a change in the nature of the economy from a material based economy to a knowledge-based economy. The main assets in the past were material like gold minds or wheat fields,\u201d Yuval said. \u201cThese are the types of things you can conquer through violence.\u201d That\u2019s how we got California. The US invaded and absorbed their wealth. But you can\u2019t invade and absorb knowledge. China isn\u2019t going to take over Silicon Valley and absorb all the wealth. \u201cToday, the main asset is knowledge,\u201d he said. The only good investment you can make for your future is the investment you make in yourself today. Hone your idea muscle, build a network and a library of mentors, make a commitment to do one healthy thing a day. Because the health of your body impacts the health of your brain. I try to improve 1% a day. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s how I invest in myself. 2. Explore Internal realities vs. External realities Resources today are different. They\u2019re abstract. Yuval said, \u201cThe source of wealth in California today is knowledge, in the mind\u2019s of engineers and technicians and CEOs. And you just cannot conquer it by force.\u201d That\u2019s one of the reason\u2019s why Yuval says, \u201cYou see a decline in international violence.\u201d The other reason: weapons are too powerful. \u201cNuclear weapons have transformed war between superpowers,\u201d he said. War today is \u201ccollective suicide, which is why we don\u2019t have such wars since 1945.\u201d Terrorism is different. Their weapon is fear. Yuval calls it \u201cpsychological menace.\u201d But he\u2019s really concerned about them in our future. \u201cTerrorists function by capturing our imagination, turning our imagination against us, and causing us to overreact,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a way, a terrorist is like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so small and weak. It cannot move even a single teacup. So how does a fly destroy a china shop? The fly finds a bull, gets into the ear of the bull and starts buzzing. The bull becomes so enraged that it loses its temper and destroys the china shop. This is what happened in the middle east over the last 15 years,\u201d Yuval said. \u201cAl-Qaeda could never destroy Iraq by itself. It got into the ear of the United States and the United States went wild and destroyed the middle eastern china shop for Al-Qaeda. This is how terrorism functions. And if you want to fight terrorism you should start with your own imagination.\u201d For me, this means understanding that ideas are currency. Becoming an idea machine, writing ten ideas a day, so you get the new \u2018weapons\u2019 of Sapiens, is the key. 3. We\u2019re going from \u201chumanists\u201d to \u201cdata-ists\u201d In 500 years we might not be dealing with humans at all. Look at Amazon for example. They tell us what to buy. We don\u2019t ask our friends. We ask data. \u201cGiven the advances of bioengineering, brain-computer interfaces and so forth, I think it\u2019s very likely that within a century or two homo sapiens will disappear and be replaced by a completely different kind of being,\u201d Yuval said. He says bioengineering is just one possibility. Another is we start connecting brains and computers to create cyborgs. This isn\u2019t science fiction. It\u2019s already happening. I\u2019m sort of scared and sort of excited. We went from tribes to villages to cities to kingdoms to empires to \u201cisms\u201d to\u2026data that will unite us. The next step in our evolution. The final frontier.", "duration": "56:49", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-216-YuvalHarari-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1487696400, "title": "Ep. 215 - Steven Kotler & Jamie Wheal: How Flow Helps You Step Outside Yourself and \"Do The Impossible\"", "author": "", "summary": "Imagine going on a swing as high as you can. Then going higher. Then going so high you loop around. I get scared thinking about it. Sergey Brin, the founder of Google, did it the first time he tried. Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal were training people at Google how to get into the state of FLOW. Sergey volunteered. What is Flow? The state where your brain and body loses all sense of time and you retreat into this perfect area of creativity and productivity. A state where Steven and Jamie have spent years trying to hack and re-create at will. And this is what they\u2019ve done. I was talking to Steven Kotler, who\u2019s been on my podcast a few times and Jamie Wheal. They co-authored \u201cStealing Fire: How Silicon Valley, the Navy SEALs, and Maverick Scientists Are Revolutionizing the Way We Live and Work.\u201d It\u2019s sort of a sequel to \u201cThe Rise of Superman\u201d all about \u201cflow\u201d in action sports. Steven said. \u201cIt\u2019s the moments of total absorption where you get so focussed on the task at hand that everything else just disappears, action and awareness merge, your sense of self disappears, time passes very strangely and all aspects of performance, mental and physical, go through the roof.\u201d But when I read it I thought, \u201cWhere are the chess players?\u201d Where are the creatives? Programmers get into flow. Musicians, athletes, artists, all sorts of people get into flow. The question was \u201chow?\u201d I am selfish. I wanted to know for myself: HOW? So I read \u201cStealing Fire.\u201d It\u2019s about all the ways you can get into flow and other \u201coptimal states of consciousness.\u201d It teaches you how to step outside yourself, have a 500% increase in your performance, functionality, creativity and have satisfaction. I had to find out, what are the triggers to get into flow? They said \u201crisk.\u201d \u201cLife or death?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou need risk, but it\u2019s definitely not physical risk,\u201d Steven said. \u201cThe brain can\u2019t tell the difference between social fear and physical fear.\u201d Steven and Jamie figured this out when they went to Google to experiment on Sergey Brin\u2019s brain (Google\u2019s founder). They built a swing that loops 360 degrees around and covered him in EEG sensors. You\u2019d have to pump your legs and use all your strength to gain the physical and mental momentum to go in a full circle. \u201cMy ten year old daughter crushed it,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cShe did 35 loops in 60 seconds, which is nudging the world record.\u201d Only a few people actually made it all the way around. Sergey\u2019s one of them. It takes intense focus. You have to overcome your fear and stay in the moment. You have to use risk to your advantage. \u201cAnything that drives attention to the current moment drives flow,\u201d Steven said. It\u2019s not just swings. It\u2019s not just \u201csmart drugs\u201d or \u201cextreme sports\u201d. On the podcast, Steven and Jamie give a range of techniques and ideas for how to get into flow. I want in. I want in ALL of the time. They have a quiz on their website (flowgenomeproject.com) that tells you your \u201cflow profile.\u201d Over 50,000 people have taken it. On the first company I started I once disappeared into my office and programmed for about 24 hours straight. Completing a month\u2019s project in one day\u2019s time. We kept that client for life, even when we sold the company. Flow not only feels good, creates increased productivity and brain function, it\u2019s also a key skill to compete. I hope I can get back to that state again.

The idea of surrendering to some \u201cforce\u201d greater than oneself. The idea of being in touch with some essence that can bring out my full potential in way that I could never possibly understand. When Cass Sunstein, genius economist (author of \u201cNudge\u201c, 40 other books, does Nobel-prize level research) wrote \u201cThe World According to Star Wars\u201c, I knew I had to talk to him. I reached out to everyone I knew, found a way to get ahold of Cass, who wasn\u2019t doing any interviews on the book, and managed to book some \u00a0time with him. I\u2019ve written many times before about the effect Star Wars has had on my life. But I was also interested in the phenomenon of Star Wars, a topic Cass writes about. In particular, why was it a hit? George Lucas is the living breathing manifestation of \u201cidea sex\u201d. He takes concepts that worked in the past, meshes them together, and knows the combination will work. For example: think of a blonde-haired young man who has to reluctantly save the world from an evil galactic empire, uses laser powered swords and blasters, and meets a beautiful princess along the way. If you think \u201cFlash Gordon\u201d you\u2019d be right. What you might not know is that George Lucas tried to buy the rights to the old TV serial \u201cFlash Gordon\u201d. He wanted to make the movie. He was rejected so he made Star Wars. Or you might think Joseph\u2019s Campbell\u2019s \u201cThe Hero With a Thousand Faces\u201d, which George Lucas studied religiously before writing the script to Star Wars. Or you might think\u2026any of a dozen influences George Lucas had and meshed together. His idea: to take the familiar, provide his own twists, and release. If the old influences were hits and he just changed one aspect (make a Western a Space Opera) there\u2019s a good chance he would have a hit. Cass Sunstein explores: what makes a hit? What makes a failure? What makes something a hit after it\u2019s been dead for years (example: Herman Melville\u2019s \u201cMoby Dick\u201d didn\u2019t sell at all while he was alive and is now considered one of the best-written books of all time). This is a topic I am obsessed with. Combine that with the topic of \u201cStar Wars\u201d and now Cass Sunstein has written a book I am obsessed with. We found a room to hide in and we spent the next hour laughing and swapping notes on the relevancy of The Force in today\u2019s world. We didn\u2019t talk economics, world history, behavioral psychology or any of the topics he is one of the best experts in the world in: We talked about what makes stories go viral. We talked about how much we enjoyed this cultural hit that changed generations. We were two kids talking about our favorite movie.", "duration": "55:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/214-JAS-CassSunstein-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1487091600, "title": "Ep. 213 - A.J. Jacobs: How to Connect With The Greatest Network in The World", "author": "", "summary": "My first podcast is 24 minutes long. It\u2019s just me. No guest. The topic: \u201cWhy College Is a Waste of Time.\u201d Then I did one about my book \u201cChoose Yourself.\u201d One week later, I got 30 minutes with Robert Greene. Then an hour with Tucker Max, an hour with Gary Vaynerchuk, and an hour with AJ Jacobs. A month later I interviewed Dr. Wayne Dyer. Two months, Arianna Huffington. Six months, Mark Cuban. I didn\u2019t have an editor or a microphone. Three years later everyone has (or should do!) a podcast. It connects me with people I never thought possible. Or in AJ Jacobs\u2019 case, it connects people with family they didn\u2019t know existed. That\u2019s the theme of his new podcast, \u201cTwice Removed.\u201d \u201cThe good news is once you realize that everyone is family, you can just choose,\u201d AJ said. \u201cSo you\u2019re not stuck. You\u2019ve got the whole world to choose from.\u201d His first guest was Dan Savage, the sex columnist for \u201cThe Village Voice.\u201d In the other room, AJ had a secret guest, a relative 41 degrees removed from Dan. Along the way, AJ unravels the 41 connections. He had Dan in tears. \u201cWe\u2019re all connected,\u201d AJ said. \u201cPeople have called genealogy the museum of me. We all see the world through our own lens.\u201d Here\u2019s what I learned from AJ\u2019s lens\u2026 1. Start with X When I first started doing an interview podcast my audience size was X. Then I improved the quality and my downloads went to 3X. \u00a0In the case of \u201cTwice Removed,\u201d \u201cStart Up\u201d and \u201cFreakonomics\u201d adding production makes it 10X. \u201cFor every minute that makes the air there are hours that don\u2019t,\u201d AJ said. \u201cYou can make 18 different shows using the same material.\u201d The key is to do the best with what you have today. It cost $0 to make \u201cThe James Altucher Show.\u201d And I got to do what I never dreamed possible for the first 40 years of my life. 2. Show the truth The arc of a good story starts with a problem. Luke Skywalker wanted to explore but he couldn\u2019t until his aunt and uncle were killed by stormtroopers. Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents were killed in the first few panels of Batman. You need a problem to kickstart an otherwise reluctant hero. \u201cI love to tell my kids about my family's failures,\u201d AJ said. \u201cHonestly, I think they think I\u2019m total loser.\u201d \u00a0 AJ told me about an Emory University study. It showed kids adjust better when they\u2019re told about their family\u2019s failures. \u201cThere\u2019s the narrative of \u2018We were always successful\u2019 or \u2018We\u2019re always losers.\u2019 Families are oscillating,\u201d AJ said. \u201cYou go through times where things are going well and times when it\u2019s total failure. Tell your kids about the struggles your family has undergone and that you emerged ok\u2026 that you survived.\u201d Give yourself permission to have an imperfect life. 3. Surprise Yourself AJ learned this from a writer at \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d \u201cHe talked about how important it is to surprise yourself and make yourself laugh,\u201d AJ said, \u201cwhich at the time I didn\u2019t really understand.\u201d So he tested it. \u201cAs you\u2019re writing, take a left turn that your brain didn\u2019t expect.\u201d He does this in \u201cTwice Removed.\u201d And in our interview. He told me about an experiment he did with his wife. They filmed 24 hours of their day for weeks. Every argument was caught on tape. And they checked it frequently to see who was right. \u201cIt was bad either way,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if I was wrong I looked like an idiot, but if I was right she would just get angrier.\u201d So they quit that experiment. And he started a new one: \u201cTwice Removed.\u201d", "duration": "01:14:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-213-AJJacobs-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1486659600, "title": "Ep. 212 - Anna Koppelman: How to Find Your World...

When I was a kid, it was \u201cLord of The Flies\u201d on the playground. Nobody cared at all. Kids would kill each other at recess and whoever survived went back to class. But it\u2019s different now. Bullying is a thing. It has a voice. And there\u2019s a way out of the world of \u201cyou\u2019re not good enough\u201d and into the world where you belong\u2026 I read an article on Facebook that was going viral:\"What I know Now As a Teen With Dsylexia.\" Anna Koppelman wrote it. Then she kept writing. When I read the article, I thought Anna was one of those alien millennials taking over the world. But even worse, she\u2019s not a millenial. Ever since birth she\u2019s been on the Internet. She\u2019s an eleventh grader. Which makes her 17 or so. Generation Z\u2026 it\u2019s a totally different animal. Anna started a charity when she was 12 years old. At 14, she asked the Huffington Post to publish her work. They said yes. Then she wrote about dyslexia, bullying, intelligence, her crushes, her rejections, and each article felt like it was going a level deeper. Her writings were read everywhere by teens who had been through similar experiences. I wish I had this as a kid. A world where I could talk to people going through what I was going through. A way to connect to my \u201ctribe\u201d. Or a way to reach out to people and we could all figure out we weren\u2019t alone. \u201cI couldn\u2019t not say it,\u201d she said. \u201cI had this feeling at school and in my life of just not being able to connect with people\u2026 I had a feeling of isolation since first grade, like there was Saran wrap between me and the rest of the world.\u201d Here\u2019s what I learned from Anna Koppelman about finding out where you belong\u2026 1. Figure out another way When Anna\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d discovered she couldn\u2019t read, they laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not smart enough to be our friend,\u201d they said. She was pushed out of the tribe. But then she learned from a moose. \u201cI was watching the children\u2019s show, \u2018Arthur.\u2019 And there was this kid on there. He was a moose. He had dyslexia. So I turned to my parents and said, \u2018I have dyslexia.\u2019\u201d \u201cHow did this moose exhibit the dyslexia?\u201d \u201cIt was all just about the same feelings that I was feeling\u2026 where he was behind in his class, but he had all these great ideas he wanted to get out but couldn\u2019t. And the feeling of being trapped because there\u2019s something in your brain that\u2019s processing differently.\u201d But she found another way. And learned how to read. But kids kept making fun of her. For the next 10 years. \u201cI just wanted to connect with people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I would write, I would be able to connect with people. When I would perform poetry, I would be able to connect with people.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean perform poetry?\u201d I was confused. Because it sounded like her life was miserable at school. And instead of going to school with the eye patch and going straight home, she\u2019d head back out to go read slam poetry in front of a dozen+ strangers. \u201cWhat made you do that?\u201d \u201cI knew that no matter how awful school was there was a world outside of school and I just needed to find that world.\u201d 2. Use your skills Anna started out writing about her interests. People spend years writing about things outside themselves. I did too. But for years I was afraid to write about the things that really scared me, or drove me, or kept me up at night. I was afraid to write about the things that shamed me. Or I was afraid because I wondered what people would think. So I wanted to learn, what did Anna, at age 14, do differently? Start with craft. Write everyday. Use your brain. Develop your analytical muscle. Build your skills. Talent is the ignition in the car. Many people have talent. Many people never turn on the car. Many people never drive the car to get to their destination. Skills are just talent in its infancy. 3. Create from one layer deeper I asked Anna about courage. A lot of people want to change their lives. But few take next steps .And I feel that even fewer young kids, dying to fit into their close-knit world of school and popularity, take those next steps. I wanted to know what triggered that point. \u201cHow did you hit publish? Weren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t have any friends,\u201d she said. \u201cI was eating lunch alone pretty much everyday. I was just in a really sad place. And the kids in my grade were really mean to me. I just felt that there was no real happiness. But when I would sit down and eat lunch alone, I would start to write in my notebook or I would write on my computer.\u201d She didn\u2019t know the risk. And in a strange way, these horrible experiences helped her become the writer she is today. \u201cThe things that have happened in my life,\u201d she said, \u201cgot me to a place where I have more of an ability and belief in myself\u2026\u201d The transition came when she revealed her scars. She showed the deepest sides of her struggle. And bled on paper. Only by taking risks can a person unleash the hidden talents inside. Vulnerability bleeds. And connects you to the world\u2026 your world. It connects you to where you belong. 4. Always be kind A boy at school tricked her. He was always mean. But she thought things could change. \u201cI was throwing parties for children in need,\u201d she said. \u201cI had been doing it since middle school.\u201d He said he wanted to throw a bake sale for Birthday Fairies. \u201cAnd I believed him.\u201d He got all the popular kids to \u201chelp.\u201d \u201cThen the day of the bake sale came. None of them baked anything and they all just kind of laughed.\u201d \u201cThis is like Steven King\u2019s \u2018Carrie. Did you psychically spill blood all over them?\u201d She didn\u2019t\u2026 I guess angels don\u2019t spill blood on people. Sometimes I wonder what it\u2019s like to be a kid now. For my entire life since birth to be connected up to a much bigger world. I\u2019m jealous of the kids born now. How they can turn to this global tribe to develop their talents. But it\u2019s not connectivity that makes you a better person. Or connects you to better relationships. Or builds up your latent skills. Or helps you find your passions. No matter who you are, it\u2019s taking those next positive steps, those first risks that turn talent into skill, those first vulnerabilities that connect you to others \u2013 this is the key to unleashing that bigger world, that brings you to a tribe bigger than who you are.

I wish I could think like she does. I want to be weird like her. \"I look at any object and try to think of any use it has other than what people had planned for it.\" And then she acts on it. She sees a pair of pantyhose, cuts off the feet (why not?) and creates a multi-billion dollar company, Spanx. She sees her 9 month pregnant belly and paints a basketball on it. And then inspires hundreds of other women to do the same. Creates a book out of it: The Belly Art Project, and donates the proceeds to charity. \"All my life I was taught how to deal with failure,\" she told me. \"My dad would ask us at the dinner table every night: how did you fail today?\" HOW DID YOU FAIL TODAY? She got comfortable with failure at an age when every other kid wants to get an A+ at everything. She got comfortable embarrassing herself. For two years she tried to be a standup comedian. \"I wasn't very good at it.\" Practice\u00a0embarrassing yourself... Ready. Fire. Aim. She got a huge order from Nieman Marcus even though she didn't have the inventory or the production ready. She said, \"YES!\". Then she figured out how to get the order filled. Oprah listed Spanx as one of her \"favorite things\" of 2000. Oprah wanted to film her office. Sara had no office. She said, \"YES!\". Then she got an office and filled it up with people. Say YES! Then make things happen. Don't argue yourself into failure. Excuses are easy. Saying \"yes\" and then executing is hard. Get your thinking time. \"It takes me five minutes to drive to work,\" she told me. \"But I take 45 minutes. I use that time to think.\" It's important to think. To be creative every day. This is how she comes up with non-stop ideas to expand her brand, expand her products, and work on other projects. I suspect this is the secret for how she always sees things differently. Being creative is a practice. It's not lightening from above. It's taking the long route when you could've taken the short route. Purpose =\u00a0Infectious salesmanship. While I was talking to Sara she used the word \"empower\" several times. Spanx clothes gives women more confidence. Empowers women. The Belly Art Project empowers pregnant women. It seems like there are three parts to a project that leads to master salesmanship. - the higher purpose for it. This gets people excited. - the actual product and its benefits. - execution Combine all three and people will get infected with your passion for your ideas. Sara was unstoppable. Don't volley. Don't engage with the people who want to argue with you. That's time wasted when you can be creative. Don't invite ego in the door. Once you've worked on your project, have passion for it, started it, be willing to take suggestions and listen to people. Ego can kill a project and close the door on good opportunities. Be aware of you mortality. Sara was selling fax machines for five years before fully launching Spanx. She could still be selling them if she never started. If she listened to all the people who tried to dissuade her. If she became afraid of the multi-billion dollar companies that could have easily squashed her. Except they didn't. She was one person and they were billions. But they lost. We are here only this precious small amount of time. Make every moment a work of art. Make every moment move you one step forward towards your dream and purpose. Invent a new undergarment even if you had never made clothes in your life. Get 100s of women to paint their pregnant bellies and then raise money for charity with the idea. \"EVERYTHING IS A CANVAS,\" she told me. Which makes everyone a potential artist. What a great way to look at life. But I can't! Why not? For anything you want to do, for anything that excites you, take the time to figure out the next step. Ready. Fire. Aim. Just why not?

So we could've even grown up together. We had similar interests in music. He could've taught me sewing. I could've taught him how to play chess. \u00a0 But, to be honest, he worked harder than me. He stood on a corner and sold hats. Then he sold t-shirts. Then he would go to work at Red Lobster all night. Then back to school the next day. \u00a0 I was lazy as a kid. I couldn't work so hard. Six billion dollars later, Daymond John sits atop the FUBU fashion empire and I think to myself, \"He's one year younger than me.\" \u00a0 Do you ever feel that: jealousy? Or if not jealousy, then maybe regret? Like there's so many things you could've done...if only... \u00a0 The good news is, \"if only\" has two answers: \"You didn't do it then.\" And...\"Start today.\" \u00a0 There's never any rush. If today is the day you can start enjoying something, start making money from it, start combining all of your interests into career that lasts one, five, ten years....then today is the day you should do it. \u00a0 I've interview Daymond before. We covered a lot of his background and how he started when I interviewed him about his book, \"The Power of Broke.\" \u00a0 But on this interview I learned some new things. \u00a0 1) DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB.\u00a0 \u00a0 Many people are unhappy in their jobs. I hear it every day from people. I get emails every day about it. \u00a0 But you can't start a business in a second, or a month, or even a year. \u00a0 Daymond worked at Red Lobster for SIX YEARS while he was getting FUBU off the ground. He didn't want to take a chance. \u00a0 Why not? One might ask. \u00a0 It's scary. If you leave a job for a new business and it doesn't work out, how will you pay your bills? I stayed at my job at HBO for 18 months after I started my first business before I would make the leap. I was really scared. \u00a0 You don't leap until you can take away as many of the risks as possible. \u00a0 2) DON'T DO THE COOL THING \u00a0 While Daymond was working at Red Lobster and selling hats on the street, his friends were losing their lives selling drugs. \u00a0 I was reading recently about Charlie Munger, Buffett's #2 man at Berkshire Hathaway and one of the richest men in the world. \u00a0 He started a hedge fund in 1973. The worst time ever to start a fund. And, if I remember correctly (I refuse to Google), he was down 20-30% the first year. And then 20-30% the second year. And then he fought back and ended up making money for his investors. \u00a0 Another man, probably in a very similar situation, was Bernie Madoff. We don't know exactly what happened but the theory is that when he was down he was too ashamed to tell anyone and turned it into a massive fraud. \u00a0 Character is destiny. The choices you make today are your biography\u00a0tomorrow. \u00a0 Daymond refused to let the opinions of others veer him off his path. He worked hard, stuck to his uncool job while he pursued his passion. And made it work. \u00a0 3) COMMUNITY \u00a0 Critical to Daymond's success. Make the company more than just about you. Make it about the community. Then it has a life larger than \"Daymond John.\" You create something people are willing to share. \u00a0 How did he do this?  Name -\u00a0\"FUBU\" means \"for u, by us\". BAM! Friends -\u00a0Daymond got his friends to wear it. Then their friends wanted to wear it. And so on. That's real marketing. Don't even think of advertising your product unless PEOPLE ARE FIRST DYING TO SHARE IT. Authority\u00a0- LL Cool J grew up down the street from Daymond. Daymond didn't know him but he started pursuing him, asking him to wear a FUBU product in one of his videos. LL probably didn't even know who this kid was. But then he saw other kids wearing the clothes. And he responded to the name. So he started wearing FUBU in his videos. BAM! Shows -\u00a0Daymond started going to all the Hip hop fashion conventions. The Magic convention in Las Vegas. He met his peers in the clothing business. They didn't know him as a kid from Queens. They just knew his products. They knew that LL Cool J was wearing them. He built his network with his peers.  Note that in all of the above he didn't spend ONE DIME on ads but he had millions of dollars worth of free advertising. This doesn't come out of luck. That comes from every day... 4) DOING WHAT YOU LOVE People mess this part up a lot. There's not one \"destiny\" that we are meant to figure out and do. Maybe Daymond John loved hip-hop music but wasn't a good musician. Maybe he loved clothes. Maybe he loved selling. Maybe he loved seeing LL Cool J wear a hat he made. We don't really know. There are too many factors. We do know, though, that once he got through the hard parts of the business and it was really starting to roll, that, as Warren Buffett would say, he \"skipped to work every morning\". 5) READY. FIRE. AIM. This is the most important factor. I've interviewed 200 successful people so far for my podcast, give or take, and this is the one factor they all have in common. Daymond got ready (he made the clothes, he saved money, he didn't quit his job, he built community). And then something happened that was game-changing. If you stick to something long enough and it's growing and you feel that people are loving \u00a0what you do, then something game-changing will happen. Macy's placed a $400,000 order (at the MAGIC fashion show). Daymond didn't have the money. Now was the moment when you can take risk. He and his mom mortgaged his mom's house for $100,000. He had to make 15,000 items. He got the fabrics. He filled up his house with seamstresses, and he fulfilled the $400,000 order. Then he returned the $100,000 out of the profits. He quit his job at Red Lobster. He was in business now. He was in business for life.", "duration": "01:00:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-210-DaymondJohn-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1485450000, "title": "Ep. 209 - Bobby Casey: Never Feel Broke Again and Travel the World (Forever)", "author": "", "summary": "I heard an eight-year-old kid tell another eight-year-old that he's not welcome in his home. He said \"Trump or Clinton?\" \u00a0 \"Clinton.\" \u00a0 And that was that. They kept walking. Kept debating and I bet nothing happened. I bet they're still friends. \u00a0 Some people are either all talk or afraid. \u00a0 Or both. \u00a0 I try not to be either. I try to listen, come up with ideas, and be grateful. Because if I listen, I learn. And then I can say two sweet words, \u201cthank you.\u201d \u00a0 How many people said, \"If Trump becomes president, I'm leaving the country.\" Or the other way around? \u00a0 There's only one reason why I\u2019d ever even consider packing. And Bobby Casey spelled it out for me. \u00a0 \"Americans don't understand how insanely expensive it is to live in the U.S.,\" Bobby said on my podcast. \u00a0He sold everything he owned and left the country in 2009. Right after the market crashed. Now he works all over the world. And helps people get off the grid. \u00a0 I wanted to know how he did it. \u00a0 And why... \u00a0 \"I hated my customers,\" he said. \"I hated my employees, I hated my job, I hated my business.\" \u00a0 \"But what made you think you could sell all your belonging and travel the world forever?\" \u00a0 \"Weren't you scared you would run out of money?\" \u00a0 \"I just knew I'd work it out,\" he said. \"I'd make some money.\" \u00a0 I couldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s easy to be uncertain when you\u2019re level of unknown isn\u2019t going to erupt your central nervous system. \u00a0 But Bobby had motivation. \u00a0 \u201cMy happiness and my quality of life is much more important than cashing out on a business,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care. I wanted to be happy again.\u201d \u00a0 So he got rid of everything. He gave away motorcycles. (He had 27). Then he bought two one-way tickets to Prague. One for him. And one for his 9 year old son. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019d never been there.\u201d \u00a0 The rest of his family moved a few weeks later. He has three kids. \u00a0 \"What about friends? And school?\" I asked. \u00a0 \"My daughter, she's 20, she's a rapper in London. She did two years of virtual school. And she can make friends anywhere. It\u2019s her personality type.\u201d His other two kids enrolled with locals. \u00a0 I had 100 questions. \"How'd you get the confidence? What type of freelance work did you do?\" \u201cHow did you make ends meet?\u201d \u00a0 He broke it down for me. And told me all the ways he saves money living abroad. \u00a0 \u201cI did the math on this,\u201d he said. \"You won't believe this, but I pay $42 a year for a 10,000 euro deductible health insurance plan.\" \u00a0 Anything after 10,000 euros, he's covered. \"I could get airlifted to John Hopkins if I wanted and that would be covered.\" \u00a0 \"You can make about $150,000, tax-free, as an American living abroad.\" Here\u2019s how Bobby explains it on the podcast... \u00a0 If you make $100K (gross) in the U.S, then you\u2019re probably netting less than $60K. Abroad, you can make the same $60K (net), live tax-free (if you qualify for the \u201cforeign earned income exclusion\u201d), get a housing allowance, pay $42 a year for health insurance, and basically never feel broke again. \u00a0 I was getting depressed. Because I know I\u2019m not going to move. It\u2019s part of being human. Everyone I look up to, Scott Adams, Dan Ariely, Nassim Taleb, they all say the same thing: people are irrational creatures. Even the idea that we\u2019re being rational, is irrational. \u00a0 Every time Bobby spoke, I had 10 new questions. \u00a0 I thought I'd never understand. But then he gave me his secret. And it answered all my questions. \u00a0 It was so simple. I couldn't believe it. \u00a0 Bobby and his son were walking around Estonia. They left Prague, bought a house and had no plans. \u00a0 Someone overheard them speaking English. \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re American?\u201d \u00a0 They started talking. \u201cWhat are you planning to do for your kids for school?\u201d \u00a0 Bobby had no idea. \u00a0 \u201cI have a son who\u2019s your son\u2019s age. We found a really good school up the hill. There\u2019s a meeting tonight for foreigners\u00a0who want to enroll their kids.\u201d \u00a0 That was it.

He wasn't sure exactly what he was going to do after college.\u201d \u00a0 I needed to know how Jon Stewart did it. How he redefined Late Night. How he broke out and rose to the top of comedy. And how he used humor to disrupt it all \u2014 mainstream media, mainstream politics, the news. \u00a0 \u201cHe would wear the same thing in the office everyday: a pair of work boots, a pair of chinos, the same t-shirt, the same Mets hat.

What's funny about it? What's our point of view?\u201d \u00a0 Everyday, I ask, \u201cWho can I help today?\u201d It keeps me open to the day. It gives me a fresh perspective.

He could\u2019ve. But that wouldn't have been funny. \u00a0 Instead, he played dumb. He pretended he didn\u2019t know it was the same person contradicting himself. \u00a0 That\u2019s what made it funny. \u00a0 He removed knowledge from the situation. And got the attention of millions. Eventually, making real change. They even had an effect on some big issues. \u00a0 \u201cThey made an eight or nine-minute mock detective movie. They took one veteran and tried to trace his paperwork through the Veterans Administration. They kept running into ridiculous roadblocks, but it was also moving. It gave you a sense of how much this guy was going through to get medical care,\u201d Chris said. \u201cThat ended up shaming the Veterans Administration and changing a lot of those rules and regulations.\u201d \u00a0 He also transformed media. \u00a0 \u201cLoosely,\u201d Chris says. \u00a0 But, in old media you couldn\u2019t find the truth like you can today. It would take weeks of research. Now with the Internet you can search and find anything. And turn it around in 24 hours. \u00a0 Chris talked to Anderson Cooper. He said the mainstream media world was always aware of \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to get made fun\u2026 \u00a0 \u201cAnd, inevitably, you did.\u201d \u00a0 3) Ignore the traps \u201cYou've got, in many cases, a lot of ambitious, competitive, eccentric people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put them in a room and give them a deadline and that can lead to a lot of clashes.\u201d But Jon didn\u2019t get stuck in the trappings of show business. \u00a0 Which is easy to do in any career. \u00a0 \u00a0 But if you use your idea of how things could be to fuel creation, you get a leg up. \u00a0 You get \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d \u00a0 4) Live in two worlds \u201cWhat about when you were writing the book? Did you ever wish you were them? Did you ever feel like, \u2018I'm covering them, but I want to be them\u2019?\u201d \u00a0 I knew my answer.

But he told me... He's the author of \"Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation,\" \"Everything Bad is Good for you,\" and the recent \"Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World\"\u2014 how the idea of \"play\" more than anything else, is what created the modern world. \u201cI regret saying this a little, but, the assumption that video games are just a terrible waste of time and that this generation is growing up playing these stupid games is really\u2026 it\u2019s so wrong,\" he said. He was talking about using play for education reform.\u00a0\"If you think about it, we walk around with a bunch of assumptions of what a learning experience is supposed to look like: listening to a lecture, watching an educational video, taking an exam to test your learning.\"  I was gonna puke.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been watching my kids play Battlefield 1, which is set in WWI. And it\u2019s amazing.\u201d  \u201cI sit and watch my kids play and ask what they\u2019re thinking about. Because as a grown up who doesn\u2019t play the game you can\u2019t process it. There\u2019s just so much going on in the world. They\u2019re playing this multiplayer game, in this incredibly vivid landscape with a million data points streaming across the screen.\u201d His doesn't understand it. And his kids don\u2019t understand how he doesn\u2019t understand it... \u00a0\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the signal I got? And how this one piece of the interface was telling me to do\u00a0xy and z?\u201d \u201cAll I can see is there\u2019s a gun and a Zeplin. I\u2019m 48,\u201d he said. We\u2019re the same age. \u201cDoes that make me middle aged?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re old.\" Kids are basically gonna destroy us. We\u2019re the one\u2019s who are going to end up in diapers. They started off there, we end up there. Unless\u2026 We play, too. So here\u2019s what Steven found out. One would ask, that sounds ridiculous: how did \"play\" create the Industrial Revolution. Or all the wars of the past 500 years. Or all the innovations we've seen with the Internet, which was initially funded by the military. What does \"play\" have to do with it? Everything. And that's what makes Steven Johnson so infuriating. He'll take two concepts that seem like they have nothing to do with each other and he'll say, THIS caused THAT! And I'd shake my head and cry and ask, \"How is that even possible?\" And then he'll show me. Because he traces his curiosity. It\u2019s like when you start clicking all the hyperlinks in a Wikipedia page. And seeing how everything is connected. Steven connects the dots and puts them in a book for you. If I were to recreate a robotic Steven Johnson (hmmm, actually, maybe he is a robot. Or at least has a Cylon brain or maybe Bradley Cooper's brain from Limitless) I'd have to feed in 10,000 books or so, and this ability to find every possible cross connection between every two ideas mentioned in the books. And then he spits it out in his masterpieces. As I told him in the beginning of the podcast: I enjoy a lot of books. A lot of books are great even. But your books and only a few others are among the only books where I read it and I feel like my IQ is going up. I made up a game in fact, based on his books. Maybe someone should make the card game for this. Here's two random concepts. Tell me how they are connected. Example: The lengthening of shop windows in London in the 1600s and the rise of American slavery in the 1800s. I\u2019m not making this up. One really caused the other. Steven calls it \u201cthe hummingbird effect.\u201d It\u2019s different from the butterfly effect where the flapping of a butterfly\u2019s wings can cause a hurricane. That\u2019s chance. The hummingbird effect is traceable. \u201cIt has to be 2-3 steps removed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have to be really rigorous about when it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d You play to find the links. I told him this idea. He laughed and said, \"I should do that.\" Example: The laugh of Sputnik, led direction to Tinder. In the podcast, we spoke about how humans have this evolutionary need not only for food and reproduction (Darwin's well-trodden theories), but also novelty. Example: Gutenberg in the 1400s led to the study of genomics. And that novelty and play gave us energy and initiative to produce discoveries ranging from the cotton gin, the steam engine, world exploration, and the Internet. Example: a tree used by the Mayans to make games led directly to car tires. What I really wanted to explore in the podcast was not only these insane connections. It was almost ludicrous how many fun ones I was coming up with, but what was it about Steven that allowed him to come up with all these connections. What does he do differently with his brain? Can I do it also? I wanted to learn. Example: The invention of the phonograph in the mid 1800s directly led to their being more boys than girls born in China this year.", "duration": "01:08:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-206-StevenJohnson-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1484240400, "title": "Ep. 205 - Jairek Robbins: What To Do When You're Overworked, Tired and Can't Turn Off Your Mind", "author": "", "summary": "You know that game where you flip a card, see the face and turn it back over, then try to find the match? \u00a0 That's the game we're going to play... \u00a0 Write down your values. I told Jairek mine. I had three. \u00a0 Jairek is a life coach. And Tony Robbins is his dad. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Because Tony didn\u2019t invest in his son\u2019s strengths. He invested in weakness. \u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t really have an understanding of what real hard work was,\u201d Jairek said. \u00a0 So in college, Jairek went to Canada and stacked lumber. \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve known me a long time,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s a weakness I have that you think I can work through?\u201d \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how we find those,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Step 1: Review your values \u00a0 Jairek said, \u201cLet\u2019s do this right now. If I were to ask you what\u2019s most important to you in life, what would you say?\u201d \u00a0  \u201cHumans\u2026\u201d That was number one. Connecting with people I care about.  \u00a0  \u201cBeing an honest person who acts with integrity.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cAnd creativity.\u201d  \u00a0 So here\u2019s the card game\u2026 Imagine you have all the cards face down on the carpet. Every card has a match. \u00a0 One shows your values. The other shows your time. You have to match them up to win. \u00a0 Because values = time. \u00a0 People say, \u201cTime is money.\u201d \u00a0 No. \u00a0 Time is values. \u00a0 But pretty much everyone struggles with this. I struggle with this. Jairek gave an example but it made me wonder maybe your brain's idea of values is wrong. \u00a0 Maybe your \u201cvalues\u201d are really your expectations\u2026 In my life, misery sinks in when expectations are higher than reality. \u00a0 I don't know. \u00a0 The example Jairek gave was a guy who spent all his time doing business. His values were family and God. So I asked Jairek, \u201cCould your brain be wrong?\u201d \u00a0 Maybe this guy\u2019s calendar was right. Maybe he really valued business\u2026 \u00a0 I\u2019m not in his head. I don't\u2019 have a life coach. I have a therapist. \u00a0 So if you're reading this and thinking, \"No he doesn\u2019t,\" then you know what's true for you. \u00a0 Step 2: Find a match \u00a0 Log your time. Look at your day and your week. Jairek\u2019s clients log their lives for seven days. But he also needs to know your thoughts. Which is harder to measure. \u201cI don\u2019t have a sensor for that yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s subjective.\u201d \u00a0 Jairek has helped thousands of people. \u00a0 One client said, \u201cHonestly, I wake up and the first thing through my head is, \u2018Am I going to close that deal today?\u2019 It\u2019s always combing through my mind. Even at dinner. I\u2019m thinking about the paperwork. My mind\u2019s constantly turning. I\u2019m not able to let go of what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u201d \u00a0 His home life was suffering. \u00a0 So Jairek asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your ritual to turn it off at the end of the day and walk away without having all those thoughts processing in your head?\u201d \u00a0 Most people don\u2019t have a ritual. That\u2019s the problem. \u201cYou need to disassociate from work,\u201d he said. \u201cGet it out of your nervous system.\u201d \u00a0 So here\u2019s the formula: disconnect, then connect. \u00a0 Part A) Disconnect: \u00a0 \u201cSome people go for a walk, other people breathe for 20 minutes. It\u2019s different for everybody. You have to figure out the routine.\u201d \u00a0 Sometimes I\u2019m emailing about work at midnight. That\u2019s how habits start. They creep in when my guard is down, when I\u2019m not connected to anything I love. \u00a0 \u00a0 Part B) Connect \u00a0 Jairek switched his coaching methods a few years ago. He used to coach on performance. Now it\u2019s relationships. Because it\u2019s the relationships in our lives that increase our performance. \u00a0 \u201cRight now, if you\u2019re at work, and you think about your kids, your heart\u2019s probably not gushing over them,\u201d he said.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cNo, usually they suck and I\u2019m annoyed at them.\u201d I had plans to see them in a few hours. \u00a0 Then Jairek hypnotized me. \u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s the most precious and beautiful moment you have with one of your kids?\u201d he said. \u201cGo back way in the distance. Remember one of your earliest moments with them that just lit your heart up. And as a dad made you prouder than you could have ever imagined.\u201d \u00a0 He had me repeat the process. Catch a memory. Then another. You can do this about your spouse, family, someone who\u2019s hurt your or you\u2019ve hurt. \u00a0 Then combine memories with music. Or look at a picture. \u201cIf you combine the visual, auditory and the feeling of it, and reconnect with those memories, then by the time you get home, you\u2019re less likely to pick up a business call. Because your head\u2019s not thinking about all the deals.\u201d \u00a0 I saw my kids that day.

Failed the astronaut test the first three times.  Failed to get the highest evaluation when he walked into space the first time.

One thing is he kept saying things to me like, \u201cI wasn\u2019t the smartest in X but\u2026\u201d  He said that about his classmates. He said that about his neighbors. He said this about his fellow co-workers. He said this out in the middle of outer space. 350,000 miles away from home.  In my podcast, years later, he was still saying that.  He's a liar.  He got his PhD from MIT in \u201crobot arms on Mars\u201d. He went into space twice. He fixed the Hubble telescope so now we can see images like this:  By the way, he failed the astronaut exam because his vision wasn't good enough.  He then figured out how to TRAIN HIS EYES TO HAVE BETTER EYESIGHT. I never even heard of that before. He passed his next exam with 20/20 vision.  Clearly he was good enough. In fact, he is the best at everything he has ever done.  Humility without negativity (negative might be: \u201cI\u2019m not good enough so I will give up.\u201d) seems to be key. In other words:  Humility With Forward Action.  Second, he told me something very interesting.  In his lab at MIT there were ten other students.  Four of them became astronauts.  Do you know how hard it is to become an astronaut? Out of the 1000s of people who used to apply each year, less than 10 would get in. These 1000s who applied were DESPERATE to get in.  And they couldn\u2019t.  And yet FOUR from this one single lab flew into outer space.  If he had been hanging out in a bar instead of a robotics lab, I doubt he could say, \u201cMe and 3 of my friends went into space\u201d.  Life and it\u2019s outcomes are contagious.

Those are the people and places that will propel you into outer space.  And by \u201couter space\u201d, in this one case I am talking metaphorically. Be the person the people around you expect you to be.  I learned this from Mike because I was curious and I reached out to him and wanted to ask questions.  Learning something from the people you admire is really the point here. If you do it just once a day you\u2019ll learn 365 incredible things a year.  This will make your life a dream.

It will make you lose all your money. It\u2019ll make you wake up in your 40\u2019s or 50\u2019s and wonder what you\u2019re going to do about retirement. It will make you develop your worst possible habits. \u00a0 For me, it was drinking. And waking up face to floor. I was ugliest when I was unhappy. That\u2019s true for everyone. \u00a0 Unless you hide it with plastic surgery and cocaine. \u00a0 The point is I care about myself now. And not a lot of people say that. \u00a0 But it\u2019s important. \u00a0 I should care about me more than anyone else\u2026 even my daughters. But sometimes I mess up. Sometimes I love them more than me. \u00a0 Even on airplanes, they say, \u201cPut your mask on before assisting others.\u201d If you put a mask on your baby before you put a mask on yourself, your baby will never know who you could\u2019ve been. \u00a0 If I don\u2019t put my oxygen mask on first everyday, then my kids, my friends, everyone I meet, won\u2019t know who I really am. \u00a0 They won\u2019t know me at my best. They\u2019ll know me passed out on the floor because I tried starving myself for three days (it was a fast. I was trying to detox my body. Again this goes back to caring about yourself. Molly, Josie, I swear, I had good intentions.) \u00a0 Let me get back to the most commonly believed lie. \u00a0 It\u2019s called the sunk cost fallacy. This is when you stick to what you\u2019re doing because you already invested your whole life in it. \u00a0 For example, you won\u2019t quit your job (the job you hate) because that\u2019s what you went to college for or because you\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years and change is scary. \u00a0 I studied computer science. I went to graduate school for it. \u00a0 But now I do what I love. Because I gave up. \u00a0 I had to give up on life\u2019s little stresses and jump head first into an even bigger stress. It took me one step closer to bottom. And one step closer to the lifeboat. \u00a0 I have a friend. She\u2019s 52. Or 53, divorced. She has a \u201clow-level\u201d job. Or that\u2019s what she says. \u00a0 She thinks her goals are out of reach. She says, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d And she believes it. So I asked my friend Susan David, (she\u2019s a Ph.D) \u201cHow can you help someone like that? How can you help someone struggling with life\u2019s circumstances?\u201d \u00a0 But I was asking the wrong question. Because she told me the stress people experience everyday isn\u2019t (usually) caused by massive life events. \u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a particular kind of stress that, in psychology, we call allostatic stress,\u201d Susan said, \u201cIt\u2019s the everyday stress.\u201d \u00a0 I was interviewing her about her book, \u201cEmotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life.\u201d \u00a0 She gave 50 or 100 tips to do exactly what the subtitle of her book says, \u201cGet Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life.\u201d \u00a0 1) Accept it \u201cAccept that you aren\u2019t where you want to be,\u201d Susan said. \u201cBe with those difficult emotions.\u201d \u00a0 She said we get stuck in two ways. One is \u201cbottling.\u201d The second is \u201cbruting.\u201d Bottling is when someone traps emotions inside. They ignore their feelings. \u00a0 Bruting is when someone obsesses about emotions. And try to determine what happened and why\u2026 \u00a0 They both cause high levels of anxiety. \u00a0 So I had to stop asking, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u00a0 2) Choose \u201cwant-to\u201d goals I have four main values. They\u2019re in my daily practice. \u00a0 Values are the things you want to do versus the things you have to do. Because \u201chave to\u201d goals are less likely to be successful. \u00a0 So I asked Susan, \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t know what your values are?\u201d \u00a0 \u201cWe often turn around and say, \u2018How did I get here?\u2019 \u00a0 \u201cI was just going on with flow. I was just doing what everyone else told me to do. I went to college. I got a job. I got a house... How did I get her?\u2019 This is a really difficult place for people to be\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really critical for all of us to realize is values are not some abstract idea. Values are ways of living, ways of being.\u201d \u00a0 Figure out your values. Susan says, at the end of the day ask yourself, \u201cWhat did I do today that was worthwhile?\u201d \u00a0 I watched a plane move through the sky today. I held the door for someone. I smiled at someone who looked dangerous\u2026 someone who probably isn\u2019t smiled at often. \u00a0 Those were worthwhile moments. I\u2019m also writing\u2026 \u00a0 It\u2019s a \u201cwant-to\u201d goal that I hope to have for the rest of my life... \u00a0but who knows, sometimes reinvention has new ideas for you. \u00a0 3) Make \u201ctowards\u201d moves There are two types of movements. \u00a0 Everything you do is either a \u201ctoward\u201d or an \u201caway\u201d movement. \u00a0 \u201cIf I value my health, I can go downstairs and choose an ice cream, which is an \u2018away\u2019 move or I can make a choice that is healthier,\u201d Susan said. \u00a0 4) Watch for setbacks \u201cWhen you have a setback you\u2019re more likely to revert back to an old bias you falsely believe,\u201d she said. \u00a0 I made an \u201caway\u201d move. I stopped writing my daily gratitude list. And then I started complaining. It was a domino effect. But I caught it early. \u00a0 Setbacks happen everyday to everyone.

His father had died. His job over. His relationship gone. He felt adrift, depressed, broken. He was so lost he wandered the world trying to find his way back. Twenty years later he wrote the novel about what happened - REBIRTH. The novel is about how he discovered for himself the ancient art of the pilgrimage. How to be a wanderer. How to be lost in a world with too much GPS raining down. Would a pilgrimage, a wandering, solve his problems? I read Kamal's book. The book comes out today. I had him on my podcast (also out today). I wanted to find out how even in our daily lives we can go on a pilgrimage. Even if I'm in a cubicle, can I break free, can I become a wanderer Sometimes I also feel stuck. But I don't want to go away for months at a time. I want a pilgrimage in my life right now! From what I can gather from reading the book, REBIRTH, and talking with Kamal, a pilgrimage has several parts: A) SEEKING AN ANSWER Something happened. Something confusing. Something that wasn't in the plan. You have to get off the regular path. Try a new one. Try one that takes a bit of courage and discipline. To meet stranger along the way B) IT TAKES TiME I'm not a believer that you have to go to a far location. But take time for yourself each day to do something you've never done before. Think about things you never thought about before. Find the places in your life that you never looked before. They are there every day. The pilgrimage awaits. Do a dare you never would have dared to before. C) STRUGGLE Maybe some people find life easy. I don't. Life is filled with worries about money, about relationships, about (for me) kids, about decisions, about the people who hate you, who annoy you, who scare you. Anxieties, regrets. Every pilgrimage begins with the struggle. And every journey is a struggle. The struggle doesn't stop. It just changes. It changes into one where you are lost to one where you have vision. Where the struggle is not being trapped in the vision of others but for the unique impact that you want to create. D) BENEFITS OF A PILGRIMAGE: - You see more clearly: Everything you see on a pilgrimage is different from \"normal life\". Enjoy them. Learn from it. Even a single day, a single meeting, can be a pilgrimage. What is your takeaway from it. - You meet people. I like to pretend everyone has a fortune cookie to give me. A little bit stale, a little bit crunchy, with a folded message inside. Read it. - There's an end. We've made pilgrimages too easy. We can go to a museum and see 2000 works of art. It used to be that people would travel a 1000 miles to see one painting hanging up in a chapel. Then you can really appreciate what you see. The more you appreciate the people, the things, the emotions around you, the more you are a pilgrim. - Come back changed. A pilgrim doesn't just fly a plane from LA to NY. A pilgrim changes because of the journey. You do that by using your senses: listen more, see more, taste more, observe more. The convenience of modern society comes at a price. It's too difficult now to be a pilgrim because everything is two taps away on our phone. There is an \"otherness\" to being disconnected for a bit. To search. To wander. And finally, to give up looking. To surrender to the results. ---- It's freeing to give up, even for a few minutes, everything you ever knew. To become a Wanderer. To look around and see everything as if it were new. REBIRTH, by Kamal Ravikant, got me thinking about these things. He went on his pilgrimage. He met people. He went on an adventure, a journey, and reading his book showed me how. I need to leave. To struggle. To find an answer. And then to completely give up all hope of ever finding one. To find again the beauty of being completely lost. If I get lost enough, maybe I can find something worth looking for.", "duration": "01:02:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-202-KamalRavikant-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1483030800, "title": "Ep. 201 - Ben Mezrich: Success after 190 Rejection Slips", "author": "", "summary": "\u201cWhen I was a struggling writer, before I wrote my first book, I got 190 rejection slips.\u201d \u00a0 He taped them to the walls like a serial killer. \u00a0 \u201cMy wallpaper was rejection slips.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cWhat was the worst one...,\u201d I asked Ben Mezrich, a New York Times bestselling author. Over the past five or six years, I\u2019ve probably read all of his books. He wrote \u201cBringing Down the House,\u201d which became the movie \u201c21\u201d. He wrote, \u201cAccidental Billionaires,\u201d which became \u201cThe Social Network\u201d where Jesse Eisenberg played a seemingly evil Mark Zuckerberg. \u00a0 The New Yorker sent him just a page with the most powerful word known to man. \u00a0 \u201cIt was just, \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Ben said, \u201cI was rejected by a janitor at a publishing house because I sent a manuscript to an editor who was no longer working there and the manuscript ended up in the trash can.

I wanted to write a hundred books.\u201d \u00a0 I was interviewing him about, \u201cThe 37th Parallel: The Secret Truth Behind America's UFO Highway.\u201d \u00a0 They found these cows in the 70s. It looked like they were sliced with a laser. They had perfect slices of circles in their abdomens. Like pancakes. And they were completely drained of blood. \u00a0 The FBI investigated. \u00a0 There was no mess. No blood spill. \u00a0 Then pilots started seeing UFOs. Ben says if a pilot sees a UFO now, they\u2019ll get fired for reporting it. \u00a0 So I asked him, \u201cIsn\u2019t there a freedom of information act?\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019ve tried,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t even admit Area 51 existed until a few years ago. So, no. They don\u2019t have to release that information.\u201d \u00a0 People lose their minds looking for answers. Questioning can be interrogative or art. Answers birth more questions. And the space between answer A and question B is just space. \u00a0 And that\u2019s where Ben\u2019s books are created. \u00a0 \u201cI only go into the stories where it\u2019s larger than life or something happens,\u201d Ben said. \u201cWhat leads up to that incredible moment?

He won\u2019t write a book that won\u2019t sell. \u00a0 \u201cHow do you know?\u201d I asked. \u00a0 \u201cUsually, I speak to the main character enough to get a book proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I do all that research.

Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, knows the answer and has known it for years. So I called him and asked. I needed to know. He told me how Trump won. And he told me how anyone can use these persuasion techniques to improve their lives. What if you can get people to do whatever you want just by using the right words and subtly hypnotizing everyone you meet? It sounds like a science fiction novel. But it's true. It's what happened, and it happens every day. Who are the victims? You're the victim. Scott Adams predicted in September 2015(!) that Donald Trump would become President because, \"he is the best master persuader I have ever seen.\" Scott Adams trained as a hypnotist and master persuader for years. \"Once you realize that everyone is completely irrational,\" Scott Adams told me, \"your life gets a lot easier. \"You can start to use the principles behind this to see why people really do things, as opposed to using rational facts, and then use that to your advantage. \"Understanding that people are irrational has made my life a lot better.\" But how did he predict a year and a half ago that Trump would win? I needed to know how. And how I could do it. Trump was the unlikely choice to be President. Just like Scott was the unlikely choice to be one of the world's most popular cartoonists with Dilbert. But we can all learn the skills that Scott learned. Scott heard a story that made him want to change his life in his 20s. His mother had delivered birth to his sister without the use of anesthetics. She was hypnotized. \"She felt no pain,\" Scott said. So Scott, in his 20s, learned all the techniques of hypnosis. \"You mean,\" I said, \"You can take a gold watch and swing it in front of their eyes and make them do what you want?\" \"That has never happened,\" Scott said, \"Except in movies. \"What you learn is that basically everything people do is completely irrational. And then they rationalize it later. \"Like, they might say they voted for Trump because of his policies but this is just a rationalization. Everyone is irrational and everyone is subject to persuasion.\" Everything seemed against Trump. But somehow he beat 16 candidates in the primaries and one big candidate in the election. And, Scott says, all the theories as to why he won have been wrong. So I called him up and asked him what happened. And he told me: ----------------- - THE LINGUISTIC KILL SHOT \"Trump described everyone using two techniques: - words that had never been used in politics before - words that were visual. So every time you looked at the candidate being described you would look for confirmation bias.\" Example: Jeb Bush he described as \"low energy\". \"Low energy\" had never been used to describe a candidate before so they stood out. And whenever you looked Jeb, unless he was jumping around, you would automatically look for clues that showed he was low energy. Trump systematically did this with everyone who was frontrunner against him, including \"Crooked Hillary\" which referred both to her legal troubles and the persistent rumors that she was sick. ------------------ - CHARISMA = POWER + EMPATHY Scott said, \"Trump clearly had the Power part down. But he was low on Empathy. \"So he used polling to figure out what the critical issue was for the most amount of people and came up with Immigration. By going with this issue he proved he had empathy with his base. \"Expect him as President to try to show empathy to a much larger group of people.\" ------------------ - OVERSELLING THE STORY \"Trump consistently oversold his point. For instance, 'Build a Wall'.\" He used hyperbole because it's the direction that counts. \"It didn't matter that the facts didn't support him. His base was listening to the direction while all the media was getting bogged down in the weeds. \"And in many cases, he would back down. He would recognize if he oversold too much and back down on it. \"But again, the media would show his views for free because he was so outlandish and his supporters would note the direction, not the facts.\" I asked Scott: What would happen to Trump if a \"Rick Perry\" situation occurred like in 2012, where Perry couldn't name the 3 cabinet departments he wanted to eliminate and that destroyed his campaign? Scott said, \"If Trump was stumbling to name the three he would just say, 'You know what? There are 10 cabinet positions I'd eliminate! You probably can guess the ones I'm talking about.\" \"And then while everyone would be scratching their heads trying to figure out if there are even ten cabinet departments, his supporters would be just note the direction.\" -------------------- - AUDACITY Early on he would say things that were so audacious nobody could believe a Presidential candidate would be saying these things. But people got used to it. It got him free media coverage which allowed him to spend less than half of what Hillary spent. It allowed him to consistently say audacious and outlandish things throughout the campaign without upsetting his base. ----------------- - EMBRACE THE ARGUMENT If you just outright reject someone, they won't even pay attention to what you say. But with everyone he spoke with, he would start off agreeing with them and then start to turn people towards supporting his ideas. Even with Hillary, he would say: \"She has great experience\" before following it up with, \"but after 30 years, what has changed?\" --------------------- - TALENT STACK Scott said, \"I'm not the funniest guy in the room. And I'm not the best at drawing. But I'm pretty good at both and that's where Dilbert comes from. \"It's really hard to be the best in the world at one thing,\" Scott told me, \"But if you are 'pretty good' at a bunch of things and use them together, you can succeed. \"Trump has one of the best talent stacks I've ever seen. He's not the smartest guy in the room, but he's pretty good at public speaking, business smarts, humor, hiring and firing, politics, etc.\" Again, he didn't know as much as the other candidates about every political issue. \"Expect him to get to know the facts that are important once he is President. But he was pretty good at knowing what was going on and combined that with the other \"pretty good\" things in his talent stack.\" ------------------- - BLAME OTHERS FOR PEOPLE'S SUFFERING \"While Hillary was focusing on 'I'm With Her' and 'Let's make history with the first woman President', Trump was focusing on 'Draining the Swamp' and 'Let's Make America Great Again'. These were much more powerful persuasion messages.\" --------------- DID HILLARY HAVE A CHANCE? How could Hillary have fought better using her own persuasion techniques? \"Hillary was running a strong persuasion game in the summer,\" Scott told me. \"She might even have won if she stuck with it.\" \" 'Dangerous Donald' was scary for people. But then her campaign leaked the Billy Bush video and even though it caused Trump to dip in the polls, it wasn't as bad as portraying him as a madman at the nuclear controls. Ironically, that bad news actually helped Trump.\" ---- My podcast with Scott comes out later today. I wanted to learn other things from him. Like how can I, or anyone, learn these persuasion techniques. What are the easiest techniques to learn? He told me on the podcast. Plus he was very honest and told me a trick he uses with the women he dates. ---- Does any of this mean Trump is going to be good or bad? This article isn't about that. It's just about what Trump, and all political candidates, do to win elections. Trump, according to Scott, was just particularly good at it. \"The best I've ever seen\". ---- Is it bad that people are irrational? That facts don't matter? Yes. But it's the reality. Our brains were built to hunt for food in scary and uncertain situations. In our more complex society, we still respond to primitive emotions even if they are now irrational. Do I want to be better at persuading so my life is better? Of course. The reality is: I'm easily influenced and have to constantly remind myself everyone has an agenda all the time. I don't think it matters who is President. There are too many forces at work to check and balance everything. But it does matter how I react, how I build my life day by day. It's my choice (I hope) whether or not I have a good impact on others. Or not. Maybe Scott hypnotized me into writing this. In which case, he did an excellent job. ------- Scott Adams Persuasion Books List: (this is from his blog) Chapter 1 - Things You Can Stop Believing The first chapter is designed to make you skeptical about your ability to comprehend reality.

And some woman, very nice person, was saying \u2018Oh I love going skiing with the whole family. It\u2019s a great vacation.\u2019\u201d Gretchen said it seemed great. But skiing doesn\u2019t appeal to her. At all. \u201cI love the fact that my husband has a knee injury so I never feel like we have to go skiing.\u201d The woman tried convincing her. She said it\u2019s a beautiful adventure, great for the whole family and everything else. \u201cTwenty minutes later she came back to me with this absolutely stricken expression on her face. And she said, \u2018I just realized I don\u2019t like skiing either\u2026\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s an easy, two-step formula for being happier: Step 1: Do less of what you don\u2019t like doing Make a list: 10 things you do but don\u2019t like doing. (Unless you don\u2019t like lists\u2026) Step 2: Do more of what you like doing Come up with all the things you daydream about. What have you always wanted to try but never had time for? BAM! Now you have time. And you\u2019re you.  C) Use envy  Gretchen was looking through a magazine from her college. She read about the other lawyers. And felt mildly interested. Then she saw people with writing jobs. \u201cI felt sick with envy,\u201d she said. \u201cEnvy is painful, but it\u2019s a very helpful emotion for a happy life. It\u2019s a giant red arrow sign standing over someone\u2019s head saying, \u2018They\u2019ve got something you want.\u2019\u201d I\u2019ve learned there are three types of self-help books. One is you\u2019re telling people what to do. The other is scientists are telling people what to do and the third is you\u2019re telling people what you did. I\u2019ve interviewed hundreds of people. I always ask how they knew what to do next. And how they knew where to find joy... But that's the myth of happiness. It's not knowable. It's not one idea.", "duration": "01:10:16", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-199-GretchenRubin-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1482253200, "title": "Ep. 198 - Dan Ariely: Where A True, Deep Sense of Accomplishment Comes From", "author": "", "summary": "Dan Ariely was burned all over his body.

I had a full time job. I was trying to run a business on the side. I was pitching two TV shows. And I was obsessively playing chess day and night and traveling to tournaments. And nothing was going well. My attention was scattered. I was unhappy. I felt stuck. One time I was talking to one of the partners in my side business, Randy Weiner. I said to him, \"I'm reading this fascinating book about chess endgames\". He said, \"I don't care about that! Why are you even looking at those books? Chess is a game for kids. You should be working at this business full-time.\" The next day I quit my job. I joined the business full time. I never played in another chess tournament ever again. I stopped pitching TV shows. I went from being an amateur to being a pro. Which is why I'm glad the other day I spoke to Steven Pressfield, author of \"Turning Pro\", \"The War of Art\", \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\", \"Do the Work\", and more than a dozen other great books and novels. Sometimes it seemed like each new low was lower. And often the highs were higher. But I haven't had a job since. Ever since I made the decision to turn pro, I've been free. It took me two years of asking before Steven finally agreed to do the podcast. I've read all his books twice. But I was still scared to death right before the podcast. Steven and I spoke for two hours about turning pro, writing, how to improve, how to achieve peak performance in any field of life. I wanted to ask questions nobody else would ask him. Two hours later I feel good about it. The podcast is coming out later today. Here is some of what we spoke about: - HOW TO DEAL WITH THE DEMONS When I join a gym, I go until I stop going. Then it basically teeters off. I'm an amateur at going to the gym. Every single day I write. If I don't do it for two days in a row I feel physically sick. But so many times I feel bad about what I am working on. Or I feel unsure if I should work on the next book. or try the next new idea. The demons come up. I get blocked. I get frustrated or scared. Will I be a failure? Have I run out of ideas? Steven wrote several books about these very demons. Steven said, \"those thoughts are 'the Resistance'. \"Every time you want to go from a lower level to a higher level - becoming an entrepreneur., get in better shape, meditate, be an artist - the Resistance will ALWAYS attack. Every writer or entrepreneur feels the Resistance every day.\" Recognize each thought as it comes up, he said. Identify the thoughts that are the resistance. Say, 'that's the resistance\". \"There's no way to get rid of The Resistance. Be aware of it. Say to yourself, these thoughts won't help me achieve my dreams.\" - KEEP THE EGO OUT A friend of mine started a company once. It was clearly a bad idea. But he thought it was a homerun. This is a cognitive bias. We tend to believe that if we pour our heart and soul into someone (our personal \"investment\") then it's a good idea. When I do something I have to constantly stop and ask if I'm smoking my own crack. One time I made a website I thought was brilliant. It had an IQ test on it. And it was a dating site. And it would tell you if you were smart or stupid and you can then date people and know their intelligence. I thought it was brilliant! My six year old daughter told me, \"Isn't this kind of mean?\" My daughter refused to light my crack pipe. Steven told me he had to make sure with his most recent novel, the autobiographical \"The Knowledge\" that he had to keep his ego out of it. \"I had to put some distance between myself and the writing because it was about my early struggles as a writer.\" - EVEN A PORN DIRECTOR CAN BE A MENTOR: Steven told me about how he switched from writing bad novels to going into screenwriting, to finally getting back to writing novels. It's important to keep switching around, to pursue every angle of an interest. To take away a lesson from every area. Along the way he met a director of porn movies that wanted Steven to write some scenes. \"He told me two things: A) don't make a sex scene just about having sex. Make sure it advances the story. Like the detective is having sex with someone and spots a clue. B) Always have something else happening so they can cut back and forth. Like a wife is cheating with the carpenter but the husband is coming home and she doesn't realize and the camera cuts back and forth. That took me to a new level in my fiction writing.\" The porn director was a mini-mentor. Other writers he admired were virtual mentors. Editors, agents, other directors and writers also became mentors. Learn from everyone. - FEAR OF SUCCESS IS REAL I said, \"I don't believe that 'fear of success' is a thing. Is it?\" Steven said, \"Absolutely. In fact, maybe it's the biggest fear people have that prevents them from turning pro. \"To be successful you have to give up a lot. There's a lot of sacrifice. You are tied to what you dedicate yourself to, and you have to get better and better at it. There's no stopping.\" \"What did you sacrifice?\" \"Everything,\" he said. \"I write every day. I will write until the day I die.\" I asked him again what he had sacrificed. We were sitting in his home where he lives on his own. He looked out past me, looking out at the amazing views of the Pacific Ocean. \"Everything.\" - EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE THE HERO IN THEIR STORY \"The arc of the hero\" is a structure that is at the heart of every story,\" Steven told me. \"But it's also the arc of your own personal story. Pay attention to it in your life.\" The 'arc of the hero' is from work by Joseph Campbell and, earlier, from Jung, that is the primal structure of almost every story. It's the arc of Harry Potter, Star Wars, the story of Jesus, and every great story you can think of. \"If someone is sitting in their office, wondering how to make use of the potential they know they have, this is their arc also.\" - the hero is feeling stuck, but feels he/she has a destiny - there is a call to action. An opportunity to become better and enter a new world. - a mentor (real or virtual) appears to help the hero enter the new world once he chooses to do so. - the hero meets new allies and even enemies. - problems get worse and worse until all seems lost - the hero gets what he wants - and, finally, the hero has to return home, a changed person, but this return home is also beset with challenges. We enjoy movies and stories best when they have this structure. But our lives are also stories. Make sure you become the hero of your story. You can have many stories in your life, not just one. We all feel stuck or frustrated at some point. Find a destiny, find mentors, meet your new friends, confront the obstacles, return home a changed person. Repeat. Now you are the pro. Now you are the hero.", "duration": "01:06:30", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-197-StevenPressfield-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1481206822, "title": "[Bonus] - Tim Ferriss: [Part 2] Where Are You Not Replaceable?", "author": "", "summary": "I was very late and I was very upset at myself. I had flown three thousand miles. I moved into an Airbnb right next to where Tim was staying. I had written thousands of notes on ripped pieces of paper and stuck them all throughout the book. I had notes written up and around all the margins. I listened to dozens of his podcasts. And I've known him for years. All morning I had jotted down possible questions. And I was late to meet Tim for our podcast. Because the west coast is three hours a way in time travel from the east coast. That's how stupid I am. I rushed over and he was waiting. Tim follows his own advice. He was relaxed. No problems. I apologized, we spoke for awhile, and then started the podcast. Three hours later...not even close to done but we stopped. I want to be a better person in life. I want to be healthier. I want to be more creative. I want to find what is hidden inside of me, dig around, unleash it. I want to find the strength to do that. It's not an easy to thing to do. To scrape the dirt and dust that collects inside of ourselves. To explore. To wander. To create. Tim's book, \"Tools of the Titans\" is a guidebook for doing the above. And I had a lot of questions. ---- A few months after I started my podcast in 2014, Tim wrote me and said, \"Can I call you and ask you some questions about podcasting\". I said sure and he called and we talked for quite awhile. He called many podcasters during this period. Then he started his own podcast. He DOMINATED. All of his guests were amazing. He told me he was getting so much great advice from his guests it was overwhelming. The aftermath of a hailstorm where everything is just glowing and even the air you breathe seems cleansed. But that lasts only a short time until the atmosphere is filled with the everyday pollution of life. So he took a month off, re-listened to all his podcasts, and just for his own use he wrote down the advice he was hearing. \"But it was too much,\" he told me. \"I kept writing. It was clearly a book.\" It's not like any other book he's written. He steps out of the way in many cases, and let's these super-achievers do the talking. He curates their thoughts. They had found the hidden gems inside themselves, and long ago brought them up to share with the world to achieve their successes, and now they documented them with Tim. That's why I flew 3000 miles. I wanted the gems. I wanted answers. ---- I've had so many ups and downs I try to quantify what works on the way up. What goes wrong on the way down. I try to quantify: what are the steps for reinvention? I wonder: what makes someone break out of mediocrity? About seven months ago I threw out all of my belongings. I gave away or donated to the library about 3000 books. All of my books now are on my kindle. None of the answers were in my things. But now I have one physical book. Tim's. And I plan to keep it. Here are ten things (among many) I learned from the book and from our podcast: \"ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP\" I'm impressed how Tim did his work before starting a podcast. Starting something new is not about taking risks. Jumping into the unknown, getting out of the comfort zone, doing something scary. It's not about bravery. It's the exact opposite. You can only do so many \"new\" things in life. So do the work beforehand. He called people up. He learned the craft as much as he could. He talked to people ranging from me to people at Apple. He had initial guests lined up. He had a huge launch. And he told me the other day that he is persistent at getting his guests. One recent guest, he told me, took two years to book. Which was refreshing for me to hear since it often takes me that long or longer to book many guests. Comedian Whitney Cummings told him: \"My work is not done on the night of a big standup special. My work was done three months ago. All I have do is show up.\" Even though I was late for our podcast, I'm glad I showed up. - DOING IS EVERYTHING Derek Sivers told him, \"If all we needed was more information, then everyone would be a billionaire with perfect abs.\" It's the DOING that's difficult. I asked Tim: \"there's 700 pages of advice here. How can anyone follow everything? How do you know what will work for you?\" Just pick a few things. Pick what resonates with you. Start slowly. It doesn't matter what you do. Just start DO-ing. Dan Ariely once told me something similar. \"If you say sorry to someone, even if you don't mean it, even if THEY KNOW you don't mean it, then you still have a better relationship with them a year later compared with people who never say sorry.\" DOING > THINKING. - BLEED From Morgan Spurlock, the director of \"Supersize Me\" and many other great documentaries. \"Don't be afraid to show your scars\". This is not a book about suicide. But Tim shares the time he was considering it. This is not a book about anxiety or depression. But Tim shares his battles with those demons. This book is not just a book of advice, it's a book of Tim's own journey as he tries to make his life better. In the section with Tony Robbins, Tony talks about how he wakes up every morning and writes about what he is anxious about. I find this is very helpful. Instead of complaining to the outside world, you reveal to your inside world what it is you are scared of. When I was talking to Susan David in another podcast, she told me how if you write down your vulnerabilities just ONCE for 20 minutes, then even up to six months later the experimental group showed less signs of stress than the control group. Be vulnerable, write down three anxieties a day. I can't be true to others if I'm not true to myself. - MORNING PAGES Julia Cameron writes about this in the classic book, \"The Artists Way\". Brian Koppelman, writer of Rounders, Ocean's 13, Billions, etc swears by this technique for increasing his creativity. Many of Tim's guests say the same thing. What are morning pages? Sit down in the morning, write in longhand three pages of garbage without stopping. This uncages the anxious \"monkey mind\" and puts it on the page. It unleashes any writer's block because you have permission to write total nonsense. It frees the mind for the creativity it needs to do that day. - THE DOUBLE THREAT GUIDE TO BEING SUCCESSFUL When Tim spoke to Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, Scott told him: \"I always advise young people to become good public speakers\". Anyone can do that, he says, with practice. \"Suddenly you're in charge or maybe you are starting your own company. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable.\" If you are good at public speaking and one other skill, you make yourself more rare and valuable. Before Warren Buffett made one dime of money, he took a Dale Carnegie course on public speaking. After that, he made a dime of money. Or two. - DON'T BE AFRAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO Dan Carlin, host of the super-podcast \"Hardcore History\" told Tim this. Dan was not a historian, didn't have a PhD, but was fascinated by history. His mother(!) told him, \"why don't you do a podcast about the stories you tell here at the dinner table.\" He told his mother, but I don't have a doctorate.\" His mother said, \"I didn't realize you had to have a doctorate to tell stories\". And now he has the most popular history-based podcast on the planet. Kamal Ravikant, a past and future guest on my own podcast, told Tim, \"If I only did things I was qualified for I'd be pushing a broom somewhere.\" Schools, corporations, government, parents, friends, want to put you in their own boxes. They have a menu for you, with only very limited choices today. But if you don't choose your own themes in life, then someone else will do the choosing for you and the results won't be as good. - THE THOUSAND TRUE FAN THEORY....EXPANDED Kevin Kelly tells tim, \"Success need not be complicated. Just start with making 1000 people extremely extremely happy,\" Three ideas from this: Kevin's idea is that if they are true super fans, you will be able to build a product, charge for it, and they will pay, making you a living. Build a product that makes their lives better. Second idea: Have direct contact with your fans. This gets rid of all the middlemen and turns your relationships into a tribe. Third idea: Not every fan is a super fan. But the super fans will help you communicate with the other people who would be receptive to your message. The key here being: have an important and unique message. One that helps people. One that is a vision that people can believe in. Start small. Focus on the people who really care about what you are doing. As Seth Godin even says, \"Find Ten\" if you have to. Because if t's a good idea then ten will tell ten who will tell ten. Book recommendation from this chapter: \"Small Giants\" by Bo Burlingham, about companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest. - ASK DUMB QUESTIONS This is a common theme throughout the book. Tony Robbins tells Tim, \"We are the quality of the questions we ask.\" And both Alex Blumberg (super podcaster) and Malcolm Gladwell talk about the importance of asking dumb questions. People sometimes criticize me for interrupting guests on my podcasts. I get it. But the reality is: if I don't understand something during the podcast, then when else will I get the chance to understand. Alex Blumberg gives some good ways to start dumb questions: \"Tell me about a time when...\" \"Tell me about the day when...\" \"What were the exact steps that got you to....\" \"Describe the conversation when...\" And then with a follow up to any answer like, \"How did that make you feel?\" -- NO COMPLAINING Tracey DiNunzio told Tim a great line which I underlined twice in the book: \"When you complain, NOBODY wants to help you\": If you only focus what is wrong, then you will bring the people around you down. Be a source of growth for the people around you, so that they can become a source of growth for you. It's the \"Honda\" theory. If you just bought a Honda, you will suddenly see Hondas all over the road. If all you do is complain, you will only see the scarcity everywhere. And the abundance will leave you in the dust. - DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL THE SELF-HELP BOOKS This is not quite what was said, but this is my personal takeaway. BJ Novak, a writer from \"The Office\" for it's entire run and a successful comedian told Tim, \"I read the book Daily Rituals and I am demoralized by how many great people start their day early.\" Instead, BJ spends several hours getting in a good mood. Walking, playing, fooling around, reading newspapers, etc. Getting in a good mood was the surest way to get creative ideas. He takes his own path. BJ's podcast recommendation: \"Intelligence Squared\". Oh! VERY important lesson from Novak. I'm always stressed that I need to publish every day. I even asked Ice T once: if you stopped doing things, how long would it take for people to forget about you? And he scared me when he answered almost immediately, \"Six months\". But Novak's advice to Tim was the opposite: \"Take as long as you want if you're talented. You'll get their attention again if you have reason to.\" BOOM! - SAYING NO This came up as a theme in many of Tim's podcasts (including one with me about my book, \"The Power of No\"). When you are young and getting started, say \"Yes\" to anything. Tim was talking to super-investor Chris Sacca who said, \"I'd even show up at meetings where I wasn't invited.\" But ultimately, so many \"inbound\" requests come in for your time you have to say \"no\" to almost all of it. Tim says: \"3 to 4 mornings per week I am in \"maker\" mode until at least 1pm\" - creativity without allowing for ANY interruptions. - \"WISDOM IS ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN ADVICE\" Sam Harris (a prior guest on my podcast as well) told Tim this. I strongly believe this. For a few years I was writing about my \"daily practice\" that I had used many times when things were at their worst for me. Then in 2015, two really difficult things happened to me. One financial and one in my relationships. Right away I said to myself, \"Ok, let's see if this still works\". And every night I would check the boxes: Did I improve 1% today physically,, emotionally, mentally, spiritually. Without this, I think I would have died or spun into massive depression both times. I followed my own advice. If you can't do this, then no advice will work. Advice is autobiography. ---- After the podcast was over, Tim and I spoke for awhile. He gave me advice about my podcast. He gave me advice about my next book. He told me some of the things that didn't make it into the book. Tim strives to increase his creativity. To experiment with new ideas, new formats, new ways to apply his creativity. \"Try things as an experiment. Always give yourself an out. Then when something works, double down.\" I left his place and it was dark. I had spent the past week doing nothing but reading his book and preparing. The last thing Tim suggested, \"Think about what advice your future self would give you right now.\" I thought about it. I went home. Had dinner. Thought more. This is what my 60 year old self should say if he could advise me right now: Care deeply about the work you do today. The future will take care of itself. Oh and, \"Don't be late.\"", "duration": "01:19:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-19620Bonus-TimFerriss-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1481043600, "title": "Ep. 196 - Tim Ferriss: [Part 1] Becoming a Titan & Overcoming Your Worst Weakness", "author": "", "summary": "I was very late and I was very upset at myself.

It was clearly a book.\" It's not like any other book he's written. He steps out of the way in many cases, and let's these super-achievers do the talking. He curates their thoughts. They had found the hidden gems inside themselves, and long ago brought them up to share with the world to achieve their successes, and now they documented them with Tim. That's why I flew 3000 miles. I wanted the gems. I wanted answers. ---- I've had so many ups and downs I try to quantify what works on the way up. What goes wrong on the way down. I try to quantify: what are the steps for reinvention? I wonder: what makes someone break out of mediocrity? About seven months ago I threw out all of my belongings. I gave away or donated to the library about 3000 books. All of my books now are on my kindle. None of the answers were in my things. But now I have one physical book. Tim's. And I plan to keep it. Here are ten things (among many) I learned from the book and from our podcast: \"ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP\" I'm impressed how Tim did his work before starting a podcast. Starting something new is not about taking risks. Jumping into the unknown, getting out of the comfort zone, doing something scary. It's not about bravery. It's the exact opposite. You can only do so many \"new\" things in life. So do the work beforehand. He called people up. He learned the craft as much as he could. He talked to people ranging from me to people at Apple. He had initial guests lined up. He had a huge launch. And he told me the other day that he is persistent at getting his guests. One recent guest, he told me, took two years to book. Which was refreshing for me to hear since it often takes me that long or longer to book many guests. Comedian Whitney Cummings told him: \"My work is not done on the night of a big standup special. My work was done three months ago. All I have do is show up.\" Even though I was late for our podcast, I'm glad I showed up. - DOING IS EVERYTHING Derek Sivers told him, \"If all we needed was more information, then everyone would be a billionaire with perfect abs.\" It's the DOING that's difficult. I asked Tim: \"there's 700 pages of advice here. How can anyone follow everything? How do you know what will work for you?\" Just pick a few things. Pick what resonates with you. Start slowly. It doesn't matter what you do. Just start DO-ing. Dan Ariely once told me something similar. \"If you say sorry to someone, even if you don't mean it, even if THEY KNOW you don't mean it, then you still have a better relationship with them a year later compared with people who never say sorry.\" DOING > THINKING. - BLEED From Morgan Spurlock, the director of \"Supersize Me\" and many other great documentaries. \"Don't be afraid to show your scars\". This is not a book about suicide. But Tim shares the time he was considering it. This is not a book about anxiety or depression. But Tim shares his battles with those demons. This book is not just a book of advice, it's a book of Tim's own journey as he tries to make his life better. In the section with Tony Robbins, Tony talks about how he wakes up every morning and writes about what he is anxious about. I find this is very helpful. Instead of complaining to the outside world, you reveal to your inside world what it is you are scared of. When I was talking to Susan David in another podcast, she told me how if you write down your vulnerabilities just ONCE for 20 minutes, then even up to six months later the experimental group showed less signs of stress than the control group. Be vulnerable, write down three anxieties a day. I can't be true to others if I'm not true to myself. - MORNING PAGES Julia Cameron writes about this in the classic book, \"The Artists Way\". Brian Koppelman, writer of Rounders, Ocean's 13, Billions, etc swears by this technique for increasing his creativity. Many of Tim's guests say the same thing. What are morning pages? Sit down in the morning, write in longhand three pages of garbage without stopping. This uncages the anxious \"monkey mind\" and puts it on the page. It unleashes any writer's block because you have permission to write total nonsense. It frees the mind for the creativity it needs to do that day. - THE DOUBLE THREAT GUIDE TO BEING SUCCESSFUL When Tim spoke to Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, Scott told him: \"I always advise young people to become good public speakers\". Anyone can do that, he says, with practice. \"Suddenly you're in charge or maybe you are starting your own company. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable.\" If you are good at public speaking and one other skill, you make yourself more rare and valuable. Before Warren Buffett made one dime of money, he took a Dale Carnegie course on public speaking. After that, he made a dime of money. Or two. - DON'T BE AFRAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO Dan Carlin, host of the super-podcast \"Hardcore History\" told Tim this. Dan was not a historian, didn't have a PhD, but was fascinated by history. His mother(!) told him, \"why don't you do a podcast about the stories you tell here at the dinner table.\" He told his mother, but I don't have a doctorate.\" His mother said, \"I didn't realize you had to have a doctorate to tell stories\". And now he has the most popular history-based podcast on the planet. Kamal Ravikant, a past and future guest on my own podcast, told Tim, \"If I only did things I was qualified for I'd be pushing a broom somewhere.\" Schools, corporations, government, parents, friends, want to put you in their own boxes. They have a menu for you, with only very limited choices today. But if you don't choose your own themes in life, then someone else will do the choosing for you and the results won't be as good. - THE THOUSAND TRUE FAN THEORY....EXPANDED Kevin Kelly tells tim, \"Success need not be complicated. Just start with making 1000 people extremely extremely happy,\" Three ideas from this: Kevin's idea is that if they are true super fans, you will be able to build a product, charge for it, and they will pay, making you a living. Build a product that makes their lives better. Second idea: Have direct contact with your fans. This gets rid of all the middlemen and turns your relationships into a tribe. Third idea: Not every fan is a super fan. But the super fans will help you communicate with the other people who would be receptive to your message. The key here being: have an important and unique message. One that helps people. One that is a vision that people can believe in. Start small. Focus on the people who really care about what you are doing. As Seth Godin even says, \"Find Ten\" if you have to. Because if t's a good idea then ten will tell ten who will tell ten. Book recommendation from this chapter: \"Small Giants\" by Bo Burlingham, about companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest. - ASK DUMB QUESTIONS This is a common theme throughout the book. Tony Robbins tells Tim, \"We are the quality of the questions we ask.\" And both Alex Blumberg (super podcaster) and Malcolm Gladwell talk about the importance of asking dumb questions. People sometimes criticize me for interrupting guests on my podcasts. I get it. But the reality is: if I don't understand something during the podcast, then when else will I get the chance to understand. Alex Blumberg gives some good ways to start dumb questions: \"Tell me about a time when...\" \"Tell me about the day when...\" \"What were the exact steps that got you to....\" \"Describe the conversation when...\" And then with a follow up to any answer like, \"How did that make you feel?\" -- NO COMPLAINING Tracey DiNunzio told Tim a great line which I underlined twice in the book: \"When you complain, NOBODY wants to help you\": If you only focus what is wrong, then you will bring the people around you down. Be a source of growth for the people around you, so that they can become a source of growth for you. It's the \"Honda\" theory. If you just bought a Honda, you will suddenly see Hondas all over the road. If all you do is complain, you will only see the scarcity everywhere. And the abundance will leave you in the dust. - DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL THE SELF-HELP BOOKS This is not quite what was said, but this is my personal takeaway. BJ Novak, a writer from \"The Office\" for it's entire run and a successful comedian told Tim, \"I read the book Daily Rituals and I am demoralized by how many great people start their day early.\" Instead, BJ spends several hours getting in a good mood. Walking, playing, fooling around, reading newspapers, etc. Getting in a good mood was the surest way to get creative ideas. He takes his own path. BJ's podcast recommendation: \"Intelligence Squared\". Oh! VERY important lesson from Novak. I'm always stressed that I need to publish every day. I even asked Ice T once: if you stopped doing things, how long would it take for people to forget about you? And he scared me when he answered almost immediately, \"Six months\". But Novak's advice to Tim was the opposite: \"Take as long as you want if you're talented. You'll get their attention again if you have reason to.\" BOOM! - SAYING NO This came up as a theme in many of Tim's podcasts (including one with me about my book, \"The Power of No\"). When you are young and getting started, say \"Yes\" to anything. Tim was talking to super-investor Chris Sacca who said, \"I'd even show up at meetings where I wasn't invited.\" But ultimately, so many \"inbound\" requests come in for your time you have to say \"no\" to almost all of it. Tim says: \"3 to 4 mornings per week I am in \"maker\" mode until at least 1pm\" - creativity without allowing for ANY interruptions. - \"WISDOM IS ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN ADVICE\" Sam Harris (a prior guest on my podcast as well) told Tim this. I strongly believe this. For a few years I was writing about my \"daily practice\" that I had used many times when things were at their worst for me. Then in 2015, two really difficult things happened to me. One financial and one in my relationships. Right away I said to myself, \"Ok, let's see if this still works\". And every night I would check the boxes: Did I improve 1% today physically,, emotionally, mentally, spiritually. Without this, I think I would have died or spun into massive depression both times. I followed my own advice. If you can't do this, then no advice will work. Advice is autobiography. ---- After the podcast was over, Tim and I spoke for awhile. He gave me advice about my podcast. He gave me advice about my next book. He told me some of the things that didn't make it into the book. Tim strives to increase his creativity. To experiment with new ideas, new formats, new ways to apply his creativity. \"Try things as an experiment. Always give yourself an out. Then when something works, double down.\" I left his place and it was dark. I had spent the past week doing nothing but reading his book and preparing. The last thing Tim suggested, \"Think about what advice your future self would give you right now.\" I thought about it. I went home. Had dinner. Thought more. This is what my 60 year old self should say if he could advise me right now: Care deeply about the work you do today. The future will take care of itself. Oh and, \"Don't be late.\"", "duration": "01:22:01", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-196-TimFerriss-v02-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1480438800, "title": "Ep. 195 - Joshua Foer: The Explorer's Code", "author": "", "summary": "The Explorer\u2019s Code:\u00a0 I wanted to wake each morning, not anxious about my day anymore. Not worried about what so-and-so would say, or where my career was going, or what was I going to write today. My only job each day is to explore something new. So I called up Josh and asked him how I could be an explorer. He told me. - Have A Mission Every day, whether it\u2019s \u201cbe creative today.\u201d Or \u201cgo some place you\u2019ve never been\u201d or \u201ctalk to ten random strangers\u201d, make a mission. Learn something new. Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON\u2019T. -Uncomfortable Situation Try to put yourself in as many uncomfortable situations as possible. \u201cFor instance,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should apply for a temp job. See what it\u2019s like.\u201d Or maybe one day you and a friend can make a bet: who can get the furthest out of town with just $100. The uncomfortable zone is where you find out who you are, the comfort zone is where you sleep. Task: make a list of uncomfortable situations. Stretch the idea muscle. -Partners/Team Josh has 100s of people who submit items to Atlas Obscura and atlasobscura.com. \u201cThere\u2019s over 10,000 weird and obscure places on there now.\u201d He also started it with two partners. Even superheroes need a team. Superman still needed the Justice League. Luke Skywalker still needed Han Solo and Princess Leia. Luke Cage needs Iron Fist and Jessica Jones. Who are on your team? Are they good people? Do you each have your super power? I am constantly looking for my team of fellow explorers. \u201cTry to experience wonder every day,\u201d Josh told me. A few months ago, my mission was to throw out everything I owned.\u00a0 What would it be like after 40 years of collecting things, to own absolutely nothing. And a few months before that, my mission was to track down someone who had disappeared from my life. I failed at that mission. But I experienced wonder along the way.

That's the name of Seth Godin's next book. He only printed 5,500 copies. And he's not printing anymore. He doesn't just view a book as pages surrounded by two covers. He makes a 3-dimensional object that's beautiful to look at and read. \"It's not new,\u201d he said on my podcast. \u201cIt's the best of the last four years of my work. And it's illustrated with hundreds of photos by Thomas Hawk, who's the most prolific and talented internet photographer.\" The book weighs 18 pounds. And it's 800 pages long. I asked him about art and marketing... and he told me about life. A) START FROM THE BEGINNING \"No business, no project, no novel ever started big,\" Seth said. It started with fear, uncertainty, excitement, possibility. Tons of \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d that lead to real action. And real action halts the what if\u2019s. The what if\u2019s turn to what is. Seth said, \u201cInstead of saying, 'I need to leap to the middle,' say, 'I'm going to start with people who want to engage with me.'\" All successes start with one person. That's it. One person, then two, then three. Success is a curve. We all know it. Don't try to cheat the curve. B) KNOW YOUR WORLD I asked Seth, \"How do you know what the world wants to hear?\" \"Well, first of all,\u201d he said, \u201cnever the whole world. You pick your world.\" Where do you hurt? Where you do you feel a knot? Can you loosen it up and ease the pressure? Can you create something for the people who want to love what you want to love? C) WHAT DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO SAY? We talked about Facebook. And the Lays Potato Chip guy who re-designed the bag. His job was to make it sound crunchier. Kids had slamming competitions. Who could slam a soda the fastest? So Coke-A-Cola created a bottle with a mouthpiece meant to maximize chugging efficiency. They sold product. But it's the message that matters. I always say: message over money. Invention happens at the edges. Between heart and lungs, breath and vocal chords is the message. It's the thing you want to say. The thing you\u2019re afraid to say. \"What really matters isn't what time you posted on Facebook,\" Seth said. \"What matters is, what did you care enough to say? D) ANYONE CAN LEAD... \"\u2019Purple Cow' says, 'How do I sit in my office and make a thing that people talk about?'\" \"What 'Tribes' says is 'Now that anyone can stand up and lead (because anyone can have a media channel... because anyone can make connection) will you choose to lead? And if you're going to lead, who will you lead? How will you connect the people you're leading? That is marketing, but it's also life.\" E) CULTURE BEATS EVERYTHING \"No one has a Suzuki tattoo,\" Seth said. \"What's a Suzuki tattoo?\" I asked. Then I got it. Harley Davidson makes half their revenue licensing their brand. T-shirts, jackets, etc. \"If you're in the Harley tribe, you can't show up on a Suzuki,\" he said. \"Tribes aren't about the alpha to the omega. Leaders always go away. The alpha person dies or moves on. But the tribe doesn't. The tribe persists. Because culture beats everything. Scenes have a culture. Tribes have a culture. It's culture that determines how an organization make its choices, how a nation will evolve.\" I've said this before. It doesn't matter who the president is. What matters is who you surround yourself with. Who's in your tribe? Who's in your heart? And if they're toxic to your creativity or well-being, detox now. \"The Beatles didn't invent teenagers. I'm not saying we invent our tribe. We just show up to lead them.\" I didn't invent the choose yourself community. The cubicle job did. I'll never say what other people should do. I just say what I like to do. I say what gets me past just getting by. F) SHOW UP \u201cHalf my blog posts are below average,\u201d Seth said. I asked if he feels bad. Intellectually, I understand failure. But it still hurts. It can turn your life upside down. I lost everything more than once. And maybe you\u2019re reading this because you have to\u2026 or you're afraid of losing everything. \u201cI\u2019m talking about [creating] generous work with good intent... that didn\u2019t work.\u201d That\u2019s the failure we need to show up for. \u201cI show up,\u201d Seth said. G) DON'T WRESTLE WITH INFINITY I didn't know what that meant. \"I am almost done wrestling with infinity,\" he said. We had half an hour left in the interview. I didn't interrupt. I couldn't. I was captivated. My mind expands when I\u2019m seconds away from hearing someone\u2019s genius. My vision slows and the inside of my ears soften. It\u2019s like my body is creating room. \"I made the book I wanted.\" \"I only printed 5,500 copies of the book. And there's not going to be a second printing. That's all there is.\u201d He doesn't have to chase. He already broke even and the best part is he chose himself. \"Now there's not an infinity of upside.\" He didn't need approval from publishers, his boss, a network\u2026 He didn\u2019t write for a bestseller list. He was compelled. And he created. He made what he wanted to make. \u00a0 \"Here's my definition of art,\u201d he said. \u201cArt is when a human being does something that might not work...\" And my whole body nodded. He went on\u2026 changing my mind.", "duration": "01:02:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-194-SethGodin-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1479229200, "title": "Ep. 193 - Brian Koppelman: How to Deliver Every Single Time", "author": "", "summary": "Brian Koppelman and his wife Amy Koppelman saved my life. Many years after he ruined my life. First off: when he wrote the movie \u201cRounders\u201d I became obsessed with poker. I went to the same club he played at and played for 365 nights, including the night my first daughter was born (I was there for the birth though!) . \u00a0 I was an addict. But eventually I stopped in order to start another company. I wish I had never stopped because that other company cost me all of my money at the time. \u00a0 Then he wrote several of my favorite movies after that. I didn\u2019t even know it was the same director until the first time I interviewed him here. \u00a0 Now he is writing and producing my favorite TV show, \u201cBillions\u201d on Showtime. About an aggressive hedge fund billionaire going after an equally aggressive US Attorney played by Paul Giamatti. \u00a0 Brian has been on the podcast several times but there\u2019s always so much more to talk about in terms of creativity and inspiration and how to succeed as an artist / entrepreneur. \u00a0 Ditto for his wife Amy who has also been on this podcast and written three of my favorite novels. One of which was turned into a movie (\u201cI Smile Back\u201d) starring Sarah Silverman. \u00a0 But here is how they saved my life. \u00a0 Awhile back I had a personal emergency. Things were going haywire. \u00a0 Amy called me and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I told her. \u00a0 She had me take a photo of every meal I was eating (\u201cI want to make sure you are eating\u201d) and a photo of everyone I was eating with (\u201cI want to make sure you are around people\u201d) and had me write to her every day what was going on in my head (\u201cwrite!\u201d) \u00a0 That was one time. \u00a0 Another time: I lost millions of dollars in a half hour while I was on the set of \u201cBillions\u201d watching it be filmed. \u00a0 I was called into an emergency board meeting by phone and found out the company was going to be shut down. It was a disaster. \u00a0 But 90% of how we feel about a situation is determined by our choice of how we will react. Only 10% is based on the situation itself. \u00a0 And since I was on the set of my favorite TV show being filmed, I decided to enjoy myself. Brian later said to me, \u201cYou lost what!? We couldn\u2019t tell at all. You were making jokes, asking questions, and you were the last one to leave.\u201d \u00a0 I used being on the set of \u201cBillions\u201d to change my reaction to an otherwise horrible event. This allowed me to easily change my 90% reaction into a positive one. \u00a0 So not only is Brian a creative genius, but he\u2019s a good friend. \u00a0 I went up to his offices where they are writing season 2 of \u201cBillions\u201d and I had maybe 1,000 more questions about creativity, writing, the arc of his career, and of course, billions of dollars. \u00a0 But one thing stands out for me. \u00a0 Everyone always says, as if it were advice that has come down from heaven to all writers: \u201cWrite what you know\u201d. \u00a0 Brian doesn\u2019t agree with this. And this is the secret to his success. And the secret to all the great writers in history. \u00a0 Stephen King didn\u2019t know what it was like to be a bullied teenage girl with psychic powers when he wrote \u201cCarrie\u201d. \u00a0 Ernest Hemingway didn\u2019t know what it was like to be an old Cuban man who spent his life fishing. \u00a0 JK Rowling didn\u2019t know what it would be like to be a boy attending Hogwarts Wizardry School. \u00a0 Brian Koppelman told me: \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t write what you know, write what fascinates you.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 This is the key to all good art. \u00a0 In this podcast, we also talk about what it feels like to hit a dead-end. To be unsure how to move forward. To be scared that maybe the best was behind us. \u00a0 How do you move past that. Recreate yourself. Start the work again. Flourish. \u00a0 I ask.

He came over to play backgammon and I asked him about it. He told me he became a journalist because it was an easy way to start talking to people. He said, \"If I ask people to tell me something I don't know,\" then I often learn new things and it keeps the conversation going. My mind blew open. I'm tired of freezing up. Feeling too paralyzed to talk. I'm a shy introvert. This will help unfreeze me. For everyone I meet, I will try to learn something I don't know. I'll simply ask them. This will be my new habit. --- I listened to Dubner's first podcast of the new show. I learned something new from one member of the audience. First off, it's a hard podcast to create. Listen to it. There are three panelists. There's a fact-checker. And there's 100 people in the audience. I've never heard of a podcast like that. It's crazy to put that much work into a podcast! To be creative, go beyond what everyone else says is crazy. And to be crazy, go beyond what everyone else says is creative. Creativity is a lose-lose proposition. You're crazy and you're lost in the woods. But if you aren't creative, you're stuck in traffic with everyone else. Someone on the show said something I didn't know: when you sleep, the nerve cells in your brain constrict, allowing spinal fluids to wash right through and clean up the proteins that often attach to nerve cells in the brain to cause Alzheimers. I learned about five new things on that very first episode. I went to sleep that night in anticipation.

He was giving a speech, sat down, and the next thing\u2026\u00a0he was dead. They called an ambulance. They got paramedics. They did that thing. They brought him back to life. But his body didn\u2019t like living. He died again. Eight more times they used machines to convince the machine in his body that we call a heart, to come back to life. Please come back to life, the machines said to his heart. And finally his heart decided to stay. After that, things changed. Like they often do when we die at the age of 47. \u201cThere are three things,\u201d Chip Conley, now the head of hospitality for AirBnB, told me, \u201ca job, a career, and a calling.\u201d \u201cI had been building and running hotels for 20 years. It was my calling to be in the hospitality business. I built over 50 hotels. But it was starting to feel like a job.\u201d \u201cWhen I died, I realized I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I had to go back to my calling.\u201d Within a few years he had sold his business. He had nothing left to do. \u201cI had faith in my calling, though,\u201d Chip said. \u201cSomething would happen.\u201d And it did. It did.  Adam wrote me. He was my Airbnb host. I\u2019ve been in 4 different Airbnbs that Adam owns over the past three years. So we knew each other. I only live in Airbnbs and I know many of the regular hosts in New York City. \u201cI\u2019m having a special guest in the apartment right downstairs from you,\u201d Adam wrote me. \u201cHe\u2019s the head of all hospitality for Airbnb. Would you like to meet?\u2019 Yes, very much so. I had spent 90% of my life in Airbnbs over the prior three years and just about 100% in the prior year. In 2014 I even wrote an article, \u201c10 Ways to Improve Airbnb.\u201d Adam made the introduction. Chip Conley, the man who had died a few years earlier and sold his hotel business, responded. \u201cShould I bring a bottle of wine?\u201d he said. He came upstairs and we started to talk. \u201cBrian Chesky, the founder of Airbnb, called me and asked me if I wanted to be the head of hospitality. Airbnb was a tech company, it wasn\u2019t used to being a hospitality company.\u201d \u201cWhen I ran 50 hotels, hospitality was my main focus.\u201d \u201cFor each hotel, I had the hotel managers come up with five adjectives for what that hotel would be.\u201d \u201cMaybe the adjectives might be: funky, hip, modern, clean, rock & roll.\u201d \u201cEvery employee, even the housekeepers, would keep those adjectives in mind in whatever they did. And, if possible, we even made sure the five senses the customers would experience in the hotels would match the five adjectives.\u201d \u201cThis is a great idea,\u201d I said, \u201cYou can even apply ideas like this to writing a book. Or even building a career for yourself. What five adjectives do you want your life, or the objects you create, or your relationships, be used to describe it.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Chip said. So he went to Airbnb to start creating an atmosphere of hospitality among the hosts. He had found his way back to his life\u2019s calling. I had felt it. Since 2013, Now I live in them. Now they are home. All because Chip died.  \u201cHow do you find your life\u2019s calling?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWhat did you love doing when you were 6, 8, 10 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I had one friend who even at 6 was making mudpies as if they were real pies. Then she became a lawyer but was always unhappy.\u201d \u201cSo she quit being a lawyer and is now one of the biggest pastry chefs in the world.\u201d \u201cFor me, I was always pretending to run a restaurant in my house. I always wanted to be in the hospitality business.\u201d I thought back to when I was ten years old. I was writing short stories. And when I was 12 I even wrote an article in the newspaper interviewing politicians. You find your interests from back then and see how they age into the current day. \u201cFind the thing you did where you lost all sense of time while you are doing it,\u201d Chip told me. \u201cRemember the equation from Victor Frankl\u2019s \u2018Man\u2019s Search for Meaning\u2018,\u201d he said. \u201cDespair = Suffering \u2013 Meaning.\u201d \u201cFind the things that bring you meaning. Suffering is always there in this world. But if you have meaning, you will have less despair. \u201cYou will find your calling.\u201d Sometimes even now I find myself doing things where I feel more \u2018job\u2019 than \u2018calling\u2019. I try to adjust where I can but it can be difficult. I guess a little bit at a time and eventually you can move your life into that calling. I said to him. \u201cThis is too good. Do you mind if I record the conversation?\u201d He said, \u201cSure.\u201d So I did. I\u2019ve been recording conversations with people ever since I was ten years old.  When I was 26, he said, I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I found my first little motel and called it The Phoenix. \u201cI knew that whatever I did, I wanted to be creative and to have freedom. I tell everyone to write down the two most important qualities about their calling and check back with it over the years. \u201cEventually I felt like what I was doing was the opposite of creativity and freedom.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I had that experience of flatlining. That was my body\u2019s way of telling me I had to change. So I got rid of my hotels.\u201d \u201cWhat if you are sitting in a cubicle and listening to this and wondering how you can find that creativity and freedom for yourself \u2013 it all sounds good BUT \u2013 kids, responsibilities, age, etc. you feel are blocking you?\u201d \u201cThen get back to what you loved when you were younger. Start to brainstorm how you can bring that even a little bit into your life now. And a little bit more the next day. And so on.\u201d \u201cTry many things,\u201d he said, \u201cOne thing I realized is that quantity = quality. People think it\u2019s one or the other but it\u2019s not. When you have a lot of quantity of ideas and things you are trying, you will find quality.\u201d This reminded me of my approach to exercising my idea muscle. If you write down ten ideas a day, you have 3,650 ideas in a year. And maybe one or two will be good. I got excited about my ideas to improve Airbnb. I said, \u201cCan I show you the ideas?\u201d I had written the list in 2014 but maybe they would still apply. \u201cOf course!\u201d he said. We went through each one. For some of them he said, \u201cHold on! Wait for the announcement coming soon.\u201d We lost track of time while doing the interview and eventually he had to go. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI saw something about you a few weeks ago and thought you would be a great speaker for our event in November \u2013 the Airbnb Open.\u201d \u201cAnd then Adam told me yesterday, by coincidence, you were staying in the apartment right above me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d I said. \u201cI love it when serendipity happens,\u201d he said, as he was getting ready to go. \u201cYou have to speak at the conference.\u201d \u201cI will!\u201d After he left I thought about what I most wanted to do when I was a kid. I wanted to be a spy. On what? I don\u2019t know. I just wanted to look at other people and follow them without them knowing. To observe and learn all of their secrets and then report back to \u201cHQ\u201d. It would be a little dangerous, I always thought. But I would survive. And save the world. Bit by bit I\u2019m doing it.

I kept number six blank. \u201cJOKE\u201d was just a reminder to start this post with a joke from Jon Macks\u2026 \u201cIf you live in Florida, ya know, God\u2019s waiting room\u2026\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re Jewish, like me\u2026\u201d Those are just a few lines from my interview\u00a0with Jon Macks. He was the top writer for \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jay Leno. He wrote 100 jokes a day. That\u2019s half a million in 20 years. He\u2019s written jokes for President Obama, Bill Clinton, John Kerry and monologues for Steve Martin, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock\u2026 and wrote the book \u201cMonogluge: What Makes America Laugh Before Bed.\u201d But before comedy, Jon did political consulting. \u201cI realized I could do one thing 300 nights a year: politics or perform. And I chose politics.\u201d He somehow transitioned and reached the heights of a dream career in comedy. I wanted to know his secret. I also wanted to know how to be funny... 1.\u00a0Association Joke: I asked Jon how to run for Congress. \u201cAnti-Washington, anti-establishment is what\u2019s working right now,\u201d he said. I\u2019m not running for Congress. But, the night of this interview, I went to an open mic. So I ran some headlines by Jon. And he wrote jokes on the spot. Headline: \u201cTrump Refuses To Say He\u2019ll Accept Election Results\u201d Jon: \u201cThe Toronto Blue Jays lost yesterday. They\u2019re refusing to accept the fact that the Cleveland Indians are going to the world series.\u201d This is an association joke. You look at what else is happening. Then marry the two. 2. Rule of 3\u2019s: This is Billy Crystals joke: \u201cDonald Trump reminds me a lot of hurricane season. He starts out with a lot of hot air, spins out of control, by the first week of November he\u2019s completely gone.\u201d The rule of 3\u2019s is this: Set up your joke. Start with a fact or an idea. Then expand on the idea by listing three qualities. The third is usually unexpected. That\u2019s your punchline. 3. Look for the oddity Jon said, \u201cMost normal people\u2014and I put comics as \u2018not normal\u2019\u2014most normal people walk into a room and go, \u2018This looks like a great party.\u2019\u201d But a comic asks questions. \u201cWho shouldn\u2019t be here?\u201d \u201cWhy are they serving bacon cheeseburgers at a Jewish event?\u201d Go beyond business as usual. Look for the oddity\u2026 in contracts, your conversations, your habits. Try to find the light in life\u2019s eccentricities. Or the bull... in shit. 4.\u00a0Find \u201cyour kind of people\u201d and bring them together Every day, I practice what I call \u201cemotional health.\u201d I spend time with people who lift me up. And I try to lift them up, too. Not with words. But with interests. We hold space for each other. And leave room for the juice in our brain to squeeze out. It\u2019s a different kind of lemonade, but it\u2019s ours. And we like it. That\u2019s all that matters. Seinfeld calls comedians \u201chis type of people.\u201d As if they have different brains than everyone else. So I asked Jon, \u201cWhat is it? What is the comedian?\u201d He said, \u201cA comic will go on stage and either say something we haven\u2019t thought of, or something we all thought of in a way that is really unique, funny and brings us all together.\u201d 5. Move forward Jon was traveling about 250 nights a year doing campaigns. His third kid was just born. And he had a choice: be a dad or \u201cbe someone calling in once a week.\u201d Lots of people make this choice. Money is involved. Fulfillment is a factor. The stress of making the \u201cright\u201d versus the \u201cwrong\u201d decision. Jon went with his gut. \u201cI figured I\u2019d take a break from political consulting, and I never went back.\u201d He had a 13-week contract with Jay Leno. That turned into a lifetime\u2026 Before podcasting and writing, I worked on Wall Street. When everything crashed, I fed people chocolate. I wanted to bring people together. Maybe that\u2019s number six.", "duration": "01:03:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-190-JonMacks-v02-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1476806400, "title": "Ep. 189 - Chuck Klosterman: The Illusion of Luck vs Skill", "author": "", "summary": "I can\u2019t tell you the secret to selling half a million books. Or half a million anything\u2026 Every day, business changes, the world shifts on its axis and your skin peels off a little bit. New cells are generated and with each blink, your eyes are rehydrated. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, if there was some formula, I\u2019d do it again,\u201d he said. Without new experiences, your soul rots. And your book or product or whatever you\u2019re trying to get rich quick off of smells like garbage. But people will buy garbage. Because we want new experiences. Ask any child. They\u2019ll give you an honest answer of why they like coloring or skipping rope. \u201cI don\u2019t know... It\u2019s fun?\u201d People wonder what they love. Instead of loving to wonder. Chuck Klosterman grew up in a town of 500 people. He became the number one literary critique of pop culture\u2026 before the Internet. Now anyone can research anything. And you don\u2019t have to own the Encyclopedia Britannica. Or wait for the library to be open. A lot of people I\u2019ve interviewed say there\u2019s a big luck factor to success... \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s as true with you,\u201d I told Chuck. He doesn\u2019t believe in luck. \u201cThe biggest factor is chance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between chance and luck?\u201d Luck: \u201cLuck almost implies like a leprechaun is, sort of somebody is making this happen.\u201d \u201cIn many ways, it seems like certain people are luckier than others,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what that really means is that when they were given chances, they elected to pursue them, as opposed to step away from them. And that kind of creates the illusion of luck.\u201d Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. When I feel stuck, I don\u2019t create a new business overnight. I begin with a pen and a waiter\u2019s pad. I carve out a new perspective. I write 10 ideas. Whether the ideas are good doesn\u2019t matter. Reinvention, freedom and success are the results of movements. Not the \u201cright movements.\u201d Just movements. Unattached, meaningless movements that hopefully fill your day and fuel your heart. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve liked, I liked in totality,\u201d Chuck said. \u201cI wanted to almost be inside of it.\u201d Focus on nothing. Or everything. Let life reveal itself to you. Then you won\u2019t need luck. Because you\u2019ll have something much more valuable: perspective. Skill: When he started, Chuck needed motivation to write. Now he\u2019s a dad. And he writes every day. \u201cI make myself do it,\u201d he said. His first job was with the local newspaper in Fargo. He wrote a 16-page insert called \u201cRage,\u201d meant to address Generation X. \u201cAt the time, my hope was that, maybe, if I do a good job as a reporter and I put in the time, I\u2019d be able to publish a book, or maybe two books in my 50s or something.\u201d He thought he\u2019d work as a reporter who might have the ability or the luck or the chance... Chance: \u201cThere were 23 kids in my graduating class. I remember the teacher would ask questions. And nobody would say anything,\u201d Chuck said.But he knew the answers. He thought everyone knew. \u201cI just assumed everyone growing up felt this way\u2014everybody felt very singular and alone. You had this world inside your mind. And there was the world outside of yourself where you just kind of goofed around, talked to people, and made small talk, but in your mind you had your own kind of world.\u201d Then Chuck went to college. \u201cI was amazed to find a handful of people who were just like me, who listened to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce but also wanted to talk about it, and didn\u2019t just want to say, \u2018It rocked.\u2019\u201d Connection changes your mental identity from alone to alive. Chuck\u2019s second book, \u201cSex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs\u201d sold half a million copies\u2014more than his other eight books combined. \u201cThe only perspective I have is my own,\u201d Chuck said. \u201cThere is the conscious experience, then there is the unconscious experience. Some of those merge when I\u2019m writing.\u201d Mystery... Chuck\u2019s latest book asks a hypothetical question that no one will know the answer to for hundreds or thousands of years: \u201cBut What If We\u2019re Wrong?\u201d He explores art, music, science, physics, the nature of reality, and who will matter in the future. \u201cAristotle was one of the first people to have an idea about what gravity was. His idea was that rocks don\u2019t float because rocks want to be on the ground, that they have agency. They long to be on the ground because they want to be at the center of the universe, and, at the time, it was believed that Earth was the center of the universe.\u201d This was believed for roughly 2,000 years. Today\u2019s idea of gravity is from Isaac Newton. Nearly 1,600 years ago. So\u2026 What if we\u2019re wrong? About everything. Food, medicine, music, legacy\u2026 My idea of a life well lived could (and probably will) be untrue in 100 years or 10 years. That\u2019s scary. Or not.

They say you need to see/hear something at least seven times to remember it. I don\u2019t know who said that. I wish I could say it was Ogilvy. I\u2019ve talked about idea sex 100 times. Here\u2019s 101. Good ideas are like babies. Each one is new to the world. (Unless we\u2019re living in \u201cThe Matrix\u201d\u2026 skip to [23:00] for this part of the interview\u2026 Even Elon Musk has thought about the likelihood of \u201creality\u201d actually being \u201cbase reality.\u201d The chances are \u201cone in billions,\u201d he said.)

People yell when they want you to listen. But if you eliminate their reward (being heard), then they have to comply. And you\u2019ll never get yelled at again. \u00a02.\u00a0Push past threats: \u201cPeople who make threats always leave themselves an out,\u201d Chris said. But the truth is they need you. If you\u2019re not talking, there\u2019s no deal. They could lose out on a sale, a new employee, or millions of dollars. \u00a0 \u201cThe point of a negotiation is to find out how much money is on the table,\u201d Chris said. \u201cYou have to push the other side as far as they\u2019ll go\u2026 without insulting them.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a03.\u00a0Gain the upper hand 100% of the time: \u00a0 \u201cYou can gain the upper hand by giving respect first,\u201d Chris said. \u00a0 Which a lot of people are afraid to do... \u00a0 \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly why you gain the upper hand,\u201d Chris said. \u00a0 \u00a04.\u00a0Become less busy: \u00a0 Rest is the new hustle. \u00a0 \u201cAnytime you slow down to do things more deliberately, you save time.\u201d Chris calls this, \u201cThe delay that saves time.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a05.\u00a0Show fearlessness \u00a0 Fear can be useful. But not in a negotiation. \u201cShowing fearlessness is a great way to inspire confidence in you from the other side,\u201d Chris said. \u00a0 Forget what you have to lose. And focus on the reward. \u00a0 \u00a0 I can\u2019t afford to lose all my money again.

Jewel was broke and millions in debt after selling 30,000,000 albums, and built back from scratch when she was 30.  Jewel has switched genres, written music from folk to pop to country to even children\u2019s music. She wrote a children\u2019s book. I love Jewel. Abused from the ages of 5 to 15. Moved out of the cold barn she was living in at 15 to live on her own. And three years later she was homeless. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a statistic,\u201d she told me she was afraid when she was 15. \u201cI looked around at other girls who were in my circumstances and things went from bad to worse\u201d And yet\u2026 she ended up a statistic. She realized this when she was 18, living out of a car, and attempting to stuff a dress down her pants in a store so she could steal it. When I was 18 I feel I was privileged. I had no real worries. I was \"suburban lucky\". Luck ruined me and made me complacent. I never would have made the good decisions Jewel ended up making. That\u2019s why I love her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m glad she came on my podcast. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s done 100s of interviews to promote her new book, \u201cNever Broken\u201d, an excellent book. But I wanted to break her down. I wanted her to laugh. She was so smart and serious. Trust me: I got her to laugh. A) HARD WOOD GROWS SLOWLY Why did a homeless girl who sang for pennies in a cafe turn down a million dollar offer? \u201cHard wood grows slowly,\u201d she said. \"I saw that as a kid. The soft trees would break. The hard trees would grow and live forever.\" She said: I knew I wanted to grow for a long time in this business. I also knew we were still in the grunge era and I was not grunge. If I took a million dollar deal, I read that I would have to pay it back. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to and I would be dropped by the label and that would be the end of my career. In fact, my album didn\u2019t do well the first year. But then went on to sell over 10,000,000 copies. They didn\u2019t drop me because I was just that girl they paid twelve dollars for. You have to think long-term instead of short-term always. \u2014- She was 19. I do NOT think I would have made that decision. I think I would have made the wrong decisions. How does one take such a long term view at such a young age. I think it was the ten years she had spent developing her skills, singing in bars all over Alaska, preparing for this moment. Confidence is really difficult to develop. I don\u2019t know if I have it even now. But I\u2019m going to remember this lesson on the next business decision I have to make. B) REINVENTION IS NON-STOP Jewel has written children\u2019s books, gone from folk music to pop to children\u2019s to country. She\u2019s been a rancher. She\u2019s been homeless. I asked her, \u201cYou had the benefit of really cultivating your talent from ages 5 to 15. You sang with your dad at gigs every week. \u201cDo you think someone starting from scratch at 50 can do this?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, \u201cReinvention never ends. It\u2019s every day. Pursue what you enjoy and move towards it and there will be opportunities.\u201d I look at my own life today. I\u2019m about to finish a children\u2019s book. I\u2019m looking into TV. I\u2019m working on a novel. I have other business things. I don\u2019t know if any of them will work. But I know if I don\u2019t keep trying I will slip back into whatever hole I constantly have to dig myself out of. There are two days to start something new. When you are five years old. And today. C) CREATE ART FOR YOURSELF I said these words: \u201cSo when you were talking to Neil Young\u2026\u201d What funny words to say to someone, I thought at the time and told her. Neil Young told her: don\u2019t ever write for radio! Meaning: don\u2019t write for the masses, write for yourself. I asked her, \u201cisn\u2019t there a tension there? Like what if you write for yourself and then nobody likes it? Don\u2019t you want to write something that people like?\u201d She said, \u201cWe all have common experiences. Ultimately when you write for yourself, you tap into that common cultural experience we all share.\u201d That was eye-opening to me. If you put in the time to develop the skills, eventually you will burrow so deep inside yourself with your art that you will tap into that same vein of blood that runs through each of us. The key to good art is figuring out who you are. Writing for yourself, then, becomes the best way to write something that can be enjoyed by everyone. D) FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF. But, still, a relationship has to be earned back. Around the time she was 30, Jewel had sold tens of millions of albums, was doing 700 shows a year, and had no money. In fact she was two million in debt. How could that be? She had given all control to her mother and her mother had destroyed it all. Since 2003 she hasn\u2019t spoken to her mother. She made back the money eventually, and has been incredibly successful since then. \u201cWill you ever talk to your mother again?\u201d I asked. I forgive her, she said. But forgiveness is the gift I had to give myself. Forgiveness is not for others. She said: Everyone still has to earn back the relationship. Forgiveness is not the same as condoning something. E) WE ALL SELF-MEDICATE \u201cI saw this at 8 years old,\u201d she said, \u201cSinging in bars. Everyone would be unhappy, they\u2019d drink, and they\u2019d get more unhappy. \u201cI swore to never drink or do drugs. \u201cBut we all need ways to cope - to \u2018medicate\u2019 our issues. \u201cI started writing every day. Journaling, writing the lyrics to what became my songs. \u201cI found that every time I wrote, it reduced my anxiety, even when I was living in my car.\u201d Writing music became the way she self-medicated. It worked. F) WATCH THE HANDS Fears and anxieties sneak up on us. Suddenly, we don\u2019t know from where, but we panic and feel that constriction in our stomach. It\u2019s hard to observe our thoughts before it\u2019s too late. \u201cSo I watch my hands,\u201d she said, \u201cI started keeping a journal of what my hands were doing.\u201d What do you mean? \u201cWas I opening doors for more people? I\u2019d count up the times I\u2019d open doors for people, I\u2019d shake hands with people, I\u2019d be open with people instead of having my arms crossed.\u201d Watching the hands taught Jewel when she was kind and had compassion and was less anxious. There\u2019s a quote in her book, \u201cEmotions are the shadows of thoughts.\u201d I think also, Actions are then the shadows of those emotions. \u201cStarve your negative thoughts,\u201d she said. By being aware of them in any way possible (watch the hands), you can stop them from being obsessive, then you starve them of the attention they need from your brain. They stop growing, they disappear. You can go from homeless, to finding a cafe to play your music, to putting flyers around town, to getting an audience, to attracting music executives, to getting a million dollar deal. While living in your car. G) ACCUMULATE YOUR INFLUENCES While we were talking, Jewel mentioned: Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Loretta Lynn, June Cash. But not just music. She quoted Brene Brown\u2019s book, \u201cDaring Greatly\u201d. She quoted philosophers. She spoke about physics, about the neuroscience of sea slugs. Getting influenced (through reading or listening) is the way to absorb another person\u2019s entire life and learn from it. Then you can combine it, throw in your own art and skills. And now you are on your way to world greatness. Is it that easy? I have no idea. I hope it is. H) FAME MAGNIFIES WHAT YOU HAVE It doesn\u2019t add to who you are. It just magnifies it. If you are a jerk, you will be a bigger jerk. If you are someone who wants to improve yourself, you\u2019ll have more opportunities to improve yourself. You have to be content with yourself first. Before fame. I have to admit, i am probably the biggest idiot ever. And when I first made money it magnified it in every way. I try now to like myself better. It\u2019s not like I wake up and say, \u201cI love you\u201d to myself. Well, maybe sometimes. I) NO ONE CAN KEEP YOU CAPTIVE. NO ONE CAN KEEP YOU UNHAPPY In 2014, she went through a divorce. \u201cI wanted my son to have the kind of mother I wanted to be.\u201d At each step we have to decide if we are content with where we are. We get to choose and nobody else does. Whether it\u2019s a spouse, or a recordd executive or a parent or a friend or whoever. \u201cWe\u2019re like a car,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd the brain is just the steering wheel. We\u2019re outside the brain. We get to steer the car.\u201d Events can be good or bad. But we 100% get to choose whether or not we will be happy. J) CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT YOUR LIFE EVERY DAY This wasn\u2019t in the podcast. It was in her book. I wanted to ask her about it. But I forgot. I always forget at least half the things I intend to ask about. But I like the idea of change every day. Even a little bit of change. We always have to explore. I was just reading that Haruki Murakami has kept the same writing routine for 24 years. Every day he wakes up at 5am, writes, runs, eats, etc. I like that. I like routine. But I want to make sure every day I do enough change that I can learn from it. Only then do I get new things to write about and think about it and improve from If I didn't do these podcasts, I'd probably talk to nobody all day long. But doing them forces me out the door to meet and learn from incredible people. And hopefully, to change a tiny bit. \u2014- I\u2019m completely selfish. I get to call up these amazing artists and get them to come to my podcast studio and ask them whatever questions I want They have to answer. I feel like this brutish monster forcing them to talk to me. But I learn from each one. And I fall in love a little bit with each guest. They all seem so smart and accomplished and confident. I even find myself jealous that Jewel was homeless for a little bit. What a great story! We posed for a picture with her book, \"Never Broken\" between us. \"I'm still broken,\" I said. And she laughed.

Influence is how they will navigate a world of uncertainty. Robert Cialdini is the most influential person in the world. And by that I mean, he wrote the book, \"INFLUENCE\", which sold 3 million copies and defines the six critical aspects of all influence. Now he has a new book, \"Pre-Suasion\", going 10x deeper into the concepts of persuasion. I got him on my podcast so I can ask the 1000 questions I have. Small story from the book: If you name a restaurant \"Studio 97\" instead of \"Studio 17\" people are more likely to tip higher. If you ask a girl for her phone number outside a flower store (triggering feelings of romance), she is more likely to give it to you than if you ask her outside a motorcycle store. And 500 other stories. The environment is just as important as what you say. Before the podcast began, I gave him a book as a gift: \"The Anxiety of Influence\", a history of poetry. What would poetry have to do with influence and marketing? In all art, since the beginning of time, artists have built on the work of the artists the generation before them. Beethoven depended on a Mozart to be a Beethoven. Picasso depended on a Cezanne. Without Michelson, there would be no Einstein. But poets, for some reason, would deny being influenced. \"I never even read Ezra Pound,\" shouted one poet at a critic. Poets want to be seen as original. NOBODY is 100% original. This is the anxiety of influence. Almost all of our decisions and even creativity are outsourced to the people around us who influence us: peers, teachers, religion, parents, bosses, etc. Our personality is our own particular mishmash of influences. How we deal with that anxiety, how we RECOGNIZE the influences, learn from them, build from them, is the BIRTH of all of our creativity. Let me summarize the seven aspects of influence: - RECIPROCITY - if you give someone a Christmas card they will want to return the favor - LIKABILITY - make yourself trustworthy. For instance, outline the negatives of dealing with you. - CONSISTENCY - ask someone for a favor. Now they will say to themselves, \"I am the type of person who does James a favor\". - SOCIAL PROOF - if you are trying to get someone to do X, show them that \"a lot of your peers do X\". For instance, if you are at a bar and you are a guy trying to meet women, being your women friends and not your guy friends with you. - AUTHORITY - \"four out of five dentists say..\" - SCARCITY - \"only 100 iPhones left at this store!\" - UNITY - you and I are the same because: location / values / religion / etc I've used each of the above in business. They work. They will make you money. The entire purpose of language is to influence. We are not strong animals. We are weak. The language of influence saved us. Probably a word like, \"Run!\" was the first word spoken. A word of influence. And it worked. I'm still running from the things I fear. So speak to influence. Don't speak to call a flower yellow. Speak to breathe spirit into an idea, to be enthusiastic, to convey emotion, to influence. This is the only way to have impact with your unique creativity. I gave Robert the book as a gift (\"reciprocity\"), assuming we would have a great podcast. And we did. But then I thought later, I can't even remember how Robert got on my podcast. I highly recommended his book in the podcast and even in this post. \u00a0 As he got into his car after the podcast in order to go to his next interview, I started thinking, \"Hmmm, who influenced who?\"", "duration": "01:09:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-184-RobertCialdini-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1473177600, "title": "Ep. 183 - Jenny Blake: Your Most Crucial Step...

What you choose to do with it is up to you. Caleb Carr was beaten as a child. His father, Lucien Carr, was an Ivy League boy, friends with Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. They were the rebels of society. Known as The Beat Generation. But Caleb reminded me of their other legacy\u2026 \u201cMy father gets arrested for murder. Jack gets arrested for accessory because he helped hide the weapon\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd then Burroughs, of course, shoots his wife down in Mexico.\u201d \u201cMy father\u2019s murder case gave their movement a type of darkness and gravitas it wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had.\u201d --- \u201cAll of these cycles, all of these abusive things are cyclical,\u201d Caleb said. His father didn\u2019t get the help he needed. He didn't get the help he needed. \u201cIt's one of the reasons I never had children myself.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand at first. Caleb has the awareness. He understands the cycle. So I asked, \u201cDon't you think if you had children, you would have been able to hold yourself back?\u201d \u201cI simply could not trust that,\u201d he said. --- As adults, we look at our lives and question what happened and why? We pick at our scabs and then wonder why we\u2019re bleeding. What\u2019s done is done. And how you choose to live with it is your legacy. So Caleb writes. And between the intersection of abuse and history, he found relief. Caleb\u2019s latest book, \u201cSurvivor, New York\u201d begins with \u201cThe Curse of Knowledge,\u201d It\u2019s the idea that once you know something you can\u2019t unknow it\u2026 pain, loss, grief. No pain heals without air. Eventually, the bandaid gets soggy. And the cut below turns green. That\u2019s when I start reading. Caleb\u2019s books are the air. Keep reading to learn three lessons from the brilliant, historical novelist, Caleb Carr. Two will give you relief. One will not... 1. History can save you. A lot of people write thrillers. But Caleb wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d set himself apart. But he found a simple solution. Training + Interest = Success Caleb is a trained historian. He has an interest in serial killer novels. And now he\u2019s a bestselling author. He writes historical thrillers where characters like Theodore Roosevelt and Alexander Hamilton rescue neglected children from serial killers. 2. Pain reinvented is freedom. Caleb needed to write... (as all writers do). But he didn\u2019t want to write a memoir like his father\u2019s pack. He tried it once. \u201cI found the experience incredibly creepy.\u201d So he found fiction. Caleb said he\u2019s not depressed but feels \u201cintense melancholia.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a dark, dark place you go.\u201d \u201cAre you able to function with it?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s when I work.\u201d 3. Always end on a cliffhanger Every unresolved problem in my life is a cliffhanger.Cliffhangers keep the story going. They create chaos. So I just stay curious. Caleb told me the warning signs of a serial killer: childhood violence, torture against animals, fires. \u201cI loved starting fires,\u201d he said. \u201cI set my house on fire when I was four years old. It was the only time my father didn\u2019t hit me.\u201d I later asked if he has sociopathic tendencies\u2026 \u201cfunctional sociopathic tendencies.\u201d \u201cUmmmm\u2026\u201d He was thinking about it.", "duration": "01:16:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-182-CalebCarr-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1472302800, "title": "[Bonus] One Good Story Can Save Your Life...

The cop turned to his friend and in Serbian said, \u201cI guess they really are free over there. I had no idea.\u201d They didn\u2019t know Jordan spoke Serbian. He ended up in a basement. Pipes were sticking out of the wall. There was no water for miles. Wires were everywhere. And Jordan was tied to a chair. They threatened to burn his eyes with a cigarette. The guard had a club and rakia, a homebrewed liquor. Jordan talked his way out of going blind and into having a drink with his kidnapper. I always say advice is autobiography. Now Jordan\u2019s made a career teaching ultimate survival skills through his podcast, \u201cThe Art of Charm.\u201d I asked him, \u201cHow can I be more likable?\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re very likable\u2026\u201d Later he said I have \u201can un-punchable face.\u201d And I agreed.

Jacobs: Four Words That Will Give You Ultimate Freedom", "author": "", "summary": "I was at a restaurant with this beautiful, thick-cut bacon. The kind you use a knife and fork on. It had fat running through it. And I felt that feeling when you fall in love in junior high school. My friend AJ Jacobs is going to prove bacon is the the path to immortality. \u201cI am very skeptical of health gurus,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can find a study to support anything.\u201d I want him to find that study so I can eat bacon three times a day. And live forever doing it. I\u2019d spend the rest of my life experimenting. That\u2019s how AJ lives his life. Every year, he does a new one. Then he writes about it. Most of our lives are lived in our head. Creation is when it leaks out. He\u2019s written four New York Times bestselling books. And he\u2019s the editor-at-large for Esquire. But you don\u2019t need permission. These four words will give you ultimate freedom to do anything you want: \u201cIt\u2019s just an experiment.\u201d Forget the gatekeepers. Just play. AJ has done hundreds of experiments. He learns from them. So do I. Here are 3 lessons I learned from AJ\u2019s hundreds of experiments: 1) Filter negative thoughts I believe in authenticity. But I don\u2019t believe in saying everything you think. If all the pain we created was just an accident, misunderstandings wouldn\u2019t need explaining. AJ stopped gossiping. He had to. It was part of an experiment. \u201cThere's a 1-800 number that Orthodox Jews have. It's like a suicide hotline, but for gossip.\u201d \u201cHow many people call that number a year?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don't know. I called it and found it very helpful.\u201d He said his brain is lazy. Mine is, too. I have to watch it. It takes a lot of effort to clear out negative thoughts. But when AJ\u2019s brain realized certain thoughts were being filtered, it stopped generating those thoughts. \u201cI started thinking more positively about people.\u201d Some people don\u2019t know they\u2019re negative talkers. Or negative thinkers. Your brain is Jurassic Park occupied by predators. If you take care of yourself and filter them out, positive thoughts will filter through. Good people will want to be around you. The landscape will change. And new opportunities will come. But if you get the urge to gossip, call the hotline. \u00a0 2) Practice radical positive honesty AJ and his wife ran into some of her college friends at a restaurant. They said, \u201cOh, we should all get together.\u201d But AJ didn\u2019t want to. He was doing an experiment where he was being radically honest 100% of the time. \u201cI had to say what was on my mind, which was, \u2018You guys seem nice, but I just have no desire to ever see you again.\u2019 \u201cHow did they react?\u201d \u201cAs you might expect, they were not overjoyed.\u201d \u201cDid your wife yell at you?\u201d \u201cYes, absolutely, she yelled at me. In one sense it was effective because we\u2019ve never seen them again.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how she stays married to you.\u201d AJ laughed. And we still got lunch after the podcast. Now he believes in radical positive honesty. I told AJ I\u2019d try it. \u201cGive it a shot. You're very handsome,\u201d he said. He was lying. 3) Don\u2019t overlook anything One of the top 3 moments in AJ\u2019s life was with Chrissy Teigen. I already knew the story because he called me immediately after interviewing her. They were talking about religion and she randomly asked if he read \u201cThe Year of Living Biblically.\u201d She didn\u2019t know he wrote it. \u201cThe Bible says you should say thanks all the time. I took it literally,\u201d he said. It was one of his experiments. \u201cI would press the elevator button and be thankful it came to the first floor. Then I'd get in and be thankful it didn't plummet to the basement and break my collarbone. It was a very bizarre way to live, but it was also wonderful because you realize there are hundreds of things that go right every day that we totally take for granted.\u201d", "duration": "01:14:12", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-180-AJJacobs-v04-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1470758400, "title": "Ep. 179 - Steve Kotler: Tomorrowland: The Future is Rich (in Possibility)", "author": "", "summary": "Beautiful women with laser boobs.

I asked him, \u201cWhen are we going to start 3D printing houses and cars?\u201d This was 7 or 8 months ago. But I was too late. China 3-D printed ten homes in two days. And they were cheap. $5,000 a home. Then they 3-D printed a mansion. And a five-story apartment complex.

So I asked him, \u201cIf I'm sitting in my cubicle or I\u2019m driving to work and I'm listening to this, how can I improve my life?\u201d He told me about a woman in her 30s who graduated from Harvard, lived with her parents and couldn\u2019t get a job. So she disrupted the $256 million a year cosmetics industry. She combined a standard inkjet carton with a 3-D printer. With bio-degradable ink, she can print any type of makeup in any color. Then Steven told me how we\u2019re colonizing space. \u201cOne of the reasons we're not in space yet is because it costs $10,000 a pound to get something out of Earth's gravity well. It's really expensive. We need to be able to print in space.\u201d \u201cMy next book,\u201d Steven said, \u201cnot the one I\u2019m writing now, but the one after that will be about the 4 enormous exoduses that are happening in this century.

Another is gonna be in space.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the other two?\u201d \u201cOne is gonna be climate change migrations.\u201d \u201cMeaning we\u2019re leaving earth?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re leaving Earth.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the fourth exodus? \u201cI actually think the fourth is into our own subconscious... in our own mind,\u201d he said.\u201d He called them \u201cinterior states of consciousness\u201d or \u201cinner-space.\u201d  Steven wrote some of my favorite books, including \"Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World,\" which is also byPeter Diamandis, the Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE Foundation. Bill Clinton said it\u2019s, \u201cA visionary roadmap for people who believe they can change the world.\u201d Steven also wrote Tomorrowland, which shows you all the ways science fiction is coming to life.

So that\u2019s who I hated... I ignored my gut. For 20 years. Your gut reveals itself every time you say how tired you are or some BS like \u201cHappy Friday.\u201d It\u2019s asking you to sleep, quit your job, be creative. To say \u201cno.\u201d Information is power. So even if you make decisions off influences, don\u2019t you want to know what the components of your decision are? I did. \u00a0 So I asked an expert... 1.\u00a0What are the forces that influence me? 2.\u00a0And how I can cleanse myself of the negative ones? I interviewed Jonah Berger about his research book, \u201cInvisible Influence: The Hidden Forces that Shape Behavior.\u201d He\u2019s a Wharton School professor, a New York Times bestselling author and social influence expert. Google is one of his clients. We talked about: - Mirror neurons - \u201cThe power of mimicry\u201d - Why I won\u2019t let my daughters win at checkers, chess or any game at all. Ever. - How to predict upcoming trends - What influences could be holding you back -And what steps you can take to be \u201cone of the lucky ones\u2026\u201d I was picturing businessmen who ignore themselves everyday. Who don\u2019t drink water when they\u2019re thirsty. Who just do the same routine. They have no idea they\u2019re on autopilot. And it\u2019s killing them. They\u2019ll get a heart attack one day and never know what hit them. That was me.\u00a0Until I chose myself and started doing these three things: 1. Find out your influences What\u2019s your day, week, year look like? And why? Jonah gives 20, 30, 40 examples in this podcast. He helps you figure out the positive and negative influences that are impacting your life. Things you\u2019ve never even considered. 2. Check your gut Picture your insides. Your meaty heart. And the deep stream of blood keeping you alive. It knows the answers to your questions already\u2026 But you have to check-in. Because sometimes it\u2019s so quiet. It\u2019s used to being ignored. Listen and notice. 3. Then lean into it Start with small changes. Go to the bathroom when you need to. Stop eating when you\u2019re full. Linger a little longer. Give yourself space. When your gut knows you\u2019re listening, it gets louder. And more powerful. I\u2019m still learning to choose myself everyday. And sometimes my gut disappears.

And if I want to ask why. If I ask, \u201cWhy do I feel like this?\u201d my thoughts seep further into my brain. And I can\u2019t find them. \u201cWhere are you going? And why do I feel like this?\u201d But \u201cwhy\u201d isn\u2019t the answer. \u201cYou are not your feelings.\u201d I\u2019ve heard this before. It\u2019s helpful to have a degree of separation. Negative pressures take away momentum. It makes me lazy. And hungry. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever really hungry. I\u2019m just looking for a human excuse to get away from responsibility. But sometimes you have to admit where you really are. I don\u2019t have advice for you. I have something better. I have Ramit Sethi, author of the New York Times bestseller, \u201cI Will Teach You to Be Rich\u201d and owner of iwillteachyoutoberich.com and growthlab.com. He\u2019s been on my podcast before. Every time he\u2019s on, people want to know this one thing: \u201cHOW can I live a rich life?\u201d I told Ramit, \"The person listening to this doesn't want to hear that it's possible to get rich. Because that's what everybody says. I want to hear specific tactics.\u201d And he\u2019s giving them all away.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s story after story after story of people who have taken your courses and made money\u2026\u201d I said. \u201cNot just made money. Yes. Of course, they made money. That's the least interesting part. A guy gets a $50,000 raise. That happens every day using my stuff.\u201d \u201cTell me a story of someone who's made $50,000 in one month.\u201d (Listen at [19:45]) I don\u2019t believe 99% of the advice about entrepreneurship. Because that advice is what gets you out of your heart and into your head. It makes you lost. Because you try to sell out. You try to win. You try to get rich. And you stop giving. So Ramit and I talked about a rich life. What is it? We came up with this: I can\u2019t tell you what a rich life is to you. I can only say what a rich life is to me. My \u201crich\u201d life consists of four things. You just need to find what you\u2019re OK at. Because if you are OK at one thing and OK at another thing then you can be the best in the world at the intersection. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. And that\u2019s how people fail. They focus on the wrong things, get lost, give up and never start again. They\u2019re at negative zero. Everyone wants to be at 100. But that\u2019s impossible. And wanting to be anywhere other than where you are right now is painful. Start by acknowledging where you are. And know that\u2019s the only true thing about this moment. Then you\u2019re out of the negative. And you have a starting place: you\u2019re at zero. Zero is the best place to be. It\u2019s where Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, every millionaire, billionaire, writer, rapper, author, athlete, and astronaut starts. It\u2019s where you\u2019ll start, too. And you can start right now. Just follow these two steps: 1.\u00a0Acknowledge where you are 2.\u00a0Trust that it\u2019s the start And then you can launch a rich life. Whatever that means to you.

And I tell a story. \u00a0 But I haven't stopped thinking about stand-up. And I want to get better. \u00a0 So I interviewed Gary Gulman. He\u2019s one of my favorite comedians. Top two. Him and Louis C.K. I\u2019ll throw Amy Schumer into the mix. Top three. He started 23 years ago. And I\u2019ve watched his Netflix series, \u201cIt\u2019s About Time\u201d twice (so far). \u00a0 The best way to learn anything is to study the masters. \u00a0 Studying Gary taught me there are two steps to developing talent in anything: \u00a0 Step 1: Start somewhere Gary first tried stand-up in 1993. But that\u2019s not how he got started. \u00a0 Before that, he watched comedy. He repeated bits to friends and got laughs. That\u2019s how all successes start. You just do it for fun. \u00a0 That\u2019s how Derek Sivers started CD Baby and how AirBnB began. They were experiments. \u00a0 Gary only had five minutes on stage. \u00a0 \u201cBack then I did impressions,\u201d he said. \u00a0 He did one of Seinfeld and Kramer playing basketball. \u00a0 But \u201cwithin a year, I had decided that my impressions were not very good.\u201d \u00a0 That\u2019s step 2: Evolve. \u00a0 Doubt is a leader. It can take you away from what you don\u2019t love and into what you do love. \u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s how I got on the track I\u2019m on now,\u201d he says. \u00a0 If you\u2019re \u201cgood,\u201d you\u2019ll just sit back. And someone who\u2019s no good will get better. \u00a0 - They\u2019ll get a mentor - They\u2019ll reinvent themselves - They\u2019ll practice for 10,000+ hours - They build a love for it \u00a0 If the \u201cgood\u201d ones don\u2019t evolve, they\u2019ll remain just that\u2026 good. \u00a0  C) Tell your story  \u201cI have symptoms of depression,\u201d he said. \u201cI almost feel like I'm moving in slow motion. There doesn't seem to be any amount of sleep that satisfies me.\u201d \u00a0 I can\u2019t sugar coat it. It sounds miserable.

It\u2019s Brian Grazer\u2019s studio. He produced A Beautiful Mind, 8 Mile, a bunch of Jim Carrey movies. He\u2019s worked with Eddie Murphy and produced my favorite TV series, Arrested Development. \u201cI bought the book A Beautiful Mind\u00a0with the thematic intention of trying to make a movie that would help de-stigmatize mental disability,\u201d he said. So he created an alternate reality. And he\u2019s done this in his own life. \u201cYou see, the nightmare of schizophrenia is not knowing what\u2019s true,\u201d the psychiatrist said in A Beautiful Mind. He was talking to John Nash\u2019s wife as she watched her husband get electroshock therapy. She loved a schizophrenic man. A brilliant man. She let me him keep his delusions. They weren\u2019t real. But what\u2019s the harm? Nothing. Unless you almost drown your baby. He won the Nobel Prize. And I cried. His mind brought him delusions but it also brought him love. Between two realities, he chose himself. I don\u2019t try to be everything I am. Because some of me is jealous. Some of me feels sad. Some of me ran out of things to say. So I become the rest of me. The side that practices difficult gratitude and improves just 1% a day. The part of me that listens. And flies to LA to be in an alternate reality.

It not only creates the story, but it gives life to energy, and energy is what stories need.\u201d It\u2019s what life needs. Or at least, my life.

And one day Elon Musk called him.\n\u201cHe was either going to make life really horrible on me or he was going to cooperate with the book\u201d said Ashlee Vance, author of the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0bestseller and\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u2019s\u00a0\u201cbest books of the year,\u201d Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.\nAshlee did 200 interviews before Elon agreed, proving permission is not a starting place.\nI wish I wrote the book. But I didn\u2019t.\nMy \u201cquest\u201d is different.\nInstead, I mastered curiosity.\nI called people and recorded. I did a ton of research. I read every book, article, interview and watched every talk. I\u2019ve spent 10,000 hours interviewing and more than 10,000 hours preparing.\nI didn\u2019t need permission. And neither do you.\nHere are 5 ways to bypass the gatekeepers:\nA) Master something\nLike anybody, Elon is smart in some things and probably stupid in others. But he mastered his interests.\nMastery is learning 90% of everything you could learn about a subject. You can\u2019t reach 100%. I hope that\u2019s comforting.\nExplore your interests. Combine them and you\u2019ll find what works for you. Then improve 1% each day.\nAlong the way, you\u2019ll master it.\nB) Make your own decisions\nElon doesn't let people make decisions for him. They\u2019ll choose wrong. And he knows it.\nIf you choose for yourself you will choose yourself.\nC) Play for pay\nI remember my childhood. Some of it. I read comic books and Dear Abby.\nNow, at 47? 48? I search for \u201csuperhero\u201d stories.\nAnd I get to be Dear Abby.\n\u201cAsk Altucher.\u201d\nEvery Thursday at 3:30 PM EST, I have a Twitter Q&amp;A.\nI answer texts and emails from strangers. 203-512-2161\nI answer Quora questions and co-host a podcast with my friend, Stephen Dubner. He wrote the\u00a0New York Times bestseller, Freakonomics.\nI wonder if he read Dear Abby growing up, too. We answer questions with questions.\nBut before all of this, I worked in finance. I did what \u201cthey\u201d wanted me to do. I got lost.\nElon did, too.\n\u201cHe just got swept up in the internet for a little while,\u201d Ashlee says, \u201cand then once he made a ton of money (from PayPal), the light went on and he just said, \u2018Now I can go chase everything I've ever wanted to go do.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cElon appears to have some kind of calling to go save humankind,\u201d Ashlee says. \u201cWhen he was 12, he designed a video game that was exactly that concept.\u201d\nBut at one point, he changed course. We all do. We forget play.\nNow he\u2019s saving humanity.\nD) There are always problems\nWhen I interviewed Derek Sivers last week, I said \u201cYou can always disappear from your problems.\u201d\nAnd you can.\nHe did. But then what?\nDerek spends a lot time answering emails and giving advice. And Elon is exploring electric vehicles and life in space.\nEveryday, I have a choice: find new problems or help others with theirs. Create problems or solve them.\nWhen I help people with their problems, I forget about mine. Sometimes.\nElon sees extreme problems and extreme solutions. All his basics are covered. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t worry about his boss or the mortgage.\n\u201cThe weird thing to me,\u201d Ashlee says, \u201cwas that [when] you started talking [to Elon] about mankind being wiped out, he wells up with emotion.\u201d\nSuffering graces all life. There are always problems.\n\u201cWhat I saw with Elon is that he's very clear-eyed. He meditates on what he thinks is important and has a absolute devotion to pursuing these goals\u201d\n\u201cHe gives you a sense of urgency in your life. Maybe I'm just getting older,\u201d Ashlee says, \u201cWhen I finished doing the book, I sat back and I said, \u2018I need to be much clearer about exactly what I want to do with my life.\u2019\u201d\nI don\u2019t have the same problem as Ashlee or see the same problems as Elon Musk. And I\u2019m grateful.\nE) Be on the right side of history\nYou only have a certain amount of energy each day. Don\u2019t waste it fighting the inevitable.\n\u201cGoing against Elon is the equivalent of going against Steve Jobs these days and you come out looking kind of foolish,\u201d Ashlee says.\u00a0 Instead, focus on building your idea muscle. Do one thing everyday that makes you physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy.\nElon Musk is changing the state of our future. Of all mankind. Who gave him permission? He did.", "duration": "57:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS-160-AshleeVance-v01-FREE.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1458615473, "title": "Ep. 159 - Derek Sivers: The Zen Master of Entrepreneurship", "author": "", "summary": "The most powerful currency in the world is not what you think.\nNot anymore.\nWe're turning to a new economy with two powerful currencies.\nAnd you have an opportunity, right now, to build a more fulfilling and rewarding life.\nI'm going to tell you what these two currencies are and how to leverage them successfully. I'll tell you what works for me.\nBut before I do, I want to introduce you to Derek Sivers. He's an influential thinker, speaker, entrepreneur and the zen master of entrepreneurship writing.\nIf you're starting a business, you have to read his book, Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur. It's in my top three.\nDerek built his business, CD Baby, around doing people favors. It became the largest seller of independent music online, with $100M in sales for 150,000 musicians.\nDerek later sold CD Baby for $22M and gave the proceeds to charity. \"If you focus entirely on others the world seems to reward you the most,\" he says.\nThat's one of the two most powerful currencies today: favors.\nBut there are limits.\n\"You have to serve others within the limits of what you're able to sustainably do. You can't do something that makes you absolutely miserable,\" he says.\nThat's choosing yourself.\nI got a lot of ideas from interviewing Derek, which is the other currency: ideas. But you already knew that.\nDerek moved to New Zealand. He takes 3-day hikes, spends 30 hours a week with his family, and answers thousands of personal emails asking for his advice.\nHe wrote a list of his priorities and said \"I don't want to do anything else right now. (No more interviews or speaking at conferences until further notice.)\" This is his last interview for awhile.\nI'm grateful he chose me. Chose us.\nAnd chose himself.\nI encourage you to write him.\nAnd listen to this interview. Share what you learned. \u00a0I wrote a list -- 7 ways to a \"make a killing\" and master the new economy.\nBecause Derek quoted Kevin Kelly, futurist and founder of Wired. He said, \"We should focus on making a living, not on making something huge.\"\nDerek changed it to \"It's about making a living, not making a killing.\"\nTo me, that's success in the new economy.\n7 ways to a \"make a killing\" and master the new economy:\nA) Leave in the cracks\nDerek was listening to Sheryl Crow. But he didn\u2019t know it was her. Her voice cracked. And she got his attention. \"That little fault is what made me like her,\" Derek said.\nB) Admit your faults\nI know I'm bad at a lot of things. Derek gave an example. When I interviewed Ramit Sethi, I admitted I forgot to read something. And I wasn't totally prepared.\n\"To me it kind of seems like a brilliant way of asking the world to love you,\" Derek said.\nAnd maybe it is.\nEveryone wants love. How sad is it that we, as humans, contemplate hiding ourselves?\nWe have two choices: be yourself or fear being yourself.\nC) You can always disappear from your problems\nBut do you want to? Did Kurt Cobain kill himself because he was too famous? Or because he got everything he wanted? And didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\nWe always want things. Happiness, love, appreciation.\nBut then do we ask for the right things? Raises, promotions, more responsibility, less freedom?\nYou can choose f-ck you money and f-ck you problems. Or you can focus on happiness. That\u2019s what Derek did.\nHe had a company, CD Baby. It\u2019s basically the original iTunes. People said he\u2019d get a lot of money with an IPO. But he didn\u2019t do it.\n\"What's the point of making money?\" Derek said, \"It's to be happy.\"\n\"And if it would make me unhappy to have so much responsibility then I'd rather not make more money. I'd rather just focus on the happiness.\"\nD) Do more favors\nAnyone can do this.\nDerek started by selling old CDs online.\nHe made money right away. So people asked for favors. Can you sell my old CDs?\nHe said yes. And it spread. Friends of friends asked. Then strangers and soon he had a profitable business.\nBut do it for yourself first. Learn the skill. Then, do it as a favor for someone else. See if more people ask. And then you have a business that cost you no money to create.\nE) Answer asks\nDerek didn\u2019t offer to sell his friend\u2019s CDs. They asked him.\n\"By doing favors for people it implies that people are asking you to do those favors and to me the key is the asking,\" he says. \"Bluntly put, you shouldn't start a business unless people are asking you to.\"\nF) Passion is poison\nOnly search for passion if searching for passion is your passion.\nWe're brainwashed to believe we're not alive. That we need a purpose. But you're alive.\nPassion or no passion, you are alive.\nDerek says, \"Instead, just follow the little things that interest you. Just notice on a day-to-day basis what you're drawn towards.\"\nG) Only have good goals\nThat's how Derek became \"a writer, speaker, thinker kind of guy.\"\nThe idea came to him. And suddenly he was inspired. \"I put so much work into this and then within nine months I was speaking at TED in front of Bill Gates, Larry Page and all these intimidating people.\"\nHe says, \"A good goal is one that actually changes your actions in the moment. Goals are not about the future,\" he says. \"Goals are about changing the present moment, changing your present actions.\"\nListen now to my podcast with Derek Sivers.

Entrepreneurship isn\u2019t everything.\nBut it can be.\nBarbara reviews thousands of investment opportunities.

Or more. \"Because they were trying for more,\" she says, \"But the real difference was how long they took to feel sorry for themselves.\"\nGet over rejection. And try again.\nB) Conserve energy.\nMonitor yourself.\nJust notice.\nI feel tired. Why? I'm not motivated. I\u2019m drained. Burnt out. Why?\nYour energy leaks out. Through fear, regret, negative people, bad situations.\nConserve it. Refocus.

They keep their jobs.\u00a0\nD) You need to be \"hungry, mean and insecure.\"\n\"That's been my track record with the businesses I've invested,\" she says. You need to have something to prove.\nBut nice is ok for me. I\u2019ll take nice.\u00a0\nE) Daydream.\n\"Vision is daydreaming and seeing yourself in a role and seeing what your business is going to become,\" she says.\nPicture it. Use your imagination.

Telling my truth.\nListen at [2:35] to learn how to cure something in yourself too.\n2) Want less.\nWanting more hurts. Because you trick your brain into believing you don\u2019t have enough. And start feeling sorry for yourself. Instead of grateful for what you do have.\nSo I want less.\u00a0\nListen at [6:28]. Turney explains why wanting more destroys you.\n3) Build up your gut.\nWe have instincts. And our bodies speak to us. But we\u2019re good at ignoring it. The pain.\nWe think stomach aches are just stomach aches. But it\u2019s an accumulation abuse. Stress. Worry. Fear.\nYou have to listen to your body. Notice the pain.\nTurney says, \u201cI became successful on the trading desk because I had great instincts, and I used my gut. Along the way I lost that.\u201d\nListen at [51:50] to hear how he got his gut back.\nAfter everything, I ask him, \u201cHas it worked out?\u201d\n\u201cI'll tell you this...\u201d\nListen here for my interview with Turney.\nYou\u2019ll learn how to choose yourself.\nAnd you\u2019ll hear how Turney did it himself.

He has the solution to my problem\u2026\nAnd maybe your problem, too.\nAdam is the youngest tenured and highest-ranking professor at the famed business university The Wharton School, a writer for The New York Times, and the New York Times bestselling author of Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success.\nIn researching his new book, Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, Adam met with today's most successful and innovative entrepreneurs.\u00a0\nWhy? To get answers.\n\u201cWe have a ton of guidance on how to generate ideas,\u201d he says. But what about after? What do you do?\nOriginals teaches you how to bring new ideas into the world.\nAnd really, there\u2019s no grand theory on how to be \"original.\" But there are tricks\u2026 And Adam discovered some patterns among today\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs.\nHe spoke to Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, Warby Parker\u2019s founders and CEOs, and thought leaders like the renowned writer, Malcolm Gladwell.\nFrom Gladwell, Adam learned the most powerful technique to induce creativity. From Larry Page and the Warby Parker guys, he found a common thread. Hint: don\u2019t quit your day job. But, more on that later.\nI\u2019m going to tell you the top three things to be \u201can original.\u201d They might surprise you. But first, I want you to know what else you\u2019ll get from today\u2019s podcast:\n\nHow to get into a flow state (even during tasks you don\u2019t like) [51:32] \n\n\nShould you plan your procrastination?

The top three things to become \"an original:\"\n1) Induce creativity\nFirst unlearn. Then learn...\nWe\u2019ve all internalized things we need to question.\nThat\u2019s what adults do. We make up rules and reasons. We draw lines instead of pictures\u2026 tell \u201cfacts,\u201d not stories.\nBut why can\u2019t we play with our food? Or stand on the counter?\nKids think. Kids create.\nAnd we can get back to that too.\nWe just have to unlearn. And then re-learn.\n\u201cThis comes back to our idea of broadening your experience and your knowledge,\u201d Adam says. \u201cYou need to step outside of your field in order to see what you should be challenging.\u201d\nImmerse yourself in new domains. Go beyond work\u2026 beyond your office\u2026 beyond the usual.\nPersonally, I dabble in a lot of things. I play games. I write. I read. I'm involved in lots of businesses. And I recently tried stand-up comedy.\n\u201cI've just pursued things I'm curious about,\u201d Adam says, \u201cand then unexpectedly, they turn out to have bridges between them.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the key to learning. Do something new. Do a dare of the day. It\u2019s good for your creative health.\u00a0\n2) Don\u2019t quit your day job (yet).\nGive yourself time to build your business. It worked for me. I tell why in this episode. Listen at [21:31].\nAnd be conservative. It\u2019s one of the best ways to be original.\n\u201cI was stunned actually,\u201d Adam says. He read this a \u201cnationally represented study of American entrepreneurs.\u201d \u201cPeople who did what you did, James, and kept their day job are 33% less likely to fail.\u201d\n3) Propel your ideas forward\nDoubting your ideas can be paralyzing, so eliminate self-doubt. According to Adam, a lot of originals said, \u201cLook, you could fail by starting a business that flops or you could fail by not starting a business at all, and I don't want to be in that second category.\" \u00a0Listen at [22:09] to get actionable steps to fight self-doubt.\n\u00a0\nListen now.\nAnd let\u2019s stop being afraid...\nTogether.\nResources and Links:\n\nRead Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant \nListen to my last interview with Adam Grant here \nRead Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success by Adam Grant \nFollow Adam on Facebook, Twitter, & visit his website www.adamgrant.net to read his articles.", "duration": "01:05:03", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/Adam20Grant20final20final20mp3.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1455045014, "title": "Ep. 153 - Russell Simmons: How to Earn Your Worth", "author": "", "summary": "Ask the world this question, and you\u2019ll drown in failure.\nYou\u2019ll lose.

I was a grown man I could get things I wanted.\u201d\nBut not all his life.\nHe grew up in Queens. \u201cHollis, Queens and 205 Street. Frank Lucas was on our corner and so that was the heroin capital. The neighborhood went down very quickly,\u201d he says.\n\"Obviously every kid took a lot of drugs.\u201d He was 13. Joined a gang. Sold drugs, \u201chad some experiences,\u201d and escaped.\nNow he\u2019s the chairman and CEO of Rush Communications and the co-founder of Def Jam, the record label famous for spotting Beastie Boys, Jay Z, Kanye West, Rihanna and 100 others.\nSince 1984.\nI wanted to know how he got here. And how he became one of my heroes.\n\u201cI didn't discover hip-hop,\u201d he says, \u201chip-hop discovered me.\u201d\nOpportunity found him. He was at the center of that universe.\nHe grew his opportunities. He spotted talent, formed partnerships, and became an entrepreneur.\u00a0\nHe learned a lot. You might expect to hear \u201che hustled.\u201d But mostly, he gave back.\n\u201cThis idea that you have to trade with the world or manipulate the world to be successful is wrong headed,\u201d Russell says.\nContribute. \u201cIf you look at your own history of success it's because you contributed to success,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s works for me too.\nI give writing. I get readers.\nI give interviews. I get advice, entertainment, a network, new friends, a memory, and experiences I would never get if I didn\u2019t give.\nAnd giving can be simple.\nWrite emails to people you admire. Surprise someone. Do something that makes someone else\u2019s life better. Give ideas. Say thanks.\n\u201cYou have to be comfortable in your seat, and life's only goal is to be happy and comfortable in your seat,\u201d Russell says. \u201cFrom that space the universe unravels and it attracts everything. You become a greater giver because you're focused on giving and you're not fearful of the world. You become a contributor.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway I'm out of cocaine now. Just so you know I've been vegan and I've stopped taking drugs almost thirty years ago,\u201d he says.\nThat\u2019s why I got to have him on my podcast.\nHe wrote a book,\u00a0The Happy Vegan: A Guide to Living a Long, Healthy, and Successful Life. I got to go to his apartment to interview him.\nIt\u2019s an incredible book. I learned a huge amount reading it. I'm not a vegan. But I'm strongly considering it.\nListen to today's podcast.

Don\u2019t eat when you\u2019re not hungry.\nBut that\u2019s not always easy. Nothing is always easy.\nWith diet, you have an internal argument.\nWillpower versus cravings.\nSo what do you do when the voice in your head won\u2019t stop?\nYou struggle. Your mind plays ping pong.\nEat it. Don\u2019t it. One bite. No. Yes. Ok. Damn it.\nOnly one side wins. Willpower or cravings.\nI\u2019m going to tell you how to make willpower win.

But \u201cWe\u2019re wired to only burn fat or only burn sugar,\u201d Dave says.\nOne or the other.\nIf your body could burn both at the same time, you\u2019d get double the energy. Or triple.\nI don\u2019t know exactly how much. But I felt like Superman. I wrote an entire book in one weekend.\nAnd Superman felt like Superman, too. Brandon Routh, the guy who played Superman in 2006 wrote the foreword to Dave\u2019s book.\nBecause it works. But we\u2019re all different.

And focused.\n\u201cOne of the three big urges that interrupt you all the time stops interrupting you,\u201d Dave says, \u201cand then you have more capacity to make better decisions somewhere else in your life.\u201d\nYou have more energy to do what you love. To read, write 10 ideas, start a business on the side.\n\u201cI would happily weight 20 lbs more if I got better brain function, if I could pay attention better if I had more energy, if I felt better, but it turns out that when you eat to get enough energy into the body, you just effortlessly lose weight without willpower,\u201d Dave says.\nGet your brain back, your willpower and insane amounts of energy.

But first, I want to tell you about my guest, Dan Harris.\nDan is an anchor on \"Good Morning America\" and \"Nightline.\"\u00a0 He's also the No. 1 New York Times bestselling author of 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works \u2013 A True Story.\nAfter the book came out people had questions. So he also created an app called \"10% Happier.\" It teaches users easy \u201cjudo moves\u201d to have more creativity, feel less stress, and be happier.\u00a0\nIt helps you surrender. Be self-aware. Focused.\n\u201cThe events that led up to my panic attack were a case study in mindlessness,\u201d Dan says. \u201cGoing to wars without thinking about the consequences, getting depressed and not knowing it and blindly self-medicating.\u201d\nI wanted to know what pushed him over the edge.\n\u201cThe one-word answer is cocaine,\u201d Dan says. \u201cThe more complicated answer is I arrived at ABC News when I was 28.\u201d\nHe was insecure. He worked with big names like Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walters. He wanted to be successful.\n\u201cMy Jewish father has this expression, \u2018The price of security is insecurity.\u2019 I really embraced that,\u201d he says.\nThe pressure never let up. He demanded more of himself.\nBut why do we make it so hard for ourselves?\nMany people have gone through this slow-motion panic attack. Including me. It's the stress of daily living.\u00a0\nSomething bad happens to you. You lose a job or get a divorce. Everyday wear and tear picks at you.\nStress happens over time. And if you don\u2019t notice it, it builds.\nThe voice in your head becomes meaner. Angrier. More resentful and regretful. Energy is wasted. Your creativity dies. Your idea muscle atrophies. And you\u2019re at the bottom of the funnel dreaming about retirement.\nBut instead of imagining a better life later, retire. You can retire a little bit every day.\nBreathe. Feel your chest fall. That\u2019s retirement.\nIt\u2019s a fantasy. I\u2019m going to tell you how to make it real right now.\nBut before I do, let me tell you what you\u2019ll get from today\u2019s podcast:\na) Learn How to Have More Ideas\nDan says, \"When you ask, 'What is boredom like? What does this feel like? Where am I feeling it in my body? What's the taste of it in my mind?\u2019 That is curiosity.\u201d Curiosity produces creativity. And ideas. You\u2019ll learn how to make room for curiosity.\nb) Distance Yourself From Stress\nDan teaches you how to notice stress and see your problems clearly. You\u2019ll learn to separate yourself from it. And relax. Essentially, you're becoming a scientist of your own inner reactions. A scientist is not his experiment. The same way humans are not their reactions and emotions to things. Those are separate. You\u2019ll learn how to separate yourself from stress.c) Be 10% Happier\n\u201cFirst of all, 10% is just a joke. You can't quantify happiness,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI came up with that as a bullshit answer to a friend.\u201d But being a little bit happier is better than being a little bit miserable. But you have to practice. You're practicing becoming aware of the angry voice that comes up and reacts. So you can be calm.\nOk, now here\u2019s Dan\u2019s secret to dealing with stress: meditation\n\u201cLet me just say outright, because as soon as you bring that word up, some high percentage of your listeners are like, \u2018All right, I'm done with this podcast. Meditation's bullshit. I don't want to do it,'\" Dan says.\nHe thought that too.\n\u201cThe book is really the story of me coming to terms with the fact that meditation is not what I thought it was. It's secular and scientifically validated,\u201d he says.\nPeople reject meditation. It\u2019s a reflex. But there are a lot of benefits to it. It:\n- Lowers blood pressure\n- Boosts immune system\n- Rewires parts of your brain\n\u201cNobody continues to meditate because they feel like 'my pre-frontal cortex might be changing.' You continue to meditate because you're less of an asshole to yourself and others,\u201d he says. \u201cThat's a huge value added.\u201d And I agree.\nLouis C.K., my favorite comedian, says, \u201cIt\u2019s not up to you if you\u2019re an asshole or not. That\u2019s up to everybody else.\u201d But you can be aware of it.\nLouis says, \u201cSelf love is a good thing, but self-awareness is more important. You need to once in a while go \u2018Um, I'm kind of an asshole.\u2019 You have to have that thought once in a while or you\u2019re a psychopath.\u201d\nListen to this podcast with Dan Harris.

More money than you thought was possible.\nListen to this episode. You\u2019ll hear tested and proven strategies to get rich from Ramit Sethi, the NewYork Times bestselling author and founder of iwillteachyoutoberich.com.\nHe grew his business from a dorm-room blog into a multi-million dollar online business.\nAnd now he started a new company, GrowthLab, to teach you how to do the same thing\u2014start and grow an online business.\nRamit is a trainer. He\u2019ll make you hustle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like looking up at a skyscraper and saying \u2018How am I going to build one of those?\u2019 Well you\u2019re not.

How can you feel motivated when you\u2019re prostituting yourself everyday?\nWhat did I learn from Ramit? It\u2019s less about what I learned, and more about what I feel capable of doing every time I listen to him.\nFear is a debilitating idea. Replace fear with motivation. You'll be amazed at the results.\nI need motivation to eat well, write everyday, do the\u00a0daily practice. And I start over everyday. Because motivation isn\u2019t as constant as your to-do list.\nBut with Ramit\u2019s plan, you'll get systems in place. Systems that manage your money and organize your time, and take care of all the things draining you dry.\n\"If you\u2019re going to put in work, why not be positive, try to improve yourself, improve your relationship, make more money,\" Ramit says.\nI haven\u2019t taken his courses. But strangers email me saying they\u2019re great. That they\u2019ve tripled their income. I don\u2019t know why they tell me that. I get a lot of strange emails from strangers.

Sometimes starting something is that simple.\nSince they were kids, David and Brian were fascinated by two things: power and wealth. They wondered, \u201cWhat makes a billionaire unique?\u201d\nThey had a question, an idea, and conviction. \u201cWe were all the f*ck in,\u201d Brian says.\nThey had dinner with a bunch of billionaires.

Really, you can\u2019t make anyone happy.\nThe sooner you accept this, the sooner you can let go of control, shame, or whatever your parents did to you, and start having sex. Or happiness. Whatever you're searching for.\nI\u2019ll explain.\nMy guest today, a seven-time New York Times best-selling author, Neil Strauss, has written books on Motley Crue, Marilyn Manson, and pornstar Jenna Jameson, before exploring the pickup artist scene.\nSex was all around him.\nHe was immersed in the seduction community, but Neil couldn't find love himself. No woman would kiss him. He grew up a loser, and couldn\u2019t get a girlfriend for most of his life.\nNow he\u2019s happily married. But between marriage and being a loser, he had a lot of \u201cpleasure fantasy experiences.\u201d Meaning, he learned how to pick up women and started having crazy sex orgies. One after another.\nAnd then he just stopped, and the sex parties ended.\nI wanted to know why. What made him decide he couldn\u2019t handle it anymore? But I\u2019ll get back to this.\nIn his first book, The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists, Neil gives you easy tools you can use to have confidence. He teaches you how to feel like you're in control of a social situation.\nNeil was so busy having sex, he didn\u2019t have time to get back to his normal life.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like that. I would just constantly be jealous or insecure, to be honest.\nBut back to happiness. Which I don\u2019t even like to talk about really\u2026 We put too much pressure on ourselves to be happy. You can\u2019t be happy all the time. And when you are happy, it should be special.\nBut Neil had a good friend to help him refocus. \u201cYou need someone in your life who can reflect yourself back to you so you can see yourself a little bit,\u201d he says.\nHis producer and close friend, Rick Rubin, said, \u201cLook, you got everything you wanted in The Game. Why are you still not happy?\u201d\nThat\u2019s when Neil started looking for the truth.\nIn his book, The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships, Neil shows you how he gave up control. The book is about beliefs. \u201dIt\u2019s so hard to recognize your beliefs, let alone change them, because you\u2019re living with yourself.\u201d\nBut behaviors are easier to change. That\u2019s what he teaches you in this episode. You\u2019ll learn how to feel healthier emotionally.\nWhen your personal life is together, you\u2019re much more capable of achieving bigger things, accumulating wealth, and feeling less stressed and worried.\nNeil says, \u201cThere\u2019s always a reason for what you\u2019re doing, and if you don\u2019t know the reason, then maybe you\u2019re living an unconscious life.\u201d\nAnd if you\u2019re just curious about the sex, then there\u2019s something here for you, too.", "duration": "01:02:45", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/Neil20Strauss20Final.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1450204103, "title": "Ep. 146 - Gabriel Weinberg: 19 Ways to Sell Your Ideas and Scale", "author": "", "summary": "You know why I wrote Choose Yourself.

And you can use them, too, for your business or blog or anything. But I\u2019ll get back to that.\nFirst you need an idea. And there needs to be a demand for that idea.\nNext, you should be wondering, \u201cIs my idea any good?\u201d Probably not. Or maybe it is. You could be much smarter than me. Most of my ideas don\u2019t lead to anything. But a few have. Like StockPickr, the company I built and sold for millions before almost destroying myself and\u00a0wanting to die.\nIf you\u2019re an idea machine, you already know how to come up with ideas. Scaling an idea is more challenging. Results don\u2019t just appear. You need traction. You need to\u00a0grow and acquire new customers.\nMy guest today, Gabriel Weinberg,\u00a0author of\u00a0Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth\u00a0and CEO of Duck Duck Go, is the king of results -- search results that is.\nThat's what Duck, Duck, Go does. It is a search engine and it's stealing millions of customers from Google. It takes some sort of voodoo mastermind to figure out how to beat Google at their own game. Gabriel challenges the status quo. He\u2019s part of that rare breed of people who believe nothing is impossible.\nNow DuckDuckGo is pretty huge. But why would anyone want to challenge Google? That\u2019s what I wanted to find out. And I\u2019ll tell you why in a second.\nBut let\u2019s get back to my secret. In 33 minutes and 22 seconds, you can know my preferred method to scaling your business. Or you can just skip to the 33:22 mark in today\u2019s interview. You might be surprised to find out how I scaled Choose Yourself \u2014 how I got traction.\nBut if you're not looking for shortcuts, listen to the whole interview. You'll get an all-inclusive, complete breakdown on how to sell and scale your best ideas.\nGabriel goes over every marketing tactic, nineteen to be exact. If you're resourceful, you can use them to start building your wealth for the New Year.\nAnd in his book, Gabriel and Justin Mares give you marketing tips from the masters, including\u00a0Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, Reddit founder\u00a0Alexis Ohanian, Kayak founder\u00a0Paul English, and more than a dozen others.\nListen today to hear Gabriel break down the best tactics for every stage of your business. You\u2019ll also hear why he wasn\u2019t happy with Google, and how he started today\u2019s superior search engine, in addition to how you and thousands of other people got here.

He\u2019s an entrepreneur, marketing man, and film producer who gets companies like HP to say, \u201cyes\u201d to him.\nYou can learn a lot from him. I did.\nOne thing I learned is there\u2019s more to choosing yourself. There\u2019s a part two.\nPart one is when you see things in your life that are absurd, decide you\u2019re not going to stand for it anymore and quit. You decide to become physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually\u00a0healthy. That\u2019s choosing yourself.\nPart two is when you see what\u2019s wrong with the world and say, \u201cThat\u2019s absurd. Let\u2019s change that. Let\u2019s hack that. Let\u2019s modify that so it\u2019s affordable.\" That's what Mick Ebeling does--\u00a0founder of the Not Impossible Labs and the Not Impossible Foundation. Through these two entities, Mick figured out how build whatever he wants, and solve impossible problems.\nMick sees the world through his own lens. It\u2019s the reason he\u2019s successful.\nHe creates technology that solves absurd problems like having your arms blown off. No prosthetics, no solution. Or being paralyzed and unable to speak to your family ever again.\nThe technology to\u00a0fix these problems does exist. But when you can\u2019t afford it, you have an even bigger problem.\nThis is why Mick hacks. He disrupts the system, doesn\u2019t wait for permission, and believes in impossible things. You can, too, but more on that later.\nLet me tell you how he got started. Mick was just reading the paper. He read that thousands of people in the country of Sudan don\u2019t have arms because of war injuries. And they just live with it. They can\u2019t afford prosthetics, so they hand-feed each other, dress each other, and help each other with all the other daily necessities.\nMick decided to do something. He flew to Sudan with no plan and figured out how to create prosthetic arms using a 3D printer. This is someone with no experience in medicine or engineering. He\u2019s just a guy with a big heart who decided nothing is impossible.\nOn the show, you\u2019ll hear how he 3D printed arms for a boy named Daniel, and empowered an entire country to do this for thousands of other people missing limbs.\nI wanted to know how it's done. How can people\u00a0quit their\u00a0jobs and do things that really matter? Mick tells you how on the podcast.\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to think like today\u2019s most successful innovators. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to create the next $700 pill,\u201d Mick says, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create something that totally disrupts a particular fill-in-the-blank, maybe it\u2019s a way of communication, a way of transportation.\u201d This is the winning mentality today: Uber, Airbnb, Not Impossible Labs.\nBy making technology accessible, he\u2019s solving global problems. \u201cHelp one, help many,\u201d that\u2019s Not Impossible Labs\u2019 mission.\nThen Mick\u2019s team tells the story through videos that go viral and infect everyone with this bug- the not impossible bug.\nBesides a miracle worker, Mick\u2019s a story teller. \u201cEach of our projects tells the story of a single individual. By helping one person, how many others can we help?\u201d\nStories bridge the gap between helping just one person and helping many. Mick\u2019s not just choosing himself\u2026 He\u2019s choosing the world.\n\u201cOnce you start to have the awareness of something you need, you start to see it.\u201d\nSo how can you get the big idea, do the impossible, and become beautifully successful\n\u201cFirst of all, you can just start to believe in this mentality that nothing is impossible,\u201d Mick says.\nTry it.\nSecond, look for absurdities. They\u2019re everywhere \u2013 when you read or watch TV. When something bothers you, think of solutions. Be an idea machine.\nThird, disrupt. Don\u2019t wait for big government or big business to give you permission. Forget bureaucracy.\nDisruption starts now. We\u2019re hacking the system.\nListen to today\u2019s episode. You\u2019ll hear Mick\u2019s miracle stories, find out where he gets his big ideas and his money, and how you too can do impossible things.\nResources and Links:\n\n\u2022 Not Impossible Labs'\u00a0Website\n\u2022 Read\u00a0Error!

You\u2019re at a point in your life where you feel you should know what you\u2019re doing with your finances, your career, your family.\u00a0\nMaybe you\u2019re feeling lost now.\nIf no one patted your back, told you you\u2019re special, and helped you figure out what you\u2019re good at, you may feel like someone is sitting on your chest. You are lying there with weight, pressure, a heaviness inside you that says, \"I\u2019m stuck here.\"\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not too late to find out what you\u2019re good at.\nJane\u2019s goal was, and still is, to give kids opportunities in life. Don\u2019t you wish someone wanted the same for you now? I do.\nThe difference is, you have to choose yourself.\nPart of that is surrounding yourself with the right people. Who are the right people? Jane says, \u201cSometimes, depending on the issue, the right people around the table are folks who you know well and trust a great deal.\u201d\nPlainly, if you pick the wrong people, you\u2019ll be stressed and you\u2019ll waste energy. How you spend your energy is your choice. And that\u2019s powerful.\nThe other resource we crave is money. Campaigning, Jane didn\u2019t have that either. She hustled.\n\"I tend to outwork people,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a working mother, I\u2019ve learned to work hard and smart.\u201d She raised $60,000 for her campaign.\nSome people wrote checks to support her. Others baked brownies, and she had bake sales\u2026 That\u2019s old school hustling.\u00a0\nSometimes, to make things happen, you have to go back to the basics. You don\u2019t become a superhero by trying to be a superhero. You become a superhero by overcoming whatever\u2019s in your way. \u201cI had to be really crisp and really convincing, and really think through my position on a number of issues to convince people that a 25 year old woman, a couple of years out of college, would be a better state senator than a 7 term incumbent,\u201d she says.\nStart small. Try to improve 1% a day. The people who baked brownies helped at least 1%.\nThat\u2019s how you gain momentum. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn in today\u2019s episode. You\u2019ll learn how to hustle, earn power, and, if you\u2019re lucky, become a superhero, too.", "duration": "01:01:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS20Ep2014520Jane20Swift20final.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1448403697, "title": "Ep. 143 - Mary Karr: How to Start Anything", "author": "", "summary": "It won't be the idea that causes you to quit... it's fear.\nIt's the big idea that stops us\u2014the idea of being a Google or a Facebook, a New York Times best-selling author, a guru, a YouTube sensation, a Mark Cuban or\u00a0Kevin O'Leary.\nSometimes, it seems easier to forget you even had the idea to begin with. The idea of success. But if you give in, you'll end up quitting before you start.\nIt's a trap.\nThink about how many people are on Earth. There are millions of attractive people I have never met because I didn't give myself the chance. I always thought, \"She'd never have sex with me.\"I didn't even look. So I quit before I could start.\nBut staring at a girl is easy. And who knows what that leads to? If you want to achieve something, you need to make moves.\nIn today's podcast, you'll learn the steps you need to take to achieve anything.\nMy guest, Mary Karr, is an award-winning poet and best-selling memoirist with praise from Stephen King, among many other highly-esteemed writers. In the interview, Mary shares some easy techniques you can use to get started.\nNumber one, start with things that are easy or convenient, and build from there.\nIdentifying your interests is important, too. Mary started with reading. \"Something about\u00a0reading other people's life stories\u00a0made me less lonely,\" she says.\nMary explains that it's often \"the thing that happened to you that was very dramatic that maybe nobody else would find dramatic,\" that make the best stories.\nThese little moments give you insight. That's what makes you capable of doing whatever you put your mind to. No one has your experiences, the order of those experiences, your relationships, your perspective, your talents, and your drive.\nThese pieces make you capable of doing something nobody else can. You have to work with what you have.\n\"I start with very convenient ideas and convenient memories in which I always appear to be doing beautiful and nimble things,\" she says, \"and then it turns out I was the one making a lot of the trouble.\" When it's your story, who knows what will turn out?\nYour experiences shape what you're capable of. And they shape what you're on your way to becoming. \"No one can tell me what the shape of my mind is like better than me,\" Mary says.\nIn addition to her literary success, Mary taught creative writing in jail. Why? \"All of us who write are ultimately trying to make the world less lonely,\" she says.\nIf there's an impact you'd like to make, make it. Even if you're scared. \"I'm never not scared,\" Mary says.\nWhen I asked what she's scared of, I realized I've heard her list before. From myself. Scared of sounding like an idiot, being boring, \"losing what little stature I've gained for myself.\"\nIf what you have is so little, then what is there to lose? That's how I picked myself up. I\u00a0improved 1% a day. You can too.\nListen today for techniques to get overcome fear of failure. You'll learn to look around you and discover opportunities.

I get it. You're afraid. You don't want to get stuck or let go of a good thing. Recognize, though, that your fear won't generate wealth and freedom.\nSo how do you know what's right financially? My guest today, Kevin O\u2019Leary says, \"There's no guarantee. You have to try things.\u201d\nBefore becoming a successful entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and millionaire shark, Kevin tried and tested different jobs. He picked up garbage. This wasn\u2019t for him. He wasn't invested.\nSometimes the key to success is to say no. Not to invest.\nIf you aren't invested, you can keep trying new things. That's what Kevin did. He tried something else, which he talks about in today's interview.\nHe just kept going. The idea is to find something more fulfilling.\nAnd even when you find it, keep an open mind. It might still be a test.\nKevin has a three-year rule. If something can't survive three years, then \"take it behind the barn and shoot it,\" he says. Dump it. Quit it. Do not invest. \"Unless it's a hobby and you don't mind losing money,\" he says.\nThis rule applies to dating, too. If you don\u2019t see a future with someone, why continue? Consider how much you\u2019re spending, or \u201cinvesting,\u201d in dating someone.\nAnd think of it the other way around. Can you survive it for three years? Or three more years? Kevin waited six before marrying Linda. Now they\u2019ve been married for 25 years.\nIn his new book, Cold Hard Truth On Men, Women, and Money: 50 Common Money Mistakes and How to Fix Them, and in today's interview, Kevin teaches you how to avoid making bad investments in your life with simple, easy-to-follow tips.\nSmart investments require time. You need time to find out who and what you\u2019re compatible with. And those things change. You change. So when you feel stuck or unfulfilled, don\u2019t just cry about it. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for tears,\u201d Mr. Wonderful says.

That's PJ O'Rourke, world-renowned talking head and published author, whose political humor and commentary make him the butt of many an insult on message boards everywhere.\nHe's on the show today to talk about politics and why humor is always the best policy, especially if you want to really make a difference.\nWhen it comes to being funny in politics, humor is your only option. \"You really don't have a choice,\" PJ tells me. \"To take it seriously is to indicate you're an idiot.\"\nAnd the same applies to the way you run your business, so be careful! If you take yourself too seriously, you're only going to end up missing out on the important, finer details. Because even in business you are still involved in politics one way or the other.\nMaybe you're the member of a committee, maybe you design your staff meetings as a form of democracy \u2013 either way, there is an election process, a conversation, and a show of hands that can represent your decision or point of view.\nAnd you need to be educated in your field if you ever hope to find the humor in it. Because finding the humor in your point of view means you are much more likely to start the right kind of conversations to get people on your side.\nUnlike politics though, comedy is hard. \"I have more respect for comedians like Jay Leno and Chris Rock,\" PJ says, after I asked him if he respected them more than Joe Biden. And that's saying something.\nHumor gives you the power to generate conversations, and PJ's quirky sense of humor lends this week's show some hilarious viewpoints on these conversation starters:\n\n\u2022 The government's role in regulating capitalism and big businesses\n\u2022 The time and place for politics\n\u2022 How to find humor in high-stakes political situations\n\u2022 How comedy can change the way the world sees a situation, especially through the lens of the internet\n\nPJ's latest book, Thrown Under the Omnibus, comes out October 6\u00a0\n\"Is that when it's coming out? No one told me!\" says P.J.\nThe book touches on these themes, but his conversation with me on the show today is full of the kind of jokes you want to be able to tell at your next networking event.\nSo listen in and see how you can be the funny man (or woman) at your next business meeting.\nTo find out more about PJ and hear more of his work, head over to his column at The Weekly Standard.\nSpecial Note: Both PJ and James will be presenting LIVE at next month's Stansberry Conference in Las Vegas.

We're very sad about his passing.\nHere is one of the last interviews Wayne Dyer has done and it is with James...\u00a0\nDuring that interview James asked Dr. Dyer what he saw as the arc of his career. \"What has your message been and how have you seen it evolve?\"\nWithout hesitating, Dr. Dyer responded...\n\"Well, it's really been always about self-reliance, in one form or another. I've often said that I really feel that I had a conversation with God just before I showed up here on this planet in 1940 and I was asked, 'What would you like to do on this trip?' And I said, 'Well, I think I'd like to teach self-reliance.' And God said, 'You want to do that for an entire lifetime? Just teach self-reliance?'\n\"I said, 'Yes, that would be a great lifetime.' And he said, 'Well, then, we'd better get your little ass into an orphanage and we'd better let you have all of these different experiences, so that once people start to question that, you will never be dissuaded because you'll have the experience of it.' So everything in my life has been directed towards teaching people how to have self-reliance. It has shifted from psychology and an emphasis on psychological principles, to spiritual principles, and that's something that I really had nothing to do with personally; that was just the direction that I was destined to go.\"\nThey concluded their conversation with the following exchange...\nDr. Wayne Dyer:Think about your body, the body that you're in. You're in a male body, I'm in a male body. And I'm in a body that's about 6'2\", it has blue eyes, it has no hair on its head, it has certain characteristics and so on, and inessence, that's why, for this incarnation, I'm doomed.\nI'm doomed to live \u2013 I'm not gonna be in a female, 4'10\" body. I'm not gonna be in any other \u2013 this is the body that I get, okay? Now, what kind of choices do I have to make within that context? Well, I can decide how healthy it's gonna be. I can decide whether I'm gonna exercise it or not.\nI can decide actually how long it's gonna live.\nThere's many, many choices that I make about this body within the context of being doomed to live in this body and not any other body. Now, if you take this metaphor and you extend it to not just the physical body but to the rest of your life and all that you are, you are, in essence \u2013 you are given a dharma. You showed up here with a purpose. You showed up here with an energy that propels \u2013 and there's something that excites you, and it's like whether you want to be a falconer or whether you want to be a musician or whether you want to be a writer or whether you want to raise horses in Montana.\nWhatever it might be, there's something that excites you. Now, you have been doomed; in other words, this is your dharma. This is what you're here for. But you're making choices.\nAnd the choices that you make all along, all the course corrections that you make, involve,\n\"Am I willing? Am I willing to do whatever it takes to make this come true?\" I've always been willing.\n\"Are you determined?\" That is, are you gonna not let anything interfere with it? Yes. You have to have that determination.\n\"Am I fearless?\" In other words, am I gonna get the fear out of me and come from a place of love, from divine love?\n\"Am I using compassion?\" Compassion for myself and compassion for others, and ultimately,\n\"Do I reach that state? \" The highest rung on the ladder, if you will, when Rumi said, \"When you are born, a ladder is placed before you to help you to escape from this world.' And so to understand that you're in this world but you're not of this world, and when you reach the top of the ladder, the top rung on that ladder of divine love, you realize that, yes, you are doomed. You have been. You're to be a writer, you're to do all these things, but you also make choices and course corrections along the way, just like the choice you make about how your body is going to be.\nWhen you understand that, when you understand that you showed up here for a reason and a purpose and, \"Now I'm gonna be willing, I'm gonna be fearless, I'm gonna be determined, I'm gonna be passionate,\" then you can live your life without regrets. I just read a book called The Five Regrets of the Dying, by a woman in Australia who is a hospice nurse, and she interviewed people every day who were dying, and asked them what were their regrets.\u00a0\nShe wrote a book about it, and the number one regret of people who were under her hospice care, the number one regret of the people dying was, \"I wish I'd had the courage to live my life the way I knew I should, rather than listening to other people tell me what to do.\" That's the essence of it all.\nJames Altucher: \u00a0 That's really important, because as you said, you're doomed to make your choices, but if you don't make your choices, you're even more doomed.\nDr. Wayne Dyer: \u00a0 Absolutely, absolutely.\nJames Altucher: \u00a0 'Cause someone else is making the choices for you. And on that note, Wayne, I really appreciate you spending the time and on this interview. I really want recommend I Can See Clearly Now. It's a great book, it's inspirational. I also recommend all of the books that you referenced in the book and in this interview, because I think they're all transformational books, and again, once again, thank you for coming on this show and being interviewed.\nDr. Wayne Dyer: \u00a0 It's my pleasure. God bless you.

These concerns may be valid, but it often just means a change in both how and what we remember.\nOne of the most common questions that Josh gets is about remembering people's names. For this he has a great memory hack: Create a secondary association with the thing you're trying to remember. For people's names this can be a funny association with the sound of their name.\nFor prose, associate it with a song or rhyme.

What started out as an innocent experiment turned into a cultural phenomenon and lucrative business.\nHot or Not was a website that allowed users to upload their photos to the site so that other users could rate them as \"hot\" or \"not.\" Soon after, a dating site was added, and a new form of internet speed dating began.\nHot or Not was part of the dawn of social media, preceding Youtube, Facebook, and sites like Tinder.\nJames shares his observations of human nature and how the site proved age-old truths about attraction.\nPeople who submitted the photos were, for the most part, confident enough to know the site was all in good fun. Others took it too seriously. In the long run, \"hotter\" people found the site and stayed based on the reaction to their photos.\nJames and his partner built the site as a side project that started out with an invite to friends \u2013 and grew to 30 thousand visitors.\nOnline source photos were used to begin the concept of the site. James estimates about 100 photos were used. Within 7 hours, the site was populated with real users wanting to be rated.\nThe instant success was a little overwhelming for James and his partner.\nMachines and internet service were much more expensive in the early 2000s. So much so, the site was almost shut down because the equipment couldn't keep up with the site!\nThey moved Hot or Not to GeoCities, and changed the future of the site. They made a deal with Ophoto as an affiliate. The final step was a business deal with Rack Space, which hosted the site for an exchange of publicity.\nCompanies called, wanting to buy this new business, but James and his partner wanted to see where it was going.\nJames says that the first year was all hard work. The dating service was the first attempt at monetizing the site. The dating site was linked to Hot or Not, and to go on with the site required one participant to be a paid member.\nJames compares the success of Hot or Not to the early days of reality shows. Hot or Not has been credited with creating 5 to 10 marriages a day.\nHot or Not was eventually sold in February of 2008. With the financial crash of 2008, James and his partner decided liquidizing the company was the wisest move.\nJames has always considered the future of business to be entrepreneur-focused rather than capital-focused. Hot or Not is a prime example of how the internet can make this possible.\nJames's suggestion to the newcomers in this business would simply be:\n\n\"Just do it.\"\n\n\nConcepts don't have to be complex to work.\n\n\nIf the interface works, then don't complicate it.\n\nResources and Links:\n\nYou can reach out to James directly on Twitter @JHong.\n\n\nTo learn more about Cakey, James' new app that helps parents find kid-friendly video playlists, head over to cakeyvillage.com.", "duration": "45:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JA20James20Hong.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1440340766, "title": "AA Ep. 336 - Dominating a Room with Your Body Cues", "author": "", "summary": "What if someone told you that your behavior was controlled by a powerful, invisible force?\nNick Morgan, the author of Power Cues, joins James today to tell the fantastic story of how, after a serious concussion that left him in a coma for about 10 days, Nick lost the ability to read other people he knew.\nHe could no longer read their body language.

It's not necessarily a fashionable thing for hip-hop artists to write and release books, but Luke wants to break down barriers and start a new conversation. In these pages he covers what it was like to be coming up on the scene in Miami and how he changed the game for the better.\nIt wasn't his original plan, but it's funny how things work out the way they're supposed to.\n\"I wanted to be a promoter,\" Luke says of his first career move. As a DJ in Miami, it was his job to play new tracks and bring in unknown artists to perform.\nFinding labels for these artists was impossible. Without any labels in the South willing to sign, Luke created his own. He took his creative energy and his business smarts to help these artists sell their skills and see their success top the charts. But with this success came a bit of backlash from women's groups, politicians, and even fellow artists who did not respect his knack for sampling and reworking songs, film, and television into explosively sexy dance tracks.\nThat was all part of the game, though, and Luke was conscious of every business decision he made. His technique?\n\"I would plan my album releases alongside bigger album releases so people would see it in the store. My album covers would hook you in.\"\nTricks like this can lead you to success, but you have to be prepared for any criticism that comes your way \u2013 even one in the form of a lawsuit.\nWhat Luke learned from his experience can apply to all of us who are struggling to start and succeed at our own business ventures.\nI've noticed that successful people always have someone coming after them, and not necessarily in a good way. \"We live in a world where all you have to do is get people to complain, then they'll target you,\" Luke says.\nSo how do you counteract this target?\nKeep fighting...\nThat's why he put fight in the book title. \"It is hard to beat the machine,\" he says. \"But you can put some dents in it, and you can make people think. You can fight against the machine... [and] put the pressure on the machine to change.\"\nLuther Campbell's experience through the ins and outs and ups and downs of the music industry is cataloged in his new book, and the way he performs under pressure is inspiring.

On today's show, I talk with him about his new book, Are You Fully Charged?, and with it, he offers key insights into finding the happiness and passion you need to feel fulfilled in your work and in your daily life.\nWith over 5 million copies of his books sold worldwide, Tom knows what inspires you and what hinders you. He also knows what you can do to overcome your own personal weaknesses to build a better and stronger business within yourself.\nI had some specific questions to discuss with him during this show, and his practical answers and optimistic perspective will definitely kick start your quest for meaning in your life.\nWhen it comes to finding meaning, the best place to start is a book. \"I read a lot of books out there, especially in the business field,\" Tom says.\nHe recommends taking the information you find in books and applying it to your day-to-day business in order to stay grounded in the goals that matter.\nBy breaking down your goals into daily, achievable objectives rather than wide-ranging, extensive ideas, you are more likely to succeed and to learn more regarding your success.\nAnd when you take charge of your own learning in this way, you take charge of your own motivation, which is the most powerful tool in your arsenal when it comes to achieving happiness.\nUltimately, Tom wants us to start living every day like we have to do something that will leave an impression long after we're gone.\nIn order to do this, we have to continue to seek new ways to be motivated.\nMotivation and happiness go hand in hand, and that's Tom's secret.

A lot of times men just need a little more help being organized and getting their lives together than women do. As James says, \"Women just grow up faster.\"\nBrett's wife Kate is also his business partner. While there are many advantages to having your spouse involved with your business, it also introduces the difficulty of separating work time from personal time. Even during dedicated work time it sometimes is hard to clearly define roles and responsibilities in the business. This is a theme that spans most business relationships, but generally your business partner isn't also the person you share a bed with each night.\nBrett keeps it simple by living by the mantra that both you and your spouse should \"Seek to Serve Each Other.\" This doesn't need to be an equal relationship all the time. Go out of your way to be generous and giving to your loved ones.\nThe Art of Manliness is currently publishing blog posts, podcast episodes, and videos about how to live well as a man in the modern world. As opposed to many of the existing Men's publications, The Art of Manliness is geared toward slightly older, professional men, and isn't focused on how to have six-pack abs or toe-curling sex for 5 hours every day. There are professional tips, parenting tips for men, and what some may call \"Old Fashioned\" advice that men can take to live a better, more fulfilling life.\nThe site is currently experiencing revenues in the high six-figures-per-year range, and has been publishing consistently this entire time. As James has recounted before, it often takes 4 or 5 years to change your life, \"Choose Yourself,\" and create the reality that you want.\nBrett gives advice on how to grow a site like he has with today's social media and sharing tools. He is a big advocate of \"Guest Posting\" on other blogs as a way to increase your reach online. The age of the solo blog is slowly going away. Today, sites like The Art of Manliness, with guest contributors, allow for a diverse set of voices and perspectives that one single person could never give. To make it easier on the site you're looking to guest post on, do most of the work for them. This includes image formatting, sizing, tagging, and including a scope of what type of post you would like to submit for that site.\nDigging into some of the more popular posts on the site, James and Brett discuss a few key topics:\n\n\u2022Regarding Minimalism, Brett and James discuss how trying to be minimalist often leads to an obsession with the things you do have. Instead of just focusing on having things, even if it's fewer things, both advocate spending your time and money on experiences. This has been scientifically proven to increase happiness and is a great way to parent, as well as live your life if you don't have children.\n\n\n\u2022The concept of Antifragility applies not only to the financial markets, as originally described by Nasim Taleb, but also to many aspects of everyday life. Health, fitness, engineering, women's health and vitality, and even society in general all experience aspects of Antifragility. We can all do things today to increase our Antifragility and be less susceptible to the trials of life. The redundancies in our lives can also increase Antifragility.\n\n\n\u2022The Art of Manliness closely mirrors a lot of the topics that James has written about time and time again, including Integrity. Until very recently the term Manliness meant not only physical strength but to be a man of virtue. This theme holds true through all of Brett's website, and is helping to bring back a better way of life for men.\n\n\n\u2022Bringing back some of the older-style manly characteristics includes being decisive and leading in relationships. Gender roles can often get complicated by stereotypes and social norms but the fact remains that in most relationships there needs to be a leader. And many times modern women are looking for the men in their lives to be that leader.\n\nIn parting, the one piece of information that Brett thinks that women need to know about men is that most men are very attuned to status. How people perceive men is something very important to many, regardless of what they may say.\nYou can reach out to Brett directly on Twitter @ArtOfManliness or check out TheArtOfManliness.com for much more of Brett's writings.\nResources:\nBrett McKay: The Art of Manliness Book Collection\nNassim Taleb: Antifragile\nScott Eyman: John Wayne The Life and Legend\nRegards,\n\u00a0\nJames\n\u00a0\nP.S.\u00a0Recently, James caught up with\u00a0New York Times best-selling business author (and former\u00a0guest) Mark Ford.\u00a0The two had dinner and batted\u00a0around ideas.

In The Untethered Soul, Michael explained ways to find inner peace. He also found himself on the other end of a phone call from Oprah, who loved the book and wanted to interview him on her show.\nHe never thought of giving an interview.\nHe made it a point not to.\nWhen The Untethered Soul came out, he paid for marketing but said he would not do interviews... That is, until Oprah called him directly.\nThey talked on the phone for 45 minutes and he went to Chicago. That was his first and only \"in-person\" interview.\nThe \"second in-person interview\" was... You guessed it, the one with Claudia and me, \"because there was something there.\"\nClaudia and I\u00a0 both e-mailed separately and a bunch of coincidences made our name stand out. One woman who lives on the grounds had read Claudia\u2019s yoga book. Another woman tweeted with me.\nAnd so here it is.\nMichael just released a second book, The Surrender Experiment, which details his journey following his spiritual awakening as events unfolded in front of him, including running a multibillion-dollar company and finding himself embroiled in a lawsuit.\nMichael, who also goes by the name Mickey, founded the Temple of the Universe in Florida in 1975. It's a nonprofit organization established as a yoga and meditation center where, according to the site, people of any religion or set of beliefs can come together to experience the inner peace Michael talks about.\nThe Temple of the Universe is where Claudia and I caught up with him.\nOn the day of the interview, Michael took us to all the sites he mentions in the book.\nHe took us to his house, which came to him when God called on the phone (an amazing story in the book). It has a meditation pyramid on the third level. I kid you not.\nIt was the first house built on the property with all glass on the front... It was where he was staying when the guy dressed in Egyptian clothes (a story that is not in the book but is on the podcast) helped him grow by bothering him.\nHe took us to the temple, of course, where we sang devotional songs ranging from the Gayatri Mantra to a Hebrew devotional song to the Our Father prayer to the Gita... and on and on...\nHe also showed us the huge\u00a0 five-building office space that \"him getting out of the way\" co-created while he was a CEO. It's a beautiful place of which he calls himself \"the groundskeeper.\"\nIn the interview, we talked with Michael about his books, the inner awakening he experienced, and how it has affected him personally and professionally. He explained how we can all achieve a similar state of being. He broke down some of the ways to do that, including:\n\n\u2022Quieting the noise in our heads, which keeps us from achieving a high level of awareness\n\n\n\u2022How fear affects us\n\n\n\u2022Allowing events to unfold and how to deal with them as they do\n\n\n\u2022Letting go of personal preference\n\n\n\u2022How to live harmoniously rather than in a state of mental chaos\n\nMichael stated that it's important to relax and be in the moment and that our inner state is meant to be healthy. He said we need to surrender to the unfolding of the universe, and by doing so, we will flourish and life will become phenomenal.\nThe Surrender Experiment is Michael's journey as he applies it to his life and the results he found from living in a state of surrender to the universe.\nHope you enjoy,\nJames\nLinks and Resources Mentioned in the Show:\nMichael's website can be found at untetheredsoul.com.

The car he was driving crashed head on into a truck. His girlfriend, sitting next to him, was unscratched.\nThe roof of the car sliced open his head, causing brain damage.\nBones in his face, his arm, all over his body were broken and he was in a coma for six days (during which time his girlfriend broke up with him). When he woke from his coma the doctors told him he might never walk again.\nYou are the alchemist of your life. The universe, perfect for 14 billion years, has given you everything you need to thrive.\nAnd yet...we often want to forcibly change the universe to fit our own selfish needs.\u00a0\nWhat idiots!\nI'm sure Hal did not want to hit that car. Did not want to be told he might not walk again. Did not want to go through years of therapy and misfortune as a result of this single event.\nThis is where alchemy comes in. We're all given this chance at some point in our lives. We're all given the tools to turn misfortune into gold.\n15 years later Hal is a father, runs a successful business, and is a bestselling author of the book \"The Miracle Morning\".\u00a0\nWhy I love to podcast is because I can just call Hal up and say \"Can I talk to you about this book?\" So I did on \"Ask Altucher\" a few weeks ago. What a great scam podcasting is!\nThe universe is a contradiction. It is infinitely open and yet we can't escape it. It is 99.9999% empty and yet is filled with everything. Atoms bounce around totally randomly and yet defined by the most precise equations.\nEinstein said \"God doesn't roll dice\" and yet...every moment is unpredictable.\nWe'll never understand the contradiction and we shouldn't try. Trying has led to myths, to misconceptions, to wars, to anguish\u00a0\nHal didn't fight what the universe had dealt him. He turned the fear and the pain and crushed it down into a diamond.\nThe diamond he now calls his \"miracle morning\" routine that he put together bit by bit to save his life. And now by he uses that same routine to save the lives of thousands of others.\nI like his routine because it fits perfectly into what I call \"The daily practice\" of choosing yourself: striving to improve every day 1% across physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.\nAfter I spoke to Hal I put together this infographic describing his method.\nDifferent parts of our brain are activated when we read facts as opposed to when we read poetry. Because facts we try to remember... and poetry we try to unravel a mystery of words mixed with art.\nWe're so ignorant and lonely and overwhelmed by this vastness - this story that tells everything but reveals nothing. And yet we're all in it together.\nWhat if every moment we turned the facts of our lives into poetry. To give up trying to assign meaning and turn all of our periods into question marks.\nDoing these daily practices, or miracle morning routines, is how we begin to unravel that mystery.\nMaybe this one thing is the only thing I really believe in. The rest...I'm wide-eyed and just born and want to learn.\nMy grandfather used to say to me when I was little, \"if the universe had an end, what's on the other side?\" He'd keep repeating it, because we both were trying to figure it out.\nMy brain hurt trying to think about it.

David is the author of several books on achieving your financial goals, and doing so while reducing stress along the way. With titles including Automatic Millionaire, Smart Women Finish Rich, and Smart Couples Finish Rich, David has become an absolute authority on choosing yourself first. Or as he says, \"Pay yourself first.\"\nWith financial troubles being the leading cause of friction and divorce amongst couples, David has found several key ways that families can manage their finances easier. Steps couples can take to improve their financial lives include:\n\n\u2022Talking about small purchases more often.\n\n\n\u2022Twice a year, work with your spouse or a financial advisor to monitor your personal financial statement.\n\n\n\u2022Have a vision for your financial future. This clarifies every decision you make in your financial life.\n\nDavid is a big advocate of \"The Latte Factor\" and doing small things to save money every day. This helps people overcome the biggest obstacle to better financial behaviors: getting started.\nWhether you're an entrepreneur or an intrapreneur, the thing you can do that will have the most effect on your financial path is to increase your income. For entrepreneurs, this means increasing your rates. If your services are indispensable to current customers, they will gladly pay a higher rate. If you're working within a company, getting a raise on a regular basis is the way to go. Be valuable to your employer and they will gladly reward you.\nThe digital economy and the passing recession have given us a unique opportunity to reinvent ourselves. While many people are having to do this at an older age, David has a few key actions people can take to get on this road, even if it's later in life:\n\n\u2022Spend Less.\n\n\n\u2022Setup an automatic saving plan. Pay yourself first and allow compounding to do its magic.\n\n\n\u2022Meditate regularly.\n\n\n\u2022Journal immediately after you meditate.\n\n\n\u2022Focus on what is making you unhappy, AND what you can do to help make you happier.\n\nLinks and Resources Mentioned in the Show:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022To access more of David's insights on how to be successful at managing your finances, head to Smart Couples Live- Enter coupon code \"tour\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022You can learn more about David and his works on FinishRich.com\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022Follow David on Twitter at @AuthorDavidBach\n\u00a0\nIf you're looking for a financial planner, David and his team at Edelman Financial Planning can help you reach your goals", "duration": "42:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JA20David20Bach-final.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1434481125, "title": "Ep. 116 - Robert Kurson: A Life's Obsession With No Way Out", "author": "", "summary": "If you're into hunting for buried pirate treasure then this is the show for you. Today I'm very happy to welcome bestselling author Robert Kurson to the podcast.\nRobert has just released Pirate Hunters: Treasure, Obsession, and the Search for a Legendary Pirate Ship. This is the second book featuring John Chatterton and is about his quest with John Mattera to find the ship of the infamous pirate Joseph Bannister. Bannister, a gentleman and business owner working with shipping companies in the Caribbean, one day turned pirate and stole a boat named The Golden Fleece, setting off on a pirate's adventure for years.\nTreasure hunting may seem like a romantic,\u00a0 childish notion, but most treasure hunters are often seeking adventure, encountering huge adversity in their search and often risking all to solve the mysteries they encounter beneath the water. Chatterton (a police officer) and Mattera (a commercial diver) worked all week, used their savings, and spent every free minute of their time searching for this long lost ship.\nShadow Diverswas Robert's first book featuring Richie Kohler and John Chatterton on their quest to solve the mystery of a WWII German U-boat found off the New Jersey coast in 1991 and how the questions surrounding this discovery would haunt these men, their marriages, and ultimately challenge every aspect of their lives.\nIn Robert's first book, Crashing Through, he tells the story of Mike May who was blind from the age 3 and regained his vision at age 46 via a rare stem-cell transplant procedure. May had lived a very fulfilling life as a blind person, and actually delayed doing this procedure for over a year.\nRobert learned the lesson of storytelling early on. Growing up he was regularly brought out of school, sometimes for extended periods of time, to travel the country. By age 8 he had visited all 48 continental United States. This time away allowed him to get a first-hand sense of the power of storytelling. This unconventional upbringing also empowered Robert to discover and follow his passion from an early age.\nRobert recounts how he found himself utterly miserable living the life of a typical day-job employee. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he feels lucky that he was miserable enough to have the courage to do something as daring as leaving a high-paying, comfortable job to pursue his passion, just like John Chatterton did years ago.\nRobert and James agree that a good barometer of your happiness in a job is how you view the people you work with. If you enjoy the people you're working with then you can be happy at your job. If you don't enjoy being around attorneys, for example, then there's virtually no chance you'll be happy at work every day as an attorney.\nThanks so much for listening\nRegards,\nDavid Newman\nP.S.

His story is a good example of how to build loyalty. You can use his experience to create loyal teams and partnerships in your life and work, too.\nThe moral of the story here is not how you find success. It's what you do with it that matters.

Oh, and also her husband Alex Ikonn. Don't want to confuse anyone!\nWhen I was a kid I didn't think I would be happy unless I was a \"millionaire\". Some kids in my school said they were millionaires and they would make fun of anyone who wasn't.\nI asked my dad what he was worth. He said $2. Maybe that scarred me so much that I always make sure to have wads of $2 bills on me at all times.\nA year or so later his company went bankrupt. So he wasn't worth the same anymore. In his mind, he was worth ZERO.\nFor the rest of his life he sat in the living room, depressed, and listened to music. When he was a little boy he loved music and won an award.\nAt some point we all return to what we loved as a child. I suppose that means I will return to comics, Judy Blume, and spying on people.\nA few weeks ago I met Mimi Ikonn and Alex Ikonn. I was insanely curious about them.\nHow come? Because Mimi makes videos of herself, delivers real value to people, and then makes over a million a year because of those videos.\nI don't know how old Mimi is. She's much younger than me. She's much younger than my father ever was when I was alive. He would've liked to live her life.\nSo Claudia and I asked Mimi and Alex if we could interview them.\nBecause they seemed very happy also. The podcast comes out later today but here's the summary.\nThis is a simple post. How to make a million.\nI am absolutely sure the same techniques that worked for Mimi and Alex can work for anyone. I had them lay it out step by step.\nA) EMOTIONS\nMimi became obsessed with beauty and hair. She and Alex watched before and after videos of women who were getting hair extensions.\n\"They seemed much happier after getting extensions,\" Alex said. \"Whenever there are strong emotions about something you know there is an opportunity.\"\nSo Mimi started making videos of herself discussing hair and beauty and hair products.\n\"I never thought I would get more than 1,000 views,\" Mimi said. \"But I loved doing the videos. And I wanted to share my love for the topics with as many people as possible.\"\nNow she has had a quarter of a BILLION views on her videos with 2.7 million subscribers.\nB) HUB AND SPOKE\nPeople ask: \"How do I get traffic to my blog\". Or \"how do I get buyers of my book.\" or \"How do I get people to follow me on Twitter.\"\nA lot of it is about loneliness. We sit in our house writing blog posts and then hit Publish. We want family to love them. We want friends to love them. And then we want the world to love them.\nI'm really just talking about myself. I know when people enjoy things I do, I feel as if I have a family. I'm happy. At least until the next post.\nMimi loved making the videos but needed traffic.\nSo they did the only two-step technique that gets traffic online for anything you want to do. Well, make it a three-step technique.\n1) Love\nKnow more, love more, express more, bleed more, than anyone else. Was Mimi the only one doing videos on beauty and hair? No. But maybe she put more passion into it.\n2) Spread the Love\nAlex would take images and posts and links to her videos and spread them on Pinterest, Instagram, blogs, other sites and have them all point back to her YouTube channel.\nI call this \"the Hub and Spoke\" approach. Youtube was the hub, with a dozen or so spokes reaching out to popular sites that all would link back to the hub.\n3) Make more Love\nNo matter what you do - some will be good and some will be bad. Not every video or post is going to have views. So you do more.\nWhen you do more, several things happen:\na. More people find you\nb. You rank higher on search\nc. You improve\nd. People who find you start clicking on your older videos so now they start to get more views.\nThe \"Make More Love\" technique always works.\nMichelle Phan did 54 YouTube videos before she made a massive hit.\nHugh Howey had already ten novels before he published \"Wool\" which became a massive bestseller. Clayton Christiansen applied for NASA for 18 years in a row before they accepted him.\nMake more love.\nC) 1000 PEOPLE\nNote she said she only thought she was going to get 1000 viewers. The number 1000 keeps coming up with people who have HUGE audiences.\nKevin Kelly wrote about this in a great post called \"1000 True Fans\". He writes about it kk.org. He also talks about it on my podcast.\nTim Ferriss talks about how every one of his posts he makes sure he's going to deliver value to at least 1000 people.\nOf course he delivers much more value than that. But 1000 seems to be the right number that people who know seem to focus on.\nKeep focusing on delivering value for a 1000 and then they tell 2 friends and so on and next thing you know you have a quarter of a billion views, five bestsellers, movies being made about you, you go into space, your own makeup lines, and on and on and on, depending on what it is you love.\nD) BUY LOW, SELL HIGH\nAlex and Mimi noticed that many of the other beauty videos were talking about a specific brand of hair extensions for women. So they went to my favorite place in the world - the mall.\n\"We saw these products were priced at $500,\" Alex said. \"So then we went on Ali Baba and saw the same products being sold for $100. We then went to the manufacturers and saw we could buy directly for $50. The exact same products that were being sold for $500.\"\nThey borrowed from mom. Borrowed their full amount off of their credit cards. And they placed an order. Then, I imagine (they did not tell me this) they prayed.\nE) SOFT SELL\nMimi talks about many products on her videos. She expressed a radiant, confident personality and talks about everything she is wearing, what her habits are, what products she uses. She NEVER sells anything.\nBut underneath the video is just a link. www.luxyhair.com.\nThe orders came in one at a time. Then 100 at a time. They sold out of their inventory, paid everyone back, and bought more.\nIn their very first year (2010) they had over a million in revenues. Ever since then they've had more than a million a year in profits. Never once using the words \"buy this\" anywhere.\nF) QVC-A\nThe most successful people have a model for their success. I think that's why I enjoy Peter Thiel's \"Zero to One\" book so much. Or Peter Diamandis's \"Bold\". Or Marcus Lemonis's TV show \"The Profit\".\nEach book has a different, but very very simple, model for how to achieve success or how to judge which companies are successful.\nMimi and Alex developed their own model, they stick with it, and have used this simple model to keep jumping from success to success.\nAlex explained it to me:\nQ - Quality\nEverything they do is quality. The cameras they use for videos (\"But not overdoing it, because this is YouTube and not television,\" said Mimi). The setting they use and how it fits their message.\nThe products, etc\nV - Value\nMimi is not trying to sell anything in her videos. She explains what she does and how she does it. She does the research and believes in the products. Rather than asking, she is giving.\n\"When you give a billion dollars in value,\" Alex said, \"you get a billion dollars or more back.\"\nC - Consistency\nI read a book about television once by TV mega-executive Grant Tinker. He was Mary Tyler Moore's husband, ran NBC for awhile, and then ran MTM productions producing such shows as \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"Bon Newhart\", and a dozen other super hit TV shows.\nI only remember one thing in the book.\nHe said, \"whenever they changed the time or date of a show, then that show would die. If you moved a show from Tuesday at 8pm to Thursday at 8:30pm then you just lost your whole audience.\"\nMimi said, \"if you are going to put out a video once a week, put it out once a week. Put it out the same day each week if you can. Don't do once a month. Don't do random. Your audience starts to anticipate and look forward to your shows and knows when to expect them.\"\nA- Authenticity\nMimi only talks on the videos about what she believes in. There's no fluff. There's no pitch. She's exuberant and it shows on each video.\nH) LESS\nMimi and Alex were working 80-100 hour weeks. They had the money in the bank. They had achieved their goals. They loved what they were doing but when you hit a lifelong goal you start to ask, \"is that it?\"\nThey got depressed.\nGoals are a myth. Our ancestors for 200,000 years didn't have goals. Every day started from scratch: hunt, forage, eat, sex, sleep, wake up to a new day.\nThen we were told to find our \"goals\". And now everyone asks, \"I'm 17 years old and feel like I've accomplished nothing in life. What should I do?\"\nLearning to find happiness with less is true wealth. Claudia and I recently got rid of most of our belongings, for instance. Then we started cancelling most meetings that I had set up. Sometimes it was hard. I had agreed to an event and then I would cancel.\nUltimately we are the sum of our experiences and not the sum of our belongings. There is nothing wrong with making money but it is only one small part of living a life of comfort, of compassion, of calm.\nMimi and Alex started to focus more on the other things that were important in their lives. \"And you know what happened?\" Alex said. \"The more we did that, the more money we made.\"\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nI really enjoyed talking to them. I am always curious how people made money through a channel like YouTube. Now I know and I think it can be replicated by anyone who is willing to do all of the above.\nI'm afraid I don't have a face for YouTube. Or Instagram. And I'm not even sure I have a face for podcasting. But I think I love doing what I do.\nAnd I like having the time to explore other interests and ideas.\nAnd then sometimes I like doing nothing at all. There's nothing wrong with that also.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\u00a0\nP.S.

He was fat. He hated his work. He was unhappy.\nA few years later, he ran, swam, and biked 703 miles in seven days when he was 45 years old.\nWhen he was 40, he had a job he hated, but he was still trying to live the American dream: the two cars, the beautiful family, the partnership at a law firm.\n\"I thought I was having a heart attack on the staircase,\" he said. \"I was 50 pounds overweight. I was working 80 hours a week. I wasn't happy. I was going to die.\"\nThat moment on the staircase was one of three or four turning points in Rich Roll's life that forced him to say: \"I have a small window to change for the better.\" And then he did it.\nBut what's interesting to me is that Rich Roll is an addict. I'm an addict. Many people I know are addicts. Many addictions are bad for you. When I was younger, I was addicted to just about everything that could possibly be harmful to me.\nRich Roll, when he was 31 years old and a high-priced lawyer, had to check himself into a 100-day rehab center after he was drunk driving the wrong way down a one-way street.\nWhile in rehab, he noticed something interesting. \"At first it felt really horrible, and then it felt better.\"\nWhen he was 40, he wasn't drinking, but he threw those obsessions into his NEXT unhealthy addiction.\n\"I was living on the window diet\" \u2013 if you can drive up to a window and order the food, then that's what he would eat. Like three Wendy's cheeseburgers.\nHe threw himself into the lifestyle of top lawyer, 80 hours a week, eat whatever you can. But that moment on the stairs made him realize, with heart disease in his family, that he was at risk.\nSo he started a seven day cleanse. All juices.\n\"In the first three days I felt horrible, but I knew from my experience in rehab that it would get a lot better.\"\nAnd it did. At the end of the juicing, he felt incredibly energetic and cleansed.\nThis was his third addiction. Gradually he went from juicing to a \"junk vegetarian\" style (pizza, etc.) to real plant-based vegan lifestyle.\n\"I had so much energy, I couldn't stop moving. Even sitting at rest I couldn't stop tapping my leg.\"\nSo one day he went for a run. He ran 24 miles. His biggest run prior that was 8 miles!\nAnd that was 22 years earlier. Sorry, Rich, if I'm getting the numbers slightly wrong.\nAfter that, he realized this was some latent ability that was coming out so he started to train.\nHe trained every day. He started running in Iron Man competitions. Then the competitions got more and more intense until he did his 700 mile Hawaii run. Five Irons Mans in seven days.\nThis was his fourth addiction.\nHe was named one of the 50 fittest men in the world.\nBut he was still a lawyer part-time and training part-time.\nHe wrote a book about his lifestyle. He started giving talks for free and going to conferences.\nSpreading the word on this healthy lifestyle that had changed his life invigorated his relationships and catapulted him to become one of the healthiest people in the world.\nThis was his fifth addiction. He couldn't stop spreading the word about what was happening to him.\n\"It was hard at first,\" he said. \"I wasn't getting paid and I was traveling everywhere.\" Gradually he started making a living at his new career and he gave up his job as a lawyer.\nHis book The Plantpower Way\" is about to come out, describing his lifestyle even more.\nRich and I are one year apart in age. I can't even run down the block, although I try to live a healthy lifestyle.\nPeople always demonize addiction. It's bad! Don't be an addict!\nBut there are positive addictions.\n\"Well-being\" is being addicted to three things: competence, positive relationships, autonomy. And maybe one more thing: Growth every day in all three of those areas.\nIf you do those things, I can tell you that you will feel well-being today, no matter what else is going on in your life.\nThe first few days or weeks or months are really hard, but then, as Rich says, \"suddenly it gets better.\"\nWhen I was talking to Rich for an upcoming podcast, he would use the same language often when describing a bad addiction and a positive addiction:\n\n\u2022\"I noticed I had to change.\"\n\u2022\"It was hard at first to get over it but I knew it would get better.\"\n\u2022It was all-consuming for him and obviously, negative or positive, he loved the lifestyle.\n\u2022His family and friends were super-supportive and those were the people he gravitated toward.\n\u2022When he went from negative to positive in his life, he also suddenly went from AMBITION to MEANING.\n\nThere are a lot of great books about habits and developing positive habits. A positive habit might be: brush your teeth twice a day or make your bed in the morning.\nWhat's the difference between a habit and an addiction? I think there is a gray area here but roughly \u2013 a habit you can control. An addiction feels out of your control.\nI bet that if Rich didn't exercise for a week, he would feel physically ill. I bet exercising and health are addictions for him.\n---\nWhat happened to Rich Roll?\nHe told me that during his time in rehab, someone asked him, \"are you a human being having a spiritual experience or a spiritual being having a human experience?\"\nHe said the question threw him off. He had never even thought in those terms before.\nIt was always the straight line: school, law school, lawyer, partner, family, two-car garage, retirement.\nWhat does that question even mean?\nThe truth is: it doesn't have to mean anything. It just has to make you think. It has to give you a little bump off the straight line.\nIt has to tear you apart a little inside so you realize there's a world outside the one you've been living in.\n---\nI try to turn on my inner addict every day. I look at what I'm doing and I try to be competent, have good relationships, and have the freedom to do what I want. Or I try to grow toward those things.\nMaybe it means meeting new people. Or to be creative in some way. Or to try to get better at something. Or to start saying \"No\" more to the people who are trying to direct my life in ways good for them but not for me.\nIf I do that, I know I will get excited and my inner addict will turn on. And everyone's inner addict is different. I will NEVER run 100 miles. Or even one mile.\nBut every six months, my life has changed almost 100% as a result.\nIt's a gradual process. You can't be a \"positive addict\" overnight.\nBut when you \"invest in yourself\" as Rich told me he started doing, the universe conspires to help you find the right answers to questions that have no meaning.\nI'm an addict and proud of it.\nRegards,\nJames\nP.S.

It's a fascinating topic completed in conjunction with a 10-year project with National Geographic.\nIt's not about just making it to 100; it's all about being healthy and active at 100, still enjoying life, and contributing.\nAs Dan says, \"they are repositories of wisdom and human experience, and that's an asset that is frequently diminished in our society and really celebrated in Blue Zones.\"\nIf you want to live to 100, you should really learn the lessons of those who have lived to that age.\nIs it biology? Is it the environment, diet, attitude, or something else, or is it a combination of all of the above?\n\"A long, healthy life is no accident. It begins with good genes, but it also depends on good habits. If you adopt the right lifestyle, experts say, chances are you may live up to a decade longer.\n\"The recipe for longevity, Buettner has found, is deeply intertwined with community, lifestyle, and spirituality. You won't find longevity in a bottle of diet pills or with hormone therapy. You'll find it by embracing a few simple but powerful habits, and by creating the right community around yourself.\"\nIn Blue Zones, age is celebrated, but here in the U.S., we warehouse our old people.\nIf you're interested in living to a healthy and happy 100 years young, then I suggest you read Dan's new book, The Blue Zones, and listen here to this podcast.\nRegards,\nDavid Newman\nSenior Producer of Stansberry Radio\n\u00a0\nP.S.

The man is a true legend in the field of entrepreneurship and investing, having started more than 100 companies, most of which have been successful.\nMy guest today is New York Times best-selling author Mark Ford. You might recognize Mark by his pen name, \"Michael Masterson,\" but I also wouldn't be surprised if you've never heard of him. Unlike other business and financial \"gurus,\" Mark is intensely private and has deliberately kept a low profile over the past 30 years. He has been a silent force behind the careers and ideas of many of the smartest people in investing and entrepreneurship.\nMark's accomplishments are as impressive as they are varied: he has built more than 100 businesses... amassed a fortune in the high eight-figure range... climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, speaks four languages... is a best-selling author of nearly 20 books... and at 64, he still wears his Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt five times a week as he spars with men half his age.\nBut before you check out the interview, we forgot to include an important piece of information during the show. Mark agreed to give away one of his most popular books to my listeners.\nWe start out today talking about what Mark calls, \"becoming an intra-preneur.\" Not everyone can quit his or her job tomorrow. As an intra-preneur, you have to become the most valuable or one of the most valuable people within the company where you work.\nMark then tells me about two very different negotiation techniques that he has learned from two of his mentors. They couldn't be more different.\nMark talks today about the three sides of every business and which one you want to be a part of.\nAnd as Mark says, \"You have to promote yourself.\"\nPlus, this is only part one of this amazing interview.\nMake sure you go to markfordbook.com and learn how you can claim your free copy of Mark's book, Living Rich: How to Live as Well as a Billionaire on a Middle-Class Budget.\nRegards,\n\u00a0\nJames Altucher", "duration": "53:48", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7c/05/e1/7c05e117-a54f-5ed4-cd68-d3bb9347ee46/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/altucher/JAS2010220Mark20Ford20Part20120final.mp3?dest-id=172343", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 794030859, "seriesTitle": "The James Altucher Show", "pubDate": 1427393827, "title": "Ep. 101 - Moises Naim: The End of Power", "author": "", "summary": "As James and Mois\u00e9s dive into this conversation, they talk about a shift in power from West to East and North to South, from presidential palaces to public squares, from corporate giants like Microsoft to Google, to today's unknown startups.\nIn The End of Power, Mois\u00e9s argues that power is not merely shifting and dispersing, it is also decaying.

Most people can tell you the exact date and time that this tsunami of inspiration and passion washed over their brain cells, rendering them helpless to the immutable forces that drive the human spirit.\nMy Big Bang happened on February 9, 1964 at 8:03 p.m.\nThat night, I (and 73 million other Americans) saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show. I was 11 years old, but I emphatically told my mother that I wanted to be a rock 'n' roll star on that very night. Over the next couple of weeks, after reading every Beatle magazine that appeared magically the day after the Sullivan show, my actual goal started to crystallize: I wanted to make great rock 'n' roll music, play to screaming girls, get a gold record, and be a millionaire!\nLike many entrepreneurs who are first starting out, I had no idea how any of this was going to happen. I just knew that it had to happen. But achieving your goals not only takes passion, it takes patience.\nI did finally get that gold record. It happened in July of 1984, 20 years and five months after I set my goal. It was a long journey, but it taught me every lesson that I ever wanted (and didn't want) to learn, including how to market a brand, how to negotiate deals, how to handle a crisis, and how to manage some big personalities. But without passion, without that Big Bang, I would have never had the drive to get started \u2013 or to keep going.\nNot only is he the lead and rhythm guitar player for Twisted Sister, but he backs up Dee Snider's lead vocals and is the owner of the Twisted Sister trademark.
