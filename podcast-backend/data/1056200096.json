Two wealthy Philadelphia commodity brokers bet on whether anyone, even down-and-out Eddie Murphy, can be trained to become a successful trader. What you might not realize is that something very similar happened in real life. In this week's Odd Lots, we examine the amazing tale of the Turtle Traders. In 1983, successful commodities speculator Richard Dennis took out a full-page ad looking for novices to train in the art of trading. His novices -- who did spectacularly well -- studied for just a few weeks and were dubbed his \"Turtles.\" Joining us to tell the story is Michael Covel, who wrote a book on the Turtles, and Jerry Parker, a former Turtle who still trades using the same technique today.", "duration": "36:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/14/27/2d/14272d17-5b21-9ce3-a85c-b211c33ef484/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/14/27/2d/14272d17-5b21-9ce3-a85c-b211c33ef484/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "https://assets.bwbx.io/av/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/v__yaZ.X9EFI/v4.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["business", "podcasts", "news podcasts", "bloomberg podcast"]}, {"seriesId": 1056200096, "seriesTitle": "Odd Lots", "pubDate": 1487972658, "title": "Could Buddhism Save The Global Economy?", "author": "Bloomberg News", "summary": "There's a widespread sense that something remains broken in the global economy.

On this week's Odd Lots podcast, we speak with Michael Mauboussin, who heads global financial strategies at Credit Suisse and is not just an expert on the world of investing, but also on the role of luck in success. As he sees it, trading is like a game of poker, and in poker you want to play against weaker, less-skilled players.
