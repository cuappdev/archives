Mene, Mene, Tekel, U'Pharsin\nCloseup of The Writing: \nBy Rembrandt - www.nationalgallery.org.uk\u00a0: Home\u00a0: Info, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\n  \nTranslation Variations\nFrench version: 6:54-7:34 \u00c0 force de se dire \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 propos de ses ennemis, que le calme \u00e9tait la mort, et qu'\u00e0 celui qui veut punir cruellement il faut d'autres moyens que la mort, il tomba dans l'immobilit\u00e9 morne des id\u00e9es de suicide; malheur \u00e0 celui qui, sur la pente du malheur, s'arr\u00eate \u00e0 ces sombres id\u00e9es! C'est une de ces mers mortes qui s'\u00e9tendent comme l'azur des flots purs, mais dans lesquelles le nageur sent de plus en plus s'engluer ses pieds dans une vase bitumineuse qui l'attire \u00e0 elle, l'aspire, l'engloutit. Une fois pris ainsi, si le secours divin ne vient point \u00e0 son aide, tout est fini, et chaque effort qu'il tente l'enfonce plus avant dans la mort.\nPublic Domain version: By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death, and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented, he began to reflect on suicide. Unhappy he, who, on the brink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!\nBefore him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once thus ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This state of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity.\nRobin Buss' translation (1996, 2003): \u2026eventually he fell into the melancholy quietude of thoughts of suicide. Woe to the man who, sliding into misfortune, is drawn by such dark thoughts! This is one of those dead seas that seem to offer the inviting blue of pure waters, but where the swimmer\u2019s feet are sucked into a bituminous mire which draws him, drags him down and swallows him up. Once caught, he is lost if God does not come to his aid, and every effort that he makes pulls him nearer to death. - The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas ROBIN BUSS\n\u2022 Bituminous Bitumen - a black viscous mixture of hydrocarbons obtained naturally or as a residue from petroleum distillation.

After getting the flu and then pneumonia last winter, I got flu and pneumonia shots Tuesday morning... in the same arm. This is evidently not something my body liked and it has rebelled. Ungodly pain hits when I move my left arm. But I've currently got it pinned to me, Napoleon-like, and good doctor drugs let me get some rest. So.

The College is in the old Hotel Ponce de Leon, built by industrialist Henry Flagler in the 1880's. It was designed by Carrere and Hastings, who also built the NYC Public Library. The college is celebrating the 125th anniversary of the building this year. For a time it was the nicest hotel in the world, with many original Tiffany windows (that are still there), beautiful architecture and even electricity with wiring put in by Edison. It was The Place to go in winter. It's a pretty amazing building. There is a student run tour twice a day, and it's very popular. It was definitely for the upper classes only. Flagler built another hotel across the street, but it was not quite as nice although It did have a casino and the world's largest indoor swimming pool.  The Hotel is built on land my ancestors farmed in the 18th century. Later, one of my great great grandfathers was a hunting and fishing guide for Henry Flagler and his guests. Hmm, I probably should have read this book a while back, huh? (Heather's Note: I love these brushes with greatness we get! More proof y'all are the best!)  Later, Flagler moved further south, building the railroad that ended in Key West. After he died he was buried in the mausoleum of a church he built here, right near the hotel. In fact, I parked in front of it tonight! His first wife, as well as his daughter and granchild are buried there.  I will attach a couple of pictures, from postcards, that you will find interesting. (I have these cards in my postcard stash. I'm a Postcrosser,) They are fairly self-explanatory. The modern photo shows the dome of the church Henry Flagler is buried in. It's Memorial Presbyterian, although my friend insists on calling it the Presbyterian Mosque. It's pretty elaborate.  The hotel became a college in the 1968. The college is small, but highly rated.  (Also, on another note, coquina is pronounced Ko-keen-a, not Ko-queen-a. It's a Spanish word, so a lot of people make that mistake. I can't remember which episode this came up in. Before Age of Innocence, though.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\nOur Sponsors:\n\nKnit Circus\nLittle Acorn Creations\nPennyWise Consulting, LLC\n\n\u00a0\nCrafty News:\n\nSweet and Simple Baby Crochet (with the cutest bunting EVER)\nHitch: Patterns Inspired by the Films of Alfred Hitchcock\nHalos of Hope Podcaster Throwdown (Our CraftLit-Throwdown group page on Ravelry) The rules are: There are no rules!

Ebooks, special issues, etc.;\nby popular demand and in response to some early feedback, we\u2019ll do a PDF version of the magazine, which will be available via our website and Ravelry. It won\u2019t have the video/audio/interactive functionality of the main version, but for readers who aren\u2019t interested in reading via app, it\u2019ll offer access to most of the content;\neach year, we\u2019ll collect the magazine content into a book book -- think the way Food&amp;Wine or Martha Stewart republishes their \"best-of\" each year.\n\nHopefully having multiple access points for the content will make everyone happy. And by having several digital options, it makes it possible to buy it from anywhere (even Australia and the UK!), because as we\u2019ve learned selling books, not everyone feels like paying the (frankly absurd) postage rates these days. It makes me ill to have to charge half again the cost of a print book just to ship it to Europe, and from a purely capitalistic perspective, I\u2019d rather you put that $12 towards another one of our ebooks! :)\nAnd, more happiness\u2014the husband gets more good press for his book, too!

It won\u2019t have the video/audio/interactive functionality of the main version, but for readers who aren\u2019t interested in reading via app, it\u2019ll offer access to most of the content;\neach year, we\u2019ll collect the magazine content into a book book -- think the way Food&amp;Wine or Martha Stewart republishes their \"best-of\" each year.\n\nHopefully having multiple access points for the content will make everyone happy. And by having several digital options, it makes it possible to buy it from anywhere (even Australia and the UK!), because as we\u2019ve learned selling books, not everyone feels like paying the (frankly absurd) postage rates these days. It makes me ill to have to charge half again the cost of a print book just to ship it to Europe, and from a purely capitalistic perspective, I\u2019d rather you put that $12 towards another one of our ebooks! :)\nAnd, more happiness\u2014the husband gets more good press for his book, too! Yay books! Yay literate people!\n* * *\nAnd my new pattern (that I'm so proud of!): Hunger Games-inspired Life and Death socks\u2014designed for those of us who tend to give their socks a beating. (more details on knitting blog)\nLet me know what you thought of the movie by tweeting a response using this hashtag (#HungerGamesMovie): Question: What did you think of the Hunger Games movie\"? (Thank you @ReneeRico, for the idea\u2014and ditto on selecting a name for a bracelet!)\n* * *\nAudible's Moveable Feast with the excellent reader, Zora Neale Hurston's lovely Their Eyes Were Watching God. \nSoon Ehren and I'll have Gulliver ready for you. I'm racking up moments of the usual start-of-book zeitgeist. (Have you seen the advertisement yet?

(Sorry, no idea how to pronounce that one) On the plus side, they do appear to be easy enough to deal with-all you have to do is force the obour into a bottle using an Eikon, stopper it up, affix the Eikon to the bottle, and then chuck the whole enchilada into a fire.\u00a0 Karen Wessel Just remembered what I've been meaning to mention - not sure if you don't know already but - the \"Leiterwagen\" mentioned in Dracula? the literal translation is Ladder (=Leiter) cart/wagon (=wagen).

Jordan Greenblatt, a Long Island transplant to Atlanta, has a smart and funny Southern wife, a group of jazz musicians for whom he plays bass, and, oh yeah, a one-man PI firm specializing in routine investigations: philanderers, insurance cheats, and other run-of-the mill cases. He also has some personal baggage that will soon be unpacked. Although he enjoys his self-described \"slacker lifestyle,\" he is a bit bored and when a New York businessman asks him to investigate the three-year old hit and run death of his daughter, a woman whom Jordan knew as a teenager, he takes the case. Jordan's main gift as an investigator seems to be his impulsivity, and with his initial lack of either foresight or self-defense skills he manages to ruffle a lot of local feathers in what eventually becomes a very personal quest for justice. Ordover's gifts as a writer include a terrific ear for dialog, excellent pacing, and a sense of humor that is neither cynical nor snarky. He's given us an intriguing supporting cast as well, and I like his taste in classic jazz. After reading the last page I was delighted to see a teaser for a second book in the series. Although fans of feline detectives may be disappointed, I was charmed that the only four-legged cat in the book is Jordan and Susannah's pet cat, Eliot, who has a walk-on part in one scene and who appears to have absolutely no super-spidey-powers of detection.\n\u00a0\nOur GORGEOUS incentive for September/October 2011\n\nfrom Marceli Botticelli's Tea Times Creations!\nTo clarify location and peoples in Dracula somewhat:Who ARE these people Harker is going on about?\n\nSaxons\u2014Germanic people\nHungarians\u2014also known as Magyars (pronounced mad-jar or mad-yar, from Hungarian: magyarok)\nWallachia or Walachia (Romanian: \u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 pronounced [\u02c8t\u0361sara rom\u0268\u02c8ne\u032fask\u0259] or Valahia pronounced [va\u02c8lahi.a]; archaic: \u021aeara Rum\u00e2neasc\u0103, Cyrillic: \u0426\u0463\u0440\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u043c\u046b\u043d\u0463\u0441\u043a\u044a / \u0426\u0463\u0440\u0430 \u0420\u0223\u043c\u046b\u043d\u0463\u0441\u043a\u044a) is a historical and geographical region of Romania.\nSz\u00e9kelys\nAtilla the Hun\n\nThis is what an Aquiline (roman) nose looks like:  \u00a0\nHere's a caleche\nBloggish stuff:\nGrab a button or get more from CraftLit's link to us page\n <center><a href=\"http://crafting-a-life.com/craftlit/?page_id=243\" title=\"a podcast for crafters who love books\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://crafting-a-life.com/craftlit/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/iListenDracula.jpg\" /></a></center>\nOr\n <center><a href=\"http://www.ravelry.com/groups/wwmdfk\" title=\"a podcast for crafters who love books\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://crafting-a-life.com/mamaoknits/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/340x250featuredcolor_KAL.jpg\" /></a></center>\nOr\n <center><a href=\"http://www.ravelry.com/groups/wwmdfk\" title=\"a podcast for crafters who love books\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://crafting-a-life.com/mamaoknits/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/340x250featuredcolor_VT_KAL.jpg\" /></a></center>\n\u00a0\nCHEEKY REDHEAD's CREEPY PLAYLIST:\n\n\"Cruel Spell\" by Big Bad Voodo Daddy\n\"Hell\" by Squirrel Nut Zippers\n\"Dr Bones\" by Cherry Poppin Daddies\n\"Werewolves of London\" by Warren Zevon\n\"Young Blood\" by Norah Jones\n\"Dead Man's Party\" by Oingo Boingo\n\"Kiss of Fire\" by Louis Armstrong\n\"Bad Things\" by Jace Everett\n\"All Souls Night\" by Loreena McKennitt\n\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\" by Sting\n\"Devil With A Blue Dress/Good Golly Miss Molly\" by Mitch Rider & the Detroit Wheels\n\"I Put A Spell On You\" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins\n\"In The Midnight Hour\" by Wilson Picket\n\"That Old Black Magic\" by Keely Smith/Louis Prima\n\nAdd your fave creepy songs to the comments section below! Possible etymologies for nosferatu:\nA leading alternative etymology is that the term originally came from the Greek \"nosophoros\" (*\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning disease-bearing.[10] F.

(The people of Dublin say he was a bloodsucker before writing about a bloodsucker.) Also, Stoker spent his summers around Killarney as a small boy. If one were to go on the Ghost Tour of Killarney, she would hear of the story of a man who lived in the ruins of Muckross Abbey. The man would be a part of living society during the day, but at night, he would retire to the ruins. The towns people would hear horrible shrieks and tortuous sounds from the Abbey that would last until almost dawn. When the sun was close to rising, the man would lie down in an empty coffin and sleep for a few hours. Lore has it that Stoker heard the stories about the man when he visited Killarney. Also, the Gaelic word drochfhuil (pronounced drak-ul) means \u201cbad blood.\u201d I have no idea how much of these stories are true, but the lore around Stoker really adds to the tale of Dracula.\n\nCHEEKY REDHEAD\u2019s CREEPY PLAYLIST:\n\n\u201cCruel Spell\u201d by Big Bad Voodo Daddy\n\u201cHell\u201d by Squirrel Nut Zippers\n\u201cDr Bones\u201d by Cherry Poppin Daddies\n\u201cWerewolves of London\u201d by Warren Zevon\n\u201cYoung Blood\u201d by Norah Jones\n\u201cDead Man\u2019s Party\u201d by Oingo Boingo\n\u201cKiss of Fire\u201d by Louis Armstrong\n\u201cBad Things\u201d by Jace Everett\n\u201cAll Souls Night\u201d by Loreena McKennitt\n\u201cMoon Over Bourbon Street\u201d by Sting\n\u201cDevil With A Blue Dress/Good Golly Miss Molly\u201d by Mitch Rider & the Detroit Wheels\n\u201cI Put A Spell On You\u201d by Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins\n\u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d by Wilson Picket\n\u201cThat Old Black Magic\u201d by Keely Smith/Louis Prima\n\nAdd your fave creepy songs to the comments section below!\nPossible etymologies for nosferatu:\n\nA leading alternative etymology is that the term originally came from the Greek \u201cnosophoros\u201d (*\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), meaning disease-bearing.[10] F.

If you\u2019re a teacher, ChopBard has a new book out for you (see incentive below). Really, seriously, the man\u2019s a goldmine.  If you're a spinner, check out Cotton Spinning with the Takli, a DVD by Joan Ruane. She is a member of my old guild in Tucson and a wonderful teacher. Everyone loves her because she's incredibly loveable. I've not seen her DVD myself--I spent my time watching her in person--but the review in Spring 2011's Spin-Off is glowing. The Quayside sock book I designed for (Knitting Socks from Around the World) is coming out July 1, 2011. I'm now working on a sweater for the same series... we'll see if this can be pulled off. It's going to be a doozy.  In moving news (um, physically moving, not necessarily emotionally moving), If you\u2019re in the Northern Virginia area, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. I\u2019m going to need babysitters and the 411 on local yarn stores etc. Already found (and love) Uniquities in Vienna, VA. LOVE that place! Am learning how to live on no income\u2014or more accurately\u2014to seriously live on seriously one income. I\u2019m also loving Farmer\u2019s Markets and local strawberries. And the color green. It's green here. If you want to see pics and stories of what happened (or didn't) on our trip, you can click on the \"Road Trip\" link in the sidebar of the shownotes. And that Punk bar I mention? That's the Triple Rock Social Club. Must go if you're in Minneapolis/St Paul. Ask if the knitters are there (ha!). Don't forget, there are a few seats left for the Road to Rhinebeck. As fun as the relocation road trip was, Rhinebeck will be even more better. And, in fact, it looks like my husband and sons will be meeting us in Rhinebeck--along with Ehren Ziegler and many many friends. Not to be missed! I also have an apology. I realized I\u2019ve been living under a rock. Not having a job meant never buying anything. Avoiding buying things\u2014meant no stores, no shopping, and no magazines (those suckers get expensive). This means no data in. So my data out has been\u2026 um\u2026 limited. As I left on the trip I got a heartfelt Tweet and Rav message from a listener in Norway who had some\u2014I thought\u2014important criticisms of where the show has been going over the last eight months. I think writing the book, starting a business, teaching while being a temporarily single mom, and moving all really sucked it out of me. But the podcast sincerely is like home to me. I've missed podcasting, I miss hearing from y\u2019all, and I miss the way things used to be, too. So, my promise to you is this: I will try to do better. So many new and exciting things are coming, but much of it will have to wait until the boys are back in school (because right now they\u2019re in \u201cCamp Mom\u201d and there\u2019s only so much of me to go around).

We are trying to provoke Scotland into asking questions regarding women in 2011 by collectively knitting between 60 and 100 million stitches to exhibit as a backdrop to this event. That, my friend, is a 21km scarf... or one massive blanket. Why the big blanket? Demographer's have shown that there are between 60 million and 100 million females missing from today's global population. Sheryl WuDunn's book \"Half the Sky\" investigates the oppression of women globally. Her  stories shock. Only when women in developing countries have equal access  to education and economic opportunity will we be using all our human  resources. We are asking you to get involved.

She is collecting symbolic fabric boobs from all over the world which will be decorated at workshops and made into Make a Boob Art. Make a Boob provides art therapy for breast cancer patients, and raises awareness and involvement through making boobs for the project and exhibition of Make a Boob Art. Art pieces will be donated to hospitals and organizations who work with breast cancer and \u2013patients.  If you would like to contribute you can make boobs and send them to Nina Lise.  You will find the step-by-step directions, mail address etc. on the Make a Boob blog, http://makeaboob.blogspot.com.\nNina Lise\nSome boob's...  \nNew podcasts: \n\u00a0Clothed in the Lamb\nDebra's CraftPatience\u2014http://craftpatience.com\u2014 listed in iTunes and on Podcast Alley, both are linked to from the website.  \u00a0\n\u00a0\nArizona update: I recorded and was poised to post just about when the shootings happened.

The 18-page eBook offers easy-to-print sewing patterns and templates for making seven different handmade bags for every personality and skill level, from beginning stitchers to advanced art quilters. The free eBook of quilted bag patterns includes materials lists and step-by-step directions for every bag, along with beautifully photographed full-color examples.    \u201cThere is such a wide variety of quilted bags in this free eBook, from quilted accessory purses that are perfect for holding your jewelry or makeup when you travel to evening clutches and eco-friendly shopping bags. You might want to make them all. And what I love about quilted bags is that they are the perfect small project for trying new skills, or to show off your love of quilting when you\u2019re out and about,\u201d says Quilting Arts Editor Pokey Bolton.    Beginners can try their hands at an easy-to-assemble Artful Eco Bag, then apply their quilting skills to a Pretty Purse.

You can add some red peppers to the brine.--West India Woman\"\n---\"Receipts,\" New York Times, August 7, 1881 (p. 9) \n [1981]\n\"There are many recipes for pickled lemons and limes. In each you can substitute one for the other. The commonest recipes call for making slits in the fruit without cutting them through. You add salt, which dissolves as it stands. The lemons or limes are left to stand for a considerable period before serving. In India, where pickled lemons and limes--called achar--are served sweet or hot, various spices are added, including cumin, chili pods, mustard seeds, fenugreek and so on.\"\n---\"Q & A,\" New York Times, April 1, 1981 (p. C9)\n[NOTE:  achar' simply means pickle, not pickled limes.] \n [2001]\n\"PICKLED LEMONS\n4 thin-skinned lemons, scrubbed and quartered\n1/4 cup kosher salt\nJuice of 8 or 9 lemons\nIn a 1-quart widemouth jar, combine the lemons and the salt. Add the lemon juice to cover the lemons by 1/2 inch. Cover and store at room temperature, shaking the jar twice a week, for two to three weeks. The lemons are ready when the rind is soft. Discard any skin that might develop on the surface of the jar. If you wish to speed up the pickling process, gently heat the quartered lemons before packing them in lemon juice and salt. To heat, arrange the lemon wedges in a single layer in a microwave-safe dish. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 30 seconds or until the lemons are warm to the touch. Pro ceed as directed above. The lemons will be ready in four to five days.\"\n---\"Internet site reveals recipe for Exotic Chicken,\" Geissler Janet, Lansing State Journal, April 9, 2001, Pg. 3D \nDon't forget to read your Bunyan.", "duration": "01:01:31", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/93/95/d8/9395d8b3-ef95-c347-4661-99b901f14b31/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/93/95/d8/9395d8b3-ef95-c347-4661-99b901f14b31/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/clean/craftlit/CraftLit_93_043008.mp3?dest-id=12285", "type": "episode", "tags": ["sketch", "knit", "knitting", "spin", "spinning", "weave", "weaving", "crochet", "quilting", "pottery"]}, {"seriesId": 151451644, "seriesTitle": "CraftLit - Serialized Classic Literature for Busy Book Lovers", "pubDate": 1209182220, "title": "Episode Ninety-two: Pilgrims Who Progress", "author": "", "summary": "Notes for you!Checkout our yahoo group!

If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ... And what country can preserve its liberties, if it's rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two?

My mouth is\nstill stuffed with gauze and my head is stuffed iwth Vicodan (which,\nsadly, ain't workin' too well).So.Today it's just the\nchapters. I'm sorry about that, but I'll post what tidbits I can here.\nAnd, honestly, you wouldn't be able to understand me talk about these\nchapters a sadder note, my friend Jeannie Townsend (of sock creating\nfame) who has given away literally thousands of sock patterns for free,\nis now supporting son and grandson (this would be the third grandchild\nshe and her DH are raising!!). She is now trying to pay the light bill\nby selling a sock pattern. She's able to accept PayPal for $5 to JeanTownsend [at] earthlink [dot] net. Let her know in the note line that you'd like the Gold Sock Pattern.She also donated a sock pattern which now comes free with the purchase of yarn from the Astrid Dutch Obsessions web site.Some interesting info from Sandi (who, like me, should take up a collection for an OED): \n\nI\nwas just listening to episode 48, and I was curious about the last line\nin Congratulatory, which describes the winding sheet of the candle\ndripping onto Carton's sleeve. I got that it's an obvious omen of\ndeath, but I just couldn't wrap my head around how it would be possible\nto combine a burial shroud and a candle. So, I did a little internet\nsearching and found this explanation: [a] mass of solidified\ndrippings of grease clinging to the side of a candle, resembling a\nsheet folded in creases, and regarded in popular superstition as an\nomen of death or calamity (OED).   Apparently, in Scottish tradition the same association is made between candle drippings and death:\"The\ncommon tallow candle in burning often gutters, and the tallow runs over\nthe edge and down the side of the candle. It soon hardens. When the\nflame consumes the candle, at times the little column formed by the\ngutter is left standing unconsumed on the edge of the candle. It is\ncalled a \"coffin-spehl,\" and is looked upon with suspicion as\nportending a death in the family at no very distant period.\" Based\non those two bits of folklore, I'm guessing that there is an\nassociation between candle drippings and burial shrouds because: a) the\ncreased wax simply resembles the cloth of a shroud, and b) this creased\nwax is what remains of the candle after the flame has burnt out, the\nextinguishing of light, of course, being symbolic of death.And then, there's today's chapters, Book 2, chapters 6, 7, 8.Chapter 6:\nAll About Foreshadowing--really. Nothing should be taken for mere\n\"filler\" in this chapter. Miss Pross and Mister Lorry are lovely here,\nand Lucie, you may notice, is in fact the \"Golden Thread\" that improves\nall it touches throughout the book. She's almost an archetype--certainly\nnot a 'real' woman, but an important tool that Dickens is using in the\nbook.Chapter 7: Back to France. Pay close, close\nattention here. We get a little Madame Defarge here (I wonder what\nshe'd knit?) and while this whole chapter reads like it's an extended\nmetaphor or symbol or grand allegorical moment--it's not. Well...it\ndoesn't hurt to see it that way, but sadly, these guys are real.This\nis an ugly chapter, meant to parallel the earlier chapter of the wine\ncask breaking in the streets. Dickens may not like what the mob is up\nto, but he has no love of the aristocracy either (remember, he wasn't\nborn rich himself).As always with Dickens, whenever he gives you a\nphysical description--listen closely. It's a representative of the\nperson's soul. And speaking of souls, listen for the corruption of\nthese men's relationship with God.Some words for this chapter:escutcheon     the shield of a family crest.\"the merry Stuart who sold it\"     That was Charles II.Convulsionists     Um...think \"Holy Rollers,\" an ecstatic religious groupPalace of the Tuileries     Louis and Marie-Antoinette's digs in Paris.Chapter 8: Lovely guy, eh? Note more red symbolism. And WHO exactly is coming to call at the end of the chapter? Hmmmm?Some words here:the heavy drag     a carriage brakethe chase     the huntthe chain of the shoe     chain connected to the brake (shoe)And then, of course, my heart goes out to the poor students and families at Virginia Tech. I'd like to think that this finally\nwill get us to deal with mental illness responsibly...but I think I\nknow us too well at this point. We'll treat this guy like a freak, and\nthe next time a teacher comes forward and says, \"I have a kid in my\nclass who needs help.\" that teacher will be told:a) if he hasn't made a threat, there's nothing we can dob) you're blowing this all out of proportionc) you're white and he's (fill in the color) and everyone'll just think you're racistd) we can't lock someone up for something they might doe) look, they're just kids.

(funny that) being published in 1898.

His dad was a  Swedenborgian (say THAT three times fast) and I thought--when working through the \"ghost\" question--this quotation was ellucidating:  Although James had rejected in the beginning of his career \"spirit-rappings and ghost-raising\", in the 1880s he become interested in the unconscious and the supernatural. In 1908 he wrote that \"Peter Quint and Miss Jessel are not 'ghosts' at all, as we now know the ghost, but goblins, elves, imps, demons as loosely constructed as those of the old trials for whichcraft; if not, more pleasingly, fairies of the legendary order, wooing their victims forth to see them dance under the moon.\" Virginia Woolf thought that Henry James's ghost have nothing in common with the violent old ghosts - \"the blood-stained captains, the white horses, the headless ladies of dark lanes and windy commons.\" Edmund Wilson was convinced that the story was \"primarily intended as a characterization of the governess\".   Then there's the \"corruption\" question. Ah...the tangled web...  ALERT: I just this second got this email from MaryBeth--right after uploading the 'Cast. Darnit. But it's worth noting here:  Loved your comments on the Fog Index. I'm a technical editor, and I have the following quote by Melville on my wall at work: \"A man of true science uses but few hard words, and only those when none other will serve his purpose; whereas the smatterer in science thinks that by mouthing hard words he proves that he understands hard things.\"   Is that not brilliant?!

The consequence for most is uncomfortable swelling and itching at the site of the bite for a short period of time. However, young children, immune deficient persons and those previously unexposed to mosquitoes are at increased risk for a severe reaction to mosquito bites according to a study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Canadian researchers recently identified this reaction as \"skeeter syndrome,\" defined as mosquito-bite induced large, local inflammatory reactions accompanied by fever.Large local reactions to mosquito bites are under diagnosed and sometimes assumed to be infectious in nature when in fact, they are the result of an allergic reaction. In this study, researchers studied five healthy children between the ages of two and four with no history of allergy to insect bites. Each had been diagnosed with cellulitis, a bacterial infection of the skin and tissue that is usually found on the face, neck or legs. The children developed extreme redness, swelling, warmth and inflammation within hours of a witnessed mosquito bite. Several months later the children were tested for allergy to mosquito. Blood tests confirmed that the children had been misdiagnosed: the symptoms they experienced were the result of an allergic reaction to a mosquito bite, not cellulitis.People with skeeter syndrome should minimize their exposure to mosquitoes to avoid experiencing an adverse reaction. It is important to increase the awareness of skeeter syndrome so those affected can avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and antibiotic treatments.[From: \"Skeeter syndrome.\" J Allergy Clin Immunol 1999;104: 705-707.]\nThe SCA has my hat (I think)!Maybe I should engage in Guerrilla Knitting?Governess Gone GothWEAVING!?!?!

A little discussion of  ChickLit and Austen...  Jane Austen's novels have been repackaged as chick-lit to reflect our modern conception of her as a romantic novelist. But her world is less comforting than we think, argues Laura Thompson...  On 07/09/2006, Laura Thompson created a bit of a stir in the literary world when she said that Chicklit--the girlie romancified summer book lit that's gotten to be so popular among the young--had co-opted Jane Austen, and specifically, Pride and Prejudice.  ...It all started in fine non-literary style: with Colin Firth. The scene in the 1995 television adaptation of Pride and Prejudice in which Colin got his shirt wet was, almost certainly, the moment that opened the door and let the modern world in upon the quiet, oil-lit writing desk at Chawton Cottage. And when Firth played Mark Darcy in the film of Bridget Jones's Diary, the deal was sealed: Pride and Prejudice was on its way to fame and fortune.  Which brings her to a point we've discussed on this podcast:  ...What on earth would Jane Austen have made of it all?  Well, she would certainly have laughed - \"I dearly love a laugh,\" says Elizabeth Bennet, in the voice of her creator - and she would have enjoyed all the money, because nobody was more aware of its importance. Elizabeth and her sister Jane might have charm to spare, plus wit and good temper to keep fear of the future at bay, but their genteel poverty means that the men who marry them are not just lovers; they are personal relief missions from lives beyond contemplation.  And this acute alertness to the significance of money - to the humiliating gulf between the shillings that buy Elizabeth's hair ribbons and Darcy's \u00a330,000 a year - is just one of the many aspects of Jane Austen that has been lost to a contemporary audience.  She goes on to say that too often, readers today just think it's neat that Elizabeth wound up with a rich guy--rather than noting that it was her job to find a rich husband or live a life of drudgery. In reality, loving Darcy is the bonus. The real marriage is that of money.  ....Actually, there is rather more to Elizabeth than the perfection we behold in her (and ourselves). What, for example, is one to make of her ambiguous joke that she began to love Darcy on \"first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley\"? Sir Walter Scott, for one, thought she meant exactly what she said; and I think he had a point.  ....But the novels as a whole are rather less comforting. Indeed, they are, in some ways, terrifying. There is something appalling about the lack of illusions with which Jane Austen viewed her little world. To censor out such a judgment - or to condemn it as \"male\" - is to do her an extreme disservice. And the point she makes next made me feel bad for not making a bigger deal out of what Charlotte did, and why:  Take, for example, the character of Charlotte Lucas, one of Austen's finest, who cuts through the nonsense now waffling round Pride and Prejudice like a particularly acid lemon. Her presence lurks sombrely behind Elizabeth's lovely lightness: the two girls are faces of the same coin, expressions of their creator's joyful esprit on the one hand and cold eye on the other.  Like Elizabeth, Charlotte has a lively mind, but, unlike her friend, she has no physical allure. A quirk of nature has taken her out of the orbit of men such as Darcy. And, because she is plain, she sees the world plainly. She calmly perceives its limitations: the ruthless judgments of its marriage market, the life sentence of inhabiting its tight social circles.  Seeing the world, she also sees the possibility of falling off its edge. \"Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.\" She snaps up Mr Collins, the terrible suitor whom Elizabeth has the freedom to reject. \"I am not romantic, you know. I never was.\" It is almost unthinkable, by today's standards, to do what Charlotte did--but she was wise, and right, and she seems to be \"happy\"...or at least happy enough...  She is the stony reality at the heart of Pride and Prejudice. She tells a woman's story, but in a way that is utterly remote from feminine convention: with scant emotion, appealing to nothing other than rationality. And, like her creator, she has remarkably little to do with cosy readings of The Jane Austen Book Club and communal swoons over Mr Darcy.  ...If Pride and Prejudice can be so easily claimed by the Grazia brigade, why should the other books be any different? It is not difficult, after all, to read what one wants to read in a novel. Every reader does it, to an extent. But the landscape of what is seen in books is becoming increasingly impoverished. Indeed, it might be that the reality of literature no longer lies within its words. As Jane Austen flourishes, the literary sense that she possessed in its most refined form is slowly dying: the irony would have amused her. Hmmmmm...more to think about...

After some introductory comments, a web, magazine, or book review (This week Mason-Dixon Knittng), and perhaps a song, I will include a chapter or two from a book. We will listen to that book until we\u2019re done with it. And because I\u2019m a former English teacher, I\u2019ll give you some things to listen for in the chapters we hear--just to give you something else to do while you\u2019re knitting, spinning, crocheting, weaving, or sewing.
