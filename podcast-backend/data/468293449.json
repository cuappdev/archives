I\u2019ve known him for nearly as long as I\u2019ve been in Los Angeles. I didn\u2019t quite realize how long it had been until we started talking. Man, there were some great times had while we were coming up. Steve is one of the funniest guys I know and he\u2019s also one of the nicest. The fact that he\u2019s not a household name is a sign that there is no justice in the world. But at least it led to some good stories about life on the lower end of the standup totem pole. I hope you enjoy it. I think too often there\u2019s talk of how a particular entertainer made it in Hollywood and there\u2019s never enough attention called to the survival years where you\u2019re just trying to get by while you\u2019re chasing your dreams. We got a lot of those stories in here.
