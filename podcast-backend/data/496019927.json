The analysis focuses on January and February 2017 as they compare to the last 60 years in the market. \n\n###The Study\n\n* S&P 500 Index (SPX) \n* 1950 - Present\n* Analyzed Daily % changes (close to close)  \n* Subdivided and averaged positive days and negative days\n* Compared the average magnitude of negative days as a % of average positive magnitude.\n\n###Results\n\nThere has been a clear drop in the magnitude of daily moves over the last few years, with January and February of 2017 seeing extremely small moves. \n\nNext, the team looked at magnitude of negative days relative to positive days. They found that 2017 so far has seen negative days far out paced by the magnitude of positive days. The only year where January and February matched this year was 1987. \n\nThis doesn't mean the team expects a huge market sell off, just a reversion to higher market volatility. Hear what James, Liz & Jenny have to say!

Though, before doing so, Brittany walks through her Iron Condor in QQQ that she was able to get filled after yesterday's show. Brittany then puts in the last trade from her homework, a short vertical call spread in GLD to capitalize on her [bearish hypothesis](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/from-theory-to-practice/episodes/the-short-side-stocks-bonds-06-20-2016). She explains in detail why she chose this UL and strategy. After that, Dr. Jim begins correlation by highlighting that before any math is introduced with this concept, he wants her to fully understand the intuitive side. This brings the discussion to positive and negative correlation, with multiple examples given to test her \"on the spot\" thinking skills.
