is better used to tell you about the entire weekend in salt lake. never in my life have i felt so welcomed in a city i had never really been to before. never have i felt more important than i did when visiting salt lake city. no amount of voicemails or emails can ever compare to seeing faces in the crowd, and hearing laughs come back at you. in the nearly 6 years i have been doing this show, nothing has ever compared to all the events in utah this past weekend. and as i always say, without you we wouldn't be doing this, and i mean that more than ever. you people gave us an even bigger drive to succeed, because we can't bear the idea of letting you all down. you are an amazing group of people, and we are so lucky to have you as part of the nation. thank you for everything you do for/to us. and thank you for being such an amazing and caring group of people. i wish we could do that every day. \n<br />/eric\n<br />now please to be enjoying the live show from SLC we had a great time doing it and i hope you all enjoy it too. \n<br />thanks to everyone involved in making this happen. we will have a list and talk more in detail about it next week.</p>", "duration": "1:43:45",
