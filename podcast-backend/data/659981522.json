I just knew how to make money.\u201d</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a difference between being an entrepreneur and making money. Entrepreneurs build something bigger than themselves and solve real problems with real customers. You can work your way into a high-paying job and be successful, but you aren\u2019t building anything that\u2019s yours. Are you building a brand, or are you selling things?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Ryan started selling yoga products on Amazon. He started with a yoga mat then he added blocks, towels and other yoga products. He made this decision because there was an audience that already existed, and he identified that audience as likely to be environmentally conscious. He carved a niche for the company as an environmentally-friendly yoga brand and created Facebook groups to target his audience.</span></p> <div>\u00a0</div> <p><strong>Starting a Business From Scratch</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cWho is the audience that you\u2019re serving and how are you giving them a solution? If you can answer those two questions, everything else is super easy.\u201d</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have never started a business and you have a goal to make more money, Ryan believes that there are two parts of the equation that you need to figure out. Before you figure these two things out, everything else is a distraction.</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience that you serve and the pain points that they have</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution that you give your audience</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Losing His Religion</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan was originally going to school to be a pastor. He was questioning his faith and running a business, so he ultimately graduated with a degree in business. Losing his faith made him angry for a while, but he found a place for faith and spirituality during his journey. Ryan is currently working on a documentary called</span> <a href=\"http://losingmyreligion.tv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losing My Religion</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to tell the story of Ryan finding his truth.

The tools and the concepts aren\u2019t completely unique, but the way EOS Worldwide implements EOS with entrepreneurial leadership teams helps them get better at three things fast and permanently.</span></p> <ol> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Vision</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Getting the leadership team a hundred percent on the same page with where they're going and how they plan to get there.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Traction</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Instilling focus, discipline, and accountability everywhere in the organization.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Health</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Helping the leadership team become a more cohesive, functional team rather than the set of strong, independent, headstrong individual leaders that they are. Often those kinds of people have the greatest challenge burgeoning as a healthy team, and so the way EOS Worldwide teaches and the way they work with clients seems to help those three concepts take hold quickly.</span></li> </ol> <div>\u00a0</div> <p><strong>\u201cIt's early success that gives an entrepreneur and his or her leadership team that confidence to continue with, quite frankly, what is fundamental change in the way the business operates.\u201d</strong></p> <div>\u00a0</div> <p><strong>EOS Implementers & The Six Key Components That Exist in Every Business</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally any EOS implementer starts interacting with an entrepreneur when he or she has hit the ceiling. Things are humming along and all of a sudden you come to a screeching halt. It has a tendency to happen multiple times, and the root cause of those problems, challenges, obstacles and frustrations tend to be one of six things. When you're implementing EOS in your business what you're doing is working to assess how weak or strong you are in each of these six things and strengthen each component.</span></p> <ol> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Vision</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Getting everybody on the same page with where you're going and how you plan to get there.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>People</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Making sure you have great people perfectly suited to help you achieve your great vision.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Data</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Learning to run the business on facts and figures, objective information, at a high level that gives you an absolute pulse on the business rather than letting feelings, egos, and emotions carry the day.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Issues</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Learning how to solve your issues as they arise, in the right place in your organization.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Process</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Not having a clear, simple, high-level set of core processes that everybody in the organization can follow so that the most important things in your business are done the right, best way every time, without you having to coach and mentor and audit and nudge people out of the way.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Attraction</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 The ability to instill focus, discipline, and accountability everywhere in the organization so that you and all your people are executing on the vision every day rather than getting distracted.</span></li> </ol> <div>\u00a0</div> <p><strong>\u201cMy advice would be to work on strengthening all six of these components.

Winters. Most entrepreneurial companies are started and grown to a point by a visionary who then has to, in order to be successful, transition more into an integrator role. It's really hard to make that transition. Very few have what it takes to do it, and one of the things Mike does with entrepreneurial leadership teams is help visionaries understand that they don't need to be the integrator to grow their business. \u201cThey should be sitting in the visionary seat loving their lives everyday and relying on an integrator to run the day-to-day and help the leadership team work to achieve the visionary's vision.\u201d</span></p> <div>\u00a0</div> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Visionaries</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 \u201cThe classic entrepreneur. They\u2019re idea people. They have 20 ideas a week and believe that every one of them is going to take the organization to the moon. They\u2019re creative problem solvers. They're the people asking what if, why can't we do that, how about we mix this up and try this. They\u2019re risk takers. They like to fly at 30,000 feet and when they need to bring the plane down to refuel they lose energy.\u201d</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Integrators</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 \u201cPeople who are put on the planet to harmoniously integrate the way a handful of strong-willed, independent humans work together to achieve a common goal. They like getting in the muck and looking at data, figuring things out at the core. They don't mind refueling the plane or putting it in the shop and fixing it from time to time to make the company execute better\u201d</span></li> </ul> <div>\u00a0</div> <p><strong>Five Rules to a Great Meeting Pulse</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every level-10 leadership meeting should be:</span></p> <ol> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the same day</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the same agenda</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always start on time</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always end on time</span></li> </ol> <div>\u00a0</div> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We appreciate Mike taking the time to talk with us today.

He got voted in the hall of fame by hitting just over 300 for his career. That means he strikes out a lot, but he was still great. The nature of business is trial-and-error. Through failure and perseverance, by identifying your strengths and weaknesses, anyone can discover their core competency in business.</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWinners are the ones who fail and don't give up.

Just go out and do it. Don\u2019t mature and double down and spend marketing dollars when you\u2019re in makeup mode. Sometimes you're in developing a strategy mode and then when things start to click is when you have to slow down, and not slow down sales but slow down. You have to find the tension between being able to break away a little bit and look at it, instead of just being fully immersed in it</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tipping point is when you get to a critical mass \u2013 and Vinnie describes the critical mass as when you start being unable to grow beyond your shadow or you already have grown beyond your shadow and you've lost the passion piece of your business \u2013 and you need to start addressing this big issue.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>The Six Core Areas of Business</strong></p> <ol> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Owner\u2019s Mindset \u2013 \u201cIf your foundation\u2019s not secure, then anything you build on top of it is not secure.

Not only thinking about it, but actually writing it down. I call it creating a movie script for your life.\u201d</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years, three months and 17 days after Craig first articulated his vision to his coach \u2013 owning a business like Early to Rise \u2013 Craig bought the business of his dreams.

Mark told Craig to narrow his focus and set four goals:</p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One for your health</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One for your wealth</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One for your social self and</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One for your personal enrichment or charity endeavors</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>How To Build Your Perfect Day</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is incredibly important. If you learn to optimize your day, and you just focus on your daily habits, your perfect day becomes your perfect week becomes your perfect month becomes your perfect quarter becomes your perfect year. This is the highest leverage point to be focusing your time and energy on if you\u2019re going to be making some sort of habit change.</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure out how you best operate.

Was it to actually grow it to 18,000 people and monetize it, or when you got that thing started what was going through your mind?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8:48 \u2013 What I'm always curious about from entrepreneurs is what it actually looked like for them to start that first thing that blows up. Was there a big strategy and planning going into it? Or did one day you just say, \u201cI can make this better,\u201d and you threw up a group and kind of said, \u201cI'm just going to see how this evolves?\u201d</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10:17 \u2013\u00a0What was that first event? What kind of details do you remember about that very first event?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11:15 \u2013 There's going to be a large percentage of listeners who might have been to MeetUp groups, but they've never started their own MeetUp group. So what kind of event did you promote for that very first one? What was the positioning? What did people opt-in to?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13:45 \u2013 If you were advising somebody to start a MeetUp group, what are some of the key elements for an event based on what you\u2019ve learned?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">19:20 \u2013 How do you measure the success of any individual MeetUp?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">21:25 \u2013 When you're talking about potentially evaluating the success of a MeetUp based on money, what do you mean? Are these events that you're charging for? Or are these events where you meet great people and get clients?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24:15 \u2013 Now, from the time of that first event, how many events should I be holding? Like, what's the path for me getting to my first event where I can actually make money off of it in some way?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">27:35 \u2013 Give us some of the overarching concepts that you teach to people about the best ways to network at these types of events.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30:10 \u2013 What's the strategy around the the pre-networking?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35:17 \u2013 What kind of thing would you say to the leader of the group if you're contacting them on social media before the event?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">38:05 \u2013\u00a0So let's just pretend the listeners are a total blank slate. They are introverted. They're not sure the best way to go up and start introducing themselves to new people. What does that look like?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">42:40 \u2013 Tell me about the follow-up.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">45:50 \u2013 What's the most influential book that you've read in 2016?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47:30 \u2013 How can people deal effectively with their fear? How do you get beyond fear mode to go out there and take action, rather than what fear mode does to most people, which is it makes them sink back into themselves?</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>How to Launch a Successful MeetUp Community</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create compelling copy \u2013 be it about who the group is or what it\u2019s going to be all about.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let the group grow, until it has about a 150 people, before the first event.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have a sizeable group, announce that you will launch in four weeks.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the title of that event, there's something to do with launch, because people are going to dig that.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optional: Keep the event free to encourage registration. If it is popular, you can add a price to the second half of tickets sold.</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>A Path to Monetization in MeetUp Groups</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After your MeetUp group has grown to about 150 people and you are ready to launch your first event, you might want to start looking for a path to monetization.</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ticket Sales \u2013 After you have developed social proof for your group \u2013 with either a number of well-rated or popular early events, or with a large number of ticket sales \u2013 you can start charging a little bit for tickets. If an early event is picking up steam, you can sell the last half of the tickets for a little bit of money. For later events, start the price at only a couple dollars and raise it incrementally. The early purchasers will give your event and group the social proof it needs to sell more expensive tickets.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sponsorships \u2013\u00a0It is possible to make quite a bit of money through sponsorships, but you have to go out and find them.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers \u2013 It is possible to get a great speaker, even if you don\u2019t have a very large group. If you can prove that you can get a moderately-sized group, maybe 50-100 people, and you can make the opportunity convenient for your speakers (e.g. they\u2019re already in town), then you can attract a great speaker and create an affiliate partnership.</span></li> <li style=\"display: inline;\"> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe've had one event with a Canadian speaker with 208 people where he closed just over 40,000 pounds\u201d</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Tips For Pre-Networking</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first few minutes of a networking event can be one of the most awkward experiences ever. So, to make it easier on yourself and on the people you want to network with, do a little pre-networking. Get in touch with them on a social network or by email and make an introduction.</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you contact people, try to establish what you specifically need connections for.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laser focus on the people who are specifically related to what you need. If you don\u2019t need anything specific, connect with the people that are the most influential.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go in with a positive, open energy and an interest in other people</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply ask, \u201cDo you know somebody that has these qualities or what I'm looking for?\u201d</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to the leader of the group, because they are likely one of the most influential people there, or they are a person everyone will want to connect with. Be very short and concise. Simply ask, \u201cHey, I found you. You're the leader of this group. You look awesome. Would love to connect with you, I\u2019m going to come to the next event.\u201d That\u2019s it. If they follow up and show interest, then you can give a very short \u2013 just one sentence \u2013 pitch on what you are looking for. If they do not show interest don\u2019t push them, because this will just push them farther away.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou do whatever it takes to find out who's going to be there, and you connect with them on social media. Super, super, super, super powerful and important.\u201d</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Preparing And Delivering Your Pitch</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over practice your pitch. Don\u2019t just remember it. Practice your pitch so well that you can\u2019t forget it, like your birthday or phone number. Then, when you are talking to someone, don\u2019t open with your pitch. Ask them questions about them. Then, when they ask what you do, they will be interested.</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBe the first person to ask the questions so you are right in there and creating trust, because the more questions you ask, the more you listen to them, the more they like and trust you\u201d</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat you want to do is you want to just try to create trust. Try to create a friendship here. Just go with creating human connection. That's all you're trying to accomplish, and that's one of the big secrets to to networking success. Forget about your pitch, forget about yourself, and truly just try to establish a great connection, finding people that you seem to gel with.\u201d</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Common Mistakes in Networking</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Showing up late. You have to show up early, because there are group dynamics being established in the first few minutes. If you show up late, you\u2019re kind of an outsider.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitching too much.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being too self-oriented, instead of being them-oriented</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not following up</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patrick\u2019s</span> <a href=\"http://patrickmpowers.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Send Patrick a friend request at</span> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/PatrickMPowers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.facebook.com/PatrickMPowers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tell him that you heard him on the Starting From Nothing Podcast, and he will give you a really big, cool gift.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are going to be on London and want to meet the people at Entrepreneurs in London, visit</span> <a href=\"http://entrepreneursinlondon.co.uk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EntrepreneursInLondon.co.uk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li> </ul> <p><br /> <br /> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Production & Development for The Impact Entrepreneur Show by</span></em> <a href=\"http://www.podcastmasters.net\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podcast Masters</span></em></a></p>", "duration": "52:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/d3/67/15/d3671568-e237-324a-0dce-754fb2e2972a/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/d3/67/15/d3671568-e237-324a-0dce-754fb2e2972a/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/thefoundation/Episode_174_-_Patrick_M._Powers.mp3?dest-id=137086", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 659981522, "seriesTitle": "Starting from Nothing - The Foundation Podcast | Building your business ENTIRELY from scratch.", "pubDate": 1476093600, "title": "SFN173: Rob Walch on Starting A Podcast: Pro Tips For Entrepreneurs", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rob Walch, recently inducted into the Podcast Hall of Fame, is the VP of Podcaster Relations with</span> <a href=\"https://www.libsyn.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libsyn</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and hosts the</span> <a href=\"http://www.podcast411.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">podCast411</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">podcast. \u00a0His books, \u201cPodcast 101\u201d and \u201cTricks of the Podcasting Masters,\u201d are available on Amazon and iBooks.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, Rob outlines his tips to entrepreneurs interested in starting a podcast, including when and why to monetize, how to use a podcast to build credibility in your niche, and the importance of providing great content in podcasting. \u00a0Rob also discusses his opinion of where the future of podcasting is going.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>In This Interview I Ask:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2:50 - What were you up to before you got into the podcast world?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6:45 - When you say clients, what do you mean?

Most likely, the people you are pitching don\u2019t know you or your product or service well enough to know your full capabilities.

Tension produces chemicals in the mind - epinephrine and norepinephrine - which give us pains of excitement.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can be afraid to say something that might insult the buyer, or give them a negative view of our company, that we don\u2019t end up triggering any tension at all, positive or negative. Without that tension, the pitch falls flat and the buyer lacks the enthusiasm.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you only are providing excitement, you're only doing half of the formula. You also have to trigger tension in order to provide a different kind of arousal for the buyer.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid becoming antagonizing in your attempt to create tension, start small and build up.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to:</span></p> <ol> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have fun</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communicate that you aren\u2019t needy</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let the buyer know you\u2019re in control of the sale through multiple successions</span></li> </ol> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>How To Close Your Presentation</strong></p> <p><strong>You cannot end a sales presentation with, \u201cThat\u2019s what we have.

You have complete control over me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because a buyer is ready to sign, doesn\u2019t mean that the deal is closed.

Why is this so important?<br /> 36:53 - Why is [<em>entrepreneurship</em>] potentially a better option than a pure entrepreneurship model?<br /> 39:26 - What skill sets or lessons did you need to learn to go from one million, and then to fifty million, and then to 250 million? What are the distinctions and that sort of growth?<br /> 41:43 - What does it look like for you to be the vision and the culture side of the company in terms of what you do in a day?<br /> 43:34 - What does your \u201cpainted picture\u201d look like for the next three to five years?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Learn in the Way That Works Best for You</strong></p> <p>In the world of business, there're so many ways to learn. Brian\u2019s style of learning had always been getting out and talking to mentors, finding real-life people who had been where he wanted to go and learn from them. It all depends on what you're doing. If you're learning to code, you don't necessarily need to go to college. If you're learning to be a doctor, you probably should. Lots of successful people have gone the route of the classroom and studying to get an MBA. Find the method that works best for you.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Overnight Success Stories Take a Long Time</strong></p> <p>As entrepreneurs, it's worth reminding ourselves that \u201covernight success stories\u201d take a long time. It took Brian ten years to generate his first million dollars in revenue. There's so much talk of people getting into tech and building the next billion-dollar app, but those are truly unicorns. They do not happen very often. Real businesses are the ones that take time, take that passion that never wanes, and you're just constantly giving to try and really grow your company.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Systematize Your Business</strong></p> <p>Write down all your business processes into a documentation of how your brand does everything. Systematizing became the foundation for <em>1-800-Got-Junk\u2019s</em> scaling. Brian took everything in his business, how he answered the phone, how he price jobs, how he resolved customer complaints, how he marketed the business when things were slow or busy; and compiled it on a one-page checklist of \u201chow you do this the 1-800-Got-Junk way\u201d.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>\u201cInspect What They're Expecting\u201d</strong></p> <p>When it comes to customer service, always ask, \u201cWhat we expect, is that getting delivered?\u201d A CEO shouldn\u2019t ever get so far away from the front lines. You have to connect. You have to check in and you have to \u201cinspect what you expect\u201d, even as you continue to grow a business.</p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>The Keys to Growing a Business Successfully</strong></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <ol> <li><strong>Have a Vision of Where You're Going</strong></li> </ol> <p>\u201cIf you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there\u201d. It knows exactly where you're going. You don't have to figure out exactly how to get there until time starts progressing and you start figuring out the how. The vision is all about where you going. What's the destination?</p> <p>Imagine pure possibility. What could the future look like if only you could imagine it? Write down on a sheet of paper that your business would look like, feel like, and how you\u2019d act at a point in the future.</p> <p>Example: The \u201cpainted picture\u201d for <em>1-800-Got-Junk</em> was a five-year vision that they would complete by December 31, 2003. It said they'd be in the top thirty metros in North America. It said they would be on The Oprah Winfrey Show. It said they would build the \u201cFedEx of junk removal\u201d, but with clean shiny trucks, friendly uniformed drivers. That painted picture compelled Brian to start seeing the future, and he shared it with friends, family, co-workers, and new hires so that everybody would see this vision and make a decision if they believed, or if they should be doing something different.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <ol start=\"2\"> <li><strong>Find the Right People</strong></li> </ol> <p>It's all about people. It's people that make businesses grow and succeed and thrive. Find the right people.</p> <p>Ask yourself, <em>who\u2019s the team? What does the team look like? What are the right seats?</em> Bring those people in who have the same shared passion for your vision and towards building something bigger together. Hire and train them. Give them love and support and everything they need to be successful. Treat them right. Never compromise on the quality of people that you bring into your organization.</p> <p>However, keep in mind that no one will <em>ever</em> be as passionate about <em>your</em> business as you are.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>What is an <em>Entrepreneur</em>?</strong></p> <p><em>Entrepreneur</em> stands for two things: opening doors to a new opportunity and then working together, building something much bigger together than anyone would have ever chosen to build alone.</p> <p>An <em>entrepreneur</em> is someone who isn't going solo. They're not flying solo. They're building something together and what's awesome about our <em>entrepreneurs</em> is once they've had their own runway and started becoming successful, they recognize that the fastest way for themselves to grow, is taking other employees they have and saying, \u201cHey, have you ever thought of running your own business, of living the American Dream? I think I can help\u201d.</p> <p><em>O2E Brands</em> is a cheerleading organization. They set a vision and help everybody work together towards that common vision. They also provide opportunities. They open doors and say \u201cCome on in. Take the risk\u201d. They invest with <em>entrepreneurs</em> and help introduce them to people could partner with one another to build a successful moving business or shine-our-window and gutter cleaning business in a new market.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Show Links:</strong></p> <p>1-800-GOT-JUNK, <a href=\"http://www.1800gotjunk.com/\">website</a></p> <p>O2E (Ordinary to Exceptional), <a href=\"http://www.o2ebrands.com/\">website</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "46:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/d3/67/15/d3671568-e237-324a-0dce-754fb2e2972a/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/d3/67/15/d3671568-e237-324a-0dce-754fb2e2972a/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/thefoundation/Episode_170_-_Brian_Scudamore.mp3?dest-id=137086", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 659981522, "seriesTitle": "Starting from Nothing - The Foundation Podcast | Building your business ENTIRELY from scratch.", "pubDate": 1471001212, "title": "SFN169: Andrei Mincov On the Importance Of Trademarking", "author": "", "summary": "<p>Andrei Mincov is the \u201ctrademark guy\u201d and founder of <a href=\"https://trademarkfactory.ca/\"><em>Trademark Factory</em></a>. He earned his PhD in law and worked for the biggest international law firm in Russia doing intellectual property work for the likes of Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, J. K. Rowling, DreamWorks and more. When Andrei moved to Canada, he went from being a hotshot lawyer to a nobody. It wasn\u2019t until he read Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em> that he decided to start his own firm.</p> <p>In this interview, Andrei teaches us about what a trademark does, and why it\u2019s better to trademark before you launch your company rather than later.

What did you find?</p> <p>22:56 - Let\u2019s say I\u2019ve got a vision of building a lifestyle business, and it\u2019s going to be $100k a year, roughly, is there any value in me going out and trademarking it if I have no intention of going bigger?</p> <p>24:33 - Does [having a trademark] raise my value if I\u2019m eventually going to sell a company? Is that going to allow me to get a bigger price for my business when I sell it?</p> <p>27:42 - Are you educating people through your marketing on why they need trademarks or are you just doing traditional marketing in the traditional sense where you are making yourself known to people who are looking for a trademark?</p> <p>32:46 - What is the cost [of trademarking] dependent on, or is there a flat cost for me to go out and get a trademark?</p> <p>36:39 - Where can we go if we want to see some educational [trademark] cartoons?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>What is a Trademark?</strong></p> <p>A trademark is anything that allows the market to tell your stuff apart from identical or similar products or services of your competitors.</p> <p>The trademark has nothing to do with protecting the product or service itself but has everything to do with the way people identify it.</p> <p>The more competitive the environment, the more important the branding becomes because everyone is doing the same thing. It\u2019s so easy to copy those ideas so the only thing that will allow you to have the competitive advantage is to protect the brand.</p> <p><em>\u201cIf you don\u2019t protect your competitive advantage, you don\u2019t have a competitive advantage.\u201d</em></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>3 Reasons Why Protecting Your Trademark is Vital for Any Business</strong></p> <ol> <li>It\u2019s the cheapest and easiest way to minimize the risk of receiving a lawsuit<br /> Without trademark protection, a company may decide to register your brand as their trademark. They can then demand that you stop using your brand and rebrand yourself or pay them money</li> <li>It makes it easier and cheaper to go after competitors who come up with similar trademarks.</li> <li>It allows you to build a brand and asset for your business.</li> </ol> <p><em>\u201cIf you\u2019re running a business [and] you don\u2019t think the value of the business is more than a few hundred thousand dollars, basically it\u2019s a hobby. It\u2019s not a business.\u201d</em></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Trademark Your Brand Before You Launch</strong></p> <p>All the big, hot startups (like Uber, Firefox, Facebook, Google, etc) filed their first trademark applications within the same month, if not many months, prior to launching. One thing that distinguishes these founders from other entrepreneurs is that they believed they could be the next big thing; so they did what potential big things do and protected their assets.</p> <p><em>\u201cTrademarks are all about timing. You need to be the first. Just because your trademark was available yesterday, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be available today.\u201d</em></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Trademarking is Not a Huge Investment</strong></p> <p>The cost of trademarking is marginal is compared to the cost of filing a patent. A patent typically requires tens of thousands of dollars and years of your life.</p> <p>When determining if you should trademark or not, ask yourself the following questions:</p> <ul> <li>Would you be okay with having to rebrand your business?</li> <li>Would you be okay with a competitor using the same brand to do the same business?</li> <li>Is there any value in the brand when you\u2019re not doing the work?</li> </ul> <p>If the answer is yes to all, then you don\u2019t have a business.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>How Trademarks Affect the Sale of Your Company</strong></p> <p>Whenever someone buys a company, they do their due diligence. They check competitors to see if your business may be infringing on someone else\u2019s. They check to make sure all your logos and branding assets are protected. If everything is protected, it makes it easier for the buyer.</p> <p>They\u2019re not just buying your systems, but also your customers and the time that you invested building your brand. If they can\u2019t take advantage of that, that\u2019s a problem.

Having that base understanding of different roles in the company gave Sia the experience to manage his own employees.</p> <p>\u201cI have a policy of hiring people smarter than me and always listening to them, but nowadays everything's gotten so detailed that when you hire people smarter than you and you want to listen to them, if you don't have a base understanding, you can't listen to them.

Eight out of ten small businesses go belly-up in the first year because of passion missing. You have to have the passion to see it through. \u201cYou have to go through the passion and not get slowed down with things that seemed more important than the bigger goal.\u201d. It\u2019s easier said than done.

Lattice structure management is characterized by self-management and has no hierarchy or defined leadership. Every point is in support of every other point. The person closest to the problem is the one that's going to make a decision.</p> <p>\u201cSo I may be the CEO of the company, but for instance, if the janitor comes in and says our vacuum cleaner is broken, it shouldn\u2019t be my decision to decide which vacuum cleaner to buy.\u201d</p> <p>When you empower people, you actually give them passion.

Shares indicate the amount of people who actually enjoyed your content and those people become part of <em>your</em> Also keep in mind that the audience size of the publication you\u2019re writing for doesn\u2019t always produce greater results or shares.

If you don\u2019t have a common affiliation, take the time to read their blog or listen to their podcast. Then share what you found valuable from your experience with their content. They will appreciate you for taking the time.</li> <li>Keep in mind that one lead can connect you to another. Top influences will know and put you in contact with other people in their field.

Either that person you talk to will be the person you need, or you plant the seed in their mind so when they come across a person who fits the mold, they\u2019ll consider making that connection.</p> <p><em>Example</em>: When you touch based with someone and they ask \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d you can say, <strong>\u201cYou know, I realized that I need to surround myself with some really great people who just eat, sleep, breath [topic of expertise].\u201d</strong> When you share these needs with the people who care about you, they naturally feel compelled to help you .</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Strategically show up every day and focus on adding value to one person at a time consistently.</strong></p> <p>Ask each person, <em>What are you working on? How can I help you?</em> Know that they will share a piece of information, and even if you are not their answer directly, you may know the person who is able to help. Either way, you plant the seed and that connection will eventually happen.</p> <p>Never ask a successful person out to coffee to \u201cpick their brain.\u201d This is basically asking them to give you their free time. The answer is obviously <em>no</em>.</p> <p>The moment Geoff learned to become the person who just look to see how can I add value to them to every relationship, he started to find that people bent over backwards to help him.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>How to become a contributor on any publication in three weeks</strong></p> <p>A common rookie mistake in an attempt to become a contributor on any publication would be to try to connect directly with its editor and pitch them your article.</p> <p>Instead, Geoff followed his 3-step process:</p> <ol> <li>He became clear on his goal: Geoff wanted to become a contributing writer on Entrepreneur.com.</li> <li>He started targeting contributing writers. This was the script he used: <strong>\u201cHey, I\u2019m seeking guidance. I see that you\u2019ve written for Entrepreneur. I\u2019m really curious about your journey, and the impact it\u2019s had on you. I\u2019m going through these crossroads in my life, and frankly I wanted to ask for your help. Would you be willing to spend 10-15 minutes with me sharing your journey? I promise I will find a way to add value to you. PS: I already shared your most recent post.\u201d</strong></li> <li>Finally he was recommended to the editor (which shows incredible valuable). He then asked the editor <strong>\u201cHey, how can I make <em>you</em> look good? What does it take to write a great post?\u201d</strong> Then Geoff took the editor\u2019s feedback and went to work.</li> </ol> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Playing the \u201cLong Game\u201d</strong></p> <p>When you meet somebody, you may have a long term hope of how they can help you, but if you just go for the ask, it won\u2019t help you. It\u2019s more rewarding to have a long term relationship.</p> <p><em>\u201c[When] you fast forward to the end of your life, it\u2019s going to be the experiences you shared and the people you shared them with.\u201d</em></p> <p>Every time you approach somebody, they\u2019re a puzzle piece. You have no idea what role they will play in your life, but you figure out where they need help and you file it away.

If not, you need to find new mentors to surround yourself with; mentors who\u2019ve already accomplished what you desire to accomplish.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Pro tip: If you want to surround yourself with millionaires and get them to mentor you, you have to find ways to add value to them.</strong></p> <p><em>Example</em><em>: Ide</em>Geoff knew he didn\u2019t need to know everything about podcasting to build his podcast; he just needed to know the people who did so he set out to become friends with Pat Flynn (Smart Passive Income) and Jordan Harbinger (Art of Charm).</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Focus on One Thing</strong></p> <p><em>\u201cYou have to win a gold medal at something.\u201d - Jeff Hoffman (Priceline)</em></p> <p>There\u2019s so many different options of paths to take as an entrepreneur, so many different types of business models. You need to figure out that one thing to focus on, and go win that gold medal. You need to eat, sleep, and breath that one thing before you scale out.</p> <p><em>Example:</em> Amazon started off with books and won a gold medal buying and selling books. Today they could care less about books because they\u2019ve been able to scale into something different.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Learn About What You Really Want by Taking Action</strong></p> <p>You have no idea what detours you\u2019re going to have to overcome. All you can focus on are the six feet in front of you at a time, but you keep moving. Slowly, but surely you end up getting to where you\u2019re supposed to be going.</p> <p><em>Example</em><em>:</em> Geoff joined the Foundation and began working on his SaaS idea extraction for The Foundation until he realized that Saas was not for him.

Leaders have to mandate simplification and show it by behavior so that team members will focus on work that matters. <strong>The reason a lot of people don\u2019t get rid of stuff is because a leader put it in place.</strong> You need to have a strong leader who realizes that some things have outlived their time and get rid of them.<br /></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>More is Not Better</strong></p> <p>We spend all this time organizing and that\u2019s not simplifying. We also think that doing is more important than thinking. This kind of mindset is what\u2019s keeping us from being innovative. <strong>It\u2019s not always about less, it\u2019s about better.</strong></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Simplification Starts with Leaders</strong></p> <p>You have to have someone who is willing to have a subtractive mindset, and not just an additive mindset, who doesn\u2019t have a fear of getting rid of things. We have this fear of holding onto things because once we have something, we feel like it has value. We\u2019re reluctant to give it up because, from a psychological standpoint, we don\u2019t like to give up value and we don\u2019t like to admit we made a stupid decision. We have to be comfortable to admit that something isn\u2019t working anymore and get rid of it.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Time Versus Value</strong></p> <p>Take an audit of what we spend our time on, and if it has value or not. If it\u2019s not valuable, why are you doing it? If it is valuable, could it be minimized or improve? How can we move it up the value chain to make it take less time and have more value. If it takes a lot of time and has no value, get rid of it. If it takes little time and has high value, you try to model everything after that. If it takes little time and has little value, look at the key levels of simplicity and ask how can I improve the value or decrease the time?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Define What Simplicity Means to Your Company, then Ask Killer Questions</strong></p> <p>You don\u2019t know how to simplify if you can\u2019t define it. An example definition of simplicity is: \u201cTo be simple, it has to be as minimal as possible. It has to be as understandable and clear as possible. It can be as repeatable as possible.
