How well do modern versions of heroes\nlike The Lone Ranger or Zorro work, without their 19th century settings\nand tools? Don't they need the horses and pistols? What about the\nHeroes created in the 20th century? <br /><br />Matt\nasks this question not only about heroes he's currently working on like\nZorro & his upcoming 2010 take on the Golden Age Green Hornet for\nDynamite, who Matt thinks still works best in his golden age era .<br /><br />We also talk about what he has pl<span>aned f</span>or\nZorro in the current arc Tales Of The Fox. Wagner says \"General Moncado\nslowly starts to gather information about this rogue highwayman...and\nit's like Rashomon getting all these different points of view\nindividual stories of who and what Zorro is. At this point he's still\nmore of an Urban Myth.\"<s><br />\n<br />\n</s>On his Green Hornet plans with artist Aaron Campbell \"I'm going to\ntell\nyou why he does it...why does Britt Reid who has a way to fight 1930's\nsocial\ninjustices through his newspaper still need to adopt this alternate\nidentity? ...We also explore Kato's motivations He's Japaneese in my\nversion, and I found a way to weave his origin into a very historical<br />\n\nevent.. We learn why this very skilled martial artist would support and fight beside Britt.\"<br />\n\n<br />\n\nWe also discuss his Vertigo series Madam Xanadu which continues to\ninteract with other Vertigo characters that have strong DC roots . Her\nmain adversary through centuries on conflict is The Phantom\nStranger.but there are other \"easter egg\"\u00a0 character apperances that\nblur the line between the DCU and Vertigo.<br />\n\n<br />\nMatt says, \"Everyone asks me how I'm able to do it, and my response is,\nI'm just doing it. I don't ask (laughs). I do tend to keep those\nreferences as ones that fit into her charcter history and senarios,like\nErtigan, Zatara, and detective Jim Corrigan (The Spectre). Or they\nhappen almost \"off camera\".Like the mystic green lantern showing up in\nancient China, or The Phantom Stranger refering obliquley to the helmet\nof Doctor Fate.

They included DC artist Mike Norton and Chris Crank of Devil's Due (The Crankcast) Marvel artist Skottie Young, Chris Neesman Brian Salazar & Tom Katers (Around Comics) Stevie D and Eric (The Comic Book Queers) and John Siuntres (Word Balloon).<br /><br />Along with the round table discussions, there were informal interviews with other comic pros like J Torres, Tim Seeley, Chris Moreno Jeremy Haun Chris Burnham, Sean McKeever and Brian Michael Bendis. Most of the pros just talked casually about work in general, but Bendis dropped a few comic news items regarding his books. <br /><br />On this special edition of Word Balloon, we present the Bendis interview, moderated by John Siuntres and the Around Comics hosts. <br /><br />Some highlights from the interview...<br /><br />On <b>Ultimate Origin</b> being re-scheduled...<br /><br />Bendis and artist Butch Guice have three issues completed, but some tie-in stories written by Jeph Loeb won't be ready till next year. Plus they didn't want the Ultimate Universe storyline to conflict with Bendis' <b>Secret Invasion</b> miniseries, so <b>Ultimate Origin</b> is getting pushed back until the end of summer 2008. <br /><br />On the ,b>Avengers/Secret Invasion/Illuminati books\u2026<br /><br />When artist Frank Cho finishes his <b>Mighty Avengers</b> arc he will move to the <b>Mighty Avengers Annual</b> featuring an all female Avengers team facing a group of female villains. Mark Bagley then replaces Cho on the series, and he's already finished drawing his arc. After issues #6 and #7 of <b>Mighty Avengers</b> comes out, <b>Illuminati #5</b> will be released. <br /><br /><b>New Avengers #38</b> will be a very special issue focusing on Jessica Jones and Luke Cage drawn by <i>Alias</i> co-creator Michael Gaydos. \"I don't want to spoil the story but it's called \u2018The Break-Up.\u2019\" <br /><br />On <b>Secret Invasion</b>...<br /><br />There are clues to who is a Skrull in some of the thought balloons in <b>Mighty Avengers</b>, so it will be fun to see who can figure out who the Skrulls are, by re-reading those issues.\" <br /><br />On <b>Ultimate Spider-Man</b> <br /><br />\"I got permission to Ultimatize a few villains from the 1967 Ralph Bashki Spidey animated series that have never appeared in any Marvel Comics. \"I was surprised that there didn't have to be any legal wrangling to recreate these villains.\" <br /><br />In fear of the pending 2008 Hollywood writers/directors strikes, the studios are rushing to production with any potential films in the development pipeline. Apparently, this has resulted in some upcoming good news for Bendis.<br /><br />\"Uh yes... in about three weeks, I should have some announcements.\"", "duration": "49:26", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/4d/1e/ba/4d1eba89-40a1-7f32-2f51-726930e98df8/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/4d/1e/ba/4d1eba89-40a1-7f32-2f51-726930e98df8/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/wordballoon/WBbendis24hrpodcast.mp3?dest-id=12360", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 207700416, "seriesTitle": "Word Balloon Comic Books  Podcast", "pubDate": 1191781920, "title": "Robert Kirkman's Zombies Are Chasing Me !", "author": "", "summary": "In this episode of Word Balloon, host John Siuntres begins a two part conversation with writer Robert Kirkman.<br /><br />Kirkman gives us an update on <b>Haunt</b>, his 2008 collaboration with Todd McFarlane, of which the writer says, \"I've written the script for it...we're looking for a May/June 2008 launch.
