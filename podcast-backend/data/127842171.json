He\u2019s been doing it since the darkroom ages. The instructions he was taught back then for developing photos has stuck with him: \u201cIf it is too light, add time; if it is too dark, take away time.\u201d But in the years since, as film gave way to digital, Kevin has learned that time cannot be added or subtracted\u2014only seized or lost. His art as a documentarian, storyteller and photographer is all about seizing the moment, and the meaning within that moment. Kevin is a master at stripping away the nonessential and capturing the essence of a person, place or point in time. The results: emotive portraits and candids, lively magazine spreads, and images that command attention amid the visual clutter that defines the digital age. Before founding Kevin Weinstein Photography in 2001, Kevin spent 12 years in newspaper and magazine journalism. On the newspaper side, he worked for the Sun (Bremerton, Washington), the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Albuquerque Tribune, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Oakland Tribune, and the Sun in Illinois. His magazine credits include US Weekly, People, Hollywood Reporter and Mother Jones. Celebrity subjects include Quentin Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson, Eva Longoria, Mario Lopez, Stacy Keibler, Smeezingtons producer Ari Levine, and Christoph Waltz, among others. Through Kevin Weinstein Photography, Kevin became a sought-after event photographer, and as his reputation and referrals spread beyond the Chicago market, he went on to shoot high-profile private parties and special events in Los Angeles, New York, and exotic and cosmopolitan destinations around the globe. Kevin Weinstein Photography has since come full circle, bringing Kevin back to his roots as an editorial and street photographer. \u00a0 Resources: Kevin Weinstein Diane Arbus \u00a0 Download the free Candid Frame app for your favorite smart device.

He is a Golden Globe nominee, a 2007 NAACP Image Award winner for best writer in a comedy series, as well as a winner of the 2007 AFI TV Program of the Year Award. LeRoi served as a producer and writer on \u201cThe Chris Rock Show,\u201d for which he won an Emmy, a Cable Ace Award, and received five Emmy Award nominations. He is an NAACP Awards Best Director nominee for his work on Everybody Hates Chris, and has directed segments for the \u201c77th Annual Academy Awards,\u201d as well as for the \u201cOrlando Jones Show.\u201d Major motion picture credits include producing and co-writing \u201cHead of State\u201d and \u201cDown to Earth,\u201d as well as producing cult-favorite, \u201cPootie Tang.\u201d Photography for him is meditation, memory, and connection. Taking time to consider what something is. Why something is. Who someone is. For LeRoi photography freezes the fractions of sections in between all of the things he sees and does and holds still all of the places and people he passes by and gives him a moment to consider them, inspect them, appreciate them, and remember them.\u00a0 While he has a focus on people, and exploring the breadth of their condition and their ability to connect to the world around them, as well as their ability to connect with him, he also ventures into architecture as abstract, and it\u2019s collision as form, as still life. Much of his work grows out of a strongly held sense of solitude and a desire to connect to the things around him. He has no hard and fast rules about purity or constraints around editing an image. He does what he feel. And show it. He assumes that his body of work will take on a character as it grows, as he is it\u2019s singular filter. Originally from Chicago, LeRoi currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two sons. \u00a0 Resources: Ali Leroi  Eli Reed \u00a0 Download the free Candid Frame app for your favorite smart device.

His work has been in demand in both the editorial and commercial world. My-First-School is a personal project for Francolini, who has a keen interest in Pakistan's diverse society. Away from the struggles reported by the media, Pakistani people are open, friendly and family-oriented but face serious challenges in everyday life just to make ends meet. Children can be affected more than most.  Education, as expected, can take second place to survival in these circumstances, and Andrea's goal is to help these families send their children to school for a basic education which then allows them to get more out of life - something we take for granted in western society. With your donations, Andrea returns to northern Pakistan on a yearly basis to buy schooling equipment, like notebooks, pencils and erasers, which will benefit the children - especially girls who can find it harder to attend school. In 2013 My First School has started to help build classrooms in 3 existing schools in order to increase their capacities. Again, in 2013 a sponsorship program, which guarantees schooling for 5 years, has also been set up. At this stage 8 students are already part of the program and hopefully each year more will be added to the list.

It became a reason for him to step out from a dark place, which he had struggled with for some time. The dark world in which he knew so well would soon come to light after being released from prison in 2011. His inspiration derived from many great documentary photographers, such as Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Helen Levitt, Garry Winogrand, and William Klein, just to name a few, but it was Bruce Gilden and Klein's street photography that made Donato realize that he could scream through his images. His work is a constant search that's forged out of his own curiosities. They're derived from his own interpretation of people, as well as deep rooted moments in the physiological confines of his mind. \"I love the amazing differences in people and how beautifully unique we all are. Good bad or indifferent; People never cease to amaze me, they often answer many of my own questions. The littlest detail, maybe in the eyes or the way someone walks can be the difference of making a photograph\".

She is interested in problematizing the idea of the perfect or official memory, by seeking moments of fragility or un-preparedness for the camera. Inhabited by upper middle-class social rituals, ideas of celebrity and beauty, upper class leisure, animals from a private zoo, beauty queens, or young wealthy children, she seeks to represent a fractured version of the images and situations that are traditionally understood to bring status and/or respect. Her experience growing up in the border has established in the way she views her subjects as well as the photographic practice itself, where she constantly looks for blurring lines between portraiture and documentary as well as explores the pulsating space between the perfect image and one that social studio photography could consider an error. When producing work, Venegas believes in the relationship to the world via a camera as well as via her participation in situations over long periods of time. Anthropological curiosity and empathy are both essential elements of her practice. An important outcome for her work is printed and framed for gallery presentation, as well as in book form. She has published three books Maria Elvia de Hank (2010), Inedito (2012) and Gestus (2015), all by the editorial house RM. \u00a0 Since 2009 Yvonne lives and works in Mexico City with her husband and two children. \u00a0 Resources: Yvonne Venegas http://yvonnevenegas2.weebly.com/ \u00a0 Elaine Stocki http://www.art.yale.edu/ElaineStocki \u00a0 Download the free Candid Frame app for your favorite smart device.

Her current projects seek toreinvigorate the meditative and provocative nature of documentaryimages by pushing the tradition into new abstract, conceptual andsemi-cinematic realms - while still preserving documentaryphotography's essential function of inciting meaningful alternativecontemplation of the real world.Ironically, Regan also becameknown for creating a cultural phenomenon as well as covering one,as the artist behind the Mr. Winkle photo collection thattransformed her otherworldly canine muse (a rescued stray canine)into an international cult icon featured in best-selling books,calendars, and collected artwork. This led to a deepening interestin animal photography, resulting in numerous other groundbreakingbooks on the topic, as well as curatorial projects.Regan's work has been exhibitedthroughout the world and is part of many collections. Majorarticles about her work have appeared in dozens of prominentpublications worldwide such as The New York Times, USA Today andThe Los Angeles Times, and she has been a featured guest onnumerous television broadcasts including CNN, the BBC and the TodayShow.Her latest book is titled Dog inCars.Resources:\u00a0Lara Jo Reganhttp://www.larajoregan.com\u00a0Dogs in Cars OfficialWebsitehttp://officialdogsincars.com\u00a0Roger Ballenhttp://www.rogerballen.com/\u00a0Support the work we do at TheCandid Frame with your donations via PayPal.

This realism has provided an accurate and insightful record of street culture throughout the world. With images portraying everything from the ugly, gritty side of life to more humorous situations, they are moments that unless captured, might otherwise go unnoticed.\nAt the heart of street photography is the 'decisive moment'. This is the split second when an image becomes complete in its composition - when each element of the image is in balance, in context and essential to the scene.

Without tricks or manipulation of any kind, she catches fleeting and impossible moments in a style that is both lyrical and graphic.

Unlike her predecessors however, her images depict but don\u2019t refer to the \u201creal\u201d world. They are documents of her imagination.\nBeginning her career as a photojournalist, Greenfield covered the experimental dance movement scene for the Village Voice from 1973 to the mid 90\u2019s. In 1982 she decided to open her own studio where she could control the lighting, and work with dancers in a collaborative environment.\nHer exploration of the expressive possibilities of photographed movement and her unique approach to photographing the human form in motion has radically redefined the genre and influenced a generation of photographers.\nGreenfield has created signature images for countless contemporary dance companies as well as commercial clients. \u00a0Her photographs have been featured in many magazines worldwide and exhibited internationally. She frequently gives lectures and offers workshops. \nSince 2014 Greenfield has been an Artist in Residence at NYU/Tisch Department of Dance and New Media. In 2015, She was honored with the Dance in Focus award in recognition of her ground-breaking contributions to the field.

Just as its land has been a rich source for cotton and soybean, the people of the Delta have been ripe for stories, both written and visual. Whether it\u2019s William Faulkner with a typewriter or William Eggleston with his camera, each artist has proven the Delta as an endless source of inspiration. It\u2019s a place that has lured many a photographer.\nBut it\u2019s a place filled with contradictions. As rich as it is for the creative artist, the existence of poverty, economic disparity and the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is not far behind. It makes it hard to idealize or demonize a place and its people. To know the place, you have to go deeper.\nAnd that is what photographer, Magdalena Sole does in her book, New Delta Rising. It\u2019s beautiful, stunning photographs provide an insightful view of the Delta, both good and bad. But most importantly, it allows the people in her images to tell their own stories in a collection of essays that compliments the photographs.

Her visual effects background clearly influences her photography and is evident in her contemporary color treatment and post production. This combined with her natural empathy for her subject and classic sense of composition result in stunning portraiture that tells a story. \u00a0In 2010 Dawn decided to make the leap and return to Los Angeles to pursue photography full time. The combination of her love of portrait photography and curiosity about what brought her fellow Brits to the City of Angels resulted in the idea for her upcoming coffee table book \"California Dreaming:Real life stories of Brits in LA\". The book has been a labour of love for almost three year and features stunning portraits of an eclectic mix of people from all walks of life, some are celebrities, others are everyday people, but all are inspirational of people following their dreams. Those featured include Nigel Lythgoe ( TV exec ), Audley Harrison ( Olympic boxer ), Ioan Gruffudd ( Actor ), Steve Sidelnyk ( Drummer ), Alan Selka ( Butler ) and The Atherton Twins ( Cirque Du Soleil acrobats ). She is currently running an indieGoGo campaign for the book which is due to be released in the spring.\nhttp://dawnboweryphotography.com/\nhttp://www.indiegogo.com/projects/california-dreaming-real-life-stories-of-brits-in-la\nhttp://britsinlabook.com/\nhttp://brookeshaden.com/gallery/\nhttp://www.missaniela.com/\nwww.thecandidframe.com\ninfo@thecandidframe.com", "duration": "40:59", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music19/v4/80/f8/46/80f84621-19dd-faf0-a9d0-509d8cc8b781/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music19/v4/80/f8/46/80f84621-19dd-faf0-a9d0-509d8cc8b781/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/clean/thecandidframe/The_Candid_Frame_218_-_Dawn_Bowery.mp3?dest-id=12000", "type": "episode", "tags": ["photography", "commercial", "networking", "british", "los", "angeles", "project", "london", "personal", "photographer", "woman", "editorial", "funding", "portrait", "bafta", "indiegogo"]}, {"seriesId": 127842171, "seriesTitle": "The Candid Frame: A Photography Podcast", "pubDate": 1390776766, "title": "TCF Ep. 217 - George Lange", "author": "", "summary": "George Lange\u2019s work as a photographer is known all over the world.

In 1948 he moved to New York and exchanged janitorial work for film classes at the New School for Social Research.\nErwitt traveled in France and Italy in 1949 with his trusty Rolleiflex camera.

To this day he is for hire and continues to work for a variety of journalistic and commercial outfits.\nIn the late 1960s Erwitt served as Magnum's president for three years.
