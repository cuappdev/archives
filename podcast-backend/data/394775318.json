But one night, in this place called the Stonewall Inn, when the police stormed in to continue their abuse, the clientele fought back. \u201cRemembering Stonewall,\u201d produced by Dave Isay of Sound Portraits and StoryCorps, was was first broadcast in 1989, on the 20th anniversary of the uprising.

In this piece, Radio Diaries uncovers what might have happened in Frank Conrad\u2019s garage, where some people say modern broadcasting began. The first portable audio recorder was made in 1945 by a man named Tony Schwartz. He moved the VU meter from inside of the unit to the top, so he could see the recording volume. And, he put a strap on it so that he could hang the device over his shoulder. Armed with his recorder (and sometimes a secret microphone attached to his wrist), Schwartz chronicled every sound in his Manhattan neighborhood. He recorded children singing songs in the park, street festival music, jukeboxes in restaurants, vendors peddling vegetables, and more than 700 conversations with cab drivers, just to name a few examples.

The electricity from the affected line was diverted to another line. This was fairly normal and everything was fine\u2014until a second bolt of lightening struck. Electric lines started shutting themselves off. As more and more lines were shut off, the system started to shut itself down. Eventually, the largest power generator in the area, known as Big Allis, turned itself off. And then all of New York City went dark. On that evening, DJ Grandmaster Caz, a Bronx native, was spinning records in a park. Caz recalls the evening: \u201cThe record just started slowing down, you know what I mean? So, quite naturally, we thought, it was us. We thought we had drained too much power and we shorted out the electricity.

These urban vestiges first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named Akasegawa Genpei. One day, in 1972, he was walking to lunch, and he came across a staircase that went up and then back down but had no door at the top. Then Akasegawa noticed that a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed. That\u2019s when something clicked. Akasegawa started noticing similar urban leftovers, and treasured them as artistic byproducts of the city. He photographed all the things he could find that were both vestigial and maintained. He began publishing his findings in a magazine column, accompanied by musings about each object. People began to send Akasegawa pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found, and in his column, Akasegawa would judge all submissions on two criteria: 1. Were they truly, completely useless? 2. Were they regularly maintained? In 1985 Akasegawa published a book of these collected photographs and writings, in which he coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers.

Cows used to be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey, herded across Twelfth Avenue (now the West Side Highway), and brought to this part of town to be made into beef. You\u2019ve heard of the meat packing district. This was like the meat hacking district. It was nicknamed \u201cAbattoir Place.\u201d It was a hive of bone boilers and hide stretchers and lard renderers. There was a disassembly line for every single part of a cow. As more and more cows were ferried to the slaughterhouses in Manhattan, it became impossible for passing herds to to coexist with Twelfth Avenue traffic. Not only did the number of cows increase, but so too had the number of carriages, and trains, and, eventually, cars. Cows were in the way. There were reports of epic cow jams on Twelfth avenue. That\u2019s why people invented cow tunnels. Or at least the story of cow tunnels. At one point there might have actually been tunnels made expressly for cows to march underneath Twelfth Avenue to the abattoir. Or people might have just invented this crazy story about cow tunnels because everybody loves a good, vaguely plausible urban myth.

When he moved to the Steel City, he had a hard time figuring out how to get around. Because Pittsburghers are always telling him to turn left at something that isn\u2019t there anymore. And then, as Mike was listening to Tom\u2019s Pittsburgher GPS routine, he noticed that in in one iteration of the joke he said, \u201cturn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut.\u201d This resonated with Mike. He realized that, because the architecture of a Pizza Hut is so distinctive, he could easily identify any building that used to be a Pizza Hut. The former Pizza Hut was thus a beacon of light shining through a thick fog of impossible directions. Here, in his friend\u2019s comedy routine, was the one Pittsburghese direction he could give that anyone, regardless of where they\u2019re from, could comprehend: turn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut. And from there, Mike created a global atlas of all the places that used to be Pizza Huts.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/28mKooa57Yk\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "19:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/noHz22nZY5A/103-UTBAPH.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1392755089, "title": "102- Icon for Access", "author": "", "summary": "There is a beauty to a universal standard.

That the emergency exit is over there. That that substance is poisonous, and you should not eat it. The group behind those internationally recognized logos is called the International Organization for Standardization. One of the most recognizable ISO symbols in the International Symbol of Access. You might not know it by that name, but you\u2019ve seen it. The International Symbol of Access is everywhere\u2013on parking spaces, on buttons that operate automatic doors, in bathrooms, on seats on the bus or at movie theaters. Anywhere there\u2019s an indication of special accommodations made for people with disabilities. The logo was created through a design contest in 1968, coordinated by an organization now called Rehabilitation International. The logo would have to be readily identifiable from reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, unambiguous, and practical. The winner was a Danish designer named Susanne Koefed\u2013though her original design didn\u2019t have a head! As the logo got absorbed into the built environment, and the politics of (dis)ability became more nuanced, some people started finding it a little lacking.

They were business partners. Van Alen was considered the artistic maverick and Severance was the savvy businessman. It\u2019s unclear why they broke up, but at some point, Severance decided he could do better on his own. The two parted ways and set up separate practices. At the time of their breakup, New York City was undergoing a boom like nothing ever seen before. Massive wealth turned Manhattan into some of the most valuable property in human history. And when property gets valuable, we build up. Late in 1928 Walter Chrysler, founder of the Chrysler car company, came to New York and bought a plot of land and decided to build, what he referred to as, \u201ca monument to me.\u201d Van Alen had already been working on plans for the previous owner of that plot and Chrysler decided to hire him to develop that plan into what would become the Chrysler Building. Walter Chrysler was a great fan of art and architecture and felt a real kinship with the Beaux-Arts trained William Van Alen. Meanwhile, downtown at 40 Wall Street, Craig Severance was planning the Manhattan Company Building. It was funded primarily by the young, Wall Street hot shot, George Ohrstrom. The two towers had different goals. Severance\u2019s building was being constructed to make money. The Chrysler Building was intended to be a monument to Chrysler, but it also aimed to be a beautiful and innovative structure. At the time, Cass Gilbert\u2019s Woolworth building was the tallest building in New York City and both Van Alen and Severance intended to take its crown.

A B-25 bomber was flying a routine mission, chartering servicemen from Massachusetts to New York City. Capt. William F. Smith, who had led some of the most dangerous missions in World War II in the European theatre, was the pilot. The day was foggy. Smith called LaGuardia Airport and requested a clearance to land. With nearly zero visibility, the tower suggested that Smith stay in the air. He ignored air traffic control and started a descent that took him over midtown Manhattan. Just as he straightened out, the clouds broke up enough for him to realize he was flying among skyscrapers. The bomber crashed into the Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world at the time. The collision killed Smith, two others on the plane, and eleven people who worked inside the building. When the plane hit, parts of the engine flew ahead and severed the lifting cables of two elevators on the 79th floor. The elevators crashed to the sub-basement. In one of the elevators was a 19-year-old elevator operator named Betty Lou Oliver. She broke her pelvis, back and neck \u2014 but she survived.

In ancient Greece, and China, and Hungary, there were systems of weights and pulleys and platforms designed to bring nobility\u2013or their meals\u2013to new heights. And somewhere below were draft animals, or even people, tasked with turning a wheel to bring these early elevators up and down. One man even spent the year of 1743 in a chimney in order to turn a lever to raise King Louis XV on a platform so the king wouldn\u2019t have to walk up a single flight of stairs. These elevators were dangerous. Ropes would snap, and then anything getting raised or lowered would plummet to the ground. Fall one story and you break your leg\u2013fall two stories you break your neck. And this fear of falling kept building heights low. People only wanted to ascend as high as they could walk.

I just read it for fun. But then I saw Jon perform stories from the book live with musical accompaniment from the band Black Prairie. And that changed everything. What you need to know about Wild Ones is that it\u2019s not a book about nature. It\u2019s a book about how we fit nature into our lives. Wild Ones is about the cutesy stuffed animals, the eco-tours, and the byzantine methods of conservation that evolve when our experience with wild life goes from something natural to something designed. Human-animal interaction has become a designed experience and the story of that transition, as the title of the book suggests, is sometimes dismaying and weirdly reassuring.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/bLF8wk5mIw8\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "35:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/Xkq7fibobvo/91-Wild-Ones-Live.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1380757283, "title": "90- Strowger and Purple Reign Redux", "author": "", "summary": "If you are an undertaker in 1878 Kansas City, and you learn that your competitor\u2019s wife works as a telephone switchboard operator and has been diverting business calls meant for you to her husband, you have a few potential courses of action.

The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenues in Lincolnwood, Illinois used to be the town\u2019s most famous building: The first Hyatt hotel in all of Chicagoland, premiere accommodations, top-notch restaurant. It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen-year-old in the area had their bar mitzvah there. Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood\u2019s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It\u2019s now dilapidated and empty.

Neff wasn\u2019t just an architect\u2013he was a starchitect. One of his most famous projects was the renovation of Pickfair, the estate owned by the iconic silent film actress Mary Pickford, and her husband Douglas Fairbanks. When the couple moved into Pickfar, the house sat on a nameless street in an empty neighborhood called Beverly Hills. If you were lucky enough to be invited to dinner at Pickfair you might find yourself seated next to Babe Ruth, the King of Spain or Albert Einstein. Life magazine called Pickfair \u201conly slightly less important than the white house, and much more fun.\u201d Neff designed estates for Charlie Chaplin, Judy Garland and Groucho Marx. His Libby Ranch is now owned by Reese Witherspoon. But at the end of his life, Wallace Neff lived in a 1,000 square foot concrete bubble. And Neff believed that this simple dome was his greatest architectural achievements. Los Angeles-based reporter David Weinberg spoke with historian Jeffrey Head, author of No Nails, No Lumber: The Bubble Houses of Wallace Neff. David also spoke with Kathy Miles, who grew up in Igloo Village; Steve Roden, an artist and current resident of the last remaining bubble house in the US; and architect Stefanos Polyzoides, who has his practice in a classic Spanish/Mediterranean-style Wallace Neff building. We also hear from Dakar-based producer Juliana Friend, who was nice enough to go check on the bubbles over there. A different version of this story originally aired on KCRW as part of their Independent Producer Project.

If nothing else because there are very few things that invoke a fear of being skewered. My preoccupation with metal reinforcement bars dovetails nicely with a structure in San Francisco I\u2019ve kind of become obsessed with\u2013 a tiny bridge on the eastern edge of Golden Gate Park called the Alvord Lake Bridge. Ernest Ransome, the father of modern rebar, constructed the bridge in 1889. Today, it is a dumpy, cracked and neglected structure. The inside is a surreal tunnel of phony stalactites. But the Alvord Lake Bridge is, quite literally, the bridge to the modern world. It is one the oldest reinforced concrete structures still standing. The twisted iron bars embedded in the bridge served as the model for the all the rebar containing structures that followed. It is the ancestor to an endless number of reinforced concrete buildings, bridges, tunnels, viaducts, and foundations. Ransome major innovation in rebar was to twist the square bar so that it bonded to the concrete better. Concrete has incredible compression strength, but it does not have much tensile strength. So if you want concrete to span any significant distance, you need to embed metal reinforcement. Thanks to CCA Senior Adjunct Professor of Architecture, William Littman (he of the Forgotten Monument) for first telling me about the Alvord Lake Bridge and showing me around.

Journalists have an ethics code. Architects do, too. According to Ethical Standard 1.4 of the American Institute of Architects (AIA): \u201cMembers should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors.\u201d A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights. Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, \u201csegregation\u201d). The latter kind of prison is called a \u201csupermax,\u201d or \u201csecurity housing unit\u201d (SHU). There is no legal definition for solitary confinement, so it\u2019s up for debate as to whether the SHU constitutes solitary confinement. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding one SHU at a Northern California prison called Pelican Bay. Life inside of the SHU at Pelican Bay means 22 to 23 hours a day inside of 7.5 by 12 foot room. It\u2019s not a space that\u2019s designed to keep you comfortable. But it\u2019s not just these architectural features, that concern humanitarian activists and psychiatrists. It\u2019s the amount of time many prisoners spend in that cells, alone, without any meaningful activity. Some psychiatrists, such as Terry Kupers, say there is a whole litany of effects that a SHU can have on a person: massive anxiety, paranoia, depression, concentration and memory problems, and loss of ability to control one\u2019s anger (which can get a prisoner in trouble and lengthen the SHU sentence). In California, SHU inmates are 33 times more likely to commit suicide than other prisoners incarcerated elsewhere in the state. There are even reports of eye damage due to the restriction on distance viewing. Terry Kupers says that a SHU \u201cdestroys people as human beings.\u201d Compared with some other prisons in the California system, the Pelican Bay SHU has some redeeming architectural features. Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells, which drifts in through doors made of a perforated metal. These porous doors also allow for inmates to communicate with each other, even though there are no lines of sight to any prisoner from within the cell. But on the other hand, cells don\u2019t have windows. Inmates never get to see the horizon. The only times prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower, or the exercise yard\u2013which is an empty, windowless room not that much bigger than a cell, with twenty-foot high concrete walls. Again, there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement. But some groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have gone beyond calling the SHU solitary confinement\u2013they call it torture. In 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture said anything over 15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse\u2013which other sources have interpreted as torture.

In Homer\u2019s Odyssey, there\u2019s a story where Odysseus and his men are traveling near an area that Sirens are known to inhabit. Odysseus knows that if he hears the siren\u2019s song, his ship is going to sink. But he still wants to hear what they sound like. So he comes up with a plan: Odysseus has his men tie him to the mast of his ship so that he can\u2019t give commands. And then Odysseus has his men fill their own ears with beeswax so they can\u2019t hear anything. They set sail in striking distance of the sirens\u2019 call. The plan works: Odysseus gets to hear the music, his men don\u2019t, and they sail on to safety\u2013with Odysseus pleading with his crew to crash the boat the whole way. And for the next 2000 or so years, that\u2019s what a siren was: a creature that makes a beautiful sound. But that all changed in 1819, when a French engineer named Charles Cagniard de la Tour decided to call the artificial noisemaker he was working on\u2013the siren. And this new, mechanical siren became one of THE signature sounds of the turn of the Century. Sirens warned people about immanent bombing raids during World War I. Sirens announced incoming fire engines, and ambulances, and police. Thanks in part to the siren, the world of the the early 20th Century had become a lot louder than any time in human history. And we can probably assume that these sirens that people heard in cities all over the world\u2013sounded NOTHING like the siren songs of Greek myth. At least to most. One man, a composer, named Arseny Avraamov heard music in the cacophony of the modern world. And he tried to create a composition\u2013a symphony\u2013 from the clatter of the newly formed Soviet Union. Moscow-based producer Charles Maynes investigated the legend of Avraamov and his forgotten masterpiece. This is The Symphony of Sirens, Revisited.

To circumvent anti-gambling laws in the US, early slot machines masqueraded as vending machines. They gave out chewing gum as prizes, and those prizes could be redeemed for cash. That\u2019s where the fruit logos come from. In fact, in the UK, slot machines are called \u201cfruit machines.\u201d Despite outward appearances, slot machines have evolved dramatically since they first appeared in 1895. To play the first slot machines, you slipped in a coin and pulled the lever to set the machine\u2019s wheels in motion. The slot machine\u2019s crank-action operation (and the way it took your money) earned it the nickname of the \u201cone-armed bandit.\u201d But today, those hand-crank levers are uncommon, and where they do exist they are known as \u201clegacy levers,\u201d because they have zero relation to how the machine actually works. Everything inside a slot machine has been computerized and automated\u2013from how you enter money, to how you bet, to how you play, to how you win and lose, and even to how you feel when leave. At first, gambling machines existed at the fringes of casino culture\u2013both figuratively and literally. The real money was in tabletop games\u2013or so it was thought\u2013and the slots were set up around the edges of the casino to give gamblers\u2019 wives something to do while they waited. But then video technology expanded what slots could do. Now a machine could have more rows and columns than the standard three-by-three, and allowed you to place multiple bets on a single spin. A penny slot machine could let you place a hundred different one-cent bets per spin\u2013so even if you win 40 cents on one line, and the machine congratulates you with flashing lights and chimes, you still lose 60 cents. And that\u2019s how video slots have become the most lucrative\u2013and addictive\u2013game in a casino.

We also talk about how this design language of exaggerated scale and wide vistas is great for limited access highways, but it\u2019s problematic when these features are grafted onto suburban landscapes where they don\u2019t belong.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/-VSAlU9yl7I\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "15:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/J0PjWASLG5g/68-Built-for-Speed.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1354233328, "title": "99% Invisible-67- Broken Window", "author": "", "summary": "When Melissa Lee was growing up in Hastings-on-Hudson, a small town in upstate New York, there were only so many fun things to do. One was buying geodes and smashing them apart with a hammer. (You know geodes, right? Those dull-looking brown rocks that you break open to reveal crystalline structures inside?) One day, when Melissa was thirteen, she and her friend Liz bought some geodes. They didn\u2019t want to wait to get home to crack them open, so they decided to throw them against the wall of an apartment building. Liz\u2019s aim went wild, and the geode went through a window. Melissa and Liz tried to find person whose window they had broken, but they couldn\u2019t figure out which door in the apartment building lead to the unit with the window in question. Eventually they gave up. Melissa would have probably forgotten about the incident had it not been for one inexplicable thing: the window didn\u2019t get fixed. Ever. It was clear that someone lived there. Melissa would walk by the window and see the apartment lit up by a TV. Someone was opening the window in the summer, and closing it in the winter. But the hole remained. Melissa finished middle school, then high school, then went away to college. And when she came home and saw the window still broken, it had this effect of making her feel like the nervous, insecure thirteen year old she was when she broke the window. This became a pattern for Melissa: she\u2019d leave home, do some growing up, come home, see the window, and feel like a teenager. Melissa traveled the world. She went to graduate school, She moved to Washington, DC, She got married. And every time she\u2019d come home, she\u2019d see the window. \u201cAs much as I was changing, this part of my past was completely frozen,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cAs soon as I saw the window I was brought right back to those middle school days when we had broken it.\u201d So in 2011, 22 years after the incident, Melissa went to go find the person who left the window broken for so long.

By its peak in the 1990s, the 6.5 acre Kowloon Walled City was home to at least 33,000 people (with estimates of up to 50,000). That\u2019s a population density of at least 3.2 million per square mile. For New York City to get that dense, every man, woman, and child living in Texas would have to move to Manhattan. To put it another way, think about living in a 1,200 square foot home. Then imagine yourself living with 9 other people. Then imagine that your building is only one unit of a twelve-story building, and every other unit is as full as yours. Then imagine hundreds those buildings crammed together in a space the size of four football fields. We can\u2019t really imagine it, either. Kowloon Walled City began as a military fort in Kowloon, a region in mainland China. In 1898, China signed a land lease with Great Britain, giving the British control of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and other nearby territories. But the lease stipulated that the fort in Kowloon would remain under Chinese jurisdiction. Over time, the fort became abandoned, leaving the area subject to neither Chinese nor British authority. This legal gray zone was attractive to displaced and marginalized people. Thousands of people moved there after the war with Japan broke out. Even more people moved there after the Communist Revolution. It attracted gangsters, drug addicts, sex workers, and refugees. And it also drew a lot of normal people from all over China who saw opportunity there. They built the city building by building, first blanketing the area of the fort, then building vertically. Buildings were packed together so tightly in the Walled City that the alleys were nearly pitch-black in the day time. Electricity and water were brought in by illegal or informal means. The Walled City gained a reputation as a sort of den of iniquity\u2013there were high levels of prostitution, gambling, mafia activity, and, for some reason, rampant unlicensed dentistry. But an order did emerge. The Walled City had no schools, but there was an informal kindergarten. A resident\u2019s organization settled disputes. And there was lots of industry: a fishball factory, a noodle factory, metalworking shops, a textile mill. There were stores, restaurants. You could even receive mail in the Walled City. Kowloon Walled City was torn down in 1993. Today, it\u2019s a park, and most traces of the city are gone. But the memory of the city lives on. It was featured in the non-verbal film Baraka, plays a cameo role in Bloodsport. It\u2019s also served as the setting in a number of video games, including most recently Call of Duty: Black Ops This week\u2019s episode was produced by Nick van der Kolk. He spoke with photographer Greg Girard and architect Aaron Tan, who both spent time in the Walled City. Nick also talked to as Brian Douglas, who helped design Call of Duty: Black Ops.

It has long been hypothesized that stripes on zebras make it difficult for a predator to distinguish one zebra from another when the zebras are in a large herd. The stripes also might make zebras less attractive to blood sucking horseflies. This is called disruptive camouflage. When it comes to humans, the greatest, most jaw-droppingly spectacular application of disruptive camouflage was called Dazzle. Dazzle painting emerged in the 1910s as design solution to a very dire problem: American and British ships were being sunk left and right by German U-Boats. England needed to import supplies to fight the Central Powers, and these ships were sitting ducks in the Atlantic Ocean. They needed a way to fend of the torpedoes. Conventional high-similarity camouflage just doesn\u2019t work in the open sea. Conditions like the color of the sky, cloud cover, and wave height change all the time, not to mention the fact that there\u2019s no way to hid all the smoke left by the ships\u2019 smoke stacks. The strategy of this high-difference, dazzle camouflage was not about invisibility. It was about disruption. Confusion. Torpedoes in the Great War could only be fired line-of-sight, so instead of firing at where they saw the ship was at that moment, torpedo gunners would have to chart out where the ship would be by the time the torpedo got there. They had to determine the target ship\u2019s speed and direction with just a brief look through the periscope. The torpedo gunner\u2019s margin of error for hitting a ship was quite low. Dazzle painting could throw off an experienced submariner by as much as 55 degrees. Our expert this week is Roy Behrens, a professor graphic design at the University of Northern Iowa. He\u2019s published several books about camouflage, and also runs the Camoupedia blog.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/Ke5Sc_eJf7Q\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "15:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/vtydHEPE5OE/65-Razzle-Dazzle.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1351207594, "title": "99% Invisible-64- Derelict Dome", "author": "", "summary": "In the Cape Cod town of Woods Hole, buildings are not usually dome-shaped. Producer Katie Klocksin was pretty surprised when she came across one. Katie started asking around about the dome.\u00a0 She found it was built by the late Buckminster Fuller, who called himself a \u201ccomprehensive anticipatory design scientist,\u201d out to solve the problems confronting \u201cStarship Earth\u201d by changing the way we make buildings.\u00a0 \u201cBucky\u201d Fuller invented and patented the geodesic dome, a spherical structure made from small triangles.\u00a0 The design is based on a lot of complicated math, but the idea is that by relying on the strength of of the triangle, these buildings could be made from cheaper materials, like plastic and aluminum instead of steel and concrete. In 1953, Fuller was commissioned to build a dome in Woods Hole by architect (and aspiring restauranteur) Gunnar Peterson.\u00a0 The dome would become the posh Dome Restaurant.\u00a0 Diners could gaze through the building\u2019s triangular windows out on onto the sea.\u00a0 A zither player named Ruth Welcome entertained guests. Despite its Utopian aspirations, the building had some structural problems.\u00a0 The glass windows heated the restaurant up like a greenhouse, so the owner installed fiberglass over most of the dome, blocking the ocean views.\u00a0 It leaked constantly, and was difficult to maintain.\u00a0 Even though the Woods Hole dome did not radically change the world, Bucky Fuller would go on to become one of the most influential thinkers in design and architecture of the 20th Century. Today, the Dome Restaurant lies vacant. A new development project could lead to the dome\u2019s restoration, but for now, it remains a decaying curiosity, inviting exploration from microphone-wielding out-of-towners.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/zy4HfyNplJs\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "17:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/9c8DyhfB_4A/64-Derelict-Dome.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1350077577, "title": "99% Invisible-63- The Political Stage", "author": "", "summary": "On this special edition of 99% Invisible, we joined forces with Andrea Seabrook of DecodeDC to investigate all the thought that goes into the most miniscule details of a political campaign.

Comcast has taken the lead in providing high-speed internet to consumers, but people like the CEO of Netflix have been critical of Comcast favoring its own video content over video from third party services such as Netflix and HBO Go.

The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenues in Lincolnwood, Illinois used to be the town\u2019s most famous building: The first Hyatt hotel in all of Chicagoland, premiere accommodations, top-notch restaurant. It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen year old boy in the area had his bar mitzvah there. Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood\u2019s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It\u2019s now dilapidated and empty. But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel. Because it\u2019s purple. Really, really purple. Gwen Macsai grew up nearby and she always thought it was really, really ugly. Lots of people did. To be fair, lots of people didn\u2019t. But everyone has an opinion about it.

Of course that was before audio recording, so now, for the most part, music is frozen music. It\u2019s only very recently in the history of music that we\u2019ve been able to freeze music into an object. In my life, the form of this object mattered a lot. I once bought vinyl albums and cassette tapes, where there were two first songs per album, Side A and Side B. The energy of a first song makes it stand apart, at least in my head it does. Then the CD came along and eliminated Side B and there was only first song, and the actual number of a track (that you see prominently on the UI) became my index for sorting songs. Then MP3s jumbled my sense of track order, and albums began to feel more like a loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual whole. I could name hundreds more examples like these, and I welcome you to chime in, but my point is: the form of the thing matters. But no effect has been as world changing as that original innovation: freezing music in time onto a recording, where a single version of a song, a single performance of a song, became the song. An inherently mutable method of communication was fundamentally changed. I heard a radio broadcast several years ago that really affected the way I thought about all this. Jim Derogatis and Greg Kot are the hosts of a radio program I\u2019m a huge fan of called Sound Opinions (subscribe now).

Belgians take beer very seriously. Amongst the 200 Belgian breweries, there\u2019s a very specific sub-type: Trappist beers. According to our reporter Cyrus Farivar (also from Episode #36 \u201cSuper Bonn Bon\u201d), there are two things you need to know about Trappist beers. First, they\u2019re amazing. Second, they\u2019re made by Trappist monks. These monks trace their roots to a monastery in 17th century France, and have since spread out to all over the world. The main concept behind the Trappist lifestyle is that the abbey should be economically self-sufficient. In other words, the monks should make something and sell it to the public as a way to fund the operations of the abbey itself. Some make cheese. Some make spirits. There\u2019s even one in Germany that makes lentil soup. But none of the Trappist products are as famous as the beer. The beer that is considered the best of the best is Westvleteren 12. With its plain brown bottle, no label, the only writing is on the cap- the beer is super cool. It\u2019s quite rare and year after year it\u2019s rated the best beer in the world. But here\u2019s the thing about Westvleteren. You can\u2019t just go there and have as much beer as you want. You can\u2019t even have it shipped from the abbey. If you want to buy beer to take with you, you have to look up the beer reservation phone number on the abbey\u2019s website. Then, you call certain phone number during certain hours, on certain days. If you\u2019re lucky enough to talk to a monk to take your reservation, you have to give your license plate number and be available to come pick up your crate during the appointed time that weekend. You\u2019re limited to one crate per person per car, maximum two per car. And, you can\u2019t buy more than one crate during a 60-day period. You also have to agree not to resell the beer. This sort of thing is not unheard of: velvet ropes and random reward have long been imposed to create artificial scarcity to heighten demand, but the mainstream trend today seems to be more geared toward greater access and accommodation for customers. The new ideal is that everything is available, at all times, no matter where you live. Yet the Westvleteren Trappists are trying to make it as difficult as possible. Jef van den Steen, author of a book called Trappist: The Seven Heavenly Beers and an acclaimed brewer himself, says that\u2019s not the case, \u201cBefore, Westvleteren was only well-known was in Belgium. And now it\u2019s worldwide, and that\u2019s the problem. They decide we will brew the same amount as the last 40-50 years, and they have enough for that, so why must they brew more? Because you want? No. They live between the walls of the abbey, so for them it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d The \u201ccustomer service\u201d is not designed to \u2026 <a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.prx.org/2012/05/31/99-invisible-55-the-best-beer-in-the-world/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">\u2192</span></a><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/Y-auZc-lC_o\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "15:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/hQnRKNr3g6I/55-The-Best-Beer-in-the-World.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1337210501, "title": "99% Invisible-54- The Colour of Money", "author": "", "summary": "US paper currency is so ubiquitous that to really look at its graphic design with fresh eyes requires some deliberate and focused attention. So pull out a greenback from your wallet (or look at a picture one online) and just take really take it in. All the fonts, the busy filigree, the micro patterns\u2026it\u2019s just dreadful. Even though paper currency itself, just idea of money, is a massive, world changing technology, the look and feel of US paper money is very stagnant. Richard Smith is the founder of the Dollar ReDe$ign Project and in an article in the New York Times, he pointed out five major areas where the design of US currency could improve: color, size, functionality, composition, and symbolism. It just so happens that Australian currency addresses each and every one of the points made by Richard Smith. Tristan Cooke and Tom Nelson of the blog Humans in Design are big fans of all the design innovations in Australian money. Aussie polymer notes are varied in color, get larger with each denomination, are more durable and are generally considered better and easier to use than US currency. But there are some interesting reasons why the greenback is the way it is. David Wolman, author of The End of Money, explains that the legacy features that make US paper money look stale and anachronistic are meant to convey stability and timelessness. Since the US economy is so important in the world economy, why mess with it? Some fear that changing the design of the currency significantly (or eliminating the penny) could undermine the faith in the federal reserve note. Even though Tristan and Tom are fans of the Australian polymer bills, they share Wolman\u2019s view that the more interesting future innovations are not going to have anything to do with physical cash. Clever user interfaces that help us manage our money better, while providing even greater convenience, are getting more refined and accepted.

Julia Barton remembers going to the top floor of Dallas\u2019s then-new city hall when she was teenager. The building, designed by I.M. Pei, is a huge trapezoid jutting out over a wide plaza. Julia found the view from the top pretty fantastic, especially when munching on a Caramello bar from the City Hall vending machines. But once she went to a protest in the plaza below. And those same windows, now hulking over her, made her feel small, and the whole event insignificant. Texans have a fondness for big structures\u2014big arenas, big houses, big freeways. Julia wasn\u2019t sure if their hidden message wasn\u2019t simply this: I\u2019m important, you\u2019re nobody. For people who distrust the big project, Edward Tenner\u2019s 2001 essay \u201cThe Xanadu Effect\u201d is some comfort. Tenner, a visiting scholar at Princeton University, ponders the ways in which obsession with bigness can presage hard times for a business or even a nation. Tenner named his essay not for Olivia Newton-John\u2019s anthem or even the Coleridge poem, but for the palace Xanadu built in the movie \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d That Xanadu, of course, was based on a real-life palace that newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst built in his waning days of empire: On its 24,000 acres were a 354,000-gallon swimming pool, a private zoo and four main buildings with a total of 165 rooms. Along with other such extravagances, the estate helped send Hearst into trusteeship late in life. The cavernous halls of Welles\u2019 gloomy cinematic Xanadu seemed to filmgoers \u2014 as the real, happier building must have appeared to many Hearst Corp. public investors \u2014 the very image of the pride that goes before a fall. The downside of the Xanadu Effect has seen itself play out in other places\u2014the Empire State Building, for example, was conceived in the 1920s but completed during the Great Depression, when it was known as \u201cthe Empty State Building.\u201d Tenner\u2019s not arguing that big things shouldn\u2019t be built; he\u2019s saying bigness is a gamble. It pays off when it it uplifts people, gives them a sense of grandeur and purpose. It fails when it crushes them or just makes life a pain, as in the big-built city of Moscow, where pedestrians have to scurry under the wide avenues in tunnels. \u00a0 On a recent reporting trip to Russia for PRI\u2019s \u201cThe World,\u201d Julia travelled to Sochi, Russia\u2019s southern-most city and upcoming host of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Sochi is Europe\u2019s biggest construction site right now, with Xanadu-like ice-palaces going up right on the Black Sea. \u00a0 All the construction\u2014including billions of dollars of infrastructure\u2014is good news for the Russian state and shoring up its presence in the Caucasus. It\u2019s not necessarily good news for the locals. Julia interviewed a Sochi resident, Alexei Kravets, who\u2019s been in a stand-off with authorities about the fate of the home he built by the Black Sea. Kravets\u2019s court case to save his home has been standing in the way of a new railway \u2026 <a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.prx.org/2012/05/01/99-invisible-53-the-xanadu-effect/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">\u2192</span></a><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/AgpZa4OKleM\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "13:50", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/g2YOlzUyQD0/53-The-Xanadu-Effect.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1334770521, "title": "99% Invisible-52- Galloping Gertie", "author": "", "summary": "Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the deck would go up and down by several feet with the slightest breeze. Construction workers on the span chewed on lemon wedges to stop their motion sickness. They nicknamed the structure Galloping Gertie. The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge design by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for a suspension bridge, but it was later modified by Leon Moisseiff to be slimmer and more elegant. The most notable change was that the 25 foot lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings, were replaced with 8 foot solid steel plate girders. The new solid girder along the side in Moisseiff\u2019s design made for a much lighter and more flexible bridge\u2014 it also caught the wind like a sail\u2014 but they didn\u2019t know that. Moisseiff\u2019s design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design and that fact ultimately won the day. Motorists who used the bridge found out first hand why it got the name Galloping Gertie, and during the four months while the bridge was open, many traveled from far away just to ride the undulating waves as they crossed high above Puget Sound. The thrill ride didn\u2019t last long. On November 7, 1940 stiff winds caused the road deck to twist violently along its center axis. The center span endured these brutal torsional forces for about an hour and finally gave way. The collapse of the twisting suspension bridge is one of the most dramatic images caught on film. I talked to John Marr from the seminal zine Murder Can Be Fun for this story and I\u2019d like to give a shout out to Alan Bellows of Damn Interesting for independently suggesting Galloping Gertie as a show topic and publishing a great, much more detailed account of the disaster on his site.

Everyone began making dentures with Vulcanite bases. But in 1864, a long disputed patent application, originally filed in 1852, was awarded and then acquired by the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. It was an outfit created to collect fees, or very often, sue dentists who already used vulcanite, and there were plenty of dentists to go after.

The patent was enforced with extreme prejudice, despite the protestations of the US dental profession.

Modern design principles and cultural preservation are not necessarily at loggerheads, but when they do come into conflict, it\u2019s not always easy to answer which ideology should win.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/ansPjlmLcVI\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "10:02", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/67/14/7a/67147a4e-7e0e-0f6a-2cf4-0d5b01c648c9/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/1DWw2bIEEaQ/39-Darth-Vader-Family-Courthouse.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 394775318, "seriesTitle": "99% Invisible", "pubDate": 1318506461, "title": "99% Invisible-38- Sound of Sport", "author": "", "summary": "If Dennis Baxter and Bill Whiston are doing their job right, you probably don\u2019t notice that they\u2019re doing their job.

This marking is called the load line, or as I prefer, the Plimsoll line. This simple graphic design has saved thousands of lives. The Plimsoll line shows the maximum loading point of the ship and lets a third party know, plainly and clearly, when a vessel is overloaded and at risk of sinking in rough seas. If you see that horizontal line above the water, you\u2019re good, if you don\u2019t, you could be sunk. The load line was named after the crusading British MP Samuel Plimsoll. The advent of insurance in the 19th century, created an incentive for ship owners to purposely sink their own ships and collect the insurance money. This grim practice became so widespread, and killed so many merchant seamen, that the over-insured, overloaded vessels became known as \u201ccoffin ships.\u201d Samuel Plimsoll (\u201cthe sailors friend\u201d) fought for sweeping merchant shipping regulation that led to the adoption of the marking that bears his name.

He scoured the country, looking for a hospital with a management system worth adopting, but he never found one. Instead he ended up in Japan. At a Toyota factory. This entire, multiyear overhaul started with a ball of blue yarn. The staff met with a Toyota Production System sensei and he took out the ball of blue yarn and a map of the hospital and told the staff to trace the path a cancer patient would take on a typical visit for chemotherapy treatment. When they were finished, it was an immensely powerful visual experience for everyone in the room. They all stared at this map with blue yarn snaking all over the place, doubling back on itself and making complicated twists and turns from one end of the building to the other.

Eisenhower, you saw the solemn oath of office taken between twenty-two smooth, sandstone columns at the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol Building. The slabs that made up the columns were considered so important that when they were transported from a barge on the Potomac River to Capitol Hill in 1824, they were pulled by man power alone, because lowly mules were deemed unfit to move such sacred objects. The columns did not have the same standing in 1958. During the renovation of the East Portico, the columns were removed, crated and stored, until a couple of women fought to put them back on their feet in the National Arboretum. Other parts of the fa\u00e7ade were also carted away in the renovation, but they didn\u2019t get quite the same treatment.

The credit union thought it had something to learn from the check casher about how to reach out and serve the poor. This was curious. McGray\u2019s impression was that check cashers (and especially payday lenders) were predatory, the bad guys, and that credit unions, especially one dedicated to serving the poor, were the good guys. This proposed sale made McGray look at the whole situation with fresh eyes. I highly recommend reading Douglas McGray\u2019s New York Times Magazine article all about it. It\u2019s excellent. I, of course, was drawn to the design aspects of the story. Check cashing stores can feel very odd when you\u2019re not used to them. Quite simply, they are often designed to look and feel more like a corner store. The furnishings are sparse, and the information is on signs\u2014 big, bold and clearly presented.
