On the podcast, Ned explains how he got into the area of paid social advertising and shares some of his experiences, including how he managed to increase the social media engagement of the LAD Bible, one of the UK's biggest social media platforms. \n \nNed explains how paid advertising is unique as it sits somewhere in-between marketers and SEO people with often no one taking full responsibility for it. He says that often, people simply don\u2019t know how to successfully apply it and that the reason for that is probably that paid social advertising is such a new tool. He explains how it is important to learn more about it as it can open up a lot of opportunities. \n \nDepending on the knowledge of the audience, Ned explains that he will shape the training so that it is not overwhelming for someone with less experience as well as making it interesting and useful for people who are already experienced.
