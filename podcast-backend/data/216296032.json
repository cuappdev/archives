We are proud of all the work we\u2019ve done, but we felt the time was right to revisit this early work.\nWhat you will hear is our best foot forward, driven by everything we\u2019ve learned personally and professionally over the last five years. \u00a0With Season One Revisited we have been able to communicate the original story of Neal Henderson, Elizabeth Rourke, Alison Dalton, and Nathan Rourke in a way that is truer to our intentions, approachable for new fans of the show, and exciting for our long-time listeners. \u00a0If you\u2019ve always wanted an easy ambasador piece to get your friends listening to the show, this is it!\nFull notes:\u00a0http://www.ourfaircity.com/2015/07/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-season-one/\nTake a listen to their efforts, and enjoy, anew, an introduction to the world of\u00a0Our Fair City.\nDownload Radio Drama Revival - Episode 420\nThe post Episode 420 \u2013 Revisiting the Tunnels of Our Fair City appeared first on Radio Drama Revival.", "duration": "01:26:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/c4/de/aa/c4deaa7b-ca43-7460-d313-f849f100b075/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/c4/de/aa/c4deaa7b-ca43-7460-d313-f849f100b075/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RadioDramaRevival/~5/ooUmNg9HfLY/9e1b44de-7d56-4771-a3dc-f9f9b7772a1d.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["radio drama", "adventure", "science fiction", "audio fiction", "Audio Drama", "Fantasy", "fiction podcast", "intrigue", "drama", "stories", "fiction", "theater of the mind", "mystery"]}, {"seriesId": 216296032, "seriesTitle": "Radio Drama Revival", "pubDate": 1442617622, "title": "Episode 419 \u2013 Saratoga\u2019s Fat Cats (3 of 3)", "author": "", "summary": "Part 3 of 3\nAlas!

For the past five years the world has become an increasingly unstable place. The threat of war between China and the USA had loomed heavily over the rest of the world. Britain, now a small, insignificant and bankrupt nation, initially, as always, had sided with the USA. But relations quickly broke down beyond repair between the two nations, leaving the UK an isolated and unimportant outcast in world diplomacy.\nFaced with two gigantic, power hungry enemies on either side, things go from bad to worse in the UK when an attack on the country\u2019s power and communications leaves its citizens without electricity, television, phone or internet. After nearly a fortnight, and with nothing more than speculation available about who carried out the attack and why, looting and riots spread throughout towns and cities like wildfire.\nRumours of an emergency radio broadcast promising help, information, food and water in the centre of every city sees millions of people on the move as they try to head for safety, hoping that the crisis may be at an end.\nIn reality, nothing can be further from the truth. In a car park, half way up Falkland Hill in Fife, a group of people who fled from the riot stricken towns below watch out over the river Forth in horror as Edinburgh is blitzed by a missile attack from the sky. The lucky ones are killed by the blasts, but anyone else close enough is subjected to the chemicals unleashed by the explosions. A devastating chemical attack turns ordinary people into bloodthirsty savages, and Scotland as we know it, changes forever.\nAnd now... this is the Aftermath.\nDig in. \u00a0We feature Episodes 1-4, most of Season 1 of the Aftermath radio drama show.\nProduction interviews? \u00a0We got 'em. \u00a0Matthew McLean's Audio Drama Production and Matthew Boudreau's Aural Fixation series.\nThe post Episode 393 \u2013 Experiencing the Aftermath appeared first on Radio Drama Revival.", "duration": "01:32:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/c4/de/aa/c4deaa7b-ca43-7460-d313-f849f100b075/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/c4/de/aa/c4deaa7b-ca43-7460-d313-f849f100b075/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RadioDramaRevival/~5/1khEHJAxgW4/85ca70c3-a86a-4364-8893-65c0f52b6d43.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["radio drama", "adventure", "science fiction", "audio fiction", "Audio Drama", "Fantasy", "fiction podcast", "intrigue", "drama", "stories", "fiction", "theater of the mind", "mystery"]}, {"seriesId": 216296032, "seriesTitle": "Radio Drama Revival", "pubDate": 1414767156, "title": "Episode 392 \u2013 Returning to the Clanking Buoy Bell", "author": "", "summary": "This week we dig into the archives to re-play the Cape Cod Radio Mystery Theater Classic New England Ghost Story \"The Buoy\"\nA beautiful post of how this production was recorded is available at:\u00a0http://www.ccrmt.com/the-buoy-2/\nThis is an utterly unforgettable 'foggy old Cape Cod' story of a lone traveler on a cold night who misses the ferry, stumbles into a bed and breakfast and starts to warm up for a taste of... the unknown. \u00a0A gorgeous atmospheric thriller that gives a nod to tales like \"Suspense\" while re-inventing them for modern radio drama. \u00a0Classic.\nThe post Episode 392 \u2013 Returning to the Clanking Buoy Bell appeared first on Radio Drama Revival.", "duration": "01:23:40", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/c4/de/aa/c4deaa7b-ca43-7460-d313-f849f100b075/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/c4/de/aa/c4deaa7b-ca43-7460-d313-f849f100b075/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RadioDramaRevival/~5/re7mLieNNk8/f0e1a9b3-ff34-4684-a6a2-78239c71ee78.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["radio drama", "adventure", "science fiction", "audio fiction", "Audio Drama", "Fantasy", "fiction podcast", "intrigue", "drama", "stories", "fiction", "theater of the mind", "mystery"]}, {"seriesId": 216296032, "seriesTitle": "Radio Drama Revival", "pubDate": 1414200240, "title": "Episode 391 \u2013 A Return to \u201cHungry Hollow\u201d", "author": "", "summary": "This week, we feature an appetizer of location horror followed by a full-on meal, the former by our own FinalRune Productions and the latter by John Ballentine's Campfire Radio Theater.\nEarlier this year, host Fred Greenhalgh was invited to participate in the founding a new kind of way to get kids to interact with the outdoors, dubbed \"Trailside Theater.\" Melissa Field of Saco Bay Center for Civic Engagement approached Fred with the idea of creating audio theater in the wild as a way to build connections between youth and the natural world, through the medium of audio storytelling.

The harrowing journey begins in Victorian Great Britain, moves to Paris then eastward to Hungary and finally, to western Romania (former Transylvania). After overcoming insurmountable odds, and grave personal loss, Hunter must make the ultimate sacrifice to remain in Faith's existence. Socially shy and a bit uncertain, Hunter becomes a determined man with purpose and great inner strength over the course of his journey. There are twists and turns, surprises, lost souls and plenty of blood. Timeless Gothic horror themes and elements are an inescapable constant that compels listeners to experience the tale by candlelight.\nThis deliciously weird compilation stitches together 6 classic gothic works into one new unified narrative, spanning 2 hours of audio.

Jack's already well versed in the offbeat; his process of filmmaking consists of 'neonizing' live action or animation footage to create a whole new work, with funky, witty narratives.  You have to see it to believe it.\nNow enter this crazy audio musical.  Why do it?  Jack says:\nRadio drama more than any other dramatic form relies on sound and words.  And as a scriptwriter I believe that perhaps radio drama is the purest form of executing a script.\nInspired by THE LITTLE PRINCE, ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THE WIZARD OF OZ...plus adult themes...I wrote a first draft of the script Paradox...and when I considered what I had written...I thought that Paradox could incorporate songs. \nSo I placed an ad on Craig's List New York seeking a composer/songwriter.  Drew Kresman responded and I liked what I heard when he sent me some of the compositions he'd previously done...so we got together and the collaboration began.\nI had worked with Daniel Broadhurst before...he'd acted in a play I'd written about a clown and a bearded lady who yearn to flee the circus and become \"ordinary\"...that play had toured New York libraries last summer....and through Daniel I met Cassie Bell and heard her extraordinary singing.  I felt she'd be perfect as Simone. And that's how Daniel Broadhurst and Cassie Bell came to be involved. Originally, I envisioned a bigger cast to play all the characters...but remarkably Daniel was able to transform himself into the different characters...and so we decided  he should play all the roles of creatures and people Simone meets along her path in Paradox.\nWe recorded Paradox in a sound studio in pretty much one take.
