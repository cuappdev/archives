He can be heard frequently on CHSRfm.ca, and two of his shows irregularly appear as podcasts, and can be found at <a href=\"http://encaffeinated.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">encaffeinated.ca</a> (CAFFEEN!) and <a href=\"http://theweirdshow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">theweirdshow.com</a> (The WEIRD Show, winner of a Parsec Award for \u201cBest Infotainment\u201d). He likes cats enough to pet them but not enough to own one, and computers enough to own several but pet none of them. He will someday write a million words, but at this rate, that will require life extension, so he eagerly awaits the ability to upload into a computer, if that hasn\u2019t already happened and this is all only a simulation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Short Fiction: \u201cNPG\u2019s policy on authorship\u200f\u201d by <a href=\"http://suchow.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jordan Suchow</a></p>\n<p>Originally published in <b><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7363/full/477244a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nature</a> </b>magazine.</p>\n<p>Jordan Suchow is a cognitive scientist studying minds, brains, and machines.

By now he had mostly moved away from Analog, although he would have a long sequence of stories about the droll interstellar adventures of Haviland Tuf (later collected in Tuf Voyaging) running throughout the eighties in the Stanley Schmidt Analog, as well as a few strong individual pieces such as the novella \u201cNightflyers.\u201d Most of his major work of the late seventies and early eighties, though, would appear in Omni. The late seventies and eighties also saw the publication of his memorable novel Dying of the Light, his only solo SF novel, while his stories were collected in A Song for Lya, Sandkings, Songs of Stars and Shadows, Songs the Dead Men Sing, Nightflyers, and Portraits of His Children. By the beginning of the eighties he\u2019d moved away from SF and into the horror genre, publishing the big horror novel Fevre Dream, and winning the Bram Stoker Award for his horror story \u201cThe Pear-Shaped Man\u201d and the World Fantasy Award for his werewolf novella \u201cThe Skin Trade.\u201d By the end of that decade, though, the crash of the horror market and the commercial failure of his ambitious horror novel The Armageddon Rag had driven him out of the print world and to a successful career in television instead, where for more than a decade he worked as story editor or producer on such shows as the new Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast.</p>\n<p>After years away, Martin made a triumphant return to the print world in 1996 with the publication of the immensely successful fantasy novel<b> A Game of Thrones</b>, the start of his<b> Song of Ice and Fire</b> sequence. A freestanding novella taken from that work, \u201cBlood of the Dragon,\u201d won Martin another Hugo Award in 1997. Further books in the <b>Song of Ice and Fire</b> series\u2014<b>A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows</b>, and <b>A Dance with Dragons</b>, have made it one of the most popular, acclaimed, and bestselling series in all of modern fantasy.

He\u2019s found that volunteering for a dozen years in radio was a decent way to get a full-time job as a Program Director at a community radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, but not such a great way to finish his thesis, so he stopped at a Masters in Computer Science.

R. Martin and Gardner Dozois.</p>\n<p>Megan Lindholm was born in Oakland California in 1952, and spent the first ten years of her life in California. She grew up in a house full of books, rich with lovely illustrated fairy tale volumes, the works of Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dumas, Shakespeare and other classics in poetry as well as prose. When she was a preteen, her family moved from the California suburbs to a house on the rural outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska. It was a huge change in lifestyle, from potato chips and avocado dip to growing potatoes and helping butcher moose. She loved the more rustic lifestyle, the opportunity to have wolf-hybrid dogs and access to undeveloped forest for long runs with her dogs.</p>\n<p>In 1970, she married and moved with her husband Fred to Kodiak, Alaska. They lived in a very small village called Chiniak near a missile tracking site. Although she had been a writer since her early teens, at this time she first began to attempt selling her stories. She worked as a village correspondent for the local newspaper, and marketed her stories, with limited success, to children\u2019s magazines. Over the next twelve years, she and her growing family spent time in Alaska, Idaho, and Hawaii. She sold stories to magazines such as Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, Highlights for Children, and designed stories to be used in the Science Research Associates (SRA) graduated reading program. She won a grant from the Alaska State Council for the Arts for the coming of age story, \u201cThe Poaching\u201d but her interest was turning more and more to fantasy.</p>\n<p>In 1982, she sold her first fantasy novel, Harpy\u2019s Flight. Ki and Vandien\u2019s adventures continued in three more volumes (Luck of the Wheels, The Windsingers, and The Limbreth Gate.) Her other works included The Reindeer People, Wolf\u2019s Brother, Alien Earth, Wizard of the Pigeons and a collaboration with Steven Brust for The Gypsy.</p>\n<p>In 1995, her career as a novelist ended as she began to write epic fantasy under the pseudonym Robin Hobb, which she continues to do to this day. Her best known work is The Farseer Trilogy, and her most recent work as Hobb is The Fool\u2019s Assassin (2014). As Megan Lindholm, her shorter works such as \u201cA Touch of Lavender\u201d was a finalist for both the Hugo and the Nebula award. \u201cSilver Lady and the Fortyish Man\u201d was also a Nebula finalist. Over the years, she has continued to write short stories as Megan Lindholm. Other short works recently published include \u201cNeighbors\u201d in the anthology Dangerous Women, edited by George R R Martin and Gardner Dozois. This anthology recently won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology.</p>\n<p>Narrated by Pete Nixon:</p>\n<p>Pete is a security engineer for Intel Security, a husband, father, and does writing and editing and narrating on the side.

But I know the heart of my story, and the heart is always what matters in a tale like mine.</b></p>\n<p>Megan Lindholm was born in Oakland California in 1952, and spent the first ten years of her life in California. She grew up in a house full of books, rich with lovely illustrated fairy tale volumes, the works of Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dumas, Shakespeare and other classics in poetry as well as prose. When she was a preteen, her family moved from the California suburbs to a house on the rural outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska. It was a huge change in lifestyle, from potato chips and avocado dip to growing potatoes and helping butcher moose. She loved the more rustic lifestyle, the opportunity to have wolf-hybrid dogs and access to undeveloped forest for long runs with her dogs.</p>\n<p>In 1970, she married and moved with her husband Fred to Kodiak, Alaska. They lived in a very small village called Chiniak near a missile tracking site. Although she had been a writer since her early teens, at this time she first began to attempt selling her stories. She worked as a village correspondent for the local newspaper, and marketed her stories, with limited success, to children\u2019s magazines. Over the next twelve years, she and her growing family spent time in Alaska, Idaho, and Hawaii. She sold stories to magazines such as Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, Highlights for Children, and designed stories to be used in the Science Research Associates (SRA) graduated reading program. She won a grant from the Alaska State Council for the Arts for the coming of age story, \u201cThe Poaching\u201d but her interest was turning more and more to fantasy.</p>\n<p>In 1982, she sold her first fantasy novel, Harpy\u2019s Flight. Ki and Vandien\u2019s adventures continued in three more volumes (Luck of the Wheels, The Windsingers, and The Limbreth Gate.) Her other works included The Reindeer People, Wolf\u2019s Brother, Alien Earth, Wizard of the Pigeons and a collaboration with Steven Brust for The Gypsy.</p>\n<p>In 1995, her career as a novelist ended as she began to write epic fantasy under the pseudonym Robin Hobb, which she continues to do to this day. Her best known work is The Farseer Trilogy, and her most recent work as Hobb is The Fool\u2019s Assassin (2014). As Megan Lindholm, her shorter works such as \u201cA Touch of Lavender\u201d was a finalist for both the Hugo and the Nebula award. \u201cSilver Lady and the Fortyish Man\u201d was also a Nebula finalist. Over the years, she has continued to write short stories as Megan Lindholm. Other short works recently published include \u201cNeighbors\u201d in the anthology Dangerous Women, edited by George R R Martin and Gardner Dozois. This anthology recently won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology.</p>\n<p>Fact: Looking Back at Genre History by <a href=\"http://www.amyhsturgis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amy H.

The plane was about a thousand feet up and was descending when he saw the crash. It was late at night, a red-eye flight, so he could only see the headlights and tail-lights, and the faintest silhouettes of the cars. One car began to swerve and careened into the opposite lane, grazing the driver\u2019s side of an oncoming car, which halted. The car that caused the accident stalled for a bit but then accelerated again and kept moving forward. While the hit car was motionless on the road, another car from behind slammed into the back of it, pushing it off the side over a small embankment that the passenger could barely discern. Then that car jerked backwards and kept driving as well.</b></p>\n<p><b>The road this took place on was just an ordinary road connecting one suburb to another. There were a few buildings\u2013warehouses, maybe\u2013close to where the crash took place, which were unlit. And a pond in the back of one of them, weakly shimmering.

Other works include scripts for talking records, radio, computer games, and the story for the first Star Trek movie. His novel Shadowkeep was the first ever book adapation of an original computer game.

of <b>Asimov\u2019</b></p>\n<p><b><br />\n</b></p>\n<p><b>StarShipSofa</b> narrates Vinegar Peace, a SF story wrote by Michael Bishop for his son Jamie Bishop who died two years ago at the Virginia Tech shooting.</p>\n<p><b>Michael Bishop says:</b></p>\n<p><b>I wrote \u201cVinegar Peace\u201d \u2014 in August of 2007 \u2014 because I had to. Our 35-year-old son, Jamie, died on the morning of April 16, 2007, as one of thirty-two victims of a disturbed shooter on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jamie, an accomplished digital artist who did lovely covers for four or five of my books, was holding forth in Room 2007 of Norris Hall in his German class more than two hours after his eventual murderer had slain two students in a dormitory on another part of campus. The administration failed to issue a warning \u2014 a warning that might well have saved many lives \u2014 in a timely fashion. However, some of its members secured their own offices and notified their own family members of this initial event; and so the worst school shooting in the history of the United States claimed our son, four other faculty members (including a man, Dr Librescu, who had survived the Holocaust and who held a table against his classroom door until all own students could escape), four of Jamie\u2019s students, and twenty-one other young people in Norris Hall, not to mention the first two victims in West Ambler-Johnston dorm. Another twenty-eight students were wounded by bullets or injured leaping from upper-story windows. Some of these young people will live with their injuries the rest of their lives.</b></p>\n<p><b>All of the administrators, with the exception of a woman who later died of a stroke or a heart attack (a death that my wife and I can\u2019t help but attribute partially to the stress of living with the mistakes of the President and the other Policy Group members), remain in their positions. So much for accountability, and so much for justice.</b></p>\n<p><b>In any case, \u201cVinegar Peace\u201d grew from this disaster and from a grief that I can\u2019t imagine ever laying totally aside. Jeri and I mourn Jamie\u2019s loss every day in some private way, and we think continually of all the other parents and loved ones of the slain and injured who will carry a similar burden with them until they die. We think, too, of the parents and loved ones of the dead and wounded from the United States\u2019s optional war in Iraq, who long for their dead and who pray for their injured with an intensity not a whit different from our own. How ironic that our son died on American soil. How sad the wasted potential and disfigured lives resulting from violence everywhere. And forgive me the inadequacy of these remarks. Clearly, I wrote a story because I could not address either my outrage or my grief in any other way.</b></p>\n<p><b>Mike Bishop</b></p>\n<p><b>StarShipSofa</b> is very honoured and humbled to be allowed to bring this...", "duration": "01:09:35", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/06/d0/da/06d0dadd-febc-689e-b7dd-5c79016becef/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm":
