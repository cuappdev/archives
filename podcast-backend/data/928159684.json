It was a tough life, and I realized quickly that I couldn't sustain a life like that. It was impossible. So I hired a trainer to force me to be better. I made an enormous lifestyle shift, and I am so happy I did.<br /><br />But it made me realize something about the current state of fitness entrepreneurs. And I want to shine a light on it.<br /><br />Everybody defaults to what comes easy to them. That should be obvious. But greatness comes from adversity; it comes from looking a challenge directly in the eye and having the fortitude to step up and go after it.<br /><br />This is what's going on with the fitness want-repreneur world right now.<br /><br />Everyone is going for what is easy. And that isn't going to pan out if they are serious about becoming a business person. Just like I knew being a great business person wouldn't pan out if I didn't get healthy.<br /><br />Fitness entrepreneurs want to do the minimal work and still expect a huge return. It's easy for fitness entrepreneurs to do the push ups, to do the squats and deadlifts because that is exactly what got them to where they are now. They started in fitness and now they want to make money just by having those guns or that body. They default into what is easy without recognizing what is hard: running an actual business.<br /><br />You know what was hard for me? Waking up early. Not eating what I wanted to eat. Powering through workouts. Yet it was easy to build 50M dollar businesses.<br /><br />I wanted to pass off getting up and running. I wanted to pass off lifting, squatting, stretching. I didn't want to do it. But I had no problem working eighteen hours a day, taking meeting after meeting, and putting in the actual work.<br /><br />Fitness \"entrepreneurs\" want to pass on replying to tweets all day to get the word out. They want to pass off the marketing. They want to pass off working hard to create a great interesting post, or doing a bunch of podcasts to get a larger audience. They want to go straight for the mirror selfie so you can get a bunch of Instagram likes, then call that their \"business\".<br /><br />Well guess what? It's not good enough.<br /><br />I have sympathy for how long it can take for something to come together in a big way. I get thousands and thousands of emails a year from people saying they've been working for months at something and they aren't seeing results. It can be disheartening. In a weird way, working out has shown me that more than anything else. I've been working out for sixteen months now and I'm happy, but if you told me sixteen months ago that this what I would have by now, I might say \"Ehhhh\u2026\"<br /><br />But the reverse is far worse.<br /><br />That's why I say to you: just start the work now. Do it. Work hard. Be diligent. Do not let up. You have the body. You have the chops. You did all that. Now get to the business side of things and grow that muscle too. <br /><br />MUSIC BY: <a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deisel1time\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://soundcloud.com/deisel1time\">https://soundcloud.com/deisel1time</a> </p>", "duration": "04:09", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/The_Current_State_of_Fitness_Entrepreneurs.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1448402193, "title": "Billboards, Production Capacity, & Gary Gets Salty", "author": "", "summary": "<p>#QOTD: What wine are you drinking at Thanksgiving?<br /><br />#LINKS<br />JOIN MY EMAIL LIST http://www.eepurl.com/LY3M5<br />WHAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR <a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://medium.com/@garyvee/one-thing-i-am-truly-thankful-for-this-year-ea3a0f5f719c#.gks957qrs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://medium.com/@garyvee/one-thing-i-am-truly-thankful-for-this-year-ea3a0f5f719c#.gks957qrs\">https://medium.com/@garyvee/one-thing...</a><br />MY NEWEST MEDIUM <a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://medium.com/@garyvee/why-everybody-has-permission-to-make-all-kinds-of-content-583a7f221519#.3vlpf8vpm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://medium.com/@garyvee/why-everybody-has-permission-to-make-all-kinds-of-content-583a7f221519#.3vlpf8vpm\">https://medium.com/@garyvee/why-every...</a></p>", "duration": "20:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/Ep_165.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1448057444, "title": "Streaming Services, Beatboxing, & Telling the Truth", "author": "", "summary": "<p>#QOTD: What is your truth?

Something they aren't good at. Something they haven't addressed. Everyone. That is the beginning of the process of self-awareness.<br /><br />One of the most important things for me when it comes to running a team is making everyone feel safe. Because when people feel safe, they start telling the truth. And that is an enormous upside in running a business.

I like pulling from both directions because it brings strengths. I really do think that life and business are bridges, and if you pull hard in both directions, you'll find balance. For example, ego and humility. You need both, but you can't have to much of one. Same with clouds and dirt, aka, higher level and execution.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So when I say don't pay attention to small details, but I also say play to your strengths but your strength is attention to detail, I understand it can be hard to figure out what to do. But I have an idea. If your strength is attention to detail but you're looking for long term business success, there are some things you need to consider.</p>\n<p>First, if you're top dog, your business is going to be small. But you would be an awesome number two three or four to a top dog. You need to pair yourself with someone who only thinks about the clouds and isn't down in the dirt like you are. You might even be happier not having the pressure of being number one because it will allow you to pay attention to those small details you would not normally be able to. Attach yourself to a number one and bet on your strengths.</p>\n<p>If your strength is finite details, your upside is limited as the number one. You have two decisions to make. One, you're cool with that. Or two, you're going to latch on to someone who will be able to elevate your work and your eight or twenty percent will be greater than the a hundred percent you do for yourself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "12:56", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EPISODE_105.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1432913410, "title": "Growing Lazy, Twitter Video for Brands, & We Have A Bucket!", "author": "", "summary": "<p>#QOTD: What do you think about the bucket?</p>\n<p>#LINKS</p>\n<p>MY NEWEST ARTICLE ON MEDIUM https://medium.com/@garyvee/why-listening-to-gurus-won-t-change-your-lifestyle-cea34330ae76</p>", "duration": "12:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EPISODE_104_Exports_1.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1432762727, "title": "CrossFit, One On One Marketing, & Liking Your Own Photos", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD: Are you gonna take me up on my advice on replying to people on Instagram and using Twitter video?

For example, I don't like the idea of an automatic direct message that sends when you follow somebody, or somebody follows you. It feels very spammy.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">However, automation does some times make sense. We use it at Wine Library. When your order is confirmed, we send an email that says \"Hey, your order is ready.\"\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">There is a fine line between what one would quantify as the thing that a human should do and the thing a computer should do. When automation tries to take the place of a human, that is when things get weird. When you use a computer to automatically populate names into mass emails that are SUPPOSED to look personal, that's messed up. When you sign an automation with your own name as if you did, that is also messed up.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">To me, it all comes around to the intent of the automation. If you're trying to \"trick\" someone into thinking it's a person, that is where things get tricky.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">One would argue that automating makes for a lot of conversion. But for me, I think there is more value in someone reaching out personally. I don't want a computer to be responding to you as me. When I have free moments, I try to answer every email I get. Personally.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">So automation makes sense for a lot of things.

They, for a change, will actually care about the customer. Employees will care, because they would have incentives. Maybe they would even put Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts inside of the DMVs, to make more money on the rent.</p>\n<p>Basically, privatized DMVs would innovate. Care. Give a crap. All the things that government industries don't do because it is not in their best interest. The people that can't innovate and can't win in a competitive landscape default to having terrible careless services.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don't want to be a hardcore capitalist on this issue, though.

If there was an #AskGaryVee Show in 1967 and I got a question like this, I'd say something like \"Hey groovy cats, it's the AskGaryVee Show. Dawn, your question is like asking if people will pay for water. No way!\" That would be the WRONG answer. What happened was that Poland Springs, and probably a lot of brands before Poland Springs, came along and convinced people that bottled water had value. Here's a fun weekend activity: go ask your grandparents what they thought about the idea of people paying for water.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;\">In fact, think about how you feel.

The failure has to be quantified. If you fail and then can never get up from it again, that's not a good kind of failure. Failure and adversity are the two things I think about. For me, as an entrepreneur, all my failures along the way have been a lesson. I'm even thinking back to when I attended my first baseball card trade show. I bought a table at 13 for $400 and nobody showed up. That was a lesson. Those micro failures were super super important. But it also depends on your stomach. If you really go out of business, people can go one of two ways. Either they're just finished and they're never able to get off the mat, or they go in a different direction. So to me, quantifying the failure is important.</span></p>", "duration": "23:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EP_89_podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1429104878, "title": "Disney's Magic Band, Selling Stuff on Meerkat & Safety First", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD, PART 1: Would you \"televise\" anything on Meerkat or Periscope consistently?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD, PART 2: How much time in a 24-hour day would you allocate to watching something live on one of those platforms?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#LINKS</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">GV's Morning Routine:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/gary-vaynerchuks-morning-routine-2015-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/gary-vaynerchuks-morning-routine-2015-3\">http://www.businessinsider.com/gary-v...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Submit a question:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\">https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-y...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Meerkat vs. Periscope:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/meerkat-periscope-answer-obvious-gary-vaynerchuk?trk=mp-reader-card\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/meerkat-periscope-answer-obvious-gary-vaynerchuk?trk=mp-reader-card\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/meerka...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">What do I think about Disney investing in the Magic Band, and the future of wearable tech in general? You know the answer. This is an interesting question because this is the kind of future that is inevitable. Smart, wearable technologies is going to eat up the world.

The layering and ammo that this gives Disney in that upfront investment is extraordinary. The recall, the content pushing out, the unlocking new virtual features - all of a sudden now, they have the ability to change the flow of the park. One of the things that I am most fascinated by right now as a retailer is efficiency. Efficiency everywhere. In an airport, an amusement park, or a retail store. Where do you know there are always going to be congested areas? Then, where are the places people just aren't going? Now imagine slapping some technology on a rock all the way in left field that requires people to go there. Now you're moving people there, making less lines. People are buying more food; even a fourth of a hot dog adds up to a lot.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Those are the things you need to be thinking about.

Money and time are, of course, difficulties. When I started WineLibrary, I had time but we didn\u2019t necessarily have the money. So it took more time. Today, I have the money, but boy do I not have the time. Fact is, though, that neither should ever be an excuse. They weren\u2019t for me, and they shouldn\u2019t be for you.</p>\n<p>This is something I really need everyone to understand. No one should ever point to time or money as an obstacle. They are firmly in the excuses column, and I have no patience for that. I will never make an excuse. Everything that is a problem with me, everything I don\u2019t achieve and everything wrong with VaynerMedia is my fault. I succumb to that, I respect that, and that\u2019s how I think it should be. No excuses. Even more so, you shouldn\u2019t let yourself have patience for excuses either. Train yourself to believe this, and you will see amazing results. No joke. There will always be problems, and you need to get out of the mindset that they are obstacles because you should already assume they will be there. They\u2019re just part of the path, my friend.</p>\n<p>Because guess what? There are about a million other things that could stop success in it\u2019s tracks. The health and well being of your family. The world is changing. The media, bad coverage of you. I\u2019m a human being, and I always wonder what would happen if I say the wrong thing. Any of these things could happen, but they are the same thing: excuses.</p>\n<p>There are a million reasons why not, but there is one good reason why, which is this: you just have to persevere.</p>\n<p>No matter what happens, it\u2019s the way it is, and you have to keep going. And that is where the optimism lives. If you truly believe that you can do it no matter what, you\u2019ve got this. The only reason you might bring up any of the previous excuses we talked about is because you DON\u2019T believe, right? Do not let that kind of thinking ever get in the way.</p>\n<p>So. You can pick time. You can pick money. Pick any one or two things that you think stop you from winning your game. But the truth is there are a million reasons. Get thicker skin. Build up your self esteem. To be able to get through, you need to have optimism.

All wrong.</p>\n<p>The biggest obstacle to success is a lack of optimism.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll back up.</p>\n<p>The fact that people go straight to any other answer is the problem in itself. Money and time are, of course, difficulties. When I started WineLibrary, I had time but we didn\u2019t necessarily have the money. So it took more time. Today, I have the money, but boy do I not have the time. Fact is, though, that neither should ever be an excuse. They weren\u2019t for me, and they shouldn\u2019t be for you.</p>\n<p>This is something I really need everyone to understand. No one should ever point to time or money as an obstacle. They are firmly in the excuses column, and I have no patience for that. I will never make an excuse. Everything that is a problem with me, everything I don\u2019t achieve and everything wrong with VaynerMedia is my fault. I succumb to that, I respect that, and that\u2019s how I think it should be. No excuses. Even more so, you shouldn\u2019t let yourself have patience for excuses either. Train yourself to believe this, and you will see amazing results. No joke. There will always be problems, and you need to get out of the mindset that they are obstacles because you should already assume they will be there. They\u2019re just part of the path, my friend.</p>\n<p>Because guess what? There are about a million other things that could stop success in it\u2019s tracks. The health and well being of your family. The world is changing. The media, bad coverage of you. I\u2019m a human being, and I always wonder what would happen if I say the wrong thing. Any of these things could happen, but they are the same thing: excuses.</p>\n<p>There are a million reasons why not, but there is one good reason why, which is this: you just have to persevere.</p>\n<p>No matter what happens, it\u2019s the way it is, and you have to keep going. And that is where the optimism lives. If you truly believe that you can do it no matter what, you\u2019ve got this. The only reason you might bring up any of the previous excuses we talked about is because you DON\u2019T believe, right? Do not let that kind of thinking ever get in the way.</p>\n<p>So. You can pick time. You can pick money. Pick any one or two things that you think stop you from winning your game. But the truth is there are a million reasons. Get thicker skin. Build up your self esteem. To be able to get through, you need to have optimism. Every day is hard, and all you have to fight it in the end is yourself.</p>\n<p>The music for this video is a song from the motion picture \"Inception\" titled \"Time\" ALL Music rights belong to Hans Zimmer and the studio behind the creation of this song.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "03:18", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/the_straightest_line_to_success.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1428529871, "title": "Passive Income, Foreign Languages & How to Delegate", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD: What is your immediate dream right now?

If you actually think it's not that important, it becomes a hell of a lot easier to let someone else do it. If you recognize that someone else's 7.7 point skills are completely acceptable for a task in place of your 10 point skills, do it. It's all about humility. Ego is the issue with delegation. Even though I have a ton of ego, I have a boatload more of humility than you think.</span></p>", "duration": "13:10", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EPISODE_86_Podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1428499233, "title": "Advertising on Pinterest, Body Language & Peace of Mind", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD: What was the biggest miss of your career?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#LINKS</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">How to submit a question:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\">https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-y...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Explore Pinterest:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://ads.pinterest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ads.pinterest.com/\">https://ads.pinterest.com/</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">We haven't talked enough about Pinterest on this show. I am a huge believer in Pinterest's product. You might have noticed recently that they've created a term of service in which you can't do affiliate sales. I think that means that they are going to be running that for themselves. If you start thinking about the amount of commerce that goes on on Pinterest, even if thye make 5% of every transaction, it could easily be one of the 5 to 10 top companies in revenue in the digital space.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Like I said, I'm a big believer in the business. We've seen great results already in a company that my fund, VaynerRSE, is incubating: Faith Box. We ran some promoted pins to great success. We're also definitely seeing it in clients here at Vayner. Wine Library, same thing. I'm massively bullish. In fact, I think that Pinterest's ad product is going to be huge. 18 months from today, we will come back to this video and create a piece of content to talk about this video where I make this claim: Pinterest's ad product is a MAJOR competitor to Google AdWords for e-comm businesses. There.

It's quite simple really. The thing is, when it comes to content, quality trumps everything. Back in the day, companies like Yahoo would fly me out to their headquarters to try and help then figure out their long format shows. Why was WineLibraryTV doing so well? The real answer was easy: quality is quality is quality. If I can put out a fifteen or thirty minute show and captive an audience, then it has a chance of doing well. If I can't, then it won't. It's not complicated. There are plenty of shit fourteen second videos. There are plenty of \"never get off the ground\" one minute shows. You'll watch a three hour movie cause it's good, but you will not watch a fifteen second commercial because it's crap.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">The length is not the variable in determining the quality.

Snapchat dabbled in it with their new chat function that launched about a year ago. Now Meerkat has been getting a lot of press around their new product.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">However, if I were Meerkat, I would be very worried right now.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Twitter\u2019s recent acquisition of the company Periscope (which is still just in beta testing) is not the best news for them. If it functions the same as Meerkat, which it is rumored to, they will have an advantage over Meerkat that will be very tough to overcome. The advantage? Native in feed. Because Periscope will be owned by Twitter, the seamless transition between the apps is inevitable, and we will probably see embedded images, and maybe even the ability to watch live streams in feed. As of right now, Meerkat pushes a tweet out on your behalf that is nothing but text and a short link. Not super eye catching in the feed, nor is it very user friendly.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Integration between platforms is key; it\u2019s one reason Vine was able to take off so quickly. Users want an easy, friendly experience that allows them to interact with all platforms equally. But platforms don\u2019t always play nice. You may notice that when you push an Instagram photo to Twitter, it appears merely as a link, no visual whatsoever. However, Vine transitions with no problem. This is the upper hand that Periscope will have.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">So I would be concerned for Meerkat. Absolutely. But truly, we\u2019ll have to wait and see how this pans out. If it\u2019s a fast move by Twitter to integrate, it could be bad. But maybe not. When Facebook launched check-ins, everyone said Foursquare was dead. That didn\u2019t happen. Both have survived and evolved.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">But Meerkat is built on top of Twitter, from the sign in to the push outs. It relies on Twitter for all the aspects of its platform, except for the actual streaming part, which happens in app. So it is bound to be a different situation than Facebook and Foursquare, which were separate entities entirely to begin with. And I\u2019ll be watching to see what happens. I absolutely plan on using Periscope so I can compare it to Meerkat. I see a scenario where this is detrimental to Meerkat, but I also see a scenario where Twitter tries to see if both can survive.</span></p>", "duration": "26:44", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/Episode_80-Podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1426114578, "title": "A Keynote: Entrepreneurship Can't Be Taught", "author": "", "summary": "", "duration": "46:13", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/Podcast-Gary_Vaynerchuk_-_USC_Entrepreneur_Talk.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1426113250, "title": "Pencils of Promise, Business Reviews & Television Advertising", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">#QOTD: How many of you ACTUALLY watch television commercials?\u00a0</span></p>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">#LINKS</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">Music in this episode by:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gonequitemad.com/\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\">www.gonequitemad.com</a></div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">Check out Brendan's awesome video:\u00a0<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/0BWK4uOZqX/\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\">http://instagram.com/p/0BWK4uOZqX/</a></div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">Fred Wilson on Twitter:\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fredwilson\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/fredwilson</a></div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">Submit a question:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html</a></div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">The amount of \"buts\" I hear is actually stunningly overwhelming.

I liked the grind too much, and that didn't allow me\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">to scale and create the level of wealthy needed to pull it off.\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">But I do hear way too many \"buts\" from people. But is an excuse.\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">BUT ... :) before I finish with my ra-ra scenario, let's understand that there is some very real stuff going on in the world. You could be born in a part of the world where there is a dictator or communism. Do I think it's easy as to be a female entrepreneur in the Middle East as it is to be in New York City? No. Of course not. Just like any white male born in a semi affluent environment is bound to have a leg up on minorities in poor communities.\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">But there is a flipside to this. The hustle that you get from coming from the grind is a huge advantage. Some people think you're dead on impact, that you have to stick with the restrictions you're born in; that if you're born into a bad situation, you're bound to fail. But I think being born into luxury is worse because everything comes so easy and you don't know how to get anything.</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">It all comes down to how you operate and how you look at the world. But I will tell you this: I hate excuses. I hate them with all my heart. When something is wrong with VaynerMedia, that's all on me. I love taking that blame and not passing the buck. I take pride in taking the blame. Stop making excuses and work.\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\" style=\"cursor: pointer; padding: 10px 0px; width: 22px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">\n<div class=\"ajR\" id=\":2rp\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); clear: both; line-height: 6px; width: 20px; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241);\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif\" style=\"height: 8px; width: 20px;\" /></div>\n</div>", "duration": "16:22", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EPISODE_79_Podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1425751435, "title": "Marketing for Musicians, Urinals, & Facebook Video", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD: Will you when, when live streaming wearable technology comes, Truman show your life, or will you consume Truman shows?

The only reason I'm not all in right now is because I'm too busy. Everybody has to decide their own opportunity costs. For me, I think I over-index on video. I perform better on video. I like video, I like this whole thing.<br /><br />But I want to still have a presence on their, so I'm taking the audio of this show and turning into a podcast. I think podcasting is a huge phenomenon. Obviously the smart phone has changed the dynamic; people can take it with them when they run or travel or work out. Other people are listening on their car over blue tooth. It has particularly exploded over the last twenty-four months, especially with Serial being such a big deal. It was big back in 04 and 05, and now it's having a comeback.\u00a0<br /><br />I'm all about podcasting in its traditional form as an audio experience. To me, there is a huge opportunity that is being missed for a long of people. Let's not forget that audio is much more accessible to a lot of people. Making a video takes a different dimension and skill set, one that I think I own; thus, I use this form to create two pieces of content. I take the audio and turn it into a podcast. Because video comes so naturally to me, that is what I default to. But I want to be aware of the podcast world, so I do what I can to make it work.<br /><br />If I had time to do two separate shows, I would. But right now I don't see the ROI of only doing audio in a world where I have so many projects happening.\u00a0<br /><br />And by the way, Podcast listeners (if you're reading this :) ), please give me your feedback. I want to make sure I'm hearing you and getting feedback.</p>\n</div>", "duration": "14:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/Episode_74_Podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1424270795, "title": "Podcasting, Building Legacy & The Chamber of Commerce", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD: What are you focusing on the MOST right now?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#SIDE QOTD: What do you want from me, AGV wise? :)</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#LINKS</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Submit a question!\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\">https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-y...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Is there a risk in giving away your best work for free? Of course. Giving away awesome work for free has been my gateway drug to so many great opportunities. But best work needs to be defined for the category you're in. I'm blown away by the amount of people who don't realize that their best advice is exactly what you should give away for free. But if you're a painter, and your best work is the most amazing painting you ever made, and you give it away for free, that's maybe a different game. But maybe you strategically gave it away. Like to an important museum, maybe. Or to a billionaire that puts in a prime spot in that home, could that then become the gateway to more?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">The problem with this debate is that when you are doing something for free, it needs to be strategic. Because what you are looking to do by giving away something for free is create leverage to then do something that is not for free, right? Right. DRock could have made that first video for someone who is not me, and it might not have panned out the same. He might not have received that ROI that he got for doing a video for free for me.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">I think that people look at this too much as a blanket statement. For me, everything I give away for free has strategic purpose. I understand WHY I'm doing it, and that's why it becomes so much easier to do, even though I don't always expect an outcome from that action. That becomes the big part of this. Way too many people do stuff for free and that expect this windfall behind it. Then when it's not delivered, they become disappointed; and in that disappointment, they don't follow up, they don't try it again.

That\u2019s literally how I think about this. The fact of the matter is you have to go right in the for the kill. It\u2019s all Karate Kid. Go in for it.</p>\n<p>What else makes it a great. Honesty. Just be real with what your goal is. If I was the CEO of Toyota, my Super Bowl ad would sound like this: \u201cHey. I\u2019m Gary Vaynerchuk and I\u2019m the CEO of Toyota. I want you to buy my cars. What do I have to do to make that happen? Let us know.\u201d That is a good Super Bowl commercial. Forget the pony. Forget the eagle and the cute dog.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m turning this episode into a test case right now. Currently, Jab Jab Jab Right Hooks\u2019 Amazon ranking is #2,051. I am now asking everyone to buy one copy. ONE. It would mean a lot to me. It would prove my point about solid right hooks. You\u2019ve watched thirty or so episode for free, and now I\u2019m asking you for this one thing. Buy one.</p>\n<p>And so, that is a right hook my friends. You just honestly ask. You try to create a little guilt around it. And you ask.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t hold back and be honest.</p>", "duration": "17:04", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/Episode_70_export_final_podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1423186743, "title": "Monetizing Media Sites, Sad Super Bowl Ads & Solid Data", "author": "", "summary": "<p>#QOTD: What question would you really like to ask me based on Steve's last question that you've never asked me?

Why? Because if you look at my twenty year career, most of it has been guessing, and, I'd like to think, projecting where the market is going to go. There was no data on what e-commerce would do in 1996. There was no data on email marketing when you were one of the first hundred people using it. There was no data on what Instagram was going to bring us in value when AJ sold Brisk Iced Tea an Instagram campaign thirteen days after Instagram launched. And...there was no data around Vine celebrities when I launched my Vine talent agency 110 days after Vine launched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So from a strategy standpoint, I get the accolades and have the luxury of doing a show that people actually watch completely on intuition because that's what I have that other people don't have. It's no different than being great at basketball or being attractive or all the other good things that can happen in life. It was just there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, I do think data still plays a role. I make these predictions, but then to actually run the business you need to know what's going on. My practicality comes into play. VaynerMedia grew very quickly, and you don't do that if you can't make payroll, right? You obviously need that practicality to run a business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I used to think I was a super 50/50 guy on this. My personality and communication style gets people's attention and put me in one place, but I take enormous pride in being able to shut up some times too. The first ten years of my career I kept my mouth shut. I built something and then I started talking.</p>\n<p>So it's both. I built the data early in my career. I got into business and entrepreneurship early. But now I'm making calls on intuition. I need both.\u00a0</p>", "duration": "20:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EPISODE_69_Podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1423081398, "title": "Optimizing Hashtags, Recycling Old Content & Bookstore Marketing", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD: What animal scares the crap out of you?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#LINKS</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">One Is Greater Than Zero:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fsYWXrGGcE\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fsYWXrGGcE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fsYW...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">GaryVee Loves Twitter Video:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUy45S2eTZs\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUy45S2eTZs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUy45...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Ask a question:\u00a0</span><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-youll-need-to-get-garyvee-945936926.html\">https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/what-y...</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"http://instagram.com/joshguilar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; cursor: pointer; color: #167ac6; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://instagram.com/joshguilar/\">http://instagram.com/joshguilar/</a><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Hashtag culture is very important, especially to Instagram and Twitter.

I have the #AskGaryVee hashtag, but it's really a way for me to gather questions, as well as create a community that people can talk to each other on. For a campaign, it's different. You need to understand two things. One, hashtags are not ownable. Maybe some of you didn't get it, so I'll say it again: hashtags are not ownable. It is insane to me that people in 2015 still think you can own a hashtag. I walk into a lot of brand meetings where people will say things like \"Let's own the #GetEm hashtag.\" My usual response is: what the hell are you talking about?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">First and foremost, any hashtag you create could be taken tomorrow by someone else and used differently. If you can remember all the way back to 2009, Skittles put out a hashtag and ended up with a lot of really crude things on their hashtag. Even worse, Skittles made their homepage a feed of that hashtag, where everything that was posted using it showed up. Yikes. It still happens today.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">So, how do you optimize hashtags for a campaign?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Flip it.

You need to spend the next 6-12 months actively acquiring new users. Then the answer is YES. It's totally fine to be making an ad once every 7 Instagram videos (remember, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook). But you need to make the stuff entertaining. Think like 1950's advertorial-style commercial starring you using the product. Like when they used to bring dogs onto Jonny Carson to eat Alpo dog food.

But I don't over think my content. Way too many people over think the stuff they are putting out there. We're living in a culture where kids are growing up scrutinizing every selfie they take. It takes them forty-seven minutes to post because they have to make sure the lighting is right. Then when it doesn't get enough likes in the first four minutes, they pull it down. I have the reverse of that rigor. I would take the most unflattering selfies, not caring about the lighting (this is actually the first year I've started to understand lighting...).</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Bottom line: I really don't care about the angles.

The answer is simple: you need to work harder. And faster. There's really nothing else to it. I'm exhausted every day, but I'm making all sorts of things happen in my eighteen hours. Not only am I working eighteen hours, I'm working fast as hell in this eighteen hours. And, I'm prioritizing what's important and what's not.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">We're all different. We work in different ways. If you're Type A, maybe you just need to schedule non-negotiable time for your personal brand if it's that important to you. But really, there is no magic answer here. The answer is just more time, and faster within that time.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Now, the faster part might confuse some people. I always tell people to start working harder, stop watching Lost, but there's another variable: be much faster in the hours you'er already in. There is not a second that's down for me. Some people say they work ten minutes day, but then when I audit them, there's fifteen minutes here and there where they watched a YouTube video. We fight for minutes on my team. Even seconds.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">I used to think I was the biggest workaholic that lived. From twenty-two to thirty, I really thought I was all in. But I had enough time to bullshit about baseball with friends. I had time. Now, I'm dramatically faster. And I'm working more hours. That's how it's happening.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">So that's the answer.

If you make a great product and you can get people to taste it, both literally and metaphorically, then there's a tremendous opportunity for your name to spread on its own. There are tons of brands that don't spend on marketing and win simply by making a great product that people can't help but talk about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this day and age, you may not have the budget to put towards marketing your product or service, but that shouldn't stop you. If you're putting out a strong product and service then your name may very well spread through the eyes and ears of those that are able to experience your offerings firsthand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Social Media has put us in a very interesting space. If you can leverage the social \"influence\" of one individual who's had a great experience with what your business offers, you can be well on your way to surpassing the attention that any paid budget would get you. BUT, you need to make sure you actually have a good product. For instance, if you're a small time restaurant that happens to have great food, all you need is that one person on Instagram or Twitter to talk you up because they love what you have to offer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The brands and the products that will break out in the next decade with zero dollars may end up being anomalies in the grand scheme of things, but that's all predicated on them having tremendous products. You can have all the money in the world but if your product sucks, you'll end up losing the long game. HOWEVER, you may very well be piss poor and not in the position to spend money on marketing, but if your product is good enough to entice people to talk about it, then in this day and age, you can most certainly win.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "09:00", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EPISODE_63_Podcast.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1421943860, "title": "Franchising, Open Courses & Cash or Exposure", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Part 1: Give me your feedback, are you excited about instagram bringing a visual element to the show?\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Part 2: Are you going to submit a question via instagram?\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">If you are building a consumer facing business, like a restaurant for example, then a franchise is a great thing to do. But, something to ask is\u2014are you trying to franchise your name? A lot of people have tried to franchise me. Yeah. Me. As in Garyvee. I got so many pitches when \u201cCrush It\u201d came out in 2010. People wanted to build courses that they would teach, but it would syphon up to me. That was something I wasn't comfortable with because I don\u2019t feel like it represented me. I wouldn't want to franchise that route.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">So if you're asking me about franchising yourself, I'm going to say no. Having other people represent \"you\", to scale your \"brand\" as a franchise, just doesn't make sense any more. With YouTube and all the other forms of social media available, you just don't need it.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">BUT let's say you're franchising your restaurant or retail business. If that is the case, I am comfortable saying: go for it. You can make suer your brand is ensured with lots of rules, lots of legal jargon and intense training. Whatever you need to do to scale that, do it. It might be tough, but it will be worth it to keep the core values of your business intact.\u00a0</span></p>", "duration": "15:27", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/EPISODE_62_Podcast_1.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1421267053, "title": "Hiring Friends, Funerals, & The Reality Distortion Field", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #ffffff;\">#QOTD: What is your favorite morning beverage?\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #ffffff;\">I think that \"hustle\" is something that you're born with.

Sure, if you work for yourself, it's really easy to give yourself that high grade hustle. However, if you work for someone else, I think your attitude and effort are solely based on how inspired you are and how protected you are by that leader. I truly believe that because I instill trust and protection (as well as some high standards) for those that work for me, they're able to go all-in and deliver and work as hard as they do due to the culture and the context that comes from within the workplace.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #ffffff;\">At the ground level, everyone is motivated by their own selfishness and there's nothing wrong with that. But then there's a side of it where if the leader presents a workplace based on meritocracy they're going to do whatever they can to not let that leader down but they'll also work hard enough to take advantage of the opportunity to grow and rise through the ranks. It's super fascinating to me see the levels of motivation that are on display among those that work for me as opposed to those that work for themselves.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #ffffff;\">There are so many variables that dictate one's work ethic, but there's no question that a lot of our motivation stems from our life's circumstances, be it traumatic or triumphant.

If you pay attention you'll realize that all the content we're putting out is (for the most part) based on the seed that is the #AskGaryVee show.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Just take a look at the last 6-8 weeks and you'll see the substantial increase in output we've been able to tackle because we're taking advantage of what this show provides -- whether that's Medium posts, GaryVaynerchuk.com articles, animated GIFs, etc. In essence, the #AskGaryVee is just one giant jab that allows for the further awareness that I'm trying to create with the other pieces of content we're putting out there. People gravitate to different mediums and different messaging and this show allows us to capitalize on all those needs.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Think about it.

People are actually consuming content on Instagram, whereas on Twitter, those days are over. Back in the day I used to be able to send out a tweet and although I had a substantially lower reach I was still able to garner that attention. Instagram, due to its image-focused nature, is naturally able to capture our attention more easily. And let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re lazy, and it\u2019s much easier to consume an image than to take the time to read a few lines or click through to a long form piece of content. It\u2019s just the nature of our tendencies, our attention spans, and the mediums where we\u2019re consuming this content, which happens to stem from the palms of our hands.</p>\n<p>OH!

I've been talking about this for a while in the halls of this world and within our industry. At the end of the day, these agencies are being hired to do work for THEIR CLIENTS, not for themselves.

I get that. It's smart in one way, but it's not intended for the long game and it's not sustainable. I'm not trying to begrudge the agencies that do it because I get the business rationale behind it but it's just not a healthy culture. It takes the eyes off the actual prize of doing what's best for the client and I just don't subscribe to it.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Luckily for us at VaynerMedia, our proof is in the pudding.

Lack of patience has caused so many people to not achieve the upside that they deserve and that just kills me. Another thing I value so greatly is an old school handshake. That really matters to me.

Having people in your life that you can trust based on their word goes a long way -- you know, someone that you just know is going to deliver on whatever it is they say they're going to do.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #ffffff;\">On the other hand, when someone doesn't deliver on something, I have the understanding to realize that unexpected things can come up and change the course of action. So I completely buy into being nimble and empathetic because you need to be able to understand that things don't always go according to plan, and it's not always the person on the other end that's to blame.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #f6f6f6;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #ffffff;\">I also think that people that are grateful are extremely attractive as well.

You need to be patient and empathetic and realize that when someone says they're going to do something, you'd hope they'll do whatever's in their power to deliver, but while also having the perspective in understanding that things don't always run their intended course -- And that's okay</span>.</span></p>", "duration": "09:20", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/Episode_53_Exports.mp3?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1418239128, "title": "First Impressions, Patrick Ewing, & Google Plus", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">#QOTD: Give me some stories from your experiences with company holiday parties.

There's a small niche group of people that I massively respect that have developed some great communities there. However, much like every social network besides Twitter, it isn't in fact a social network. Most of these \"social networks\" have become content portals. And so, I still have a great sized audience on Google+ and therefore they will not be forgotten and I will continue to distribute my content there because it's native, and that's what you need to do. Understand the nuances of the platform and deliver based on how it's used.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">So all in all, Google+ is a loss, but it's still something that needs to be paid attention to.

It's supply and demand. My advice? DON'T. DRINK.GOOD.WINE. It's all supply and demand.

By creating content you're beginning the journey of how your story will unfold. The reception of this content will also allow you to test and learn and understand the best approach to creating future content once your business and website are ready for the masses. That process you simply don't want to miss out on.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 17px;\">And so, a big issue I've been seeing is that people are too reluctant to sell against the communities and the impressions they've established on social. Too many people are caught up on only leveraging their website for banner ads but selling against social audiences is essentially the same thing. If you're creating valuable content that's living on social then you might as well take advantage of that opportunity. Don't get caught up in only monetizing on the platform that you fully own when there's a world of opportunity that exists through the channels you're deciding to put your content on.\u00a0</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 17px;\">So in short - If the opportunity to create content presents itself and makes sense for the objectives of the business you're trying to build, then my suggestion is to go ALL IN and get moving.

The truth is, I'm self-taught. I didn't take any courses in social media, but in general I was never a real good student and never took any substantial classes in business or marketing -- But, that's seemed to work out for me just fine :)</p>\n<p>I think all this really just boils down to being self-aware and knowing yourself. \u00a0I honestly think that 99% are you are clowns, and are just reading headlines, rather than being actual practitioners and going deep within each platform. I'm even scared of you taking a course because most of the courses I've been exposed to during speaking engagements were jokes -- either the course itself or the teachers involved came off as clowns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My honest opinion is that Social Media right now is in a very awkward and early stage. If you look back at the early internet marketers of 1995, they were spewing out a ton of garbage as well. So the timing is difficult now, but I can say confidently that I would feel a lot better about you taking a \"course\" 5 years from now rather than today.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, in this whole circus type of environment, it all scares me. The most important thing you can do is be surgical, knowledgeable, and become an actual practitioner. However, for this particular instance, there's too many variables to consider. Are the courses good? Can you actually learn in those environments? Because I can't - hence why my advice is to become a practitioner as best you can, because that's what I've done, and that's certainly worked for me :)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "duration": "12:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/06/ed/62/06ed62e6-b81a-cf08-90dc-8e113c3046c2/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/askgaryvee/Episode_31_Podcast.m4a?dest-id=224974", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 928159684, "seriesTitle": "The GaryVee Audio Experience", "pubDate": 1413133200, "title": "How to Pick a Name for Your Business", "author": "", "summary": "<p>#QOTD: What's your favorite thing about San Francisco?</p>\n<p>To me, a name is made.

Typically when people think about online video they think about spending 5/10% on the overall production and then 90/95% on the distribution. Of that 95% of allocated budget, they just end up pounding the users with right hooks and wind up pissing them off.</p>\n<p>So what does online video mean to most people? It's the pre-rolls on YouTube where people end up tabbing out and don't end up consuming the content. OR, they're going to sites like ESPN.com and getting pounded by 30 second videos that waste OUR time, which I'm sure pisses most of us off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I'm most worried about when I hear about these allocations is that I actually like live TV commercials better than the online videos that end up blocking the users from what they actually want to do or see. As I've stressed a million times before, this comes down to providing VALUE.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So when I hear these notions versus what I know the practitioners are actually doing, it bothers me because I know that they're spending their budgeted dollars on video that is annoying customers.
