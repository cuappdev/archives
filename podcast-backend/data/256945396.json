But Gordimer writes with a focussed intimacy that makes the piece a tragic love story rather than a political morality tale. \"One of the things I think she can teach us,\" says Hadley, \"is how to write politically without becoming shrill.\"</p>", "duration": "52:19", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/tnyfiction/tnyfiction090612__hadley.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["arts", "deborah treisman", "nadine gordimer", "storytelling", "tessa hadley", "fiction", "new", "yorker", "wnyc", "literature"]}, {"seriesId": 256945396, "seriesTitle": "The New Yorker: Fiction", "pubDate": 1343886428, "title": "Maile Meloy Reads Laurie Colwin", "author": "WNYC Studios and The New Yorker", "summary": "<p>Maile Meloy reads Laurie Colwin's \"Mr. Parker\" and discusses it with The New Yorker's fiction editor, Deborah Treisman. \"Mr. Parker\" was published in the April 14, 1973, issue of The New Yorker and can be found in \"Passion and Affect.\" Maile Meloy's novels include \"Liars and Saints\" and \"A Family Daughter.\"</p>", "duration": "22:21", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/tnyfiction/tnyfiction080212__meloy.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["arts", "deborah treisman", "laurie colwin", "maile meloy", "storytelling", "fiction", "new", "yorker", "wnyc", "literature"]}, {"seriesId": 256945396, "seriesTitle": "The New Yorker: Fiction", "pubDate": 1341029925, "title": "James Salter Reads Reynolds Price", "author": "WNYC Studios and The New Yorker", "summary": "<p>James Salter reads Reynolds Price's \"His Final Mother\" and discusses it with The New Yorker's fiction editor, Deborah Treisman. \"His Final Mother\" was published in the May 21, 1990, issue of The New Yorker and can be found in \"Reynolds Price: The Collected Stories.\" James Salter's novels include \"The Hunters\" and \"Light Years.\"</p>", "duration": "43:53", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/tnyfiction/tnyfiction063012__salter.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["arts", "deborah treisman", "james salter", "reynolds price", "storytelling", "fiction", "new", "yorker", "wnyc", "literature"]}, {"seriesId": 256945396, "seriesTitle": "The New Yorker: Fiction", "pubDate": 1338611334, "title": "Dave Eggers Reads Roddy Doyle", "author": "WNYC Studios and The New Yorker", "summary": "<p>Dave Eggers reads Roddy Doyle's \"Bullfighting,\" and discusses it with The New Yorker's fiction editor, Deborah Treisman. \"Bullfighting\" was published in the April 28, 2008, issue of The New Yorker and can be found in \"Bullfighting: Stories.\" Dave Eggers's new novel, \"A Hologram for the King,\" comes out this month.</p>", "duration": "49:55", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/62/45/1c6245ab-6570-0638-d141-1d61ab3c9d9c/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/tnyfiction/tnyfiction060212_eggers.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": ["arts", "dave eggers", "deborah treisman", "roddy doyle", "storytelling", "fiction", "new", "yorker", "wnyc", "literature"]}, {"seriesId": 256945396, "seriesTitle": "The New Yorker: Fiction", "pubDate": 1335927835, "title": "Matthew Klam Reads Charles D\u2019Ambrosio", "author": "WNYC Studios and The New Yorker", "summary": "<p>Matthew Klam reads Charles D'Ambrosio's \"The Point\" and discusses it with The New Yorker's fiction editor, Deborah Treisman. \"The Point\" was published in the October 1, 1990, issue of The New Yorker and was the title story of D'Ambrosio's first collection.
