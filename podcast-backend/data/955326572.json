Keep. It. Simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having so many stats available to us can be overwhelming, especially when you have all these numbers in front of you and you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Keep it simple by looking at the one metric that tells you how well your ads are doing based on the objective you have chosen.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what I mean by that...</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the goal of your ad campaign is to send people from your Facebook ad to a valuable blog post you\u2019ve written so you can start warming them up to your business, for example, you would choose the Objective \u201cClicks to Website\u201d when you\u2019re setting up your Facebook ads (the goal here is to drive people from your ad to your website).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now when looking at your stats, focus first on the cost per click and then the click-through rate which tells you the % of people who are seeing your ad and then clicking on it. If it\u2019s a low CPC and a good click through rate you know you\u2019ve set up a good ad. If it\u2019s a low click through rate, you use that information to make changes to your ad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So with that said, what\u2019s a good CPC and CTR %?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer to that is going to vary by industry, but as a general guideline, I\u2019d try and get your CPC below $1 and your CTR above 1%.</span></p>\n<p>Another example is when you\u2019re sending people from your Facebook ad to an opt-in page or a webinar registration page. The goal here is \u201cwebsite conversions\u201d because you\u2019re trying to get people to opt-in to your email list or register for your event.</p>\n<p>In this case, the first metric you want to look at is what is your cost per lead? How many leads have you generated for the amount of money you\u2019ve spent?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, for cost per lead, what\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d is going to vary from industry to industry. Meaning, for a B2B brand to get a $15 CPL, it might be super pumped for that, but if I\u2019m personally getting a $15 CPL, I\u2019m shutting my ads off and changing them up.</span></p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s <em>really</em> going to vary by the niche you\u2019re in. But, if I had to give you a general CPL to stay under, I would shoot for $8 and under. Again, that\u2019s going vary a lot.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep it simple, don\u2019t over complicate things any more than they need to be when it comes to reading your stats.</span></p>\n<p>I walk you through all of this in today's episode and more, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What I like to call \"troubleshooting\" stats like Reach, Frequency and Relevancy Score -- what they are, why they're important, and how to use them to make smart decisions for improving your Facebook ads.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to customize your Facebook ads reports</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The metrics you need to be looking at based on the Objective you're using</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The little known yet important stat most people overlook and how to customize it for your ad campaigns</span></li>\n</ul>", "duration": "19:58", "imageUrlLg": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7a/14/34/7a1434cc-5221-87eb-91d2-f3ebcbfe918b/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/7a/14/34/7a1434cc-5221-87eb-91d2-f3ebcbfe918b/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/aoptpodcast/AOPT_076_How_to_Understand_Facebook_Ads_Reporting_For_Better_Results.mp3?dest-id=238397", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 955326572, "seriesTitle": "The Art of Paid Traffic | Proven Online Advertising Strategies You Can Implement Today", "pubDate": 1455737558, "title": "#75: How Much Should You Spend On Your Paid Ads?", "author": "", "summary": "<p>On today's episode of the Art of Paid Traffic, we\u2019re going to continue our mini-series on metrics and measuring your paid traffic as today, Charlie Vallely and\u00a0Keith Perhac from a company called <a href=\"http://rickmulready.com/segmetrics\" target=\"_blank\">SegMetrics</a> are joining me to talk about\u00a0understanding the value of a lead and using your metrics to really dial in on determining how much should you spend on your paid ads.</p>\n<p>Now as you\u2019ll hear as we get into it, the metrics platform they\u2019ve created works with\u00a0Infusionsoft but if you\u2019re not an\u00a0Infusionsoft user, not to worry, it\u2019s totally fine.

color: #333333; margin: 0px 0px 15px;\">When it comes to the type of video, you need to be specific with regards to what you're using your video for. \u00a0For example, if you're using YouTube ads to drive traffic to your website, you want to use a video that's very short and has the most action happening within the first 20 seconds. \u00a0The most important thing is to ask people for the click!</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 17.3333339691162px; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 30.6000003814697px; color: #333333; margin: 0px 0px 15px;\">The first 5 seconds is super important, really grab people at the beginning. \u00a0At around the 20 second mark, ask for the click. \u00a0The reason being is that you only pay for your ad if people view your video for more than 30 seconds.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 17.3333339691162px; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 30.6000003814697px; color: #333333; margin: 0px 0px 15px;\">The whole video is clickable, people can click anywhere on the video but it works really well when you point people to a certain place to click, especially if you can use something that looks like a button.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 17.3333339691162px; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 30.6000003814697px; color: #333333; margin: 0px 0px 15px;\">Only target video placements. \u00a0If someone is watching a video relevant to your offer, you can target them. \u00a0For example, if someone is watching a video on yoga at home, we can run an ad in front of that person about yoga at home! \u00a0Get the targeting right!</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 17.3333339691162px;
