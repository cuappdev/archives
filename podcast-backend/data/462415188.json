and other sectors that impact our future. \n\nThe outlook he has developed as a result of all this input is less than sanguine. Jim concludes that economic growth will be constrained both by world governments' chronic addiction to spending more revenue than they take in, and by the systemically-rising costs of fossil fuel-driven energy.\n\nIn terms growth, he sees political leadership becoming less and less relevant in its ability to effect outcomes. In fact, he declares the price of oil as now being more influential in stimulating or depressing sovereign economies than central bank interest rates. In his words, \"\"oil is the new Federal Funds rate\"\".\n\nThose managing capital -- whether at the individual or institutional level -- have a very difficult time of it today because asset prices are being buffeted by powerful, but countervailing crosswinds. The deflationary forces of credit contraction put downward pressure on asset prices, but central bank money printing and other liquidity measures push up from below. Rock-bottom interest rates are forcing investors out the risk curve, but few are comfortable with the alternative choices they have. Many investors instead are looking to minimize risk now, but they're not sure what is safe anymore. Raise cash that's being eroding in purchasing power by inflation?

Not surprisingly for a longtime insider, Senator Bradley looks through the lens of working within the current system - i.e., if we can fix its shortcomings, it will solve our problems. Potential structural limits to growth, such as Peak Oil, are less bright on the radar.\n\nThere is much to learn here about what our Congressional leaders are focused on and what they are not. Listeners will undoubtly find points to agree with, and possibly others out-of-alignment with the concerns presented in the Crash Course. We expect an animated discussion to ensue in the Comments section below.\n\nWe take it as a good sign that widely-known veteran politicians such as Senator Bradley are increasingly standing up to admit \"there is a problem\" -- that's the first step towards taking corrective action.

No amount of political or policy intervention is going to change that reality. (Unless a global \"debt jubilee\" transpires, which Paul thinks is unlikely).\n\nLooking at the global monetary base, Paul sees it dwarfed by the staggering amount of debts that need to be repaid or serviced. The reckless use of leverage has resulted in a chasm between total credit and the money that can service it.\n\nSo how will this debt overhang be resolved?\n\nCentral bank money printing -- and lots of it -- thinks Paul.\n\nAt this point, the danger posed by the instability of our monetary and fiscal house of cards is so great that trying to time an investment program to when this avalanche of printing will occur too risky, in Paul's opinion.
