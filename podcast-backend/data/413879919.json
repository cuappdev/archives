After the wine class, a person who seemed very interested in what I had to say approaches me with a sad look on his or her face and says, \u201cI love the taste of wine. I\u2019m so fascinated by the subject but I just can\u2019t drink that often. I get a horrible headache every time I drink, especially with red wine. Is there anything I can do?\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>My heart always breaks a little for that person and I hope that despite my obvious lack of expertise in health matters (here\u2019s my caveat, I\u2019m an MBA, not an MD so I am only offering this article second hand) that I can solve the problem and get the person back on track to enjoy wine, headache-free.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Before I go down this path, I want to be really clear about the information that\u2019s widely available and that\u2019s repeated over and over again in major wine outlets and news publications. I scoured scientific journals and I found an even better source \u2013 a scientist who scoured scientific journals<a href=\"http://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/rss#_ftn1\">[1]</a> \u2013 to see what conclusive evidence there is on this topic. What I and they found was a lot of half studies without a statistically significant result in most cases. The bottom line is that no one has funded a large-scale study on this topic. (And I get it: really, who is going to fund something like this, which is what it comes down to? Wine companies have other priorities and they would be the most likely cash source\u2026).\u00a0 So as I share this info, I want to tell you now that except for two of these solutions, one which I can vouch for and another which has scientific proof behind it, the rest is pure conjecture.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Still, we\u2019re not operating in the dark. There are some strong contenders for what is causing that nasty pounding after drinking wine or more specifically, red wine. And, better yet, if you\u2019re not averse to taking an over-the-counter medicine, you could solve the problem fairly easily in many cases.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Let\u2019s run through the different potential causes and give ideas on how to tackle them.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>The first thing that is killing most heads\u2026</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m not going to hold you in suspense. I want to tell you the number one thing that is probably causing your headache: alcohol. It dehydrates the body, or to quote the UK National Health Service:</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><em>\u201cDehydration can also occur as a result of drinking too much alcohol. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you wee more.\u201d</em> (insert immature chuckle here).</p> <p><em>\u00a0</em></p> <p>And what a lot of us fail to realize is that most wine is somewhere between 12.5% and 14.5% alcohol by volume. That means that for a 5 ounce glass of wine, 12.5% to 14.5%, more or less, is made up of alcohol. Contrast that with beer, which is more like 3-4% alcohol by volume and you see that wine is not as innocuous as it seems.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>So if you happen to have one or two glasses of wine, especially red, which tends to be higher in alcohol (because the grapes are riper and picked later, thus upping the sugar), AND you have no water in between and no food or nibbles, you are robbing your body of water. Dehydration gives you a headache, so there you go! \u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>The Solution?</strong></p> <p>First, try wines with lower alcohol content. If you can drink around 10% or 11% ABV versus 14%, that could help. Look on the bottle for the percentage \u2013 it\u2019s required by law in most countries. Lower alcohol means more bang for your buck \u2013 1 glass of this stuff won\u2019t wallop you like one glass of a 14%\u2019er will.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Alternately you can take a page out of the professional drinkers\u2019 book people in the wine industry\u2019s book. We\u2019re usually downing water in between glasses or eating food to mitigate the effect of the high alcohol. It seems like our tolerances are off the charts (and they probably are to some extent) but a lot of that comes from experience and lots and lots of water.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Ok, that\u2019s the number one cause of headaches. But there are several others, so don\u2019t think I\u2019m about to dismiss you if you\u2019ve tried to drink water and it doesn\u2019t work!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Next are the mean amines. Wines that go through malolactic fermentation release amines in the process, and have levels that can be 200% higher than in wines that don\u2019t go through malo. There\u2019s been some research done on the effect of the \u201camines\u201d but nothing super conclusive. <a href=\"http://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/rss#_ftn2\">[2]</a></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>The second thing we\u2019re pretty sure is causing pain: Histamines<a href=\"http://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/rss#_ftn3\"><strong>[3]</strong></a></strong></p> <p>Histamines are compounds that exist in wine at varying levels. Red wine and bubbly tend to be higher in these pesky enzymes. That means if you have a sensitivity, you may have a terrible allergic reaction, e.g., a headache, rash, even sneezing. This is especially true for people with a diamine oxidase deficiency (you can take a probiotic to help that problem, incidentally). The National Institute of Health in the US has shown that high levels of histamine in blood plasma can create bad allergic reactions, including allergy headaches. Since alcohol increases histamine in blood plasma, you could wind up suffering with a headache.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>The Solution?</strong></p> <p>Pop the anti-histamine of your choice about an hour before you drink wine. Still drink the water to prevent dehydration, but see if this helps you out. Again, no conclusive studies on this one, but it has some research behind it, so I\u2019d give it a try (just check the interactions with alcohol before you take anything).</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>And the less proven amine\u2026</strong></p> <p>Some doctors posit that high levels of the amino acid tyramine, which can cause migraines, is the main cause of headache pain from wines. If stuff like processed meats (think pepperoni or hot dogs), tofu, soy sauce, miso, and cheeses like blue, brie, cheddar, Swiss, or Roquefort give you a headache, you may have an issue with tyramine. Although the levels are lower in red wine than in these foods, they go hand in hand. You\u2019ll need to skip the wine and cheese pairings and stick to one small glass of wine if you think this may be your issue. That said, apart from a few doctors saying they think this is the problem, I couldn\u2019t find any studies to back it up.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Tannins often take heat for causing headaches.</strong> And they do change serotonin levels, which can cause migraines. They ARE more prominent in reds than in whites, so that could explain the issue for people who have problems with red and not white. Tannins also can release fatty acids (prostaglandins) that can cause headaches and pain.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>But again, this is all conjecture. We don\u2019t have much to back this up. Still, it\u2019s a theory posited by headache specialists, so if you think this is your problem, take some kind of headache medicine \u2013 ibuprofen, Tylenol, aspirin, whatever. Again, watch out for the interaction between the wine and the drug.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>What is probably NOT causing your headache? Sulfites</strong></p> <p>Sulfites/sulfur dioxide/sulphites are a naturally occurring byproduct of fermentation and are added to wine to prevent spoilage and browning. They are also in dried fruit jam, molasses, bottled lime and lemon juice, sauerkraut, lunchmeat, and gravy. Although wine is singled out as a product that has sulfites, plenty of others have equal or higher levels.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Unless you are part of the 1-5% of the population that has a sulfite allergy, this isn\u2019t your problem. If you have severe asthma or allergies, this could be a huge issue and you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a problem because the result is not a headache, but an asthma attack or something worse. If you don\u2019t have these issues, dismiss this one.\u00a0 It\u2019s better you move on and try to find the real cause.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>The Wrap</strong></p> <p>After all this, I will repeat what I said at the beginning: the issue with a red wine headache or any wine headache is most likely dehydration or histamine issues or a combo of a few of these things. Try a few solutions and see if they work. And make sure you chug water. If it\u2019s still an epic fail, I guess you\u2019ll have to wait until I report back with some new, exciting finding that solves this really annoying problem!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <div> <p><a href=\"http://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/rss#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> http://www.wineinformationcouncil.eu/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1835:can-wine-trigger-migraine-attacks?&amp;Itemid=640</p> </div> <div> <p><a href=\"http://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/rss#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> http://www.yalescientific.org/2009/10/everyday-qa-what-causes-the-red-wine-headache/</p> </div> <div> <p><a href=\"http://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/rss#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8005453</p> </div>", "duration": "09:57", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/0d/a7/e6/0da7e68f-6be6-fff4-db69-d84ef522fd6a/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/0d/a7/e6/0da7e68f-6be6-fff4-db69-d84ef522fd6a/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/winefornormalpeople/Audio_blog_14__Red_Wine_Headaches.mp3?dest-id=150053", "type": "episode", "tags": ["drinking", "wine", "red", "headaches"]}, {"seriesId": 413879919, "seriesTitle": "Wine for Normal People", "pubDate": 1488130902, "title": "Ep 180:  Stellenbosch, South Africa", "author": "", "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Stellenbosch is the most prestigious, oldest wine growing region in South Africa.

Through Thomas Jefferson's detailed records, we're able to learn so much about wine during the late 1700s and early 1800s in France, Spain, and northern Italy. Turns out, as much as we think things have changed, much of it has stayed the same. We need to thank the folks at Monticello in Virginia\u00a0for making such awesome records available! Here are some notes:</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Pre-Revolution wine was made up of Madeira, light red Claret, Sherry, and Port. The British dictated tastes and discouraged trade in French wine so Portugal and Spain dominated</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Jefferson began his love of wine while at William & Mary College in Williamsburg, Virginia and developed more of an interest when he interacted with German prisoners during and after the Revolution</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>in 1784, Jefferson was newly widowed and moved to France to serve as an ambassador alongside John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Adams loved Bordeaux and helped school Jefferson in wine, but Jefferson took his passion further, combining \"public service with private gratification\" on a number of long trips through Burgundy, Rh\u00f4ne, Piedmont, Loire, and Bordeaux. He toured Rheingau, Mosel, and Champagne later on. Burgundy was his passion.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Jefferson didn't want to leave Paris in 1789 but left and became Washington's Secretary of State, and he never returned to the continent. He became an advocate for French and Italian wines in America.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>While \u00a0president, he drank sherry Hermitage blanc, what appears to be Bandol, and a Roussillon wine that seems like a modern day vin doux natural and racked up personal wine debts that would be several million dollars in today's world.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Throughout his life, Jefferson kept immaculate records of his drinking, coming up with a tasting lexicon and a method for getting people more interested in trying these fine wines. We know that the best wines of the world remain so -- terroir is terroir -- and that the more things have changed, the more they have stayed the same in many regards. No amount of technology can make a better wine than a Montrachet from Burgundy or a first growth from Bordeaux.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Hope you enjoy this bit of international wine history!

The three keys to finding one:</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <ol> <li>Lower acidity and softer, rounder textures, which mean these wines are from warmer, sunnier climates where the grapes get fully ripe and aren't as tart.\u00a013.5% alcohol is probably the minimum you\u2019d want for the right body.</li> </ol> <p>\u00a0</p> <ol start=\"2\"> <li>Wines that are better served at 50\u02daF+ -- not ice cold. You'll need to leave these out of the fridge to warm up.\u00a0</li> </ol> <p>\u00a0</p> <ol start=\"3\"> <li>Fuller flavored wines that have enough umph to stand up to richer foods -- soups and stews, poultry with herbs, pastas with richer sauces.</li> </ol> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>For me, the genre of grapes and blends that fit the bill are those from Alsace, , the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, and Southern Italy, and places that have similar climates to those areas.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Alsace Whites:</strong> Take your pick! Any of the great grapes of Alsace are full, soft, rich, and great for warmer weather.\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>Riesling</strong> is opulent and almost oily in texture but still dry with peach, apple, pear, and mineral (think of being near a waterfall) notes. The wine has acidity but it's fuller in body than many dry German versions.</li> <li>The <strong>Pinot Gris</strong> is not so aromatic, but it's spicy -- like coriander or mild ginger -- with smoke, orange, apricot, pear notes and a rich texture. Good stuff and affordable.\u00a0</li> <li>I\u2019ve actually had some awesome <strong>Pinot Blanc</strong> of late. Although it can be insipid and thin, the right producer in the right year makes it fat, round, and pear-like in flavor.</li> <li>Great versions can be had from $18 on up to hundreds of dollars.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Rh\u00f4ne Whites:</strong></p> <ul> <li>For Southern Rh\u00f4ne, C<strong>ostieres di N\u00eemes Blanc, C\u00f4tes de Rh\u00f4ne Blanc, and Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape blanc</strong> are my favorites. The main grapes for these wines vary -- some are Grenache Blanc, some Marsanne, some Viognier, some Roussanne or Picpoul, but good versions share the same character: soft, luxurious textures that roll around in your mouth with enough acidity to keep them from feeling heavy or imbalanced. The flavors will range from peachy to honeyed to herbal, but the textures are consistent so they fit the criteria above. Outstanding versions of Costieres de N\u00eemes and C\u00f4tes de Rh\u00f4ne Blanc can be had for US$15 to $20. I\u2019ve even had some great Picpoul for around $15 that has this same quality.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape will set you back at least $US40, but it\u2019s well worth it, especially with halibut in butter herb sauce (the best pairing I\u2019ve probably ever had!). You'll find similar wines from great producers in <strong>Priorat</strong> just south of Barcelona, Spain. These wines are often a better value than CdP and have a Grenache Blanc lead (and they are awesome with Spanish tapas!). You can get a great one for around $US25.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li><strong>Northern Rh\u00f4ne</strong> wines are similar but they are more refined and much more expensive! <strong>Viognier from Condrieu</strong> is soft, and like a bouquet of flowers or bowl of peaches or apricots, and dry but decadent in texture. The white versions of <strong>Hermitage, Crozes-Hermitage and Saint-Joseph</strong> are made with <strong>Marsanne and Roussanne</strong> grapes and may be the fullest whites you'll find -- like eating a honey comb, but not sweet, with lots of earthy, waterfall/stream smells and flavors.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Before I go move from the Rh\u00f4ne to Southern Italy, I should point out that <strong>California does some great whites with Rh\u00f4ne</strong> grapes too. I\u2019ve had some Viognier from Santa Barbara that\u2019s full of fruit flavor but with a touch of acid -- great with food and delicious on its own. Our friends at Tablas Creek in Paso Robles make a few outstanding white Rh\u00f4ne blends in the Rh\u00f4ne style. And one of the tastiest Rh\u00f4ne\u00a0wines I've had out of Lodi was a Picpoul by Acquiesce Winery -- full, rich, soft, but with enough acidity to keep it from sitting heavy in your mouth. All of these will run you more than $20, not a great value but tasty nonetheless!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>And to complete our tour of cold weather whites, on to Southern Italy...</strong></p> <ul> <li>The two amazing grapes of Southern Italy -- <strong>Fiano and Greco</strong> -- make rich, full, soft whites. Another warm, Mediterranean climate, these wines share a lot in common from a texture standpoint with the wines of the southern Rh\u00f4ne, especially. The difference is the flavors. Fiano tastes like honey with tangerine, cardamom, and hazelnut notes and floral notes-- like being outside in a garden where the bees can't get enough of the white flowers (gardenia, jasmine -- that kind of stuff). Greco is soft, but the best version is Greco di Tufo from Campania, and it tastes like pears and almonds with a ton of mineral/chalk note and a good acidity.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Don\u2019t worry, as with all audio blogs, all this info is at winefornormalpeople.com.

And when the weather is cool, that\u2019s often all I\u2019ll grab. But after I\u2019ve downed big reds from warm places around the (mostly NEW) world with higher alcohol that will make me feel warm, I\u2019m left wanting a little something with more complexity. Something that\u2019s less fruity. A wine that seems hearty but has an element of surprise \u2013 maybe that hit of terroir or something that keeps on giving me something new with each sip. And that\u2019s when I grab a Bandol (BAHN-dol), a Mourv\u00e8dre based red wine from Provence in Southern France.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Amidst the lavender, olives, soaps, and beautifully patterned fabrics oh, and ros\u00e9, there\u2019s this small, high quality region.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>If you know anything about wine in Provence than you probably associate it with ros\u00e9. And rightfully so: 80% of wine produced here is pink. The market demands it and Provence delivers, in spades. But there\u2019s more than just those lovely salmon colored beauties here: 15% of the wine from Provence is red and it isn\u2019t the refreshing, light partner of ros\u00e9. This is big, balls-out stuff mainly from three red wine areas: Cassis, Bellet, and Bandol, with the latter being the only one I\u2019ve been able to find often in a wine shop in the US.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Bandol\u2019s wines are mainly made from the very powerful, luscious Mourv\u00e8dre (moo-VED-rrr) grape. It\u2019s a plummy, herbal, licorice-flavored, woodsy grape that\u2019s rarely bottled alone because it is so powerful. Mourv\u00e8dre is so strong that it can\u2019t be without oak aging to tame its tannins and in the bottle, wines made of it can age for 15 years and may still not be ready!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Growing in tight little bushes that can stand up to the heavy, ferocious gusts of cold wind that come from northern continental Europe (the Mistral) this tough, muscly grape produces a small amount of potent wine. And because of its power, the grape is mainly used in blends to add a kick to wines that otherwise may lack tannins and brawn (Mourv\u00e8dre is a big component in Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, for example, and many C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne).</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>But when it\u2019s the star of the show, it needs to be tempered so in Bandol, where wines contain a minimum of 50% Mourv\u00e8dre, but can be up to 100%, the grape is usually blended with Grenache and Cinsault, which soften up the bold, tannic, and kind of meaty flavors of the lead grape. Syrah can be used to add depth of flavor (black pepper and other types of herbal notes) and Carignan adds fruit and juiciness and softens the toughness of the Mourv\u00e8dre, which in addition to its strong flavor can be tannic and unforgiving. As an aside, if it\u2019s listed, the percentage of Mourv\u00e8dre can be a tip off as to how long to hold it before you drink it \u2013 more Mourv\u00e8dre = more aging.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>History</strong></p> <p>But let\u2019s get off the grapes and onto the region, which I think needs\u00a0a dork out moment of its own, since we HAVE TO give props to one of the oldest winemaking regions in France.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Winemaking started here about 2,600 years ago, most likely when the Phoenicians sailed from modern-day Lebanon and took over the area we now know as Provence. They saw great potential for one of their cash crops here (wine) and likely brought Monastrell from Spain (which is Mourvedre\u2019s name in the Iberian Peninsula), where their Phoenician brethren had already been making wine for several centuries in a similar climate.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>When they arrived in the Gulf of Bandol, we can only guess that they were thrilled. They found the ideal place for vineyards: an area with a natural amphitheater created by mountains on three sides and easy access from the vineyards right out to the Gulf. Cha-ching! They could easily export their wine to far flung places and make cash without much transportation overhead (inland locales like Champagne or Burgundy required a trip down a river or over land\u2014 why waste the time when Bordeaux and Bandol were basically on the ocean?)</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>The Romans agreed with the Phoenician\u2019s assessment of the wine quality and worked on painstakingly building stone terraces into the mountainside (which are called restanques and are still used today) and they further built the reputation of this small enclave.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Things trucked along for Bandol, with Louis XV being a famous fan, until the late 1800s when phylloxera hit and nearly all of the vineyards were destroyed.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>But growers in this region weren\u2019t giving up after that vine murderer came to town. The winegrowing areas were too good for that. They\u2019d been extolled for millennia, not just for their warm coastal climates, elevation, and sun exposure but for the outstanding, diverse soils that yielded flavorful, bold but still nuanced wines. They used the phylloxera epidemic as a chance to reshape the vineyards and when they applied for their appellation in 1941, Bandol included an elite set of 8 communes that lie exclusively on hillsides and have limestone rich, low fertility, well-drained soils, creating the best wines. In addition, they went back to basics and replanted with a lot of Mourvedre \u2013 the grape that had fared best here, probably since the time of the Phoenicians.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Although you\u2019ll find differences in the wines \u2013 depending on the exact terroir, the blend used, and the vintage, one thing is true of Bandol \u2013 I\u2019ve never had a stinker. The wines always seem to be earthy, herbal, spicy, rich, and tannic and have a sense of place. They frequently taste like tobacco, licorice, and black fruit and some can verge on rustic, with a dusty note. Regardless or nuance, the producers have a dedication to quality in this small area and take the responsibility seriously.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Bandol is a little pricey \u2013 you won\u2019t find one for much less than $25 US. But you get what you pay so if you have a few extra bucks, grab a bottle of Bandol and give it a go. Have food with it \u2013 something hearty and rich. You\u2019ll find a new favorite rich red wine that\u2019s unlike anything else you\u2019ve tried.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>And don\u2019t forget to report back on this blog post and let me know what you think: winefornormalpeople.com/blog.</p>", "duration": "07:47", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/0d/a7/e6/0da7e68f-6be6-fff4-db69-d84ef522fd6a/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/0d/a7/e6/0da7e68f-6be6-fff4-db69-d84ef522fd6a/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://traffic.libsyn.com/winefornormalpeople/Audio_blog_12__Bandol_a_red_wine_from_Provence.mp3?dest-id=150053", "type": "episode", "tags": ["education", "wine", "provence", "bandol"]}, {"seriesId": 413879919, "seriesTitle": "Wine for Normal People", "pubDate": 1481044160, "title": "Ep 173: Pfalz -- The German Region for Dry Wine Lovers", "author": "", "summary": "<p><strong>Pfalz is t</strong><strong>he region for you if you have the question: How do I get into German wine If I hate sweet stuff?</strong></p> <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Pfalz is an important region in terms of\u00a0quantity and quality.

It\u2019s fun, but it doesn\u2019t taste that great and as we\u2019ve become more sophisticated in our wine drinking, Beaujolais Nouveau has become less exciting to most people.\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sadly this increasing sophistication has had terrible repercussions in the region of Beaujolais \u2014 forcing some growers out of business and creating tensions among those who depended on this product for their livelihoods. So the question for Beaujolais is: Now that Beaujolais Nouveau is on the rocks, what else is there?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Enter higher quality Beaujolais. This is the stuff wine people go nuts over but that few others know about: the 10 Beaujolais Crus that make distinctive, floral, fresh\u00a0wine from the Gamay grape. Just south of Burgundy and north of Rh\u00f4ne, on a swath of granite, which is Gamay\u2019s preferred soil, are scattered areas that make outstanding\u00a0wine. From north to south these are: Saint-Amour, Juli\u00e9nas, Ch\u00e9nas, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, Fleurie, Chiroubles, Morgon, R\u00e9gni\u00e9, C\u00f4te de Brouilly, and Brouilly.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The wines produced in these Cru run the gamut \u2014 from floral and fruity to rich, earthy, and complex. Here\u2019s a quick grouping of each type:\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"http://winefornormalpeople.com/wfiles/2015/12/beaujormap.jpg\">\u00a0</a></span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Lighter bodied, more floral, less age worthy:</strong> Chiroubles\u00a0</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Medium bodied, fruity with mineral notes:</strong>Brouilly, C\u00f4te de Brouilly, Fleurie, R\u00e9gni\u00e9, Saint-Amour</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Fuller bodied, spicy, earthy:</strong> Ch\u00e9nas, Juli\u00e9nas</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Even fuller and more age-worthy, spicy, and like a cross between Pinot Noir and more floral\u00a0Gamay:</strong> Morgon, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Most of these wines are incredibly well priced for what they are \u2014 around US $20 or less \u2014 and they taste like nothing else you\u2019ve ever tried. I don\u2019t know of other wines that can boast flavors of iris flowers, violets, or lily of the valley and also have raspberry, earth, and spice notes. The combination of freshness and structure \u2014 most Cru have excellent acidity but also a round, soft texture \u2014 make these wines like nothing else you\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So clearly, I love the stuff.

For many reasons. They\u2019re often inexpensive yet high quality. When they\u2019re good, they\u2019re fresh, layered, and delicious. And maybe best of all, they\u2019re originals \u2013 you don\u2019t see every country growing Spanish grapes. These are one of a kind.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>The reds are fabulous and what the country is best known for, but the whites are compelling and outstanding too. Albari\u00f1o from Rias Baixas and the rare white blends of Priorat are particular standouts, but maybe the best white grape of all is Verdejo, a full, creamy, pear and herbal tasting wine with nut and honey notes and enough acid to keep it fresh and lively.\u00a0 This grape -- possibly native to this area, possibly brought by predecessors of the Moors from North Africa --has settled in well and Rueda, located on a 2,300 foot high plain just northeast of Madrid, is where it shines.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>In this dry, boring looking plain of north-central Spain, soils are rocky and well-drained. The vines struggle and if they weren\u2019t so drought resistant they wouldn\u2019t survive. Rueda\u2019s climate is like that of any mid-western area \u2014 continental with hot summers and cold winters. The day to night temperature swings (diurnals) are extreme, and that means that the grapes can gather acidity in the cool nights to offset the ripeness they get from sitting in the hot sun all day.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Given the location, weather is erratic. Storms whipping over the Iberian peninsula smack the area and frost, wind, hail, and any number of other natural maladies can maim or kill the crops unexpectedly. And one of those maladies, the killer of all European grapevines in the late 1800s through the early 1900s, the phylloxera root bug, kicked the area in the teeth and put Verdejo at risk of falling into obscurity, if not extinction.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>After ripping through the area and killing 2/3 of the vines, growers replanted on American grapevine roots (which are resistant to phylloxera, can anchor the plant, and can take a graft from a different grape species with no noticeable flavor difference). But they picked grapes that produced quantity over quality, and Verdejo, a slower grower, got bumped by Sauvignon Blanc and Viura (also used in Cava and white Rioja).\u00a0 Most of the stuff produced from 1922 through the 1970s was Sherry-like wine of variable quality often sold in bulk.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Help came from an unlikely source in the 1970s: Marquis de Riscal, a Rioja producer, who decided to bring Verdejo into the spotlight and make dry whites from the grape. The Bodega\u2019s dedication to reviving the grape transformed it. Part of the problem for Verdejo-based wines was that they did seem to oxidize (turn into that sherry-like concoction) quickly. With investment and research, Riscal and other producers found that night harvest, cooler fermentations, and a good dose of sulfur dioxide helps preserve the aromas and freshness of the wines and makes them shine.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>My opinion: Good call!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Named for the green color of its berries (verde), Verdejo is the 5th most planted white grape in Spain and is popular in its mother country. And it\u2019s clear why: The grape is unlike any other. It\u2019s aromatic with its citrus notes and usually a distinctive earthy, underbrush/shrubby smell. It tastes like bay leaves, almonds, and has a slight bitterness and great mouth-cleansing acidity. Despite its crispness, wines of Verdejo have a full, smooth, silky texture that I love. It\u2019s a complex, food friendly white -- great with everything from sheep\u2019s milk cheese to pasta or fish in lemon or lemon cream sauces. The grape\u2019s acidity makes it refreshing for warm weather but the full nature of the wine makes it a great fall and winter white too.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Through this praise of the grape, I\u2019ve failed to mention one of the coolest things about Verdejo: you can get great stuff for around US $15. That said, not all Rueda or Verdejo is created equal so let me give you some tips for buying before I sign off.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Wines labeled \u201cRueda\u201d are only required to be 50% Verdejo \u2014 the rest is normally Sauvignon Blanc and Viura, a grape usually used for blending in white Rioja and in Cava, as I already mentioned.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Wines labeled \u201cRueda Verdejo\u201d or Rueda Superior are required to be 85% Verdejo, but many are 100% and usually indicate so on the bottle. Rueda Verdejo are the best wines, in my opinion. Look before you buy \u2013 the label will usually indicate if the wine is 100% Verdejo and that\u2019s what you need to seek out.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Have you had Rueda Verdejo?

Why spend $25 when I can spend $2.50? Seriously, it\u2019s just fermented grapes. Isn\u2019t it all the same?\u201d</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">No. And despite the articles and taste\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">tests of experts where the $2 wine wins a blind tasting, there is a difference between crap wine and good stuff. Let\u2019s remember that those tests are in pressured environments, with artificial conditions (peer pressure, no food around so European wines lose every time).</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I\u2019m telling you, even if you don\u2019t know how expensive a wine is, when you taste something that is well made, there\u2019s a big difference between that and plonk.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I\u2019m totally willing to buy that, like everything in wine,\u00a0<em>tasting\u00a0</em>quality is something you figure out as you learn more about wine. You may be at a place now where you can\u2019t taste the difference. It will come with time and more tasting.\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Regardless of what you can or can\u2019t taste, there are some serious, concrete differences between mass produced wine and wine that may be of interest. These are farming, winemaking, and flavor factors that distinguish wines from each other in both quality and price. So even if you can\u2019t taste the difference today, maybe this will at least provide an explanation of the price difference between good wine and cheap wine and give you an appreciation of why some wineries charge more for their wine.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are three main factors:</span></p> <ol> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Since all great wine starts in the vineyard, the best vineyard sites are prized, limited and the grapes from there cost more.</strong></span></li> </ol> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Let\u2019s take wine out of the equation for a second. Let\u2019s bring this to tomatoes.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Ever been to a local farmer\u2019s market? There are usually multiple people selling tomatoes. One week you buy tomatoes from a farmer whose wares look awesome and whose tomatoes are half the price of the vendor next to her. But when you slice the tomatoes open and taste them, they are acidic and too earthy for your liking. They lack sweetness and aren\u2019t so juicy. So when you go back you spring for the more expensive ones. It ticked you off a little to have to pay double for a tomato, but you decide to do it anyway. When you cut open that tomato and taste it, the heavens open and angels sing. This is the best tomato you\u2019ve ever eaten. You would pay 4 times the price of the other tomato for this experience.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What\u2019s going on here? It\u2019s the effect of\u00a0<em>terrior</em>\u00a0and the brilliance of the farmer in picking the right fruit for the right place on her farm. Growing on the right spot, the tomatoes are heavenly. Growing on a less good spot, they suck. Grapes are the same way. So expect higher quality, better fruit to go into expensive wine.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If someone grows grapes on crappy sites where grapes don\u2019t gain maximum flavor and structure, the resulting wine is going to suck. If they grow it in a place with the right sun exposure, soil type, drainage, and slope, you get unbelievable grapes. And you can\u2019t have great wine without great grapes. Period. So some of the expense of better wine is from the cost of growing on coveted, often hard to farm sites that make kick ass grapes.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>2. Winemaking has another huge effect. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and don\u2019t use the right equipment (the right kind of barrels, the right type of maceration, fermentation) the wine isn\u2019t going to be as good.</strong></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Never is this more clear than when you\u2019re touring around a wine region trying the wines. The wines of the area are from similar vineyards and sometimes from the exact same ones, but in the hands of different winemakers they taste completely different. The winemaker\u2019s decisions can make or break a wine.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So even if you\u2019ve done a great job in the vineyard and you have beautiful grapes that have outstanding potential, you\u2019re by no means done \u2014 it can still all go to pot. Trust me, I\u2019ve seen this happen. In the hands of an overzealous, tech-loving winemaker, beautiful grapes can transform into a wine that tastes like a mouthful of vanilla and butter with no hint of the natural goodness that came from the land.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Top wines have balance between acid, tannin, alcohol, and sugar (or lack thereof) and they are either reminiscent of fruit or of the land in which they grew. They aren\u2019t oak bombs. They don\u2019t taste like butter (although they can have the texture of velvet). They aren\u2019t high alcohol without a balance of tannin or acid. A skilled winemaker understands the grapes s/he has to work with and uses techniques to highlight the deliciousness of the grapes, not to transform the wine into something completely different from the grapes they worked so hard to grow.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Are barrels expensive? Good ones are. Is storing wine and allowing it to mature expensive? HELL YES! I\u2019m a business dork, so I always think about inventory holding costs \u2014 not cheap. Do you sometimes have to painstakingly make a bunch of different lots form different areas of the vineyard and then blend them? If you want good wine, you may.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When you pay for good wine, you\u2019re paying for the great judgement of the winemaker.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>3. Ultimately the taste, aroma, and texture of the wine are dead giveaways that you have something special.</strong></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you read the blog or listen to the podcast, you know that I\u2019m quick to call BS on stuff in the wine industry that I think is ridiculous. But I promise you that as you have the opportunity to taste better wine, you will taste the differences between cheap and expensive glasses. The velvety feeling of high quality Pinot Noir, with just the right balance of fruit, acid, and light tannin. The ripe fruit flavors combined with a spicy earth and bright acidity of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. The bacon, black pepper, and black plum notes against the bright acid and noticeable but not too rough tannin of a Northern Rh\u00f4ne Syrah.\u00a0 These experiences stand apart from the less expensive wines that are just fine, but not memorable.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The more you drink the more you realize that there is a taste difference. I\u2019ve watched the faces of friends light up when they taste a truly great wine versus the stuff they usually drink and it\u2019s a different animal \u2014 they get it. I remember my own experiences of tasting fine wines for the first time and knowing that there was a big difference between what\u2019s possible and what I normally drink on a nightly basis.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You have to know what to look for, but when you do, drinking great wine (on special occasions, because what normal person can afford to every night?) is so rewarding and such a wonderful treat.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What do you think? Agree? Disagree that there\u2019s a difference?

I have \"known\" Ian virtually for years and have watched his career changes through interactions over email and social media as he moved into wine. Finally, he gives us the whole, fascinating story and then we get into SERIOUS dorkery -- discussing everything from ros\u00e9 making to the politics of Bordeaux to whether or not ratings matter.
