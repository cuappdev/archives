We had loads of fun with this one.\n\nThe I Ching is a collection of poems which you consult with numbered sticks. You ask a question, shake a random stick from the cup, and the corresponding poem holds your answer.\u00a0In writing The Man in the High Castle, Phillip K. Dick used the I Ching to make plot decisions at crucial points. We decided to turn that, and our format, on its head, so we used the I Ching to ask us questions. \u00a0Understanding exactly what the I Ching was asking was at least as much fun as answering the questions we inferred.\n\nHere are the I Ching's questions.\n\n\tAlthough he reached a great position, Wise Liu did not care for earthly things. He brewed instead the pills of heaven, forging immortality in his earthly crucible.\n\tMarriage is a blessed union indeed, when done in accordance with Yin and Yang. The dragon and the phoenix coil together, uniting in a sweet dream of love.\n\tAll names in Heaven are unique, and even earthly things cannot be the same. Your future is set within the book of fate, which never confuses praise and blame.\n\tEmperor Ming slew his one true love, but a shaman took pity, and eased his heart with dreams of roaming upon the moon, his beloved mistress forever at his side.\n\tTwo scholars went to the capitol for examinations. One passed, and stayed. One\u00a0failed and returned, carrying a letter from his friend. He fell ill, but eventually, thank Heaven, came home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nImportant Cultural Note: The I Ching is far more complex than we've been able to describe in this podcast, and is worthy of a lot more attention than we were able to present to you in this 'cast.\n\nWant more Wes Chu? Wes didn't say a whole lot in this episode, possibly because he was exhausted from the grilling we gave him earlier. This episode was recorded directly it AFTER recording a guest episode with him that will be airing in coming weeks.\n\nAudio Notes: Many of you have complained about the audio quality of the show, especially in the last few months.
