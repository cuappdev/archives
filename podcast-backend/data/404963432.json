quarter\n \tOne of the reasons we got that 3.5% jump in Q3 GDP\n \tWas the big surge in soybean exports, because of a drought overseas\n \tWhich created a temporary increase for U.S. beans\n \tThe rest of it was an inventory build, which I still think needs to be worked off\n \tIn fact, I think we're going to work off a lot of it in the first quarter of this year\n \tThat's the first estimate, and, who knows, they may downward revise it the next time they give us the numbers\n \tIf you now take the first 3 quarters of GDP growth, and use the first estimate for Q4\n \tFor the entire year of 2016 GDP grew at just 1.6%\n \tThat is the lowest number since 2009, tied with 2011, at 1.6% also\n \tIf you remember 2011 GDP growth was so weak that they launched QE3 for 2012\n \tSo they ended QE2, the economy started rolling over\n \tAnd when they got that 1.6% GDP for the entire year\n \tThe Fed very quickly came out and launched QE3 the following year to goose the GDP back up\n \t\u00a0What are they doing now?\u00a0 Not only is the Fed not preparing to launch another round of QE\n \tThey are tightening monetary policy\n \tThey're saying, \"We're going to raise interest rates 3 times,

Chairman William Dudley in an interview on Fox Business basically said that a September rate hike was still possible\n \tLook, a September alien invasion is still possible, but I'm not going to waste my time preparing for it\n \tWhat's amazing to me is how all of the villagers still come running every time a Fed official cries \"Wolf!\"\n \tHaven't they noticed that they've cried, \"Wolf!\" over and over again and there's never a wolf?\n \tI think that Dudley purposely came out and mentioned a September rate increase just to keep the markets in check; to preserve the false narrative that there is actually a recovery, instead of a bubble\n \tAll of a sudden, gold sold off, it went from +$18 to +$2 or $3\n \tSilver went negative; it lost its entire rally in a matter of minutes\n \tI think Dudley was trying to undo the damage done overnight by Dudley's counterpart at the San Francisco Fed, John Williams' well-thought out paper\n \tWilliams wrote in his piece that he believes we're in a \"new era\".\u00a0 He doesn't understand that the new era that we're in is collateral damage from central bank monetary policy\n \tThey think this is a random occurrence that needs a new government prescription\n \tJohn Williams is proposing, based on this \"new normal\" the neutral interest rate is so low, it's almost impossible for the central banks to get there, absent negative interest rates\n \tWhat Williams is proposing, is more inflation\n \tWhat he is arguing is that we should scrap this 2% inflation target and that we need a higher number\n \t\u00a0I've been saying for years that this is going to happen\n \tIt's just like the unemployment rate, where they said, \"We'll raise interest rates if it gets below 6.5% and then we let it go below 5%\n \tWe kept moving that goal post\n \tI said the same thing was going to happen to inflation\n \tIn fact it is happening.\u00a0 If you look at the CPI numbers that just came out today, we continue to be above the 2% level on the core; we've been there for many months in a row\n \tNow they're already starting to say, \"Hey wait a minute, 2% isn't high enough\n \tWe need more inflation because we need lower rates, and the only way to get there is to have higher inflation\n \tThis is what I have been expecting\n \tIf you read William's piece, he says one of the ways we should get there is for the Fed to target nominal GDP\n \tIn other words, not GDP after you adjust for inflation\n \tI've argued that the deflator is under the actual inflation number, therefore overestimating GDP growth\n \tThe Fed is saying, \"Who cares about the GDP deflator?\n \tAll we care about is the nominal number\n \tWe don't care if the growth is real or inflationary, we just want nominal GDP numbers to go up\"\n \tWhat good is that?\n \tNo one benefits from phony GDP growth that is simply a by-product of inflation\n \tThe whole point is that we want the economy to actually, grow, not for just prices to go up\n \tBut what the Williams is saying is no, all we care about is prices going up\n \tIt's all about style over substance\n \tThat's why we're stuck in this malaise\n \tAdditionally, what Williams was also arguing for was more fiscal stimulus\n \tHe was saying that we're at the end of our rope with interest rates at practically at zero\n \tWe need the government to provide more stimulus in the form of deficit spending\n \tWe've already got about a $20 trillion national debt\n \tIf deficit spending were stimulative, why haven't we gotten a huge stimulus from that $20 trillion of debt?\n \tThat $20 trillion is an anchor weighing down the economy and Williams is calling for another anchor\n \tThe more the Fed stimulates the economy, the more the economy is sedated\n \tEventually the economy is a corpse

the official numbers for Q2 Non-Farm Productivity and the consensus was that it would increase for the first time in 3 quarters; the prior 2 quarters we saw a decline in productivity\n \tSo analysts were looking for a .5 increase in the second quarter\n \tInstead, we got a decline of .5\n \tMore importantly, this is the first 3-quarter consecutive decline in productivity since 1979\n \tThat was the Carter years - stagflation, the misery index, sky-high inflation, sky-high interest rates\n \tThat was the last time we had a 3-quarter drop in productivity and President Obama is bragging about how great the recovery is and Hillary Clinton promises more of this\n \tIf you look at the actual size of the decline over those 3 quarters, it's the biggest drop in productivity since 1993\n \tIf you look at the year-over-year decline, this is the biggest decline in productivity in 3 years\n \tProductivity is extremely important\n \tPoliticians are all talking about higher wages - \"We need higher wages!\"\n \tYou can't get higher wages without higher productivity.\n \tThat is where higher wages come from\n \tNow, a lot of politicians want to substitute government decrees - they want to mandate higher wages\n \tLike minimum wage - we're going to force employers to pay this minimum wage\n \tAll that does, is raise the bar; it makes it harder for unskilled workers to get a job in the first place\n \tNow employers are forced to pay a wage that may be well above the productivity that they can deliver\n \tIn that case, they can't get the job\n \tMimimum Wage doesn't just raise wages, it raises the bar\n \tAnother popular way that politicians try to mandate higher compensation is by mandating benefits such as health care, sick leave, paid vacation days, or overtime\n \tThe idea is that you're getting something for nothing - I voted for this guy and he delivered\n \tThat's not how it works\n \tWhen an employer hires somebody, they look at the overall cost of employing that person, relative to the productivity required for the job\n \tIf I am mandated to provide certain benefits, the costs associated with them are also mandated\n \tIf you force the employer to provide benefits at a certain cost, how is he going to pay for it?\n \tWhat happens is, the compensation becomes a mix of wages and benefits\n \tMaybe the worker doesn't perfer that, maybe the worker just wants the higher wage\n \tThe worker can't have it because the government took that decision away by mandating that a portion of the pay include benefits, whether the worker wants them or not\n \tThe politicians hope the voters fall for the idea that they got something for nothing\n \tThat's government for you.\u00a0 They always want you to think you're getting something for nothing\n \tBut the something for nothing costs a lot more than you think because the nothing is not nothing\n \tIn this case, wages go down so the benefits can go up\n \tEverybody would be better off if the government stayed out and let each worker negotiate independently with the employer for a compensation package that is most valuable to that worker\n \tBut productivity is really the holy grail of higher wages\n \tIf we really want higher wages we need to raise productivity and that's not happening\n \tIf productivity is going down, wages are going down\n \tIf you want wages to go up, you have to have higher productivity\n \tHow do you get that?\u00a0 Less government, lower taxes, higher interest rates so we get more savings and more investment and less of all this speculation and paper-shuffling that we have in this bubble economy\n \tI want to talk also on this podcast about Donald Trump's economic speech yesterday\n \tI just want to focus on one aspect of it that has been getting a lot of press:

Fest and following that I went to Vancouver for a one-day gold conference\n\tOne of the things I wanted to discuss was some discussion about me on the www.kitco.com website and I think it was prompted by my itnterview with kitco, which you can see on my YouTube Channel\n\tWhenever there is a discussion about me an argument develops between those who want to believe I never get anything right and those with believe I get a lot of things right\n\tI thought one part of the discussion was quite amusing\n\tOf course, I never claim to be infallible; when you make a lot of projections they don't all turn out to be right\n\tNobody is 100% right on anything that they say\n\tThe key is, are you right more often than you are wrong\n\tAnd when you're wrong, do you change your mind, when the facts change, which is something that I do\n\tBut people will always go back and focus on a quote from years ago and say, \"Look here's a quote from Peter Schiff saying interest rates would go up, and Look! now they're down\"\n\tI did not expect the bond bubble to get this big\n\tWho thought we'd have half of the sovereign debt trading for negative yields?\n\tVery few people envisioned that, but it happened\n\tFor the last several years I have said nothing about higher interest rates\n\tI do believe that when the bond bubble bursts rates will spike up\n\tBut I don't know when that is going to happen\n\tIf you've made enough forecasts, one can always find things that have not panned out\n\tBut these people overlook the overwhelming number of forecasts I've gotten right\n\tOne of the forecasts people used to make fun of me about was a forecast I made on a show called, \"Southland Today\"\n\tI put that up on the internet years ago, it's a 2002 interview and if you watch that clip, you'll recognize that a lot of the things I said in that interview were used to form the introduction to the old, \"Wall Street Unspun\" the precursor to the Peter Schiff Show\n\tThe intro for that show included many quotes that were lifted from the \"Southland Today\" interview\n\tDuring that interview, I said I thought the Dow would go down to 4000\n\tOf course a lot happened between 2002 and now\n\tWhat did happen is that after I did that interview the market fell precipitously; the Dow did drop another 25-30%\n\tThe NASDAQ maybe even more\n\tWhat happened between that interview and the market falling is that Alan Greenspan slashed interest rates down to 1%, and at the time of the interview I did not know he was going to do that\n\tI thought Alan Greenspan would be smarter than that\n\tIf Alan Greenspan had not slashed interest rates, my forecast would have been correct\n\tOnce Greenspan lowered interest rates, of course, I changed my forecast and became bullish on the market when it was still quite a bit lower\n\t6yyj6e69", "duration": "37:50", "imageUrlLg":

Non-Farm Payroll report for the month of June\n\tRemember the last 2 reports were quite weak and everybody was hoping for a rebound in June to prove that April and May were a fluke and not a new trend\n\tIn fact the Fed talked about that in their last FOMC meeting minutes\n\tThe consensus was for 180,000 jobs to be created and the range went from a low of 130,000 to as high as 235,000\n\tThe consensus average of that range was 180,000\n\tThe actual number came in at 287,000, over 100,000 jobs above the consensus\n\tNow we did revise down the really bad number from May, and made it even worse\n\tInitially that number was 38,000 jobs and now we know it was just 11,000 jobs\n\tSo about 70% of the jobs disappeared\n\tI have a good feeling that the reason June's number is so high is that it's just wrong, and we'll see what kind of revision we get to it next month\n\tRemember, a good chunk of these numbers are jobs that the government assumes were created without evidence, based on the birth-death model\n\tI would suggest that far fewer businesses are actually being formed than the government believes\n\tIn fact, its possible that more business are shutting down than are hiring\n\tGiven the economy and the minimum wage, those business that are starting up are hiring fewer people than start-up historically hire\n\tI think these guesstimates are wildly optimistic and skewing all the numbers\n\tUnemployment rate, which was 4.7 last month and expected to notch up to 4.8, instead notched up higher to 4.9\n\tPrivate payrolls which were expected to rise by $170,000 jumped by $265,000\n\tBut last month they revised a $25,000 gain to a $6,000 loss\n\tWhy did unemployment move up? Because the labor force participation rate notched up from 62.6 to 62.7\n\tObviously not all the people who re-joined the labor force could find jobs\n\tAverage hourly earnings were expected to rise by .2%\n\tAgain they disappointed; they rose by just .1%\n\tOverall, a mixed picture, but the headline number, the 287,000 vs 180,000 consensus\n\tThat's normally the number the market trades off\n\tAnd that is exactly what happened - as soon as the report came out we had a big jump in the dollar index and we had a big selloff in Gold\n\tGold started out largely unchanged, went down about $22 on the news\n\tSilver sold off, it was down about 40-50 cents\n\tThat was the knee-jerk reaction: strong dollar, weak gold, weak silver\n\tWhy?\n\tA strong jobs number means the Fed is more likely to raise rates, right?\n\tRate hike is coming, good for the dollar, bad for gold\n\tBut what did I say on Wednesday's podcast?\n\tI said that it didn't matter what the jobs number was\n\tThat gold was not going to go down, and if it was a weak number, I expected a big rally in gold\n\tBut I also said that a strong number would not hurt gold\n\tEarlier in the year, a strong number would crush gold\n\tI said that what's going on, and based on the latest FOMC minutes, I don't care what the jobs number is\n\tThe Fed is not going to raise rates\n\tJobs have nothing to do with it, Jobs are the excuse\n\tThe Fed can't raise rates now because of the fragility in the banking system, all the things that were revealed by Brexit\n\tThe market is sensing that and that's why within the first hour gold reversed all of its losses and finished the day up about $5.60 at $1365.40\n\tThe highest close of the year on a day when we had a huge beat in the Non-Farm Payrolls\n\tSilver had an even more impressive reversal; it rallied over $1\n\tStocks really broke out; the GDX was up over 30% today to close at $30.54\n\tNot quite the highest close of the year\n\tMany silver and gold stocks hit 52-week highs today, some hit 2 or 3-year highs\n\tThe overall stock market was also up just under 80 points; the Dow was up 250\n\tWe have now recovered all of the post-Brexit losses\n\tThe Dow now back up around 18,000\n\tThe foreign markets have done so much better, particularly the markets I'm involved in", "duration": "24:41", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://media.blubrry.com/schiffradio/content.blubrry.com/schiffradio/Ep_180_Market_Reaction_To_Jobs_Report_Confirms_My_Hypothesis.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 404963432, "seriesTitle": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "pubDate": 1467852336, "title": "Fed Minutes Reveal The Easing Cycle Has Already Begun \u2013 Ep. 179", "author": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "summary": "Gold and silver prices continue to march higher\n\tGold was up another $7 today; it closed at $1363.20 - that is the high for the year\n\tSilver was up .15 at $20.06\n\tSilver is now going up relative to the price of gold which is very for the precious metals complex\n\tGold stocks are on fire; the XAU index, a gold stock index was up 3.27% today\n\tIt's now up better than 135% on the year and well over 150% from the lows on the third week in January\n\tBut do you think that any major players on Wall Street have recommended gold stocks?\n\tDo any of the big hedge funds have positions in gold?\n\tNo!

the problem is that these tools have never worked\n\tThey can't cut rates, much, they can print all the money they want, they can do QE4, it can be bigger than QE3, and\u00a0 it probably will be\n\tEven though Janet Yellen, in response to a direct question about negative interest rates, said that she didn't think the Fed would go there, well we'll see\n\tWhen push comes to shove they may be more willing to go there than they are right now because they still want to pretend that the recovery is on track, so why even bring up negative rates when you're talking about raising rates\n\tSo I think once the conversation turns then negative rates may be a more serious consideration\n\tOne of the congressmen asked about Puerto Rico and Janet Yellen said, \"No, there's nothing we can do, Puerto Rico is on it's own.\"\n\tI wish the Fed would have had the same attitude about the mortgage market\n\tThe Federal Reserve has no problem buying up toxic mortgages but they wouldn't touch Puerto Rican sovereign debt with ta 10-foot pole\n\tWhich leads you to believe how risky that debt much be\n\tI wish the Fed would do the same thing to the U.S. government - force the U.S. government to make those tough choices\n\tIn fact, there was a House member, today, who talked to Janet Yellen about the independent central banks and Janet Yellen bluffed, that if interest rates, and that was a problem for Congress, that Congress would have to deal with the problem\n\tI don't believe her for a second\n\tI believe on of the reasons, specifically that Janet Yellen doesn't want to raise rates is that she knows that will complicate the budget situation in Washington because the Federal Government can't afford to pay higher interest rates\n\tIf the Federal Reserve already bailed out the government by doing QE and buying all these bonds, why are they going to change course?\n\tI don't believe for a second Janet Yellen's tough talk about how independent the Federal Reserve is and how if the situation warranted it, they would raise interest rates and Congress would have to deal with the consequences\n\tThere's no way the Fed is going to do that; she may have fooled some of the people on that sub-committee, but she didn't fool me\n\tOf course, she always gets these questions about jobs, and how are you going to create jobs,", "duration": "22:37", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://media.blubrry.com/schiffradio/content.blubrry.com/schiffradio/Ep_175_Janet_Yellen_Doesn_t_Know_Murphy_s_Law.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 404963432, "seriesTitle": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "pubDate": 1466205058, "title": "Alien Invasion More Likely Than July Rate Hike \u2013 Ep.174", "author": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "summary": "Gold closed the week at the highest weekly close since January of 2015\n\tNot quite above the $1300 benchmark - I think we closed about $1298 - up about $20 on the day\n\tIntra-day yesterday, gold was well above $1300\n\tUntil there was news that a British Member of Parliament was shot and that somehow revised hope for the \"stay\" vote in the Brexit referendum\n\tAs if the price of gold is going up based on the outcome of that vote\n\tAs far as I'm concerned next week's vote is a non-event for the gold market\n\tThe conventional wisdom seems to believe that if Britain leaves, all hell is going to break loose in Europe\n\tI guess all this chaos is supposed to be bullish for gold\n\tIf Britain votes to stay, the euro will go up and that might be bullish for gold, because a weak dollar is generally bullish for gold\n\tI think gold will go up regardless of the British vote\n\tThe price of gold is not going up because of what's happening in Europe\n\tIt's going up because of what's happening in the United States\n\t\u00a0More specifically at the Federal Reserve\n\tThe Federal Reserve concluded its June meeting on Wednesday and Janet Yellen - surprise! did not raise interest rates\n\tIf you remember, a few months ago, some minutes leaked to the public caused the public to think the Fed would raise rates in June for sure - maybe July, but probably June\n\tAnd gold tanked and the dollar rallied and I said, \"I don't think so.\"\n\tThere's nothing in these minutes that say the Fed is going to do anything\n\tIt's the same old Open Mouth Operation\n\tIf you read between the lines, they didn't commit to anything\n\tBut she cried wolf and everybody came running, and\n\tNot only did the Fed not raise in June but they backtracked on their intentions to raise rates in the future\n\tThey toned down their so-called dot plots for this year and next year\n\tNow, instead of announcing the first rate hike of the year, they actually pushed back expectations\n\tThere were a lot of articles about the Fed losing credibility, the Fed surrendering\n\tThis is what I have been forecasting\n\tNone of this is a surprise to faithful listeners to this podcast\n\tThose who have been listening to the talking heads on the major media outlets expect the Fed to raise rates because they actually believe that the Fed's policies have worked and that we have a recovery\n\tThey have not figured out that this is a bubble\n\tThey never figure it out until after the bubble has burst\n\tIf you go back and read the transcript of Janet Yellen's press conference, she's still talking about\u00a0 a July rate hike\n\tIf she had been honest, she would have said,\"Why would we raise rates in July?

for the first time this year\n\tI don't know if anybody expects the Fed to raise rates on Wednesday - it's a 2 day meeting, it gets started tomorrow and we get the announcement on Wednesday afternoon\n\tBrexit was one of the things they were concerned about\n\tNow the polls are showing that a British exit of the EU is becoming more and more likely and that was one of the things supposedly the Fed was concerned about\n\tI think all that is an excuse - they're really concerned about the U.S. bubble economy and domestic problems\n\tBut they don't want to acknowledge that so they want to rationalize their decisions with problems abroad\n\tThat vote is looking like it may go the wrong way as far as the powers that be are concerned\n\tI've already mentioned on this podcast that if I were in Britain, I would vote to go\n\tIt's not because I'm anti free trade, I'm for free trade - it's just that the EU is no longer about free trade\n\tThat was its initial pretext and it might have been a good idea, but no idea that involves more government can ever be good\n\tThe problem with government is that it grows and grows and grows\n\tLike the camel getting its nose under the tent\n\tThat's what happening in the EU and the British are finally saying we've had enough\n\tIt's too bad the British don't have enough with their own big government, but they don't want big government imposed from Brussels\n\tWhatever benefits member nations got in the beginning from freer trade, they've lost from regulations, taxation and micro-management coming out of the EU\n\tAs I said before, the only reason there was a need for the EU is because governments impose too many tariffs and regulation and theoretically the solution was to let some other entity circumvent all the other government regulation\n\tAnd they made the deal with the devil and it didn't work out\n\tBut the same thing is true in the United States\n\tThe original American colonies all made a deal - we came together, abandoned the Articles of Confederation we went for a less weak central government and we passed the Constitution of the United States\n\tBut the problem is, the Federal government is not abiding by its constitutional restraints on its powers\n\tThe Federal government is not acting the way the framers envisioned, it has usurped powers that were not granted to it in the Constitution, so the Federal government is no longer a benefit to the United States, just like the EU is not longer a benefit to Europe\n\tThe difference is, the EU disintegrated a lot quicker\n\tThe U.S. government lasted for a much longer period of time, and was a positive factor for the colonies\n\tBut the EU quickly degenerated\n\tEvery time you can remove a layer of government, you restore more freedom and prosperity\n\tSo I wish the British luck with their revolution\n\tSo this is just one more cloud on the horizon providing a reason for the Fed not to raise rates this week\n\tA more important reason is the stock market\n\tOnce again on the decline, the NASDAQ is down a little over 2% over the last 2 days\n\tThe Dow Jones is down about 1.5% -

maybe June\n\tMaybe June, September and December\n\tThere are still people, like Goldman Sachs, who are looking for 3 rate hikes this year\n\tI was on a panel months ago with Jim Rickards, whom I have a lot of respect for, and back then he argued with me, because he believed the Fed would raise rates 2 if not 3 times in 2016\n\tI said the Fed would not raise rates at all\n\tToday I posted an interview that he gave on Bloomberg - now Jim Rickards says Janet Yellen has gone super-dove and she is not going to raise rates\n\tThe reason Jim Rickards disagreed with me on the panel a couple of months ago is that, although he agrees with my thoughts on the economy, is that he thought the Fed would not recognize that the economy is very weak, rather that it believes the economy is still recovering\n\tHe thought the Fed would raise rates anyway, which would cause a recession, cause the Fed to abort the increases, go back to zero and to QE4\n\tI said, I think we are going to skip all the rate hikes and go directly to rate cuts and QE4\n\tAnd now I think Jim has joined me in that perspective\n\tThe question is: Will the Federal Reserve actually admit that the economy is that weak, or just not raise rates, which is tantamount to an admission of weakness\n\tWe are going to get the first official look at Q1 GDP on Thursday\n\tThere's a good chance that we will print a negative number\n\tAnd even if we don't print a negative number, it will be a single digit number less than 1\n\tAnd by the time they revise it the following month to incorporate all the bad news that comes after Thursday, I think they will revise it negative\n\tWhich means we're in a recession\n\tIf Q1 is negative, and I don't believe we will get a bounce-back in Q2\n\tI think Q1 is the high water mark and it's down hill from here\n\tI think Q2 will be weaker regardless of how weak Q1 is, because we borrowed growth from Q2 because we had the warmest winter in 120 years\n\tCompanies are now winding down their bloated inventories that they built up the last couple of years\n\tAnd because the trade deficits are getting bigger and not smaller\n\tSo we have a lot weighing down GDP in Q2 in an already weak economy\n\tBy the way, the Atlanta Fed revised up their Q1 GDP number from .3 to .4\n\tWhy did they do that?\u00a0 This is the second time the Atlanta Fed has upwardly revised their estimate, despite the fact that the economic data has gotten worse since their last estimate\n\tIf the data gets worse, why would you revise your forecast up?\n\tTo me something's going on, maybe it's the boys at the New York Fed putting pressure on Atlanta to be more optimistic, but we'll see, because we will get the first official numbers on Thursday\n\tLet me go over some of the economic data that has come out just since my last podcast\n\tOn Friday last week, we got the PMI Flash Index for April -

silver was up about .04, but you wouldn't know that earlier in the morning gold was up better than $25, we did trade back above $1270\n\tSilver made a new high for the year - silver was up about 75\u00a2 early in the morning, in fact I think it made its peak during the Draghi press conference\n\tWe were above $1760 and then, just around 9am or so, there was a huge seller in the gold and the silver market and the whole complex went negative and we managed to close slightly positive on the day, but we had a huge sell-off intra-day following a big rally\n\tThat doesn't mean the top is in - I think it's interesting; we just got a huge correction out of the way and the price went up - we flushed out a big seller and now that seller is out of the market and this market is still going a lot higher\n\tI put an article on my Facebook page about how gold stocks are way up this year, and they are way up this year, but the article basically said, \"Don't buy\", because gold is going to sell off.\n\tI'm seeing a log of mainstream articles now about why you should not jump on this bandwagon, how dangerous the gold market is\n\tAnd all this is just music to my ears.\u00a0 If you are bullish on gold, this is exactly what you want.\u00a0 You want everybody to be skeptical.\n\tYou want this wall of worry, that gold and silver are going to climb, and we're going to climb with it while everybody else is worried about the crash, because they still don't get it.\n\tThey're still talking about how the Fed is going to raise rates, and how that's bad for gold\n\tIt's not bad for gold - it all depends on how the Fed raises rates\n\tIf the Fed raises rates Paul Volker style, really jacks them up there, yeah, that will be bad for gold\n\tBut they're not going to do that.\u00a0 If they raise rates, slowly, which is the only way they can do that if they even raise them, they will be slower than Greenspan was\n\tWhen Greenspan raised rates, that was great for gold, because he was very slow\n\tWell, Yellen is going to be even slower\n\tSo if gold did well under Greenspan, it will do even better under Yellen hikes, if we even get hikes\n\tIf we even get hikes.\u00a0 We could get cuts, QE4, negative rates\n\tIf the Fed raises rates a little bit, that's bullish for gold; if they don't raise rates at all, even more bullish for gold, or they cut rates, and gold goes ballistic\n\tEither way, gold stocks are going up\n\tMeanwhile Wall Street is looking at amazement at the rally and it wouldn't dawn on them to participate\n\tThe mainstream investment world is not on board.\u00a0 The train has left - there's nobody on it\n\tEventually they're going to buy, just like they piled in to the gold trade when it was 17-18-1900, that's when the big firms started finally noticing it\n\tEventually they are going to realize... I think it is going to take Yellen admitting the economy is weak, of the Fed actually cutting rates, but by then the prices are going to be much higher than they are now and we keep getting bad economic news\n\tBut I want to talk first about the Draghi press conference\n\tMario Draghi of the ECB, leaving interest rates unchanged, and continuing their QE program\n\tThe euro initially rallied, even during the Q&amp;A, but then at the end, the euro turned around with the gold market, and the euro ended up unchanged\n\tDraghi made some interesting comments.

gold stocks all year\n\tThe catalyst was the Atlanta Fed Q1 GDP estimate downgrade all the way down to .1\n\tIf you remember, from listening to my podcasts, the very first time the Atlanta Fed came out with its upward revision, with a lot of fanfare, to 2.7%, I said that that was all political and that they would have to walk that back all quarter long, and now they have eliminated the entire estimated gain\n\tA fair estimate might have been -.1, but President Obama is still saying we have the strongest advanced economy in the world\n\tI don't know what his definition of \"strong\" or \"advanced\" is, but we might have one of the weakest of the advanced economies\n\tIt's just that nobody wants to accept that fact yet\n\tHere's where it really gets interesting: CNBC was very dismissive of the weak economic numbers\n\tThey are characterizing the weak Q1 as similar to previous years' weak Q1, where the weather pushed back some economic activity to Q2, causing rebounds\n\tThey said the same thing is going to happen this year.\u00a0 No it's not.\n\tThis year is different from last year\n\tFirst, let's talk about inventories: February and January Wholesale Trade Inventories have been revised down from +.3 to -.2\n\tLast year, companies were still building up inventories, believing in the recovery narrative, boosting GDP\n\tThe inventory unwind that I have been talking about for the last year is just beginning\n\tIt started in Q1 of this year, and this inventory sell-down is going to subtract from GDP\n\tHere's another factor: the weather\n\tThe weather for the last two first quarters was very cold, pushing economic activity to Q2, helping Q2 to rebound\n\tThat's not what happened this year.\u00a0 The first quarter of this year was the warmest in over 120 years\n\tSo obviously there was no economic activity pushed forward due to weather, if anything, the weather might have pulled some activity from Q2 to Q1\n\tAs weak as Q1 was, it might have been weaker if cold weather had suspended some economic activity\n\tThe third difference is the trade deficit, which is rapidly growing this year\n\tI think the growing trade deficit will continue to put a drag on Q2 GDP\n\tThe inventory liquidation will continue to be a drag on Q2 GDP\n\tWhat that means is had the government properly seasonally adjusted Q1 for the unusually warm weather, I think Q1 GDP would be a lot lower\n\tQ1 will be a contraction, and we are going to fall from there\n\tIf that is true, then we are in a recession\n\tI think this recession will be longer in duration that the preceding one\n\tThe question is: What is the government going to do about it?\n\tThere was a meeting today between President Obama, Joe Biden and Janet Yellen\n\tThey have to figure out how to throw the economy a lifeline without admitting that it is drowning\n\tThe first thing the Fed can do is signal that they are not going to raise rates - change their forward guidance\n\tBy just not raising the rates, the specter of a hike remains\n\tThe question is what story will they use in order to not damage Obama's recovery narrative and Hillary Clinton's campaign?\n\tMaybe they will blame it on the global economy, even though the U.S. is much weaker than many other economies\n\tThe Fed can't cut much - one cut and they're done, unless they want to venture into negative territory, which would be a disaster\n\tThey could re-launch QE, which I think there is a very good chance they're going to do", "duration": "24:23", "imageUrlLg":

Janet Yellen gave a speech to the Economic Club of New York, one of the most dovish speeches, if not the most dovish she has ever given\n\tAs a result of the speech, the price of gold was up about $20 on the day; we closed above $1240\n\tIn fact a couple of days ago, we had gotten nearly down to $1200\n\tThat shows you the strength of this bull market in gold, despite the talk of a rate hike in April, and despite the rally in the dollar, gold held its position above $1200\n\tTo me, that's very bullish, the question when will all the bears throw in the towel?\n\tGoldman Sachs is still looking for gold to hit $1000 - $900\n\tThey're still looking for a strong dollar and a bunch of rate hikes\n\tAlthough Goldman Sachs is not as bearish on gold as Harry Dent\n\tHarry Dent called for $700 gold when I debated him on Friday's Alex Jones show\n\tThat was a good debate, and you can check it out on my YouTube channel\n\tThe dollar was down across the board today\n\tThe dollar index barely held on to the 95 handle, it closed at 95.15, off not quite a full percentage point on the day\n\tAussie dollar very strong on the day, up 1.4%\n\tNew Zealand dollar was the big winner on the day; that currency was up a full 2 percentage points on the day against the U.S. dollar\n\tThe Dow Jones liked the dovish news coming from the Fed; up just under 100 points\n\tOne of the reasons it wasn't up more is because of the financials in the Dow weighing it down\n\tThe NASDAQ was up 79.8 - that's a 1.7% increase\n\tThe NASDAQ was standing still compared to the gold stocks - the GDX up 5.77%\n\tThe GDXJ, the juniors, were up even more - about 6.3% today\n\tThat's where the action was and I think it will continue to be, based on Janet Yellen's Dovish remarks\n\tI still don't think the conventional wisdom appreciates the extent of these dovish remarks\n\tLet me go over her remarks; she started with a pretty upbeat assessment on the economy\n\tShe said the labor market is looking good, consumer spending is looking good, the housing recovery continues - she went over all these positives\n\tShe did list some minor negatives: Manufacturing and Net Exports, but she blamed all that on the strong dollar\n\tShe did also mention that capital spending and business investment was lackluster, noting in particular weakness in layoffs in the energy sector\n\tBut overall she was still upbeat on the economy\n\tIn fact, she admitted that the Fed's assessment of economic growth, inflation, and unemployment were exactly the same on December 2015, when they raised rates, and in the March meeting, where they didn't raise rates\n\tShe said the Fed's outlook on the economy had not changed at all\n\tIf it hasn't changed at all, why didn't they raise rates again?\n\tThey were telegraphing 4 rate hikes, and if all their assumptions about the economy had stayed the same, they why didn't we get the rate hike\n\tShe actually mentioned that in the Q&amp;A\n\tThere weren't a lot of questions; there were two people allowed to ask questions -

also went down\n\tSo what was the catalyst?\n\tYou might say maybe it was because gold failed to rally on the news of the terrorist attack in Belgium\n\tNews of this kind often triggers a knee-jerk reaction to buy gold, but the rally really wasn't that big, and when a market doesn't rally on good news, it generally means it is over bought, or\u00a0 it's ready to go down\n\tTo me, however, that was a non-event, as far as gold is concerned\n\tI don't buy gold because of geopolitical instability - that has nothing to do with my strategy\n\tThe real reason to buy gold has to do with inflation, and the central banks creating it, artificially low interest rates, negative interest rates and Quantitative Easing\n\tIt has nothing to do with terrorism, except to the extent that terrorist attacks lead to more government spending that is not supported by taxes which means more money printing, more inflation and bigger deficits\n\tIn the long run, it is good for gold, but in the short run, it is just a bunch of noise, but traders can certainly jump on these events as a reason to buy or sell and read things into a lack of movement, assuming there is a fundamental reason in the gold market, when there's not\n\tThe more significant factors that hurt gold were comments by several Federal Reserve officials, to the extent that April is now considered a \"live\" meeting, meaning that they still might raise interest rates\n\tThese comments are coming less than 2 weeks after the official March meeting, where the Fed could have raised interest rates, but didn't\n\tNot only did they not raise interest rates, they went out of their way to diminish the markets' expectations of future rate hikes\n\tSo that after the March meeting, people who thought the Fed was going to raise rates 3 more times, revised expectations to at most 2, but a lot of people are starting to expect no interest rate hikes at all\n\tIt was a very dovish press conference following the release of their statement\n\tSo now, a week later some of the same guys on the FOMC saying, \"We might raise rates in April\"\n\tIf you're thinking about raising rates in April, why were you so dovish last week?\n\tAnd if you are going to raise them in April, why not raise them in March\n\tNone of this makes any sense, especially looking at the economic released since the Fed decided not to raise rates in March, and in general, it's been weaker expected\n\tSo if the Fed is being given weaker than expected economic news, after they said they wouldn't raise rates, why would they now be raising the spectre of a rate hike coming up next month\n\tIs this some kind of trial balloon?\n\tI think the Fed is losing even more credibility when they're so schizophrenic: they'll raise rates -

They said, based on our economic forecasts, this is what we think is going to happen - BUT if we're wrong, it's not going to happen\n\tJanet Yellen said to Steve Liesman, \"Look, these dots don't mean anything - this is what we're thinking at a moment in time, but it's not a promise.\"\n\tFor some reason, everybody assumes that if the Fed thinks the economy is going to get better it will get better, in fact, if anything, since the Fed's track record is so horrific, if the Fed thinks the economy is going to get better, it's probably going to get worse, and so they are not going to raise interest rates the way they're pretending\n\tOne of the reasons the Fed is pretending that the economy is good is because that's the official line of the Obama Administration: \"The economy is good, and if you say it's not good, you're peddling fiction.\"\n\tYellen probably wanted to say to Liesman,\"Steve, we're not raising rates because the economy is lousy.\"\n\tThe fact that they don't raise rates is the proof that they know that the economy is lousy, but they don't want to say it, so Janet Yellen is saying \"Read between the lines\"\n\tWhen I'm listening to all the coverage about the fact that the Fed didn't raise rates, the reports say,\"Janet Yellen chickens out\", \"Janet Yellen gets cold feet\"\n\tThat's not the point.\u00a0 Her feet were always cold.

people had anticipated that that would be the case\n\tIn fact, it seems like he fired a bigger blast than people were expecting, he announced that he would reduce negative interest rates further\n\tThey moved from -.3 to -.4 and he announced an expansion of their quantitative easing program from \u20ac60 billion per month to \u20ac80 billion, which means that their program is not larger than the Fed's; remember we were doing $85 billion a month before we tapered it down\n\tSo what the ECB is doing is closer to $90 billion\n\tThe problem for the market is that even though he fired a bigger blast than the markets had anticipated, after he fired it, he put that bazooka back in his holster\n\tWhat I mean by that, is at the end of his press conference, Draghi mention that he thought that this would probably be the last cut, that -40 is as low as the ECB is going to go\n\tNow maybe the market was just looking for an excuse to reverse, but the Euro, which had initially dropped sharply, about 1.5% down on the day, following the initial announcement, reversed and ended up falling about 2%, so it was a 3.5% reversal, and from what I've read, this is the biggest reversal, ever in the euro, from down to up\n\tIn fact the dollar index went through 4 handles, at its highs this morning, the dollar index was at 98.5 and at its lows it was trading at around 95\n\tMany people think this is a failure for the ECB; they want a weaker euro, because they want more inflation\n\tI think the ECB is going to get more inflation, whether the euro weakens or strengthens against the dollar, because it's still going to weaken in real purchasing power\n\tJust as I mentioned in yesterday's podcast, referring to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Mario Draghi is saying that he doesn't have enough inflation, and interestingly enough, Draghi is going to get more inflation, and more than he's bargaining for\n\tHe mentioned in his press conference that these things take time, because it will take time for inflation for develop because first we need the recovery to regain traction, as if inflation is a by-product of economic growth - it's not.\n\tIt's a by-product of all the money printing\n\tIt's just that right now, a lot of that money printing is in the financial assets\n\tBut all this QE and negative interest rates are not going to get economic growth\n\tNow maybe the Eurozone economy will grow, but it's not because of QE, it's despite QE\n\tIn fact, there would be more growth, if the ECB wasn't doing this, what they are doing is counter productive\n\tBut ultimately they will succeed in getting more inflation, in fact they will get more than they bargained for\n\tI predict that prices in the Eurozone will not only hit the 2% target, it will exceed it, and that will mean the ECB is going to have to quickly withdraw that stimulus, they will have to raise rates much faster than they thought and much higher than they thought, but at least they'll do it\n\tWe can't. that's the big difference.\u00a0 Europe can afford higher rates, America cannot\n\tEurope is going to have the Bundesbank pressuring the ECB fight that inflation; there will be no such pressure on the Fed from the United States\n\tNormally, too, when the ECB eases, gold goes down and that was the knee-jerk reaction, as soon as the announcement came out, the price of gold dropped about $15, but it reversed very quickly and it ended up finishing up $19\n\tWe're talking about a $35 intra day reversal, in fact, the low was below $1240, but ever since the price of gold closed above $1250, it has never closed below $1250\n\tThis is the highest close of the year, it's the first time I've see gold close above $1270\n\tGold stocks closed at their highs of the year, the GDX index of gold miners was up 4.5% today closing at $20.38 - this is the first close above $20 all year\n\tThe key level for gold is going to be $1280\n\tWe've touched that level twice, once last week and once Monday morning", "duration": "25:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://media.blubrry.com/schiffradio/content.blubrry.com/schiffradio/Ep_150_Draghi_s_Bazooka_Backfires_Gold_Explodes.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 404963432, "seriesTitle": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "pubDate": 1457574303, "title": "Why Didn\u2019t the Fed \u201cJust Say No\u201d? \u2013  Ep. 149", "author": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "summary": "So far it's been a pretty light week but what little economic data that has been released is bad, and all of it evidences the recession that nobody wants to acknowledge\n\tLet's start with the Consumer Credit numbers that came out on Monday.\u00a0 Not only was the number extremely weak, but the revisions to the prior month were even weaker\n\tThe initial report for the growth in consumer credit in December was $21.3 billion\n\tNow I don't think growth in consumer credit is good;

Why?\n\tHow does the expectation of higher inflation help an economy?\n\tThe only thing that's good about inflation is if you're a debtor; if you borrowed money, inflation will help ease the pain of that debt\n\tYou would figure the last thing the Fed would want is for people to expect higher inflation, because what would happen to bond holders?\n\tBond holders would not want to hold bonds at low rates; they would demand higher interest on those bonds, which would crush the government because they don't have the money\n\tIt would also crush the Fed, because the Fed's balance sheet is loaded up with long-term government bonds that yield next to nothing\n\tWhat's going to happen to the value of those bonds if potential buyers believe inflation is going to be higher?\n\tBond prices will collapse and the Fed will take a huge hit\n\tIt makes no sense at all that anyone on the Fed would be worried that inflation expectations aren't high enough\n\tThey should be relieved that people aren't smart enough to expect higher inflation\n\tThat is going to be one of the best examples of, \"Be careful what you wish for\"\n\tAlso, Bullard acknowledged that 2015 GDP growth was disappointing - 1.8%\n\tAnd who knows, it might be less, as we're getting revisions to Q4 tomorrow\n\t\u00a0Bullard says that this year GDP will be a lot better, forecasting about 2-1/2% growth for 2016\n\tI would have love to have seen a follow up question: \"What makes you think that?

the gold index was up about 2-2-1/2% - it was down 4% earlier when gold was down but by the stock market opened gold wasn't down $8 anymore, it was down about $2 or $3, yet gold stocks were clobbered\n\tMaybe it's still the overhang from Goldman Sachs coming out yesterday and predicting that gold would fall below $1000/oz in 2016\n\tThat probably means that Goldman Sachs is short a bunch of gold and they want to cover, or they just need to buy and they're trying to convince the muppets who actually pay attention to what they say, to sell their gold to them\n\tJanet Yellen continued with the narrative that everything is O.K. - the economy is fine, the recovery is on track, yes, she acknowledged some headwinds: growth was a little bit slower at the end of last year, but no big deal\n\tThere are some problems overseas that they're monitoring , there are some financial tightening: overseas markets are weak, domestic markets are weak, yes the Fed is paying attention to all that\n\tBut so far, from their perspective, everything is on track, the recovery is moving along, the labor market is strong, despite the fact that there is no improvement in labor force participation, there's no improvement in the part-time workers who want full-time work, there's no real wage growth other than the bump from the minimum wage hike\n\tBut despite all that, Janet Yellen still maintains that everything looks good, that we will overcome these headwinds - this is her most likely scenario\n\tShe did acknowledge that monetary policy is not fixed, that the trajectory is not set in stone, that the Fed will monitor incoming data, and if the data evolves in a manner they don't expect, then yes, they might not raise interest rates as much as they believe they're going to raise them\n\tAs far as the Fed is concerned, based on the data they have now, their most likely scenario is that everything is fine, which means the market is going to keep falling\n\tIt's almost ironic that Yellen would say, \"The markets are weak, and if they stay weak then we might have to adjust our monetary policy\" - that means the markets are going to stay weak!\n\tThe only way to stop the markets from falling is for the markets to know that rates aren't going up\n\tI think it's more than just the absence of rate hikes: this market needs more QE\n\tThe Fed dialed back the dosage and the market requires it now, or it will start going down\n\tI was watching a great interview with Jim Grant today on CNBC and he was saying all the things I am saying: he says we're already in a recession; he's confident that it began at the end of last year and he thinks the Fed is going to go back to zero and do more QE, and that they might go negative\n\tJanet Yellen was asked about negative rates in her testimony, apparently the Fed had considered it back in 2010 and they rejected it and she was asked if negative interest rates are even legal\n\tYellen said to her knowledge there is nothing legally preventing the Fed from going to negative rates\n\tBut, of course, the fact that the Fed is considering it and talking about it means that they are going to do it\n\tIf they weren't going to do it,", "duration": "34:14", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://media.blubrry.com/schiffradio/content.blubrry.com/schiffradio/Ep_141_Yellen_Throws_Sinking_Market_an_Anchor.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 404963432, "seriesTitle": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "pubDate": 1455072905, "title": "Scott Nations Claims Peter Schiff Was Never Right \u2013 Ep. 140", "author": "The Peter Schiff Show Podcast", "summary": "It was another volatile day in the U.S. stock market, with the Dow swinging from positive to negative to positive to finally closing negative, but well off the lows and the highs of the day\n\tThe NASDAQ was only down about 15; the Dow down about 12 points\n\tThe real action was in the currency markets: the dollar got clobbered today, a new 4-month low in the euro, 2-year low in the yen, the Swiss franc was probably the strongest currency on the day\n\tThe dollar index actually traded in the 95 handle before recovering slightly back up above 967\n\tGold, several times flirted with $1200 again, couldn't quite make it there; the highest I saw it was $1198, it didn't touch $1200\n\tThe gold stocks got hammered - they were down about 4% today, I guess the fact that gold could not break through to $1200 caused people to sell gold stocks, even though there was very little selling in gold itself\n\tWhat I want to discuss on today's podcast is my appearance on CNBC's web program, \"Futures Now\"\n\tMy appearance was promoted on television, although this appearance was actually on CNBC.com\n\tThey like to have me on, because I am good for their ratings online\n\tThe YouTube video of my appearance is posted on my Facebook page\n\tGo back and look at my last several appearances on Futures Now with Scott Nations, who constantly wants to remind everybody how wrong I am about everything\n\tThey have to admit that I was right about several things\n\tWhen I was on their show the day after the rate hike and also several times before the rate hike\n\tI said I did not think the Fed could raise rates because it would push the economy into recession, cause a bear market in stocks - basically prick the bubble\n\tI did not think the Fed would be willing to put themselves in the difficult position of having to reverse the rate cut and lose credibility\n\tUp until December, I was right.\u00a0 But even I had started to admit that the Fed might do such a thing by the time they actually did it\n\tLook at what's happened.\u00a0 It's been a blood bath since they've raised rates\n\tLook at what's happening in the financials - they've lost half their value\n\tLook at gold: I said if the Fed raised rates, Gold would go up- it went up from $1050/oz. the day after they raised rates to $1200\n\tI said if the Fed raised rates, the dollar would go down and now it's at a 4-month low - Gold's at a 7-month high\n\tDollar going down, gold going up, stocks getting crushed that's exactly what I said\n\tYou'd think they would at least acknowledge that I got something right\n\tBut then, you'd be wrong\n\tHost Jackie DeAngelis' introduced me by saying, \"Peter Schiff claims he got everything right!\"\n\tThey are implying that they disagree that I was right about the consequences of the rate hike\n\tIn the article on the interview, they misquoted me by saying that I claimed to get everything right.\n\tI did refer back to my published quotes, which clearly state that I thought the market and the dollar would tank and gold would go up if the Fed actually raised rates.\n\tScott Nations said, \"I don't know if Peter Schiff got anything right\"\n\tAll the forecasts on \"Futures Now\" I made the day after the Fed raised rates were correct and Scott Nations got everything wrong\n\tThe very first thing the host said to me on my interview was that I was wrong, in that I said it was impossible for the Fed to raise rates\n\tI did not say that.\u00a0 I said it would be impossible for the Fed to raise rates without causing the stock market to go down, the dollar to go down and gold to go up.\u00a0 I thought the Fed would have been too smart to risk their credibility on such a move.\u00a0 I was wrong about the fact that the Fed was too smart to risk their own credibility by hastening recession\n\tSo they did raise rates, and everything that I said would happen has happened\n\tThat's what I got right.\n\tBy a week or two before the meeting, I had actually acknowledged that they probably would raise rates,", "duration": "34:34", "imageUrlLg": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/a3/d0/e2/a3d0e2cd-b219-f2cb-f2bf-50ca7c416432/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://media.blubrry.com/schiffradio/content.blubrry.com/schiffradio/Scott_Nations_Claims_Peter_Schiff_Was_Never_Right.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}]}
