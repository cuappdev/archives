In this episode we start by talking about their most recent fight, which is a somewhat typical fight about spending time together, but then we get into some of the VERY JUICY fights they have had over the years, including one hot mess of a fight in college when they weren\u2019t even together, and one doozy about a girl hitting on Chris at a wedding. Also Jade prefers ESPN and Chris prefers Bleacher Report. We also talk about Chris\u2019s time in the military, inappropriate Facebook behavior, and why, in this, the Golden Age of Television, Chris and Jade are so devoted to NBC\u2019s The Blacklist (I never really get a satisfactory answer).</span></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/honey_pod/~4/OkM7G5T7rVo\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "01:06:11", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/honey/ChrisSmithJadeTerrell_Export_6.27.16.mp3?dest-id=369214", "type": "episode", "tags": ["love", "fight", "wedding", "couple", "conversation", "therapy", "counseling", "argument", "yelling"]}, {"seriesId": 1100078871, "seriesTitle": "Honey", "pubDate": 1466458634, "title": "The Black Magic Incident (Jake & Dana)", "author": "WhatsaCreative", "summary": "<p>Jake & Dana work through it...</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/honey_pod/~4/9yx4grmykvo\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "51:43", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/honey/DanaBomarJakeSprague_Export_6.20.16.mp3?dest-id=369214", "type": "episode", "tags": ["fight", "couple", "conversation", "trouble", "counseling", "argument", "disagreement"]}, {"seriesId": 1100078871, "seriesTitle": "Honey", "pubDate": 1465821791, "title": "Two New England Leos (Kimberly & Mark)", "author": "WhatsaCreative", "summary": "<p>Kimberly and Mark work through it.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/honey_pod/~4/MlCrxpG4wIo\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "01:10:05", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/honey/KimberlyAboltinMarkRicketson_Export_6.13.16.mp3?dest-id=369214", "type": "episode", "tags": ["fight", "dating", "marriage", "advice", "couple", "discussion", "therapy", "astrology", "counseling", "argument"]}, {"seriesId": 1100078871, "seriesTitle": "Honey", "pubDate": 1465262592, "title": "Even Keel Kirk (January & Ryan)", "author": "WhatsaCreative", "summary": "<p>January and Ryan come on Honey to work through it...</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/honey_pod/~4/W6hBnMJ4G9Q\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "54:51", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/honey/RyanKirkJanuaryMalkus_Export_6.6.16.mp3?dest-id=369214", "type": "episode", "tags": ["travel", "fight", "communication", "relationship", "couple", "vacation", "discussion", "therapy", "counseling", "argument"]}, {"seriesId": 1100078871, "seriesTitle": "Honey", "pubDate": 1462799520, "title": "The Juice (Lyndsey & Nick)", "author": "WhatsaCreative", "summary": "<p>Lyndsey\u00a0Frank and\u00a0Nick\u00a0Rasmussen work through it...</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/honey_pod/~4/Rmtrq2zDFcY\" width=\"1\" />", "duration": "56:06", "imageUrlLg": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/00/fc/f3/00fcf380-e64d-8add-1abd-74878f7e37ef/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/honey/LyndseyFrankNickRasmussen_Export_5.9.16.mp3?dest-id=369214", "type": "episode", "tags": ["fight", "relationship", "sex", "couple", "porn", "therapy", "breakup", "nudity", "breasts", "counseling", "argument"]}, {"seriesId": 1100078871, "seriesTitle": "Honey", "pubDate": 1462201681, "title": "Confusion (Erica & Ben)", "author": "WhatsaCreative", "summary": "<p>Erica Bardin and Ben Wickham stop by the show today -
