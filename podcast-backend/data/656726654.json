You come up with an idea, get to work on it and at some point down the line you get a sense that a different topic (or *part* of your topic) would be better to focus on. \n\nIn this episode we talk you through what you need to know to do a *great* job on a transition like this. \n\n- What do you need to know about the new topic before switching? \n- What questions should you ask yourself? \n- How do you know when to trust your intuition or not? \n- How can you switch without pissing off your existing audience? \n- Have you planned enough about the new topic so it\u2019s more likely to be successful? \n- **Plus some smooth jazz flute stuff\u2026 seriously, I\u2019m way into it. **\n\nAll of that in a totally unedited podcast episode (well, we do bleep the swear words) so you get *everything*; you won\u2019t miss out on a thing. \n\nThis topic is just a great recalibration of business ideas in general. I think you\u2019re gonna like it.

It's in Seattle, and on a recent trip I got to spend a little time with Mark Canlis, who runs the restaurant with his brother Brian.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nListen, here's the thing; the way this family thinks about their business, their perspective after 60+ years of serving people at an *insane* level of quality, has shaken stuff up for me.\n\u00a0\nThe way they tell their stories, the things they choose to invest time and money into, their \"reasons why,\" have changed the way I look at my own story, my own investments, my own reasons. These changes are adding up to a much bigger, human, vital vision of what my business is.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo I recorded a short conversation with Mark about how his family looks at their business and couched that in this episode of the show with some commentary from us here at Fizzle.
