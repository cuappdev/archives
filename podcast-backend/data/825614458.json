Here are the 3 mistakes people make with investing.  </p>\n\n<p>1.Investing too early.  Do you think about investing when you have no money?  Of course not.  People ask Grant all the time what they should invest in with the 10K they got. If all you have is 10K you are still broke and have no business investing.  The best investment Grant made in his life is not investing.  He waited until he had a more significant amount to put his chips down on the table.</p>\n\n<p>2. You start too small.  What are you going to do do, invest a nickel?  $5 goes up 100 times it\u2019s still just $500 bucks.  The think is too small.  The only reason to invest is to get rich, to have prosperity.  Don\u2019t do little tiny amounts.  They won\u2019t make a difference.  Don\u2019t invest to grow, invest for freedom.  Wait until you have a significant amount to invest.  Grant was 33 years old when he had over a million dollars in the bank before he made his first real estate investment.  </p>\n\n<p>3.Diversify: Rich people put all the eggs in one basket.  They protect that basket.  Don\u2019t put a lot of different eggs in a number of different baskets.  Rich people make 1 big deal.  Wall street sells diversification.  People don\u2019t know what they are investing in.  Accumulate cash so you can put it in one big deal.  People keep gambling with little pieces and get torched.  You have to reduce your risk by doing your homework.  You should not give money to people you don\u2019t know.  You put $100 into a mutual fund and you don\u2019t even know where it\u2019s going.  </p>\n\n\n<p>Investing is a vital part to earning your freedom.  Chances are you won\u2019t inherit wealth.  </p>\n\n<p>A good investment is something you put your money in and it explodes. The bank tells you to put your money in a bank and it will grow.  No it won\u2019t.  It will sit there.  But you need to let your money sit there until you earn enough to save a significant amount.  </p>\n\n<p>If you have 100K to your name you don\u2019t want to spend all that in one deal.  You still need to have something left, you want to sleep at night.  Get your income up and keep parking the money until you have enough to make a big play and still have some left over.  I spent 350K on my first deal when I had over 1 million saved.</p>", "duration": "49:24", "imageUrlLg": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/02/c3/4f02c399-2cb1-1e97-1606-2c8d6ff55c3d/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/4f/02/c3/4f02c399-2cb1-1e97-1606-2c8d6ff55c3d/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": "http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/podcasts.grantcardone.com/cardonezone/CZ_209_Investing_101_2016.03.25.mp3", "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 825614458, "seriesTitle": "Cardone Zone", "pubDate": 1458316834, "title": "208: What To Do When You Screw Up", "author": "Grant Cardone", "summary": "<p>Every week Grant Cardone comes at you on the Cardone Zone to talk about career, business, and finance.

He explains that the old way of doing things isn\u2019t viable and gives the example of traditional media. He explains the traditional networks ABC, NBC, CBS are losing viewers. More and more people want to control where and when they get their information. This is why Hulu and Netflix have gained such popularity and on-demand style viewing inspired Grant to launch WitNation.com a digital network for 24/7 access to business programming. \n\nGrant goes on to say that the middle class was based upon an era where there was expansion and industrialization in America. The middle class idea worked for a certain population of people at a specific time in history. Things have since changed and people refuse to adjust how they work and earn. They are applying old work styles such as a 40 hour workweek to a completely different marketplace. This is why they are failing. The new economy calls for people to strive for freedom and it\u2019s not achieved without work!\n\nGrant\u2019s advice is to look at your primary employment and see if there are opportunities there to earn more income.

He sites an article \u201cThe Middle Class is Steadily Eroding\u201d which includes a Price Waterhouse Coopers study and examples of retail stores who are failing because they target middle and lower income customers as opposed to the higher end retailers who offer exceptional service to a higher end clientele with money to spend. Grant equates the mythology of the middle class to that of Hercules and urges people to watch what the wealthier people do and mimic it. According to Grant people must think about where the money is and follow it. There is a reason $3500 washer and dryers are selling yet $500 ones remain in the stores. People with money have money to spend. Grant offers these key tips: \n\n1.      You need profit margins. \n2.      Do not strive to be the cheapest and lowest.\n3.      Provide great service to a high-end clientele. \n\nGrant takes callers and discusses how middle class values keep people stuck.

Average person works 34 hours a week.\nThe rich began to work longer hours than the poor since economic collapse. \nGrant\u2019s opinion is that the rich are paranoid, do not want to be poor and work to prosper and dominate in their space. They look at downtime (vacation, days off) as a danger to their business and goal of true freedom. \nFigures from the American Time Use Survey, show that Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree or above work two hours more each day than those without a high-school diploma. \nWHY?

Fewer than 1/4 Americans have enough money in their savings account to cover at least six months of expenses, enough to help cushion the blow of a job loss, medical emergency or some other unexpected event, according to the survey of 1,000 adults. 50% of those surveyed have less than a three-month cushion and 27% had no savings at all. \n\nThese numbers are scary which is why people must be looking for more sales instead of missing sales. If you\u2019re tired of missing sales this is the episode to tune into. Grant explains that:\nAnyone can learn to sell and anyone can sell more.\nThe economy is improving \u2013 the opportunity is out there.\nYou are missing deals and opportunities.\nYou need more money\nExcuses wont make you money nor pay the bills.\nSales is the only way to grow your business and finances.\nMost companies have terrible conversion rates.\n\nGrant points out that successful companies and people do two interesting things:\n        1) figure out what their competition won\u2019t do \n        2) look at what they can control\n\nHe pinpoints top mistakes of sales organizations:\n1) Fundamentals are missing  \n2) Mistake - Sales Approach hasn\u2019t kept up with Technology \n3) Mistake - People are not properly motivated.\n\nFor solutions for all of these missed opportunities and a free download featuring Grant himself offering tips to help you visit: http://tiredofmissingsales.com/\n\nImportant Links & Resources For More Information\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GrantCardone\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cardonesuccess\nMain Website: http://www.grantcardone.com\nSign up for your free weekly strategy from Grant: www.grantcardone.com/cardone-success/\nInterested in having Grant speak at your organization?

Grant questions this aversion to work and reminds viewers that the middle class plan that includes, do well in school, go to college, find a stable job, get married, buy a home, raise kids is not enough to withstand shifts and changes in a volatile economy. Grant Cardone offers hard success lessons inspired by an article in Business Insider and adds additional points. These hard lessons include: \n\n1.      Success Requires Work\n2.      Life is not fair and neither is business. Grant explains life is good for a bunch, terrible for too many and great for just a small handful.\n3.      The universe doesn\u2019t care if you succeed or fail. \n4.      The biggest obstacle to success is you. Stop blaming economy, bad breaks, divorce, race, ethnicity, or some conspiracy. It\u2019s you!\n5.      You're not owed anything, entitled to anything, or deserve anything. Bad things happen to good people. Your good deeds and good intentions will not always be returned. You will be disappointed. You will be let down. You will be betrayed.\n6.      Luck plays a huge role in success. Catching a big break that leads to landing your dream job, for example, often depends on being in the right place at the right time. The harder you work \u2013 the more you show up the luckier you will be!\n7.      Everything you've worked for can disappear in an instant.\n8.      You need money and much more than you estimate.\n9.      Learn to sell not matter how much you hate it.\n10.     You will always work for someone. \n \nImportant Links & Resources For More Information\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GrantCardone\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cardonesuccess\nMain Website: http://www.grantcardone.com\nSign up for your free weekly strategy from Grant: http://www.grantcardone.com/cardone-success/\nInterested in having Grant speak at your organization?

They think their business will certainly succeed.\"\nA realist will have a harder shot at success in the world, Kahneman says, since people tend to favor optimists. They rise quicker in organizations because they believe they can. They attract more funding for their enterprises by selling their vision. People will work harder for the optimistic leader because they want to be assured that it'll all be OK. Studies of meetings show that people don't listen to the most informed person in the room; they default to the loudest one. \nThat's why we say that these people have a \"can-do spirit,\" Kahneman says. \"Among other things, a 'can-do spirit' means you think you can do things you cannot do.\" \nAnd sometimes, it's this semi-delusional thinking and a little luck that makes the seemingly impossible possible.\n\nHow do you get Confidence.....

Grant begins the show siting a commencement speech given by Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen to NYU graduates urging them to pursue endeavors that fuel their passion and call for grit and perseverance. Grant believes fighting the giants is what builds swag and the hustle muscle necessary to thrive, succeed and overcome obstacles in business and life. Grant refers to the popular movie \u201cFrozen\u201d whose core message of \u201clet go\u201d isn\u2019t one to apply to business. Instead, Grant advises to dig deep, decide never to quit, have more grit than anyone else in the game, and outwork everyone. He sites Steve Jobs as someone who never gave up, was committed to his vision and persevered when others doubted him. Grant offers advice to callers on creating more time, establishing a solid purpose and even gets a call from a fan follower who announced he has given up marijuana and adopted Grant\u2019s MORE formula discussed in a prior show. If you ever needed to dig deep to rise above any challenge, this episode of The Cardone Zone is a must watch. \n\nConnect with Grant:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GrantCardone \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cardonesuccess\nMain Website: http://www.grantcardone.com \nSign up for your free weekly strategy from Grant: http://www.grantcardone.com/cardone-success/ \nInterested in having Grant speak at your organization?

According to Grant Cardone, social media has been a great gift for his business. Businesses are too caught up in ROI because they don't fully understand the functions of social media. Cardone actually posts on his platforms himself and advises businesses that they should 'attack the marketplace' and make yourself, your business and services known to the masses. Social media is a great tool to accomplish this purpose. Grant offers tips and makes it clear the purpose of social media is to make money and gaining attention and keeping it is the key. Cardone gets most of his business via YouTube and his activity on Twitter and Facebook. Each platform requires a different method and businesses MUST understand and use them all. Grant also takes viewer calls which in this episode makes for very interesting interactions that are spontaneous and irreverent. \n\n\nImportant Links & Resources For More Information\n\nSign up for your free weekly strategy from Grant: http://www.grantcardone.com/cardone-s...\n\nInterested in having Grant speak at your organization?
