But to tide you over until then, we have a brand new audio drama podcast coming out in just two weeks. It\u2019s called The Deep Vault, and it\u2019s a sci-fi adventure story featuring robots, gunslingers, the apocalypse and more. You can subscribe to it RIGHT NOW by searching for it on iTunes, or wherever you download podcasts. \n\nTo learn more about it, follow us on Twitter @thedeepvault, visit our website deepvaultpodcast.com, or check out our The Deep Vault Facebook page. The teaser is up now, so take a listen.\n\nAnd if you feel so inclined, give The Deep Vault a review on iTunes. It really helps.\n\nUntil Season 2.
