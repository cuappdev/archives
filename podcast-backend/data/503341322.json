Fast forward to today and the show starts of boasting \"World's Greatest Design Podcast\", but don't worry soon there after the conversation shifts to being the best at podcasting is close to being useless (even while celebrating great success the boys can still keep it humble). Switching over to their famous random chit chat the guys all marvel at how manly Billy is for building a staircase on the back of his house, Mark talks about accidentally stumbling into a Sea Festival, talking to podcast listeners in the wild, what they each look for in picking a guests for the show and of course they guys all rally around the future fun of their August appearance in Cleveland for Weapons of Mass Creation.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Illustrator Tom Whalen stops by the show to let everyone know that his career is just as fun as it seems on French paper.

This is great news for all the Team James Flames people out there in podcast land. Not only do the boys introduce a new full time me member to the show but they also introduce a new design game that will certainly sweep the design community by storm Hire, Retire & Fire. Watch your ass could you easily be the next person to get fired by the maniacs at Adventures in Design. Speaking of getting hired, the guys talk about their upcoming live shows at Gallery F in Chicago this July and their headlining appearance in August at Weapons of Mass Creation Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. You can hear the excitement building as the AID summer tour season is quickly approaching, make sure you check out one of this summer's LIVE show recordings or invite the podcast to come out to your city for a design experience like none other on planet earth. If you really want a unique listener experience you can always go out to eat with Mark, in episode 24 Billy and James talk about some of their favorite times out on the road breaking bread and coeds with Mark. However, sharing a dinner out on the town isn't the only way to enjoy some time with Mr. Brickey, you can always instead just ask him to spell words for you, which can be hours on entertainment. Lastly, what wouldn't an episode of the show be without some good ol fashioned complaining about shitty Kickstarter campaigns.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Next up Dan Ibarra, from Aesthetic Apparatus, makes his third appearance on the show to introduce the Circle of Trust to Schoolha.us the new group-mentorship program by AA. Dan quickly informs everyone to the new way of thinking going on over at camp AA and Dan also defines that 3 or more people are needed to have a crew. Explaining what they feel is wrong with the current design education process Dan gives a glimpse into the different methods of learning and team building that they hope to create with Schoolha.us. Having a goal and wanting to learn is the key dynamic to being a successful part of the Schoolha.us program, simply put you learn what you want to learn and when you feel you're done, you're done\u2026 No more \"force feeding\" style of studio education. Learn more by visiting their new website here: http://schoolha.us As with all things Adventures In Design, eventually the guys debate on the long term effects that Schoolha.us may have on Aesthetic Apparatus. So even if you're a well seasoned pro, you can hopefully relate to the delicate balance of being selfless/selfish with your career, doing what you love and what you have to do, to make a honest living.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Keeping with the educational theme of Schoolha.us during Shop Talk the crew all discuss what they do and don't want to see in student portfolios and their expectations in conversation during the interview process. Moving over to their own work, more specifically showing new work to clients, the guys all discuss managing early client expectations and trying to not let folks leap to ridiculous conclusions on early rounds of work. Also, a lengthy discussion occurs when Mark shares his frustration with clients simply changing their minds and really the scope of projects in the middle of a ongoing job and how this can really effect the designer's bottom line if they don't take up for themselves. Comparing clients to 3 year olds, double taking your way out of jam and standing up for good design are just a few of the bullet points in possibly the longest ever AID discussion on dealing with those that hire you to do what you do\u2026 and to hopefully do it well.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Every now and again the show even talks about the art of design\u2026 Billy initiates a very interesting conversation on a recent Man of Steel poster curated by Mondo.

They also talk about the victory in launching their new show website AIDpodcast.com and how getting that project off of the ground has been a blessing. While discussing Mark's upcoming cross country road trip Billy comes up with the genius idea that they should gather design questions for Mark to ask of strangers along the way from New York\u00a0 to California. After a heated discussion of standardized goalie masks in the NHL the boys need to cool their jets and take a music break before getting a James Flames hosted shop talk going. In the midst of the audio break, due to not currently having a phone line, Mark shares a classic telemarketer call where a accidental wrong number leads to one memorable email address. The call was made in 2003 long before Adventures In Design had hit the airwaves or Hero had ever even printed their first poster.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">James Flames joins the show for his fourth show appearance and third time sitting in on Shop Talk. Out of the gate Mark complains about how shitty CG cartoons are these days, Billy offers some contemporary children's cartoons worthy of checking out and then the whole gang reminisces on watching TV after school back in the day. The gang also tries to figure out the exact label for what it is they all do for a living, which for the fist time in show history, leaves everyone speechless. Even though no one seems to know the exact label the guys share a discussion on how almost everyone's New Year's Design Resolutions where hitting the same themes, the boys debate whether one can ever truly have a proper life balance while owning their own business. Mark and Billy confess their South By Southwest secrets to James and he's not happy with what he hears.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In a interactive media loop, the podcast comments on recent blog drama that has taken place on their website AIDpodcast.com where Calm The Ham and couple of internet tumbleweeds get called out in the discussion. Joking about their new self proclaimed stance as the \"TMZ\" or \"60 Minutes\" of the poster world, the discussion goes deep into exploring why some people may choose to be \"inspired by\" and why others just get greedy, and can't seem to exist in the gray areas of the law. In a weird twist of commentary Mark and Billy debate what their level of customer service should be to those that stop by the website or listen to the show. Then in a moment of loosing his mind Mark decides that designers should start sticking together in the same way that cops do!

While most men with handlebar mustaches look like they should be engaged in almost constant conversation about kazoos, I must side with Mark on this one (Mark was in my wedding and one of three handlebar mustachioed men including myself). Next up is a rousing edition of \u201cMark fucks with Telemarketers\u201d in where a very willing salesman seems way too aroused at the prospect of being drawn by an \u201cartist\u201d over the phone. On to my favorite part of the show <em>Shop Talk</em>, this is where bullshit artists like me get the real scoop on what\u2019s goes on in the world of graphic design. Joining the guys this week is none other than the inimitable Dan Ibarra of Aesthetic Apparatus. Fresh off a new Typeface release and knee deep in the middle of creating a line of gift-able items called \u201cHaute Crap\u201d, Dan helps weigh in on a few key issues. The guys answer some listener questions about the economy of using a 3</span><span style=\"font-size: 8px; letter-spacing: 0px;\"><sup>rd</sup></span><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.0px;\"> party printer from the standpoint of the struggling designer, and Dan makes some great points about the value of the passion that is required in order to have a successful business----that and making sure you don\u2019t squander all your profits on cocaine. Things start to heat up when Billy reveals just how much he judges other poster artist\u2019s ability\u2026errrr\u2026umm, inability to properly screen-print, causing what is sure to be an instant loss in newbie poster artist listenership. Bringing the topic back into the realm of Simplify vs. Detailed, the guys compare the work of two prominent poster artists, Jason Munn and Aaron Horkey. Through this debate, we are reminded of the benefits of both schools of design thought to the point where both artists\u2019 work can be equally appreciated. Finally, the guys discuss the economy and the ethics of submitting your work to a Gallery show, is it worth your time and effort as an artist?

In the chitter chatter of non design related topics you'll hear about rescuing dogs and the first ever guy's only segment featuring \"Uncle Brickey's Recipe For Perfect Summer Balls\". This time around the Circle of Trust goes north of the border to Montreal, Quebec to interview Raymond Biesinger a international man of editorial illustration. Raymond, a regular listener of the show, fits in well as the third wheel and openly talks about how he got into making editorial illustration his main design discipline and at times being the in the sweet spot of turning down 2-3 jobs for every one job that he agrees to. Raymond also shines a little light on to getting clients to \"Auction for your time\" and about how important it is for him to make sure that his client projects provide enough finical security so that he can afford to get involved in his own passion projects that normally have little to no money attached to them. A great honest and modest interview that intelligently explains the difference between illustration and design careers, his love of history and 101 things you probably didn't know about Canada. During the world famous \"shop talk\" segment, the show covers the topics of how the creative process works for Mark & Billy individually, advice on when to price a project and how to react to unsettling feedback from your clients. Plus, where to sell your prints online, thoughts on the poster collector website Expresso Beans, advice on picking a good art festival, all of these topics and many more are waiting for you on this episode of Adventures In Design.</p>\n<div>\u00a0</div>", "duration": "", "imageUrlLg": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/13/7c/e3/137ce3c4-99a4-f9ee-5e5c-23a82c8e9705/source/600x600bb.jpg", "imageUrlSm": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/13/7c/e3/137ce3c4-99a4-f9ee-5e5c-23a82c8e9705/source/60x60bb.jpg", "audioUrl": null, "type": "episode", "tags": []}, {"seriesId": 503341322, "seriesTitle": "Adventures In Design", "pubDate": 1340198822, "title": "Episode 10 \"This Currency Doesn't Add Up\"", "author": "", "summary": "<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Georgia;\">A I D E-XTREME!
