    We are not only passionate about making, but also engaging the community to participate in what we do. Every semester, we run 10-week training programs for Cornell students interested in learning about iOS development, product design, and backend development. Many of our past students have gone on to become impactful designers and developers on our core team and in the industry.</br>
