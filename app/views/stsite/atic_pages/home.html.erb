	<p class="text-black text-paragraph">
		Cornell App Development is a project team at Cornell University dedicated to mobile app development.  Every year, we take an app from idea to product, culminating with a release on the App Store. We give students the opportunity to work in a startup environment and gain practical experience in software development, design, and product management.  Our team is made up of talented designers, developers, and visionaries who collaborate to bring projects to life.</br>

		Not everyone involved with our team is a coding expert.  Every semester we run a 10 week developer in 
		training program for Cornell Students interested in learning about iOS development.  Over 300 students 
		applied last year and less than 10% of them had prior experience developing for the platform.  </br>
