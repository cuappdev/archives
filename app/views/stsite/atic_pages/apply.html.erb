    <strong>Intro to iOS App Development</strong></br>
    Intro to iOS App Development Course is a training program for anyone interested in making native iPhone applications. No prior iOS experience is required. We will start with the basics of Xcode and how to make a simple app, and work our way towards more advanced techniques as the course progresses. In previous semesters, we examined features from popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Tinder. By the end of the course, you should have all the experience necessary to create your own app and distribute it on the iOS App Store. Pre-requisites: Be currently enrolled, or have previously taken an intro to computer science course (CS 1110 or equivalent). You will need to have access to a MacBook or a PC running MacOS to participate in the course.
