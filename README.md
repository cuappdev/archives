# Cornell Big Red Shuttle

The Big Red Shuttle is Cornell's first free, student-run, late-night transportation service for students in need of a safe ride home. It strives to promote a safer campus climate to prevent alcohol-related incidents and sexual assault. The Big Red Shuttle runs a 20-minute route every Friday and Saturday from 12am-3am with a professional paid driver and two managers trained by Cayuga's Watchers. This app complements the BRS service by allowing students to view the shuttle route and time schedule so that they can find the quickest and safest way back home.
