# Cornell Big Red Shuttle

The Big Red Shuttle is Cornell's first free, student-run, late-night transportation service for students in need of a safe ride home. The Big Red Shuttle runs a 20-minute route every Friday and Saturday from 12am-3am with a professional paid driver and two managers trained by Cayuga's Watchers. In the app, users can check out the shuttle schedule and map of the route and enter in their destination to find the quickest route home. To learn more, visit http://www.cornellbigredshuttle.com/.
