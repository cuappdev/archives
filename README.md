# archives

Archives of our retired projects, with history intact.

## History

As Cornell AppDev has grown, we've taken on a significant number of projects, and we encourage our
members to contribute to our organization and contribute to open-source. As we continue growing,
we would like to keep our GitHub page an accurate description of the projects we are currently
working on.

This repository was created using the `setup_archives.sh` script, and was slightly modified from
a script found online to fit our specific use case.
