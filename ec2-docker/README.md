# EC2 Docker - Deployment Tool

This is a tool for testing and deploying our backends to production environments. This is a Vagrant machine that installs Ansible and uses it to deploy a Docker Compose onto an EC2 Instance.

## Credits

We use the following Ansible roles from fellow open source developers.
