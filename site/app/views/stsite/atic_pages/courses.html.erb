    What are our courses?
  </div>
  <p>
    Every semester, we run 10-week courses for Cornell students interested in learning more about the design and development of mobile / web apps. Each course is taught by our core team members and can be taken for 2 S/U credits. Requirements include attending a 1-hour lecture once a week and completing a weekly project, culminating in a final project at the end of the semester. We currently offer three courses: iOS development, product design, and backend development.

  </div>
  <p>
    Students from any college or major are encouraged to apply.  You <strong>do not</strong> need to be an engineer, CS major, or design major to succeed in our courses or join our team. Our courses are geared towards beginners in the areas of mobile app development, backend development, and product design. We'll start with the basics and follow a logical progression to more advanced concepts. By the end of the course, you will know enough to be a Junior iOS Developer, Backend Developer, or Designer on our core team.

    Requirements
  </div>
  <p>
    <strong>For Developers</strong></br>
    From Week One, the course will assume no prior knowledge of iOS / backend development or even computer science.  However, in the interest of time, we will not be spending much time on low-level programming concepts. For this reason, we insist that applicants have previously taken or are concurrently taking CS 1110 (or have equivalent familiarity with basic computer science fundamentals).
  </br>
  </br>
    <strong>For Designers</strong></br>
    No hard requirements exist for our design course. Anyone interest in UI / UX design, user testing, etc. is encouraged to apply! However, applicants will need to complete a pre-test to demonstrate interest in the course.

    FAQ
  </div>
  <p>
    <strong>How long and frequent are lectures?</strong>
    </br>
      Lectures will be 1 hour in length and will be held once per week. Additionally, a homework project will be assigned weekly and will be due the night before the following week's session.
    </br></br>
    <strong>Can I take this course for credit? What if I want to audit?</strong>
    </br>
      Accepted students will receive 2 S/U course credits for completing the program. You may also audit the course but in the interest of our time, we will not be grading projects completed by students auditing the course.
    </br></br>
    <strong>Do I have to be a certain year or in a certain school to apply?</strong>
    </br>
    There is no major or year requirement to apply. Students enrolled in any school are welcome.
    </br></br>
    <strong>Can I take more than one course in the same semester?</strong>
    </br>
    Yes, if your schedule permits, you can enroll in more than one course. Many past students have successfully completed both the developer and design courses in the same semester. However, please be mindful that the courses will be what you make out of it, so make sure you have the time to handle the workload for both courses!
